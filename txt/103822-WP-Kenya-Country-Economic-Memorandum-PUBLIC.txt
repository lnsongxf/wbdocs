It is my pleasure to present the Kenya Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) titled: “From Economic
 Growth to Jobs and Shared Prosperity”. The CEM is a strategic World Bank product that analyzes
key aspects of the country’s economic development with the main aim of providing an integrated and
long term perspective of the country’s development priorities. This particular edition of the CEM has
benefitted from extensive review from various stakeholders, including the government, academia and
the private sector.

The Kenya CEM has five main messages. First, Kenya has performed well in the past decade in terms
of economic growth, and modern services are behind the acceleration of growth. Expansion in these
services, such as financial intermediation and mobile communications have stimulated demand for
other services such as trade. The CEM discusses how to maximize the potential of services, especially
given that most formal, high quality jobs are created in this sector.

Second, agriculture, which still contributes to over a quarter of the economy, and manufacturing
have stagnated. The CEM discusses the reasons behind this stagnation, noting that agriculture and
manufacturing have not been able to create enough jobs for Kenya’s growing working age population.
Most of the jobs are created by the informal economy and are concentrated in low productivity segments
of trade, hospitality, and jua kali. Improving the ease of doing business is one way towards job creation
and higher productivity. However there is still a need for creating job opportunities for the rural poor,
for poverty reduction and achieving shared prosperity. Reviving agriculture, in particular, remains the
pathway for poverty reduction.

Third, accelerating growth to meet Kenya’s development goals requires technological advances and
innovation that raise firms’ productivity. Although the likelihood of Kenyan firms to innovate is high
compared with firms in several other countries, the CEM finds that there is room to increase innovation.
Only a few Kenyan firms have come up with products that are actually new to the domestic market.
Moreover, the share of firms spending on research and development (R&D) remains low. And Kenya
can leverage its stock of managerial capacity to increase innovation. At the same time, attracting foreign
firms can stimulate productivity enhancement as technologies spill over to domestic firms.

Fourth, achieving rapid growth will require macroeconomic stability to boost investment and savings.
And as the government strives to build Kenya’s energy and transport infrastructure, this needs to be
complemented with improvements in the public investment management process and better execution.
Fifth, the discovery of oil opens a possibility for raising Kenya’s growth. Kenya’s recent oil discoveries,
if used prudently, can contribute to achieving the Vision 2030 goals. Resource extraction can make a
direct contribution to economic output and the main transmission channel will be fiscal. So appropriate
management of resource revenues can generate resources that could be used to raise public investment,
human capital, and productivity in the non-resource sectors of the economy.

The World Bank Group is proud of its long-standing relationship with Kenya, and looks forward
to continuous collaboration with both National and County Governments and other partners.
Working together, Kenya can realize its potential to lift millions of families out of poverty and
achieve shared prosperity.

         EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

     Case Stories

     Laetitia Mukungu from Bukura in western Kenya was one of the best students in her primary
     school, but her dream to continue schooling was shattered by lack of finances after her mom lost
     her job. Driven by her passion for agriculture, Laetitia discovered a way to earn money to cover
     her schooling expenses. She spent hours researching on the Internet and came up with the idea of
     raising rabbits. Kenya’s urban centers, in particular high-end hotels and restaurants, demanded
     more rabbit meat than the market could supply. So Laetitia convinced the local school to lend her
     K Sh 50,000, which she used to purchase several New Zealand rabbits, and employed 15 women to
     work in her rabbit center. Today, the business continues to be profitable and provides livelihoods
     for the women working in the rabbit center. Through her online research and practice, Laetitia
     discovered the rabbit hatch is a rich source of organic fertilizer and pesticide. Hence, the women in
     the center started planting maize and sukuma wiki, which supplemented their income. Finally, the
     business enabled Laetitia to realize her dream of a better education: in 2012 she was accepted at
     a renowned secondary school, the African Leadership Academy in South Africa.

     October 2014 was not a good month for the several hundred workers at the Eveready East Africa
     and Mondelez (formerly Cadbury) production plants; the owners of the two plants had decided to
     move production outside Kenya. The reason for the closure of both plants was the same: it would
     be cheaper to produce the products, dry-cell batteries in the case of Eveready and confectionary
     (chocolate) products for Cadbury, elsewhere—interestingly, to the Arab Republic of Egypt in both
     instances—and import them to Kenya. While closing production, both companies noted that
     Kenya is a growing market for their products and they plan to expand sales. In addition, Eveready
     announced that it would invest in real estate development on the 20 acres of land where the plant
     is located in Nakuru, and Mondelez said that Kenya would serve as its business hub for East Africa.

     January 2015 brought a cheer among Nairobi’s residents as the fast-growing taxi company Uber
     became available on their smartphones. Following its establishment in South Africa and Nigeria,
     Uber decided on Nairobi, which it sees as “the Green City in the Sun and East Africa’s economic
     powerhouse.”1 Modern service companies such as Uber need three things to thrive: middle-class city
     dwellers (urban population) with credit cards (access to financial services) and smartphones (high
     penetration of mobile Internet). Nairobi clearly has all three. Indeed, other leading multinational
     companies, such as IBM, Intel, and Google, have moved to Nairobi and are using it as their base
     for operations in Africa.

FROM ECONOMIC GROW TH TO JOBS AND SHARED PROSPERIT Y                                                         v
       These three examples pretty much capture the most important messages that the rest of this report
       conveys from a macro perspective. Laetitia exemplifies the potential of Kenya’s large and growing
       youth: entrepreneurial spirit, access to the Internet (even in a remote village), and expanding
       primary education. Businesses such as the rabbit center diversify the economy; moving from raising
       rabbits to producing fertilizer and pesticides is what economists call expansion of production
       capabilities (or “economic complexity”). At the same time, Laetitia portrays the struggles young
       people face: how to finance post-primary education, how to get access to finance, as well as the
       fact that most young entrepreneurs and workers typically go into services or production of goods
       that are protected from outside competition, that is, in the non-tradable sector.

       The second example illustrates how difficult life is for those who have to compete with the rest of
       the world. Eveready and Cadbury are the most recent examples on a long list of manufacturing
       firms that have closed production in Kenya and moved elsewhere, while Egypt’s list of newly
       opened manufacturing plants, in particular in the food industry, is rapidly growing. Kenya's
       growing economy has been consumption driven, so opportunities to meet the demand for goods
       and services for the rising middle class are plenty. However, importing those goods and services
       is more profitable than producing them domestically, given Kenya’s high cost of labor and utilities
       (electricity, land, and transport).

       The third example touches on a successful part of Kenya’s economy—rapid development and
       penetration of mordern services, such as mobile technologies and finance. These sectors of
       the economy, together with land development and commercial services, have been booming,
       particularly in Nairobi, which is the regional hub for most services and industrial firms. However,
       nine in 10 Kenyans do not live in Nairobi and do not work in the modern services sector. Having a
       small part of the economy pulling up the rest will not be enough to meet Kenyans’ development
       expectations. Some may think that the recent oil discoveries will fill the gap, but oil should not be
       taken for granted; the discoveries to date are neither groundbreaking nor guaranteed to become
       a “blessing” for the majority of Kenyans.

     Tunisia today is just above the upper-middle-income threshold. Looking at Tunisia’s economic and social
     indicators, Kenyans have a lot to look forward to. First, Tunisians live on average 14 years longer than
     Kenyans. Practically no Tunisian lives in extreme poverty, and all Tunisians have access to electricity. Finally,
     Tunisians are better educated and two-thirds live in urban areas, compared with less than one-third of Kenya’s

          Box 1.1: Corruption and access to water

          Corruption is estimated to raise the price of connecting a household to a water network in low- and middle-
          income countries by as much as 30 to 45 percent. Poor people living in slums not connected to the water
          grid frequently pay far more for water than connected customers do. Globally it is estimated that 20 to 70
          percent of lost resources in the water sector could be saved if transparency was widespread and corruption
          was eliminated. In Kenya, corruption in the water sector is characterized by bribery, unaccounted for water
          fees, and procurement processes that are not transparent. According to survey work by TI Kenya, 87 percent
          of respondents in Nairobi had witnessed the payment of bribes to connect to the city’s water network. With
          wide-scale corruption in the water sector, achieving the global Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target
          of improved access to water could cost an estimated US$48 billion more than planned. Further, the survey
          results based on data for 51 countries reveal that a population’s access to safe drinking water is negatively
          correlated with the level of bribery practiced in the country irrespective of the level of national per capita
          income and the money invested by the government in public infrastructure for water and other services.

          Overall, the study revealed that increased transparency, accountability, and integrity could lead to better
          education and health outcomes and increased access to water, which are important MDGs.

FROM ECONOMIC GROW TH TO JOBS AND SHARED PROSPERIT Y                                                                       31
          Box 2.1: From growth to shared prosperity—The different paths of Rwanda and Nigeria

          Poverty rates have been falling across Africa since the beginning of the 2000s. As gross domestic product
          (GDP) growth accelerated to around 5 percent per year, the percentage of people living on less than US$1.25
          per day in Sub-Saharan Africa declined at an average rate of 0.8 percent per year. However, beneath the
          regional averages, there is considerable variation in the elasticity of poverty to growth. Rwanda and Nigeria
          illustrate this point.

          Rwanda is one of Africa’s economic success stories of the 2000s. GDP grew at an average of 8.2 percent per
          year between 2005 and 2010, and GDP per capita grew at 5.2 percent. This translated into growth of mean
          consumption per person among the rural poor of 2.1 percent per year, which brought poverty down from 62 to
          48 percent.a Rwanda’s growth story was pro-poor in the absolute sense and the relative sense, as consumption
          growth of the poor rose faster than consumption of the non-poor (0.4 percent). The key to Rwanda’s success was
          increasing agricultural production, which doubled at the household level, as did the share of households selling
          surplus harvests on the market. Behind this success was a cohesive agricultural strategy focused on increasing
          investments in agricultural inputs, land consolidation, and infrastructure. If Kenya had the consumption trends
          in rural Rwanda, Kenya’s rural poverty rate would have declined to 38 percent.

          Like in Rwanda, Nigeria’s growth has been robust, but poverty reduction much less so. Annual non-oil GDP
          growth rates have averaged 8 percent per year since 2003 and GDP per capita has grown at 3.5 percent per
          year. However, unlike Rwanda, the results from household surveys conducted in 2004 and 2010 suggest that
          overall poverty declined by only 2 percentage points (to 46 percent) and rural poverty went down from 57 to
          53 percent. Although there are lingering questions about the quality of the consumption data for 2010, the
          evidence points to growing inequality in the country. A decomposition of the change in poverty between 2004
          and 2010 indicated that poverty would have been 4 percentage points lower had inequality not increased.b
          Nigeria’s experience also highlights how regional variations in economic performance affected the national
          trajectory of inequality. While states in the coastal regions and the federal capital enjoyed inclusive growth,
          poverty reduction in the rest of the country was set back because growth was accompanied by increasing
          inequality or stagnation. In Kenya, there are stark spatial divides, primarily between the high-potential agro-
          ecological zones in central, western, and coastal Kenya, and the arid and semi-arid pastoral regions of northern
          and southern Kenya. Uneven geographic development will likely work to accentuate national inequality.

          Box 2.2: Despite challenges, there are still opportunities in the agriculture sector
          Agriculture is the main source of employment in rural Kenya and has significant potential to reduce poverty.
          Kenya has seen several successes in agriculture, including in tea, fertilizer, and horticulture. Overall, the sector
          continues to have a large potential for growth and contribution to poverty reduction and shared prosperity.

          The agriculture sector challenges are well Figure B2.2.1: Wholesale prices of maize in Nairobi,
          represented by the maize market, where Kampala, and international commodity markets
          competition is limited and consumer prices are
          high, with significant negative impact on welfare
          and poverty (Figure B2.2.1).

          State intervention, tariff barriers, nontariff trade
          barriers, and anticompetitive conduct by firms are
          among the explanations behind the high prices
          (Argent and Begazo 2015). The mechanisms in
          place to maintain high prices reflect a complex
          political economy. Maize is produced by

          parts of Kenya, but a considerable proportion
          of maize traded for consumption is produced by
          large Kalenjin farmers in the Northern Rift Valley. Using household surveys, the Tegemeo Institute shows that
          although maize production is widespread, 70 percent of maize farmers produce for their own consumption
          only. The same surveys show that 50 percent of revenues from traded maize was earned by 2 percent of the
          farmers. The government, through the National Cereals and Produce Board, is engaged in setting the price
          for maize through price announcements in the immediate post-harvest period each year and through maize
          purchasing schemes. The National Cereals and Produce Board has largely been managed by officials with ties
          to the Northern Rift Valley.

     Box 2.3: Why agriculture will continue to matter for Kenya’s growth and poverty reduction
     Agriculture continues to be a key pillar of Kenya’s economy. It accounts for about a quarter of gross domestic
     product (GDP) and two-thirds of exports. And agriculture accounts for more than 70 percent of employment
     in rural areas. Moreover, adding the food industry and indirect (spillover) effects, the total contribution of the
     agriculture sector goes up to half of total output.

     The sector’s performance over the past decade can be characterized as weak and erratic at best. Apart from
     a few exceptional segments, productivity and output growth in agriculture have been quite weak. The causes
     of the underperformance are well known. The World Bank Agriculture Sector Review (forthcoming) finds
     the following to be particularly high ranking: (i) institutional and regulatory weaknesses (legal framework
     that supports elite capture), (ii) land fragmentation and administration (average farm size of just above one
     hectare and significant share of unregistered land), (iii) lack of downstream facilities (such as drying and
     storage), and (iv) poor rural infrastructure (less than 2 percent of agricultural land is irrigated).

     From a macro perspective, sorting out the challenges in the sector would bring positive spillover effects. First,
     increases in agricultural output and productivity would directly raise exports and GDP, as well as the incomes
     of the bottom 40 percent of the population. Second, because of its excessive reliance on climate conditions,
     the sector has been one of the main contributors to economic volatility over the past five years. Hence,
     productivity measures that stabilize food security, such as greater stability in grain policy (tariffs and quotas)
     or subsidies for seeds or fertilizer, would also reduce volatility in the nonfarm sector. Third, improvements
     in agriculture would facilitate a transition of labor to the more productive nonfarm sectors, following a
     decade in which the share of urban population has been stable. Such urbanization would in turn reduce rural
     population density and land scarcity, which in turn would abate the political risks that may stem from land
     scarcity. Finally, raising the incomes of the rural population would make a significant dent in poverty, as most
     of the poor live in rural areas.

      Within households, working-age members are increasingly incorporating nonfarm self-employment into the
      mix of income sources. Income data from the Tegemeo panel survey also suggest that rural households have
      increasingly been diversifying away from crop income. In 2000, 50 percent of household income was derived
      from crops and 16 percent from nonfarm business; by 2007, crop income comprised 38 percent of household
      income and nonfarm business comprised 21 percent.a The census data also suggest that the bottleneck of low
      job creation in the wage sector may in part explain the increase in nonfarm self-employment.

      In a setting of stagnant wage job growth and increasing demand for nonfarm jobs, one short-run solution for
      individuals with some schooling is to try their hand at starting an informal business. In the foreseeable future,
      it is inevitable that informal self-employment will continue to grow, given the rapid growth of the workforce
      and increasing access to education in a setting of low wage job growth.

 While Kenya fares well compared to its regional, and even global competitors in the area of Getting Credit, it
 shows room for improvement in the 9 other areas measures by Doing Business indicators, where its ranking
 remains in triple-digits. Areas such as starting a business, dealing with construction permits and resolving
 insolvency, in particular, could benefit from additional streamlining to reduce procedure count and cost
 needed to complete these processes, as well as strengthening the underlying legal framework. While several
 efforts to pass various bills aiming to improve these areas are ongoing, implementation and communication
 remains to be an important aspect of reforms that should not be neglected moving forward.

FROM ECONOMIC GROW TH TO JOBS AND SHARED PROSPERIT Y                                                                     49
      Box 2.6: Examples of labor regulations that are causing firms to become risk averse in hiring

      The Work Injury Benefits Act (WIBA) and the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) provisions seem
      to have become a source of costly litigation between employers and employees. Although these laws seek
      to protect employees’ rights and were enacted to root out oppressive practices at the workplace, they have
      resulted in higher costs for formal hiring. For example, the definition of a dependent in the WIBA is too wide and
      it can result in unnecessary litigation instead of the law limiting the dependents to the immediate family only.

      The costs of annual safety and health audits and risk assessments have been loaded onto employers. OSHA
      Provision No. 15 of 2007 introduced compulsory annual safety and health audits, risk assessment, and
      the requirement for a health and safety statement by all employers. The costs of these undertakings are
      loaded onto the employers instead of the agencies undertaking the audits. The cost of compliance with this
      requirement will drive out small investors who are unable to conform because of lack of capacity to conduct
      the audits and assessments.

      Compensation levels for injury at work are also perceived to be high by employers. According to the Kenya
      Association of Manufacturers, an employee earning K Sh 50,000 a month would be eligible for compensation
      of K Sh 4.8 million, and one earning K Sh 1.2 million a month could get K Sh 115 million in case of permanent
      disablement. Such high amounts make businesses risk averse when it comes to employment.

 Box 2.7: Locking labor market entrants in low-productivity jobs limits their long-term earning potential

 A recent study by Falco et al. (2014) uses the Ghana and Tanzania Urban Panel Surveys to examine the determinants
 of earnings, earnings growth, and low-pay/high-pay transitions in the high growth period 2004–08.


 The findings highlight the relative importance of job characteristics—over workers’ endowments—
 in determining earnings and earnings growth. The findings also point toward path dependence in pay
 trajectories. This conclusion is reinforced by the finding that being in low-paid employment has a scarring
 effect: it undermines future earnings prospects. In other words, low pay is a persistent condition and new
 entrants in the labor market risk being trapped in low-paying occupations, and some groups of workers—
 women and youth—are particularly at risk of falling into low-pay traps. Falling into low pay undermines
 individuals’ prospects for obtaining high-paying jobs in the future.

       	 Aghion, Comin, and Howitt (2006) developed a theory that domestic saving affects economic growth in low- and middle-income countries
         that are far from the technological frontier.
     65	
         Gross domestic savings are measured relative to GDP and are defined as the difference between GDP and final consumption. Gross
         national savings are measured against gross national disposable Income (GNDI), which equals GDP plus net income and transfers from
         abroad. In the case of Kenya, where transfers from abroad, which include development aid, are significant, gross national savings is the
         more appropriate indicator.

 Box 3.1: Determinants of Savings
 Although a strong positive relationship has been found between savings and income growth, the causality
 between the two runs both ways. There are two major arguments in the controversy. The first argument is
 causality between savings and growth; the second argument is how income growth affects savings. Loayza,
 Schmidt-Hebbel, and Serven (2000) find that a 1 percentage point increase in income growth increases the
 saving rate by roughly the same amount. Moreover, the same authors show that this relationship is stronger
 in low- and middle-income economies. In contrast, Rodrik (2000) concludes that a permanent increase in the
 saving rate induces a temporal increase in output growth, whereas a permanent increase in income growth
 is followed by a permanent increase in the saving rate. This argument on the causality has profound policy
 implications. If saving causes growth, savings-enhancing policies are likely to induce growth. If the direction
 is opposite, such policies may fail to promote permanent growth. These policies may promote growth in the
 short run by fueling investment through savings. In the long run, however, they may fail to realize permanent
 growth because returns to capital diminish and savings itself does not affect total factor productivity, that is,
 the long-term determinant of economic growth.

 Demographic Changes
 Demographics are another strong determinant of savings. The life-cycle theory predicts that savings follow a
 hump-shaped pattern, that is, young workers dis-save against their future income, middle-aged workers save
 for their retirement, and the elderly dis-save upon their retirement (Modigliani 1970). Therefore, demographic
 changes have significant impacts on household saving patterns. The microeconomic and macroeconomic
 literature confirms that rises in youth and old dependency ratios tend to lower the savings rate.

 Macroeconomic Stability
 Macroeconomic stability has been found to be among the most important policy determinants of savings.
 The stability of prices is the main parameter of macroeconomic stability that influences savings. Balassa
 (1986) claims that maintaining low and stable inflation encourages saving. Kenya’s decade-average inflation
 rate declined from 17.4 percent in the 1990s to 10.9 percent in the 2000s. This macroeconomic stabilization
 could be accompanied by an increase in the saving rate. Nevertheless, price volatility has risen since 2010,
 which in turn discourages saving.

 Financial Development
 Financial development leads to more efficient domestic resource mobilization, but has two opposite effects
 on savings. As the banking sector grows, individuals have more opportunities to save, although at the same
 time they are able to borrow more, which in turn leads to dis-saving. Kenya’s financial sector has developed
 rapidly over the past years, with the share of population with access to finance increasing from 69 to 75
 percent (of which access to formal prudential banking rose from 22 to 33 percent) (IMF 2014). It seems that
 the increased access has supported saving, as the number of customers and deposits rose faster—157 and 92
 percent, respectfully—than credit to households (84 percent growth) between 2009 and 2013.

 Urbanization
 Urbanization has been found to influence savings, as it depicts an increase in income stability. As people
 move from rural to urban areas, their income becomes less volatile and uncertain, which in turn has been
 found to lead to lower savings. Rural households are expected to save a larger portion of their income for the
 precautionary motive (for example, in case of a poor harvest), while nonfarming households tend to save less
 because their income is more predictable. Kenya has witnessed a trend of shift in population from its rural to
 urban areas (see chapter 1), which possibly contributed negatively to saving rates.

                           Fiscal Policy
                           Empirical studies have shown that an increase in public savings can lead to an increase in household
                           savings in the short and long runs. The permanent income hypothesis predicts that a change in the timing
                           of taxation does not affect household consumption behavior. Given a sequence of public expenditures, it
                           does not matter when the government raises taxes to finance these expenditures. Therefore, the theory
                           predicts that change in public savings fully crowds out private savings, leaving national savings unchanged
                           (Ricardian equivalence). However, most empirical studies show that public savings only partially crowd out
                           private savings. Because the private sector needs some time to adjust its saving behavior, the impact of
                           public savings on household savings is more pronounced in the short run. This situation suggests that public
                           savings can be an effective policy instrument to raise savings.

          Box 4.1. How is economic complexity measured and what does it (not) represent?

          The economic complexity index (ECI) is measured using disaggregated export data (from UN COMTRADE),
          which are used as a proxy for the industrial structure of the entire economy. All products are mapped in
          terms of their linkages based on how similar they are in their complexity. The most complex products with
          the largest number of connections are located in the center or core of the network. There are many products
          in the periphery that are only weakly connected to other products.


          The ECI is not a measure of export diversification or trade openness. The aim of the ECI is not to prescribe
          specific sectors that a country should develop, but to serve as a big picture examination of the potential of
          the economy. Data in the Atlas of Economic Complexity, which captures more than 120 countries, can be
          found at http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/

       	 Strictly speaking, the Herfindahl Hirschman Index is meant to measure firm concentration in a market and thus inform the assessment of
         competition in the marketplace. Nevertheless, the index is used extensively to measure the degree of concentration in other spheres:
         product exports and imports, trade partners, etc. In this particular case, it measures Kenya’s concentration in manufacturing exports.

  The analysis in this section draws on the 2010 Census of Industrial Production conducted by the Kenya
  National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS). The data set covers 2,252 firms and 109 International Standard Industrial
  Classification four-digit product categories in manufacturing, mining, electricity, and water supply. These
  firms accounted for 324,841 jobs (including proprietors) in 2009, which implies that the data capture formal

                        Exports (of goods and services) can be measured as the following:


                        Gross exports. The transaction value of a sector’s exports, that is, what is published as exports in the balance
                        of payments. Gross exports capture the value added embodied in the production of the export, as well as all
                        (domestic and imported) intermediate inputs. Gross measures of trade statistics are registered in the balance
                        of payments at the transaction value, that is, the price for the goods or services. For example, a business
                        process outsourcing (BPO) company from India sells its services in Europe and India’s gross exports of BPO
                        services capture the invoice price of those services.


                        Direct value added of exports. This is a sector’s domestic value added embodied in its own exports,
                        measured as gross exports excluding inputs. This measure captures the value-added contribution of a sector
                        in the sector’s own exports. For example, an Indian BPO firm uses telecommunications services, from local
                        providers and foreign owners of satellites, which are intermediate inputs.


                        Total value added of exports. This is a measure of the total value added of a sector’s exports from a
                        countrywide perspective. It captures the direct value added of a sector’s exports and the value of the sector’s
                        inputs to other sectors’ exports (forward linkages).


                        Forward linkages. These are the value added of a sector that is exported indirectly through exports of other
                        sectors that contain inputs from the sector. For example, the BPO firm may be providing services to a domestic
                        manufacturing firm that exports its products. The share of the BPO firm’s input to the manufacturing good
                        exports counts as a forward linkage.
                        a. The analysis in this section draws on a new World Bank Value Added Database (Saez et al. 2014) which contains data on both direct
                        exports of services and indirect exports of services. The database uses input-output data from the Global Trade Analysis Project.

     Although hopes for the future are running high,
     from an outsider’s point of view the outlook is not that bright. WTTC projects Kenya’s tourism receipts to rise
     slower than in the rest of SSA, and far from the needed rate to reach the three million visitors target. Even some
     of the more mature tourist destinations, such as Indonesia or Morocco, are expected to be more successful in
     attracting more visitors. The deteriorating security situation has already had a high toll on international visits, and
     will continue to be a drag on the sector. Disease epidemics, as the 2014 experience with Ebola has shown, can
     also have detrimental effects. Apart from these exogenous factors, another explanation for the relatively weaker
     outlook is low investment in the sector (figure B4.4.2). Over the past 12 years, investment in tourism development
     grew at an average of 7 percent annually in Kenya, while other countries were investing more rapidly.

     Public policies related to tourism are a key pillar to successful development of the sector. First and foremost,
     infrastructure capacity has to be consistent with the strategy for tourism development. The airport in Nairobi
     has a design capacity of 2.5 million and has operated for years at overcapacity (reaching almost six million
     passengers per year). However, the government has been investing in the airport: a new terminal opened in 2014,
     and further expansion is ongoing. Other countries are taking similar steps: Vietnam’s main airport, in Hanoi, will

 open a new terminal this year and capacity will rise to 16 million, and Dar el Salaam’s capacity is currently being
 expanded to six million passengers annually. Second, road infrastructure to key tourist destinations (coast and
 parks) also needs improvements. The utilization of national parks, Kenya’s premier attraction, is unbalanced,
 with the top parks (Mara, Amboseli, and Nakuru) being overcrowded, while others, such as Tsavo or Meru, are
 underutilized. It seems that private reserves are more successful in attracting visitors compared with some of
 the public national parks. At the same time, the capacity to accommodate foreign visitors, which is a job of the
 private sector, seems to be there. Bed occupancy ratios have not crossed above 40 percent over the past few
 years, which is low by industry standards.

 Box 4.5: Integrated survey of services
 For insight into the characteristics of services firms, this section draws on the 2011 Integrated Survey of
 Services. The Kenya National Bureau of Statistics conducted this survey of 3,191 formal services firms in 2011,
 covering firm behavior in 2009 and 2010. Although not intended for national accounts purposes, the results
 are indicative of firm performance with two important caveats. First, there are data limitations given the
 intended purpose of the survey, which was to derive input-output structure for supply and use tables rather
 than to calculate value added and the fact that only 2,300 firms have complete and consistent observations.
 Second, the timeframe of the survey is not ideal, as it occurred immediately after the global economic crisis,
 which resulted in a slowdown of growth in Kenya.

 The SAYG approach does not lead to any savings; therefore, transfers to the budget from the resource boom
 diminish over time, following the resource revenue depletion. Under PIH, the government transfers about
 $2.7 billion to the fiscal budget annually (black line in panel b). In the short term, this is financed by borrowing
 from abroad (the first yellow shaded area), as resource revenues are relatively low at this stage. In the medium
 term, the resource revenues pick up and reach a peak of about $9 billion. The difference between revenues
 and transfers is saved in a sovereign wealth fund (green shaded area). Finally, as the revenues gradually die
 out, interest earnings on the welfare fund assets are used to supplement the transfers to the budget (second
 yellow shaded area). Under BIH, transfers to the fiscal budget are scaled up over time as resource revenues
 are saved in the sovereign wealth fund and interest earnings on wealth fund assets increase (black curve line
 in panel c). Until the early 2040s, resource revenues exceed the transfers; therefore, reserves continue to
 build up. Later in the projection horizon, accumulation comes to a halt and the BIH annuity reaches a plateau.
 Finally, the “big push” under the MF approach leads to investments that are financed by borrowings in the
 short term (first yellow-shaded area). In the medium term, resource revenues exceed spending; however, the
 difference is smaller than with PIH or BIH. Moreover, the spending converges to the PIH annuity in the long-
 term; however, spending remains above the PIH. Therefore, stabilization fund savings would be a lot smaller
 than the levels with PIH or BIH.

      Box 5.2. Fiscal Rule Examples
      The following experiences in other countries can serve as benchmarks for planning the institutional
      framework in Kenya.

      Chile’s Structural Balance Rule In 2006, Chile’s Fiscal Responsibility Law institutionalized one of the most
      praised fiscal rules in effect today. The framework characterizes a complex set of mechanisms, including
      transfer rules and automatic stabilizers that enable long-term sustainability and short-term macroeconomic
      stabilization.

      The structural balance rule limits government spending by structural revenues. In the case of natural resource
      revenues falling short of the target levels (or exceeding them), the differences are compensated by transfers
      between the two sovereign wealth funds and the fiscal budget. Each year, a minimum of 2 percent of the
      previous year’s gross domestic product (GDP) is transferred to the Pension Reserve Fund, which accumulates
      national savings to cover long-term pension liabilities. This transfer can be increased by another 0.5 percent if
      the natural resource revenues exceed the structural target substantially. Any remaining surplus is transferred
      to the Economic and Social Stabilization Fund. In the case of a fiscal deficit, which may be driven by low
      growth performance or low resource prices, withdrawals from this fund cover the gap. In general, both funds
      invest only in financial assets abroad to avoid overheating the economy (World Bank 2014a).

      The design and commitment of the Chilean government have turned this practice into a success story.
      However, implementation of such a complex rule requires strong institutional capacity. To estimate the
      structural revenues the authorities would need to project the long-term prices of natural resources, interest
      earnings on financial assets, and the trajectory of potential GDP going forward. In many low-income countries,
      a simpler rule could prove to be more transparent and implementable.

      Norway’s Bird-in-Hand
      Starting in 2001, Norway’s fiscal rule has limited the structural non-oil deficit by an amount equivalent to
      the real return on resource revenue savings. Accordingly, the revenues net of transfers to the budget are
      transferred to the Global Government Pension Fund, which serves stabilization and saving purposes by
      investing in financial assets abroad. As such, the fiscal rule in Norway enables spending to increase gradually
      without depleting the savings, which are crucial for fiscal sustainability in the long term.

      For mature producers that are close to the end of their extraction cycle, the bird-in-hand rule enables a
      sustainable expenditure path. However, this requires substantial savings to be accumulated before the
      depletion. In Norway, these savings already exceed 100 percent of GDP. In comparison, in low-income
      countries with relatively young natural resource industries, the bird-in-hand rule may constrain spending on
      much-needed public goods in the earlier phases of the extraction cycle.

      Kazakhstan’s Modified Permanent Income Rule
      Kazakhstan’s sovereign wealth fund, the National Fund of the Republic of Kazakhstan (NFRK), serves a dual
      purpose of stabilization of the macro-economy and accumulation of national savings. It was established in
      2000, and has been modified several times. The more recent modifications were implemented in 2007 and
      2012. Since 2007, the NFRK receives all fiscal revenues from gas, oil, and four metals (chrome, zinc, lead, and
      copper), and makes disbursements to the budget, as enacted by law.




112                                                                        K E N YA C O U N T R Y E C O N O M I C M E M O R A N D U M
 In 2012, the annual transfer of funds to the budget was changed from the previously fixed amount of US$8
 billion to the flexible amount of US$8 billion plus or minus 15 percent (US$6.8 billion to US$9.2 billion),
 depending on the cyclical position of the economy. In 2012, it was decided that the next three budgets,
 subject to revision, will receive a transfer of US$9.2 billion, keeping the transfers pegged at the upper end of
 the range that has been specified.

 Timor-Leste’s Sustainable Income Rule
 Timor-Leste’s Petroleum Fund was established in 2005 with an objective of prudently managing the petroleum
 resources and mitigating the risks to the budget and economy from fluctuations in oil revenues. For this
 purpose, the Petroleum Fund collects all oil revenues, which constitute more than 70 percent of the economy
 (McKechnie 2013).

 Transfers from the Petroleum Fund to the fiscal budget are determined by a modified permanent income
 rule called Estimated Sustainable Income. Accordingly, each year the Government of Timor-Leste calculates
 the country’s petroleum wealth using conservative long-term oil price projections, existing Petroleum Fund
 savings, and the discounted sum of future productions. A maximum of 3 percent of this petroleum wealth
 is then transferred to the fiscal budget annually. Exceptions that involve transfers exceeding this ceiling are
 subject to parliamentary approval.

 Although this rule has been applied successfully in Timor-Leste, it is sensitive to projection biases. Long-
 term averaging of the prices helps smooth the expenditures by preventing sharp movements. Similarly,
 limiting the expenditures to a fraction of total oil wealth provides a sustainable approach. However, frequent
 updates in long-term oil price projections based on current market data could also make public expenditures
 pro-cyclical. The Government of Timor-Leste has been careful by taking a conservative approach so far. In
 addition, transparency of the fund, clear definition of responsibilities, and effective management by the
 Central Bank have led independent evaluators to consider this a success story.

             Appendix A: Examination of exogenous and endogenous shocks to the Kenyan economy




      The applied method for examining the size and lag effects of exogenous and endogenous shocks on
      the economy is based on the work of Raddatz (2007). It begins by identifying the economies that
      unilaterally influence Kenya’s economy (no significant reverse impact). The list includes Kenya’s major
      exogenous export partners, the European Union, India, Pakistan, and the United States. Foreign
      effective demand for Kenya (GDP growth rates of the aforementioned economies) is constructed with
      normalized weights that sum to one, computed according to the average export share of Kenya’s
      exports of goods and services in 2009–12. Then, foreign effective inflation is constructed (consumer
      price index--based inflation) using the same approach, this time using the main exogenous partners
      from which Kenya imports goods and services, China, the European Union, India, Japan, South Africa,
      and the United States.

      The assessment of the transmission of the shocks is based on impulse response functions and variance
      decomposition methods for which bivariate vector autoregression (VAR) models are employed. VAR
      is one of the most frequently used methods in the empirical literature for examining the size and the
      time-lag of the reaction of one variable to a shock in another. Because the core aim of the analysis is
      to assess the transmission of the exogenous shocks, by following the approach of Cushman and Zha
      (1997) and Raddatz (2007), the so-called block exogeneity assumption is imposed in the VARs.89 The
      selection of the VAR models is done according to the common approach in the literature.90

      The same methodological approach can be utilized to assess how domestic (endogenous) shocks affect
      the economy. To this end, the impacts of shocks from the following factors were examined: investment
      (gross and fixed investments, and net foreign direct investment inflows), fiscal policy outcomes (total
      government expenditure, final government consumption, budget deficit, and public debt expressed
      as ratios of GDP), domestic inflation, population growth, and human capital variables (average years
      of schooling and gross secondary school enrollment). The analysis is again based on bivariate VAR
      models, but without the imposition of the block exogeneity assumption due to endogeneity issues.




      89
        	 The imposition of the block-exogeneity assumption in the VARs means that the two-side effects of the variables that are included in the
          model are restricted. For example, in the usual VAR framework the two-way causation is assessed between the variables used (X and Y),
          whereas the block exogeneity assumption allows only the one-way impact of the variables to be assessed, that is, from the exogenous (X) to
          the endogenous (Y) variable, but not the other way around, as is allowed under the usual VAR framework.
      90	
          First, the lag length of the variables is chosen by the information selection criteria (Akaike (1974, 1976), Schwarts (1978), and Hannan and
          Quinn (1979)), and then the residual diagnostic tests are conducted for serial correlation, normal distribution, and autoregressive
          conditional heteroskedasticity. After the model has been specified, the impulse response functions are estimated with bootstrap
          confidence intervals of 100 repetitions.

                               Appendix B: Simulation model for Kenya’s oil revenue



      The simulations in chapter 5 were performed by using a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model
      developed by Levine, Melina, and Onder (2015). The model builds on Melina and Xiong (2013), Melina,
      Yang, and Zanna (2014), Berg et al. (2013), and Buffie et al. (2012), which analyze the public investment
      and growth nexus together with debt sustainability and natural resource revenue management in
      low- and middle-income countries. In addition to the modeling framework developed in these papers,
      the framework developed for Kenya incorporates the analysis of expenditure composition in public
      investments, which involves human capital components such as health and education spending as
      well.

      In particular, the framework is a small-economy model with limited asset market participation to
      capture the presence of agents that do not have access to financial markets in low- and middle-income
      countries. The production side of the model exhibits (i) a traded goods sector featuring learning-
      by-doing externalities to capture the effects of the Dutch disease that may arise because of natural
      resource booms; (ii) a non-traded goods sector; and (iii) a natural resource sector.

      A typical firm in the traded (T) and non-traded (N) goods sectors produces output, yj,t , j = {T, N}
      according to the technology

                                             yj,t = zj `kj,t-1j1-αj `Aj,tLj,tjαj`kG,t-1jαG


      where zj is a total factor productivity scale parameter, kj,t is end-of-period private capital, kG,t-1 is end-
      of-period public capital, αj is the labor share of sectoral income, and αG represents the output elasticity
      with respect to public capital. Labor productivity Aj,t is given by:

                                                       Aj,t = zα,jet βj,eht βj,h


      where et represents the average education of the labor force, and ht represents the average health
      status of the labor force.

      The model also features inefficiencies and absorptive capacity constraints for public investment and
      a time-varying depreciation rate of public capital to capture lack of maintenance, in line with the
      empirical literature for low- and middle-income economies (see Gupta et al. 2011, among others).
      To reflect this, effective investment is assumed to take a particular functional form to enable the
      deviations of government investment expenditure from the initial steady state more than a threshold
      lead to a decrease in efficiency of the additional investment proportional to the size of the deviation.
      This mechanism captures absorptive capacity constraints in Kenya and comparable countries.

      Saving/spending scenarios are chosen on the basis of the policy options. These are determined by
      the country’s plans as documented by strategic documents such as Vision 2030 and the Medium-
      Term Plans, as well as alternative scenarios that are commonly observed in other countries. Public
      investment can be frontloaded and the degree of the frontloading is linked to the degree of investment
      inefficiency.

As far as fiscal policy is concerned, the model has a fund where any positive difference between
inflows (including natural resource revenue) and outflows (including investment expenditures) is
saved and the lower bound of this fund is a policy choice. The fund is drawn down when such a
difference is negative. However, when the fund reaches a chosen lower bound, then one or more
fiscal instruments react to close it either instantaneously or by temporarily allowing accumulation of
public debt and satisfying the government intertemporal budget constraint in the long run. In the case
of Kenya—where natural resource exploitation is a recent phenomenon and virtually no fiscal buffers
have been accumulated yet—a lower bound of zero is set for the fund, which effectively becomes a
non-negativity constraint for government assets. The model allows four fiscal instruments to close the
fiscal gap (consumption tax, labor income tax, government consumption, and government transfers).
For simplicity, where needed, only the consumption tax is allowed to stabilize debt in the long run
and the other instruments are left at their initial steady state. Although the use of other instruments,
combined or in isolation, implies somewhat different macroeconomic dynamics, the bottom-line of
the results outlined below is robust to such choices.
