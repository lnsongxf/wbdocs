Introduction / Project Scope

The Baku-Shamakhi Road (Km 15-45) is to be reconstructed into a four-lane highway following
a New Project Design which was different from the design when the Scott-Wilson EA Report
was drafted. For this reason a Supplemental Environmental Assessment (EA) Report has been
drafted to capture the change in scope. This project will be funded by WB-IBRD and to be
implemented by Azer Road Service (ARS) under the Ministry of Transport.

The objective of this supplemental Environmental Assessment (EA) is to present and assess the
impacts of the New Project Design (primarily the change in the structural pavement design in
8km spots/sections) which entails reworking on old pavement structure and importing some new
materials from previously identified quarries and borrow areas. The preparation of the
Supplemental Environmental Assessment (EA) for Baku-Shamakhi Road Km 15-45 takes full
cognizance of the Scott-Wilson EA Report as the reference document.

Description of the Project

The project road of 30km will be supportive of the objectives of the entire Baku-Shamakhi road
which are as follow:
    Reduce road transport costs for road users
    Improve access and transit throughout the entire road
    Enhance safety within Azerbaijan’s east-west corridor, through the implementation of a
       number of subprojects
    Better road quality and better safety through new alignments
    Lower travel costs and a shorter travel time.

In addition, as mentioned in the Scott-Wilson EA Report, the other recognized objectives are as
follows
      to propel economic growth as a result of returns on investments through the marked
        growth of the traffic on the subject roads;
      to improve road technical specifications for increase in speed and consequently reduce
        travel time;
      To improved east-west connections to foster economic integration and growth within the
        country, in particular non-oil growth, leading to a degree of economic diversification

The four-laning of the entire Baku-Shamakhi road is expected to result to economic growth for
Azerbaijan is as a consequence of higher returns on investments through the marked growth of
the traffic, increase in speed, and subsequent decrease in travel time with the better road
infrastructure. In general, the enhanced east-west connections will foster economic integration
and growth within the country, particularly the non-oil growth, leading to a degree of economic
diversification.

From the existing two-lane Category II road, the segment km 15-45 of the Baku-Shamakhi
highway shall be reconstructed into four-lane and will entail the following options:
    (i) Construction of the additional carriageway to one side, either the right hand side (RHS)
         or left hand side (LHS) of the existing carriageway with a total width of 27.5m;
    (ii) Widening of the existing carriageway on both sides, either by:
           (a) Widening at both sides with a reduced median and shoulder, total width 22.5m;
                  or

           (b)  Widening at both sides without median and reduced lane width and shoulder,
                total width 17.5m.
    (iii) Widening in sections with climbing lane, total width 20.5m.

The changes in the original scope includes: (i) improvement of U-turn layouts; (ii) relocation of
various utilities; and (iii) Strengthening of additional sections of the existing carriageway, totaling
about 8 km. The new lanes in the 8km spots/sections will conform to the new design, which will
have relatively thicker Wearing Course by 3 cm (from 5cm to 8 cm), while maintaining the same
thickness of Binder Course (9cm), and Bituminous Base Course (10cm). The Granular Base
Course will be thicker by 10cm (from 5cm to 8 cm), while the Capping Layer will be thinner by
9cm (from 35cm to 24cm)..

Generally, the construction will be within the designated ROW. Indirect impact can extend even
beyond the 60 ROW mainly due to social environmental characteristics of the project area. This
has been considered in the Scott-Wilson EA Report.

Supplementary Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures

In the previous Scott-Wilson EA Report for the four-laning of the road segment, anticipated
direct and/or indirect impacts were already sufficiently tackled and adequately addressed in the
Outline Monitoring Plan. In this Supplemental EA, the change of scope due to the revision in the
pavement design is the only one item being considered. Primarily reconstruction work is only
done on the existing pavement and firsthand work is to be done on the additional two lanes as
part of the four-laning.

Impacts considered are those associated with scarifying and milling of the existing asphalt
layers to be while the subs-structures should be reworked to conform to the new designs. The
new two-lanes will conform to the new design.

In the four-laning work, the impacts will be expected along the road corridor as well as the
material sources and processing plants. Hence, this Supplemental EA will be mainly be on
impacts and mitigation measures in connection with reworking of the existing two lanes and
construction of two additional lanes.

Supplemental Environmental Management during Construction

The Supplemental Environmental Management Plan (EMP) identifies the mitigation measures,
monitoring activities and institutional arrangements to be implemented to prevent, eliminate, or
reduce to acceptable levels any adverse environmental and social impacts of the road
rehabilitation project. The Scott-Wilson EA Report is considered still relevant and applicable with
the four-laning project works and may be used in the environmental management and
monitoring works during the construction. In this supplemental EA, a number of additional
provisions are being included to improve the management and monitoring aspects of the four-
laning construction activities to take into account the change in scope.

Capacity Building

The staff training for ESS/district ARS is recommended as part of the construction supervision
contract by an international environmental specialist focusing on capability on the proper
enforcement of the EMP. A typical ESS/ARS staff training will consist of lecture-type
presentation of the general procedure and requirements for effective environmental monitoring
followed by more detailed on-the-job and hands-on training at the construction site where the
trainees will participate in the activities of the international environmental specialist/construction
supervision staff in reviewing the Contractor’s reports, periodic monitoring inspections,

deliberation of environmental issues involving the Contractor and the project stakeholders, and
finally the accomplishment of environmental reports.

Public Consultation Summary and Information Disclosure

In conformance with the Operational Policy (OP)/Bank Procedure (BP) 4.01: Environmental
Assessment of the WB-IBRD, In conformity with the Operational Policy (OP)/Bank Procedure
(BP) 4.01: Environmental Assessment of the WB-IBRD, public consultation for the Four-laning
of the Baku-Shamakhi km 15-45 Section [additional works for rehabilitation and strengthening of
the existing road lanes and relocation of utility and communication lines not envisaged by the
original road design] was scheduled on 23 October 2015 at 3:00 pm at Ashagi Guzdek
Settlement Municipal Office, part of Absharon Rayon. The PIU-ARS coordinated the holding of
public consultation with the Local Executive Power of Absharon Rayon, wherein local residents,
village officials/representatives, local NGOs, and other stakeholders were invited. This was
attended by around of 20 participants and in which the Environmental Consultant elaborated the
rehabilitation works, project’s environmental, social impacts, and land issues along with WB and
GoA policies in minimizing and mitigating projected impacts. Comments were later solicited from
the participants in an open forum and both by means of written documentation filled out by the
participants themselves. Minutes of the Meeting have been separately documented and
attached to the Report.

Conclusions

This Supplemental EA contains additional provisions in the mitigation and monitoring aspects to
be performed during the implementation of the project in conformance with the change of scope
(New Project Design). These shall be in addition to what were presented in the Scott-Wilson EA
Report documents drafted for the project. These additional provision aims at improving the
environmental management and monitoring aspect of the works.

1.        INTRODUCTION

1.1       Project Background and Previous Studies

The project being considered in this is referred to as the Baku-Shamakhi Road (Km 15-45). This
project involves the upgrading of a road segment from two-lane Category II to a four-lane
Category I Highway which starts at km 15+000 to km 44+600 as the actual chainage. This road
segment is part of the upgrading of the entire Baku-Shamakhi Road (M4) starting from km 10
and km 91. Funding for this project is being provided as a load from WB-IBRD and to be
implemented by Azer Road Service (ARS) under the Ministry of Transport.

The existing road segment has been rehabilitated into a Category II road as per the Former
Soviet Union Standard (SNIP) 2.05.02-85. The construction works produced a road with a two
lane carriageway with a paved width of 9.00 m and an unpaved shoulder width of 2 x 3.00 m.

The Baku-Shamakhi road is the shortest way from Baku to Georgia and to western Azerbaijan.
The four-laning construction for the Baku-Shamakhi Road has been subdivided into several
road segments with their respective EIAs. Previously, an Environmental Assessment Report
(EAR) for the four-laning was drafted for km15-451 by Scott-Wilsion, referred herewith as SW-
EAR. However, certain changes were adopted in the pavement structure n around 8 km plus
improvement in some of the U-turn layouts. The four-laning of the section-alignment from km15-
45 remained the same aside from these said modifications. This modification is not considered
major departure from the former scope as the reconstruction is confined within the defined four-
lane strip. Because of this reason, a new EA is not necessary, and a Supplemental EA Report
is being drafted to capture the difference of scope, with the perceived impacts and required
mitigation measures.

The previous environmental documents for this road segment are as follows:

1.2       Brief Description of the Study Area

The Baku-Shamakhi highway is a segment of the Magistral Road, M4 (Baku to Yevlakh). The
segment being considered starts at chainage km 15+000 and ends at km km 44+600. The
entire starting point of this approximate 29.6 km road segment at km 15 which located west of
the trumpet interchange after Mushfiq (part of Garadah Rayon) and Ashagi-Guzdak (part of
Abasheron Rayon); through Pirakeshkul (Military Camp) and ends at approximately 1.5 km east
of Dzhangi, part of Gobustan Rayon. This particular road segment is linked with km 13.5-15 and
km 45-91. Currently, some works were already done, however temporarily stopped due to some
issues with the Contractor.

In the S-W EA Report, the road has been described as going through areas of arid, denuded,
rolling foothills with deep, water incised gullies, climbing gently towards the Caucasus. The
landscape is also characterized as highly eroded, with soils that are friable, alkaline with high

clay content. This area is known to be used as winter grazing grounds for sheep, cattle and
goats, and donkeys, which reduces the opportunity for shrub development

Along the study corridor, there is only one watercourse that is found – Sumgayitchay River,
which flows about two kilometers to the north parallel with the road approximately from km 20
up to km 45; however in some sections (e.g. at km 22 and km 28) the loops of the river come
nearer to the road side up to 500 m.

The area between 15km-45km on the Baku-Shamakhi highway crosses dry steppe/semi-desert,
in which the flora is mainly characterized by Saltwort (Salsola dendroides) and Wormwood
(Artemisia hanseniania) plant species. The road construction is restricted to 60m (30m either
side of the existing road centre point) of the ROW and it is not envisaged that there will be a
significant, long term impact on roadside vegetation. During the drafting of the S-W EA Report,
there are no known sites of cultural or archaeological importance near the entire stretch of road.

The only Nationally Designated protected area in the immediate highway environs is the Mud
Volcano Areas found at km 30.5 and km 31. The closest mud-volcano to the study corridor is
Pirikushkul mud volcano located approximately 100 m from the roadside at approximately km
31.

A map of the project road is shown in Figure 1 below.

1.3        Scope of Supplemental Environmental Assessment

The preparation of the Supplemental Environmental Assessment (EA) Report for Baku-
Shamakhi Road Km 45-91 takes full cognizance of the Scott-Wilson EA Report as the reference
document. Due to the changes in the original construction contract a Supplemental
Environmental Assessment (EA) Report has to be drafted.

The changes to the original scope are as follows:

       1) Improvements to the layout of U-turns provision
             - Doubling of three single direction U-turns, at Km21+432, km26+367, km30+362;
             - New single U-turn at Km23+100
             - Improved layout for all 9 U-turns.

       2) Relocation of various utilities; and

       3) Strengthening of additional sections of the existing carriageway, totaling about 8 km. The
          carriageway in these sections were to have been overlaid with wearing course, but will
          now be reconstructed to the same specification as the new carriageway. In these areas,
          all existing pavement layers, (both asphalt and unbound (subbase) layers) will be
          removed as well as part of the earthworks, depending on the conditions found. Some of
          the asphalt layers may be recycled to be used as fill material. Unlike in km 45 – 91, the
          new carriageway, and the reconstructed existing carriageway, will not have a separate
          crushed stone layer.

This Supplemental EA Report will focus on impacts that will result in the introduced changes
and assess the adequacy of the associated Environmental Management Plan. Previous
environmental assessment results will be also be checked vis-à-vis the new design and
recommendations shall be presented to conform to WB-IBRD’s requirements and Azerbaijan
legislations.

2.         CURRENT EA DOCUMENT

An Environmental Assessment Report for the four-laning construction based on existing design
was drafted by Scott-Wilson dated May 2009, the purpose of which was to provide an update of
the previous Environmental Assessment (EA)2 for Baku – Shamahki Road Rehabilitation in
relation to the proposed 4-lane highway upgrade between km 15 and km 45.

As mentioned in the Scott-Wilson EA Report, an Environmental Assessment was prepared by
Kocks Consult GmbH as part of the initial planning phase for the Rehabilitation stage of this
project; and this has been approved by the State Ecological Expertise (SEE) of the Ministry of
Environment and Natural Resources (MENR) of Azerbaijan.

The Scott-Wilson EA Report describes any additional, or amplified, impacts due to the proposed
4-lane upgrading along the 30 km stretch from km 15 to km 45. The salient components consist
of:
        Discussions on Alternative Alignments;
        Environmental Baseline Conditions Km15 – Km45;
        Socio-Economic Baseline Conditions Km15 – Km45;
        Overall Mitigation and Offsets and Monitoring; and
        Appendix F: Outline Monitoring Plan

3.       PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND PROJECT SCOPE MODIFICATION

3.1      Objectives and purpose of the project

The 30km project road of will be supportive of the objectives of the entire Baku-Shamakhi road
which are as follow:
    Reduce road transport costs for road users
    Improve access and transit throughout the entire road
    Enhance safety within Azerbaijan’s east-west corridor, through the implementation of a
       number of subprojects
    Better road quality and better safety through new alignments
    Lower travel costs and a shorter travel time.

In addition, as mentioned in the Scott-Wilson EA Report, the widening of the existing Baku to
Shamakhi road from a two lane to a four lane road is intended to meet an anticipated growth in
demand for road transport services. The other recognized objectives are as follows
     to propel economic growth as a result of returns on investments through the marked
        growth of the traffic on the subject roads;
     to improve road technical specifications for increase in speed and consequently reduce
        travel time;
     To improved east-west connections to foster economic integration and growth within the
        country, in particular non-oil growth, leading to a degree of economic diversification

The four-laning of the entire Baku-Shamakhi road is expected to result to economic growth for
Azerbaijan is as a consequence of higher returns on investments through the marked growth of
the traffic, increase in speed, and subsequent decrease in travel time with the better road
infrastructure. In general, the enhanced east-west connections will foster economic integration
and growth within the country, particularly the non-oil growth, leading to a degree of economic
diversification.


3.2      Main Design Options

In the Scott-Wilson EA Report, four main design options were proposed for the four-laning of the
road between Baku and Shamakhi, depending on local topography and land use – to be used
alternatively on different sections of the road. These options were as follows:

      (iv) Construction of the additional carriageway to one side, either the right hand side (RHS)
           or left hand side (LHS) of the existing carriageway (see Figure 2) with a total width of
           27.5m;
      (v) Widening of the existing carriageway on both sides, either by:
              (c) Widening at both sides with a reduced median and shoulder, total width 22.5m
                    (see Figure 3); or
             (d) Widening at both sides without median and reduced lane width and shoulder,
                    total width 17.5m (see Figure 4).
      (vi) Widening in sections with climbing lane, total width 20.5m (see Figure 5).

The entire construction roadway from shoulder to shoulder will have a width of 27.00m. With
provisions for drainage, the entire road will be around 30-35 m. The cross-sectional profile of the
road is shown in the next Figures.

The road construction will also include drainage, cross-pipes and culverts along with relocation
of underground and above ground utility lines.

Generally, the construction will be within the designated ROW. Indirect impact can extend even
beyond the 60 ROW mainly due to social environmental characteristics of the project area. This
has been considered in the Scott-Wilson EA Report. These options were further deliberated by
the PIU and the concerned consultants.

3.3     Description of Project Modification

As mentioned, the changes in the original scope includes: (i) improvement of U-turn layouts; (ii)
relocation of various utilities; and (iii) Strengthening of additional sections of the existing
carriageway, totaling about 8 km. The strengthening portions entails a new structural pavement
design based on new parameters adopted to strengthen the road pavement in anticipation of
heavier loadings. Because of this, the road pavement of said 8km sections has also to be rebuilt
to conform to the new design parameters. Changes in thicknesses in the New Project Design
were introduced. In the construction, this will be implemented by scarifying the pavement
structure up to embankment layer and onto which the new design project design. The design
modification is shown on the table below and depicted on the subsequent schematics.

4.        SUPPLEMENTAL ENVIRONMENT IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES

In the previous Scott-Wilson EA Report for the four-laning of the road segment, anticipated
direct and/or indirect impacts were already sufficiently tackled and adequately addressed in the
Outline Monitoring Plan. In this Supplemental EA Report, the change of scope due to the
revision in the pavement design for the 8km spots or sections is the only one item being
considered. Primarily reconstruction work is only done on the existing pavement and firsthand
work is to be done on the additional two lanes as part of the four-laning.

For the existing pavement in the 8km spots or sections, the asphalt layers are to be scarified,
milled and to be mixed with new asphalt mix at the plant, while the subs-structures should be
reworked to conform to the new designs. The new lanes will conform to the new design, which
will have relatively thicker Wearing Course by 3 cm (from 5cm to 8 cm), while maintaining the
same thickness of Binder Course (9cm), and Bituminous Base Course (10cm). The Granular
Base Course will be thicker by 10cm (from 5cm to 8 cm), while the Capping Layer will be thinner
by 9cm (from 35cm to 24cm).

In the four-laning work, the impacts will be expected along the road corridor as well as the
material sources and processing plants. What will be emphasized in this Supplemental EA
Report are impacts and mitigation measures in connection with reworking of the 8km
spots/sections lanes. In general, the previous Outline Monitoring Plan in the Scott-Wilson EA
Report can be supplemented according to this change of scope.


4.1       Roadway Earthworks for the 8km Change in Scope

Since the 8km spots/sections of the road will be constructed on existing road and shoulder,
impacts on major cut or fill have already been considered in the Scott-Wilson EA Report and
previous documents. The rework on the existing pavement (if already completed) will entail the
following to conform to the new design:
     (i)   Scarifying and milling of the existing asphalt layers: Wearing Course, Binder Course
              and Bituminous Base Course
     (ii) Excavation, removal and temporary stockpiling of the existing Granular Subbase
     (iii) Excavation trimming of the Capping Layer from 35cm to 24cm
     (iv) Re-laying of thicker Granular Subbase from 15cm to 22cm, using stockpiled portion
              (excess Capping Layer and possibly from milled materials in conformance with the
              specified gradation;
     (v) Re-laying of thicker Bituminous Base Course of the same thickness (10cm)
     (vi) Re-laying of thinner Binder Course of the same thickness (9cm)
     (vii) Re-laying of thicker Wearing Course from 5 cm to 8 cm

In case where new two-lane portion shall be constructed along new strips, these will require the
following scope of the New Project Design:

      (i)     Preparation of the road embankment layer
      (ii)    Installing 24 cm Capping Layer
      (iii)   Laying of 25 cm Granular Subbase
      (iv)    Laying of 10 cm Bituminous Base Course
      (v)     Laying of 9 cm Binder Course
      (vi)    Laying of 8 cm Wearing Course


The reconstruction of the new pavement will entail short term disturbance at the site consisting
of noise, dust, equipment emission, impairment of local community access. Noise can be

                                                             10

mitigated by proper scheduling the usage of equipment, installation of mufflers and regular
equipment maintenance and provision of noise barriers when needed. Dust can be routinely
minimized by watering of certain exposed areas and covering materials being hauled in trucks.
Location for temporary material stockpile can pose some localized issues which the Contractor
can resolve by proper planning.

In some areas, cut and fill for the new lanes to conform to the New Project Design may have to
be done along with the construction of side ditches for drainage. Roadway cuts shall entail
excavation, removal and reusing, when proved to be suitable, for embankment/filling work.
Unsuitable soil materials shall be disposed in areas where it would be proven to be non-
detrimental to adjacent community and the environment. The work scope also includes all
excavation necessary for side ditches and relocation of underground utilities. Some excavation
and filling will be done at the extension of water way crossings. The impacts of the cut and fill
works will be minimized by proper planning and determining sites to obtain materials or deposit
them when they are in excess. Re-cultivation of borrow areas should be done after their usage
and deposited materials should be stabilized by proper grading to allow natural re-vegetation.



4.2      Borrow and Quarry Areas

The four-laning will entail usage of materials in the existing road and additional volumes for the
new two lanes. After comparing the New Project Design with the Existing Road Design for 8km
spots/sections, it is likely that for the reconstruction of existing pavement, new materials would
have to be imported from quarries. The volume of materials that will be used for the road
substructure can be estimated by simplified computations base on the road geometry as shown
below:

proves to be beneficial. Savings in the bitumen can likewise be realized with the reuse of old
asphalt pavement.

In the Scott-Wilson EA Report, sources of aggregate for road pavement were mentioned and
these are primarily the rivers near the project road. The following were among the potential: (i)
Qozluchay I; (ii) Qozluchay II; and (iii) Pirsaatchay. As mentioned in the report, these were
identified as the potential borrow areas by the Environmental Assessment for Baku – Shamakhi
Road rehabilitation3 and the impacts were discussed by the mentioned Kocks EA Report.

As shown, minimal requirements may be needed. However, to assure of the quality, the
Wearing Course may be constructed of new crushed aggregate from the material sources.

What needs to be given more consideration is the manner of quarrying. Proper planning should
be done to minimize effect on the topography as well as the natural hydrology of the river.
Mitigation measures to minimize or avoid bank erosion and/or localized scouring should be
undertaken. When all materials are obtained, the quarries used should be reinstated to better or
improved conditions.

5.         SUPPLEMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN

The Supplemental Environmental Management Plan (EMP) in this report identifies the mitigation
measures, monitoring activities and institutional arrangements to be implemented to prevent,
eliminate, or reduce to acceptable levels any adverse environmental and social impacts of the
road rehabilitation project. The Scott-Wilson EA Report also takes cognizance of the previous
fore-running EMP drafted by Kocks Consult4.

In this Supplemental EA Report, a number of additional provisions are being included to
improve the management and monitoring aspects of the four-laning construction activities to
take into account the change in scope. These additional items are found in the Annexes of this
Supplementary EA Report.

5.1        Environmental Mitigation and Monitoring Program

The Supplemental environmental mitigation and monitoring programs summarized in Annexes A
and B have been devised to ensure proper response with the identified project impacts, which
may arise during the construction phase of the project road. Prior to the construction, the ESS
with the assistance of the Construction Supervision Consultant will do the following for the
Baku-Shamakhi Road (Km 15-45):

                Establish baseline information on the existing environmental conditions and
                 parameters for the specific road project;

                Develop an environmental auditing protocol for the construction period as well as a
                 detailed monitoring and management plan;

                Provide guidance and formulate a report outline that will be used by the contractor as
                 a guide in the preparation of monthly environmental progress reports; and

                Undertake regular and periodic monitoring of contractor’s implementation of the
                 mitigation measures during the construction stage, consistent with the monitoring
                 program, and submit to PIU-ARS quarterly monitoring reports. Special separate
                 reports should be prepared in the event a significant environment related incident will
                 arise.

                The PIU will provide the WB a summary of the monitoring results on a quarterly
                 basis.

In addition, environmental management activities should form part of the Internal Monitoring
System. The purpose of such system is to track progress of as well as changes in civil work
activities as well as monitor effects and impact of the road construction and rehabilitation on the
households and communities along the road. The ARS OJSC will be responsible for the
establishment of the monitoring system with the assistance of the Supervision Consultant and
the Civil Works Contractor, whose scope will be specified in the terms of reference for the work
contract.

5.2        Institutional Arrangements and Reporting

To ensure that the proposed mitigation measures will be implemented by the Contractor/s
during the construction stage, the detailed engineering consultant will undertake the following:

             Clearly define in the tender and contract documents the Contractor’s obligation to
              undertake and implement environmental mitigation measures as specified in Scott-
              Wilson EA Report and Supplemental Environmental Mitigation Measures outlined in
              Annex A. The same shall be appended in Contract Specifications;

             The cost for the recommended environmental mitigation measures will, where
              possible, be itemized as cost items in the Bill of Quantities. Such allocation of a cost
              item to specific environmental mitigation measure will be crucial to assure their
              actual implementation. During procurement or bidding, the bidders will be specifically
              instructed to include these cost items as line items in the Bill of Quantities to form
              part of their financial bids; and

             Explicitly require the Contractor to recruit an environmental, health and safety (EHS)
              personnel who will be specifically responsible in handling environmental issues of the
              project.

The Contractor will be responsible for the implementation of environmental mitigation measures
during construction and shall employ EHS personnel who will supervise implementation of the
Contractor’s environmental responsibilities as stipulated in the contract and liaise with the ESS
and the district ARS on such matters. Likewise, the EHS personnel will also be responsible for
health and safety aspects of work sites and shall submit monthly reports to ESS on the status of
implementation of mitigation measures, including complaints received and actions taken as well
as other environmental issues relating to the project. The Contractor, in coordination with the
construction supervision consultant, shall set-up a grievance redress committee that will deal
with any complaints during project implementation.

Also, during project implementation, the ESS with the assistance of the CSC shall monitor the
compliance of the Contractor in accordance with the EMP provisions. The ESS shall submit
quarterly reports to ARS and the MENR describing the status of implementation of
environmental mitigation measures by the contractors. Included in the reports are additional
mitigation measures that may need to be implemented, incidents of non-compliance with
applicable environmental permits, complaints received from local residents, NGOs, etc. and
ways and means by which, they were addressed or settled.

It is advisable that the CSC shall employ an expatriate environment specialist (with civil
engineering/environmental management background) to assist the ESS in the monitoring the
progress of the construction on its environmental aspect. The CSC, through its environment
specialist, shall provide hands-on training to the ESS throughout various stages of the
construction. The CSC shall also assist the ESS in preparing monitoring reports regarding the
performance of the contractors in terms of compliance with the relevant national environmental
regulations, quality standards and the implementation of environmental specifications in
accordance with the contract provisions. The Terms of Reference (ToR) for the environmental
specialist shall be drawn-up by the detailed engineering consultants for the road project. During
project implementation, the ARS (through the PIU) will report to the World Bank-IBRD every
three (3) months on the progress of the project based on the monitoring reports submitted by
the ESS/CSC and the Contractor.

Upon project completion and subsequent acceptance by the ARS, the same will be responsible
on the operation and maintenance of the Project Road. Routine and random environmental
monitoring will be undertaken by ARS district offices as scheduled in the monitoring plan
(Annex B). Parallel to this the MENR will conduct random monitoring of the project to assess
compliance with the required mitigation measures and applicable environmental laws and
regulations. Should the ARS plan for full public participation activities, a detailed action plan
should be devised with adequate funding from Azerbaijan government.

5.5       Institutional Strengthening

In the implementation of projects, often one major issue is the incorporation of the requirements
for environmental mitigation and monitoring in the contract documents even though the EMP
was adequately prepared. Accordingly, it becomes difficult to enforce the needed environmental
mitigating measures in projects, particularly due to lack of reference of these items in the project
contract. It is important that this item be adequately emphasized on the part of ESS for
compliance by the Contractor. Furthermore, the level of expertise of ESS to undertake
environmental management and monitoring should also be upgraded.

In the past some training had been formulated and implemented in line with institutional building
and capacity building of staff from various agencies dealing with environmental regulations and
control, especially the ESS-ARS OJSC. The topics elaborated in the training covered a range of
environmental management and related issues relevant to the road construction sector in
Azerbaijan such as Introduction to Construction Noise, Ecology, Environmental Good Practice,
Waste Management; Good Practice on site – Dust, Ecology, Noise, Smoke & Odours, Trees,
Water Management, Map Reading, Borrow Pit/Quarry, Oils & Chemicals; and Traffic Impacts on
Air Quality.

To respond to the requirements of the environmental monitoring activities, the gaps in the
previous training should be assessed. Accordingly, based on these identified gaps, it is
proposed that additional measures be provided to address these gaps, as guide to good
practices in ensuring compliance by Contractors to the environmental regulatory measures.
On this note the assistance of an international environmental specialist will be useful. The
matter of capability and capacity building on the part of the ESS should form part of the
proposed Terms of Reference of the international environment specialist who will conduct the
ESS/district ARS training and orientation for contractors. The following are the basic scope of
the international environment specialist among others:

         Assess the capacity of the ESS and district ARS and determine the specific additional
          training needs to respond to the requirements in conducting environmental monitoring
          and implementation of mitigation measures of road projects;

         Prepare a short-term staff training prospectus and associated materials to meet
          immediate needs;

         Undertake training workshops that will include the following topics:


                                                             17

               Establishment of baseline data at the start of the project for reckoning project
                environmental impacts.

               Preparation of EMPs and incorporation of the mitigating measures in contract
                documents and specifications for Consulting Services and Works contracts;

               Procedures for monitoring the implementation of mitigating measures including
                target parameters, frequency, responsibilities and means of monitoring;

               Health and safety procedures in project implementation.

         Conduct orientation/workshop for contractors on construction-related environmental
          issues on road projects, implementation of mitigation measures and monitoring, and
          preparation of monitoring reports;

         Evaluate the effectiveness of the training measuring improvements in attitudes and skills
          achieved through a combination of feedback questionnaires and performance
          evaluation; and

         Prepare outline proposals for the longer-term organizational and capability development
          of ESS and district ARS.

A typical ESS/ARS staff training will consist of lecture-type presentation of the general
procedure and requirements for effective environmental monitoring. This will be followed by a
more detailed on-the-job and hands-on training at the construction site where the trainees will
participate in the activities of the international environmental specialist/construction supervision
staff in reviewing the contractor’s reports, periodic monitoring inspections, and deliberation of
environmental issues involving the contractor and the project stakeholders, and finally the
accomplishment of environmental reports. The field trainings should coincide with peak work
activity at the site to provide a first-hand observation of the following environmental issues:

         Erosion and slope stability issues;
         Discharges to water bodies;
         Disturbance on biodiversity;
         Dust suppression;
         Exhaust emissions;
         Noise abatement measures;
         Protection against oil spillage;
         Quarry, borrow pits and asphalt plant operations;
         Site health and safety, sanitary facilities, etc.;
         Public safety, traffic management, child safety, etc.
         Documentation in dealing with public complaints and conflict resolution.
