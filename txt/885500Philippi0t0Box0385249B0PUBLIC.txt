I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:

       Assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in the
        Philippines perceive the Bank;

       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in the Philippines regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in the Philippines;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank in the Philippines;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank ’s effectiveness and results, knowledge
               and research, and communication and information sharing in the Philippines; and
            Perceptions of the World Bank’s future role in the Philippines.

       Use data to help inform the Philippines country team’s strategy.



II. Methodology
In October and November 2012, 1,536 stakeholders of the World Bank in the Philippines were
invited to provide their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a
country survey. Participants in the survey were drawn from among civil society organizations
(NGOs, community-based organizations, faith-based organizations, academia/think tanks, and
trade unions); donors (bilateral or multilateral development agencies); government (House of
Representatives member or staff, Senate member or staff, judicial branch official or staff, local
government unit officials or staff, national executive branch officials or staff, and project
management units (PMUs) for a World Bank-supported project official or staff); government-
owned corporation or financial institution official or staff; the media (press, radio, TV, web,
etc.); and the private sector (banks/financial sector, private organizations or business, and
consultants or contractors). A total of 328 stakeholders participated in the country survey (21%).
Respondents received questionnaires via courier, post, or email and returned it accordingly.
Respondents were asked about: general issues facing the Philippines, their overall attitudes
toward the Bank; the World Bank’s effectiveness and results; the Bank’s knowledge; working
with the World Bank; the Bank’s future role in the Philippines, and the Bank’s communication
and information sharing.

Every country that engages in the Country Survey must include specific indicator questions that
will be aggregated for the Bank’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions are identified
throughout the survey report.

A. Background Information: Respondents were asked to describe their current organization and
   identify their specialization, with which agency within the World Bank Group they primarily
   work, their exposure to the Bank in the Philippines, and their geographic location.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. General Issues facing the Philippines: Respondents were asked to indicate whether the
   Philippines was headed in the right or wrong direction, the most important development
   priorities, and which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty and generating
   economic growth in the Philippines.
C. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with the World Bank (IBRD/IDA) and IFC, the World Bank and IFC’s effectiveness in the
   Philippines, World Bank and IFC staff preparedness, agreement with various statements
   regarding the Bank’s work, and the extent to which the Bank is an effective development
   partner. Respondents were also asked to indicate the sectoral areas on which it would be most
   productive for the Bank to focus its resources, the Bank’s greatest values and greatest
   weaknesses in its work, the most effective instruments in helping to reduce poverty in the
   Philippines, and how they attribute slow or failed reform efforts.
D. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the Bank’s level of
   effectiveness across twelve key development areas in the Philippines, the extent to which the
   Bank’s work helps achieve sustainable development results in the Philippines, and the extent
   to which the World Bank Group meets the Philippines’ need for financial instruments,
   knowledge services, and financial products.
E. The World Bank’s Knowledge: Respondents were asked to indicate how frequently they
   consult Bank knowledge and research in the work they do and to rate the effectiveness and
   quality of the Bank’s knowledge and research, including how significant a contribution it
   makes to development results and its technical quality.
F. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
   a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as the World Bank ’s
   “Safeguard Policy” requirements being reasonable and the Bank disbursing funds promptly.
G. The Future Role of the World Bank in the Philippines: Respondents were asked to rate how
   significant a role the Bank should play in the Philippines’ development in the near future and
   how effectively the different agencies within the World Bank Group collaborate.
   Respondents were also asked to indicate what the Bank should do to make itself of greater
   value in the Philippines.
H. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the Bank, their access to the Internet, their usage and evaluation of the
   Bank’s websites, and their usage and evaluation of the Bank’s KDCs and online resource
   centers. Respondents were asked about their awareness of the Bank’s and IFC’s Access to
   Information policies, past information requests from the Bank, and their level of agreement
   that they use more data from the World Bank as a result of the Bank’s Open Data policy.
   Respondents were also asked to indicate their level of agreement that they know how to find
   information from the Bank and that the Bank is responsive to information requests.
In addition, when possible, responses from respondents completing this year’s country survey
were compared to responses from the 148 respondents (54% response rate) who completed the
survey in FY 2005 and the 337 respondents (22% response rate) who completed the survey in FY
2009. Notations and/or charts are included when these comparisons were possible.

       There were significant stakeholder group differences in their ratings of the Bank’s
        effectiveness across several of these development areas.

             Respondents from PMUs had the highest ratings for the Bank’s effectiveness at
              “Helping in disaster risk management and climate change mitigation and
              adaptation” and “Helping promote good governance and anticorruption in
              Government” whereas respondents from other organizations had significantly
              lower ratings.

             Respondents from PMUs had the highest ratings for the Bank’s effectiveness at
              “Helping promote stability, peace and development in conflict-affected areas”

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness

To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve sustainable development results in the Philippines, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twelve specific areas of
effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve sustainable
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help a chieve sustainable
development results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of
effectiveness in one specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s
overall effectiveness or perceptions of the Bank ’s ability to help achieve sustainable
development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in the Philippines.
             The areas determined to be key drivers of the World Bank’s (IBRD/IDA) overall
                effectiveness from these analyses were:
                o The World Bank Group’s effectiveness at “Helping improve the delivery of
                    basic services, such as education, health, water and sanitation” and “Helping
                    promote good governance and anticorruption in Government ”.
             The areas determined to be key drivers of the IFC’s overall effectiveness from
                these analyses were:
                o The World Bank Group’s effectiveness at “Helping improve the delivery of
                    basic services, such as education, health, water and sanitation” and “Helping
                    improve the delivery of basic services in poor areas”.

       Achieving Sustainable Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest
        Pearson Product-Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related
        to perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable development results in the
        Philippines, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of
        perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable development results.
        The areas determined to be key drivers from these analyses were the World Bank
        Group’s effectiveness at:
             “Helping promote access and delivery of financial services”;
             “Helping improve local governance through more effective decentralization” ;
             “Helping build an enabling business environment to promote competitiveness,
                productivity and employment” ; and
             “Helping promote procurement and public financial management reforms in
                Government”.

The World Bank Group is interested in gauging the views of clients and partners who are either involved

Group uses to assess the views of its critical stakeholders. With this understanding, the World Bank
Group hopes to develop more effective strategies, outreach and programs that support development in
the Philippines.

The World Bank Group commissioned an independent firm to oversee the logistics of this effort in the
