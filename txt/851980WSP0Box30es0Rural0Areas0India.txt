    Foreword
    Indian remains one of the countries wherein a lot of efforts are still required to eliminate the practice
    of open defecation. In rural areas, open defecation though reduced in scale continues to be a
    socially and culturally accepted traditional behavior largely. Low awareness of the potential health
    and economic benefits of better sanitation and hygiene practices, perception of high costs of having
    a toilet, the perceived convenience of open defecation are some of the other bottlenecks towards
    achievement of the goal of Open Defecation Free India. Lack of priority to safe confinement and
    disposal of human excreta poses significant health risks manifest in the sanitation challenge facing
    the nation today.

    However, the Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) launched by Government of India in 1999 has gone
    a long way in achieving and sustaining the status of open defecation free Gram Panchayats in rural
    India and ensuring healthy and hygienic environment. The vigorous efforts made under this Campaign
    have helped to achieve rural sanitation coverage to an estimated 70 per cent as of March 2011. The
    campaign has proved to be one of the most effective programme for its focus on community-led,
    demand driven approach, making long term positive impact on the health profiles and quality of lives
    of millions of rural people. The campaign has developed strategic components to ensure full coverage
    of sanitation through financial and programmatic support in software and hardware component of
    household, school, anganwadi and community sanitation.

Foreword



The provision of providing sanitation facilities through public toilet complexes is the most suitable
option for those who cannot afford individual toilets for monetary reasons or due to lack of space and
go for open defecation. Such complexes are useful and valuable option at public places, markets,
taxi stands etc. where large congregation of people takes place. The Community Sanitary Complex
(CSCs) fosters the cognitive development of healthy sanitation practices in the community. The TSC
recognizes Community Sanitary Complexes as one of the options to reduce open defecation and
has provision of a maximum unit cost of 2 lakh for construction of CSC, where the sharing pattern
amongst Central Government, State Government and the community is in the ratio of 60:30:10.
However besides financial resources, technical and management advice are also required for effective
construction and maintenance of Community Sanitary Complexes. This is important because lack of
adequate knowledge for construction, operation and maintenance, may render such facilities unusable
and non-functional.

The Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation has been continuously updating technical notes
on rural sanitation to reinforce the quality of interventions. The Handbook on ‘Establishment and
Management of Community Sanitary Complexes in Rural Areas’ gives very useful insight on the
planning, construction, operation and maintenance of sanitary toilet complexes in a sustainable way.
The manual is intended primarily for programme implementers to help them understand the critical
need for Community Sanitary Complexes and inform them of the guiding principles to be adopted
while planning for CSCs. The scope of this document has been made comprehensive by including
several aspects like safe disposal or reuse of human waste from toilet complexes and extensive
guidance on different options for toilet designs with indicative costs. The manual encompasses both
technological and management aspects of CSCs and will be of specific interest to Gram Panchayat
representatives, village level motivators and village level sanitation committees etc. who are entrusted
with the responsibility for planning for sanitation facilities at the village level.

This is a result of excellent term work and synergy of contributions from professionals who have
worked tirelessly in developing this technical note, ably assisted by WSP-SA. I wish to place on
record our deep appreciation of this effort and hope that this document will be immensely useful as a
Reference Manual.

       Box 1:
       Some Important Points to be considered before Implementing Sanitary Toilet Complexes in
       Rural Areas

       •	   They are expensive to build; sometimes the cost can run into lakhs of rupees depending on the number
            of toilet seats!
       •	   O&M of these facilities if often a challenge and need to be planned properly upfront and thereafter
            monitored regularly. Since it is a public property, users fail to maintain it with the same care as with
            individual toilets. Therefore, at the implementation stage, active involvement of the community to
            undertake maintenance should be assured.
       •	   These facilities need to be maintained – there should be some person or institution responsible for its
            maintenance; this caretaker who will maintain the facility needs to be paid. In addition, the maintenance
            of the facility involves other costs, like water, cleaning material, etc., all of which will incur regular costs.
       •	   Also, someone should monitor the maintenance regularly.  This system has to be put in place by
            creating awareness and motivation among the local communities, to inculcate the habit of use and
            ownership of the toilet complex by the community.
       So community or public toilets should be constructed only when all other options such as individual
       or shared toilets are not possible.

       CASE STUDY: Community Involvement in Planning, Implementation and Maintenance of
       Village Sanitary Infrastructure

       Dhamner village in Satara district of Maharashtra is an example of community involvement in total sanitation
       and waste water management. The village has 550 residential houses spread over a main village and
       three hamlets. In the year 2000, residents of Dhamner came together under a dynamic leader and decided
       to undertake measures to manage individual and community waste water with the goal of a cleaner and
       healthier village. Government functionaries acted as facilitators while villagers were encouraged to decide
       take a decision on and set up sanitation facilities at their own expense. Dhamner residents were thus
       motivated for towards overall development of the village which has resulted in total sanitation coverage of
       the village as well as an efficient and low-cost system of waste management.    
       At the Gram Sabha, villagers of Dhamner decided to take measures to hygienically and productively
       manage sullage. It was decided to construct partially-covered roadside drains and use Reinforced Cement
       Concrete (RCC) pipes where necessary. It was made mandatory for each house to connect their its
       domestic waste water to the community drain. A chamber was provided between the house and the main
       drain, and a grid placed at each opening between the main drain and a household connection to stop
       materials like such as paper and plastics from entering the drainage system. The sullage is collected at four
       low-lying points. The stabiliszed effluent has been utiliszed for to water a children’s park and playground,
       and developing horticultural gardens and orchards.

       Individual connections to the drains are maintained by the families and the community drainage system by
       the Gram Panchayat. For the last four years, the Gram Panchayat has not needed to spend any money for
       on maintenance. The park and horticultural gardens are maintained by women’s self help groupsSHGs and
       a youth club.

       For the initial construction of the system, the total capital expenditure was Rs. 9,46,000. A part of this was
       raised from contributions and voluntary laborlabour by the local people. A major share was provided from
       the Rajya Sabha member’s discretionary fund. The village Panchayat is expecting earnings from the sale of
       the produce of the orchards as well.

       Dhamner is an example of what can be achieved when there is community involvement, collective efforts
       and dynamic leadership with the government acting as a facilitator. The technology used is low-cost, easily
       manageable and environment-friendly. In recognition of its achievements, Dhamner village Panchayat
       received the Nirmal Gram Puraskar, a national award for clean environment, in 2005.

       Box 3:
       Types of Cost

       Capital costs are the expenses, which are incurred only once to make the facility operational and ready for
       use such as land, construction labour and materials, construction supervision, etc.

       Operating costs mean the expenses incurred in running of the facility on a daily basis such as cleaning,
       cost of water and soap, etc.

       Maintenance costs refer to the costs needed to keep the technology in proper working condition such as
       repair works, pipe and drain cleaning, etc.

     6. Technology Options for Sanitary
     Toilet Complexes
     A sanitary toilet complex has two key            6.1	 Toilet Seat with Superstructure
     components:
                                                      Toilet seat: The toilet seat consists invariably of
     1.	 Toilet seat with superstructure; and         a toilet pan and a water seal or S trap. The pan is
     2.	Disposal system for human waste.              a squatting pan having with a slope of about 28-
                                                      290 , same as those used for household toilets.
     Figure 2 A: An S trap or water seal              The S trap has a (a) water seal of 20 mm, or less
                                                      requiring 1.5 to 2 litre of water to flush human
                                                      waste per use of the toilet. The pan and trap may
                                                      be of ceramic or fibre/plastic. The fibre/plastic
                                                      pan and trap are useful in certain situations, such
                                                      as rural areas, due to light weight, lower cost,
                                                      longer life, resistance against breakage and ease
                                                      of transportation.

                                                     Number of seats: The number of seats in a
                                                     toilet complex is determined by the approximate
                                                     number of users per day ; 40 users per seat is
                                                     the optimum. The required required number of
                                                     seats for a sanitary toilet complex in a village can
                                                     be estimated accordingly.
                                                     Usually, the ratio of seats for man and women
