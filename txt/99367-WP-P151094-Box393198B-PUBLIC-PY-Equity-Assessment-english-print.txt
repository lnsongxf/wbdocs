solated by nature and recovering from a period of historically slow growth during the 1980s and 1990s, Para-
guay has faced many economic and social challenges at the beginning of the 21st century. By the year 2000, gross
domestic product (GDP) per capita was only 50 percent of the Latin American average and 34 percent of the average
Paraguay’s MERCOSUR partners. High rates of poverty and inequality were an inherent characteristic of the country.

Summary


Isolated by nature and recovering from a period of historically slow growth during the 1980s and 1990s, Paraguay has
faced many economic and social challenges in the early 21st century. The high rates of poverty and inequality were an
inherent characteristic of the country. By 2003, a little less than half of Paraguayans were in moderate poverty and one
in five in extreme poverty.

However, between 2003 and 2013, Paraguay performed well and achieved a reduction in the monetary and non-mone
tary poverty. GDP grew by 33 percent, moderate poverty reached 24 percent, while extreme poverty affects only 10
percent of the total population. This was the result of a period of substantive average growth, though favoring more
the poorest, particularly since 2011.

This report explores the factors associated with the improvements observed in the welfare and inequality and inves-
tigates the challenges to sustainability, taking into account Paraguay’s historical structural problems in sustaining
growth and improving social indicators.

The conceptual framework of the report is based on a tripartite definition of equity: mobility out of poverty, fairness,
and agency. According to this framework, the report explores the following specific sets of questions:

1. 	      How can be explained the limited effect of the reduction of the extreme poverty until 2011 and the recent
reversal of this relationship? What has been the role of labor markets and public and private transfers in this process?

2. 	    How the conditions at birth determined the access of the Paraguayans to basic services and opportunities
throughout your life? What is the state’s role to reverse this situation through the provision of social services?

3. 	    What are the challenges of autonomy and voice, especially among women, which prevent people to not have
the elements to make effective decisions about their own development?

to the strengthening of agency, the capacity of peo-

has made progress over the last decade in promoting
women’s empowerment and gender equality. The im-
provements have been particularly good in women’s en-
dowment in terms of sexual and health indicators, as well
as educational attainment and achievement. There have
also been important advances in the legal framework to
provide for gender equality. However, challenges remain
in youth unemployment and job quality and segmenta-

Conclusions
                                                                                                                            11
Paraguay has made substantial progress in the last
decade in improving welfare and reducing inequali-
ty. There is reason for optimism especially because of the
enhanced labor productivity in agriculture and improved
employment opportunities, which hints at the potential
for long-lasting transformations.

Still, the country faces challenges that threaten the
sustainability of these improvements. A key obsta-
cle is the fact that a large share of the population faces
a volatile economic environment. Another area of con-
cern relates to the persistent lack of opportunity across
all groups. Even though income inequality has narrowed,
problems in the structural determinants of inequity re-
main. Finally, the relevance of strengthening agency and
autonomy, particularly in the participation of women in
markets, communities, and relationships, is at the core of
an equitable society.

To reduce structural inequities in monetary and non-
monetary outcomes, the relevant structural deter-
minants must be addressed. This will require the pro-
motion of well-functioning and accessible markets that
are able to provide all segments of the population with

      Box 1. Food prices and the extreme poverty rate


     In 2006-11, food price inflation outpaced overall inflation resulting in higher extreme poverty (figure B1.1). Fixed
     through the traditional approach to the measurement of income poverty, the extreme poverty line is set according to a
     basket of basic food items as determined using the 1997/98 household income and expenditure survey. The value of the
     basket is adjusted annually according to the increase in the food consumer price index (CPI, in Asunción; constructed by
     the Central Bank of Paraguay). Therefore, increases in food prices in the past decade, which were larger than the rise in the
     price of the overall basket, led to a sizable appreciation in the extreme poverty line, which climbed almost 30 percent, from
     ₲270,000 in 2003 to ₲343,000 in 2011 (both expressed in 2011 prices).

     If food prices had increased at the same rate as overall inflation, poverty would have fallen substantially between 2006 and
     2007, from 20.7 to 17.6 percent; it actually fell by less than one percentage point (figure B1.2), that is, gains in the income of
     the poorest were largely absorbed by the rise in the price of the basic food basket. Because the poorest spend most of their
     budgets on food, this captures not merely a mathematical relationship, but an actual stagnation in the food purchasing
     ability of the poorest. Because food prices remained relatively high, poverty hovered around 18 percent between 2008 and
     2011, roughly 5 percentage points higher than it would otherwise have been. In 2012 and 2013, however, food price infla-
     tion fell and closely tracked the overall CPI (figure B1.2). As a result, 2012 and 2013 saw important drops in extreme poverty
     because the income gains among the poorest overtook the increase in food prices.

     Box 2. Productivity gains over the past decade


     In three of the most important sectors of employment (agriculture, manufacturing, and construction), employment
     elasticity was lower in 2007–11 than it had been in 2003–07, suggesting that there was a rise in productivity (figure
     B2.1]. Positive employment elasticity indicates that, on average, increased output is associated with increased employment.
     However, an elasticity of less than 1 indicates that output is growing more quickly than employment, which is attributable
     to a rise in productivity or rises in product prices. Employment elasticity of less than 1 was characteristic of agriculture in
     both periods, suggesting that recent gains in agricultural output were being driven by productivity (or price) gains rather
     than higher employment. While manufacturing and construction gains in the first period were associated with important
     increases in employment, the elasticities in the second period suggest that there were productivity gains and, as a result, a
     relative decline in the demand for labor.

     While recent employment and output trends suggest there was greater labor productivity, Paraguay’s level of total
     factor productivity is relatively low (figure B2.2). In 2011, Paraguay’s total factor productivity was 35 percent of that of
     the United States, showing a slight rise from the low of 31 percent in 2000; this is comparable with the total factor produc-
     tivity of Bolivia (38 percent), but lower than Brazil’s (43 percent) and Uruguay’s (56 percent).

    throughout Latin America. In the majority of countries in the region (10 of the 18 selected), minimum wages are 4 or 5
    percent of per capita GDP (figure B3.1). There are a number of outliers, including Mexico, where the minimum wage is 1
    percent of per capita GDP; El Salvador and Uruguay, at 2 percent; and Guatemala and Honduras, at 10 and 19 percent,
    respectively. A proposed increase of 25 percent in Paraguay, would raise the minimum wage there to 7 percent of the GDP
    per capita in 2012, pushing the minimum wage slightly higher relative to most Latin American countries.

firms (mostly covered by minimum wage legislation) and
workers with more employment uncertainty who may
transition from tenuous employment situations (unem-
ployment and self-employment) to microenterprises.

The persistence of unemployment is particularly
alarming: one in five of the unemployed in 2010-12                                                                                            41
were unemployed one year later (figure 45). This indi-
cates that part of the population was experiencing either
chronic or frequent spells of unemployment. Additional-
ly, a large proportion of the unemployed exited the labor
force one year later, potentially as discouraged workers.
This tendency was less apparent after 2010, when over a
third of the unemployed dropped out of the labor force.
By 2013, only 20 percent of those who had been em-
ployed the previous year had exited the labor force. The
most likely outcome among the formerly unemployed is
employment in small firms. While less than a third of the
unemployed in 2010 reported they were wage employed
in small firms a year later, more than half of those who
had been unemployed the previous year were working in
small firms by 2013.

In sum, through increased employment opportunities
and higher earnings, labor markets played an import-
ant role in reducing the incidence of both extreme and
moderate poverty in urban areas. The challenges remain
twofold: self-employment and unemployment are still
prevalent among the least well off, who are thus exposed
to fluctuations in the economy and largely untouched by
minimum wage legislation. In addition, despite the trend
observed throughout the decade of rising employment

     ing social expenditures relevant to the delivery of goods
     and services. Third, although the Social Cabinet has been
     strengthening coordination among social service delivery
     agencies, there is still lack of efficient fiscal, strategic, and
     management coordination among executive agencies,
     departments, and municipalities, and there is no quality
     control over the delivery process. Finally, the civil service
     system is weak. This weakness is expressed in high turn-
     over rates among public servants and the absence of a
     formal training system, resulting in substantial instability
     across public servant positions and a shortage of profes-
     sional skills. Meanwhile, the number of public employ-
     ees has risen considerably in the last seven years; almost
     70,000 public sector jobs were included in the budget for
     centralized and decentralized public agencies. This rep-
     resents an overall 32 percent expansion (figure 53).

     Box 4. Teenage pregnancy and lack of agency: Key results from a mixed-methods study in Paraguay


     A mixed-method study was conducted in 2012–13 on risk factors and social circumstances related to adolescent
     parenthood in Paraguay.a For the qualitative component, the study consisted of semistructured in-depth interviews and
     mini focus groups, and, for the quantitative component, a standardized survey among 1,000 boys and girls in the target
     age-group of 15–19 years. The goal of the study was

     1) to gather comprehensive information about perceptions, attitudes, knowledge, values, and concerns
     2) to illuminate on essential contextual information such as peer effects and cultural and social norms

     The study found that lower levels of agency and agency enablers such as aspirations and empowerment are
     associated with a higher risk of becoming a teenage mother. Thus, a girl may become pregnant because she lacks the
     capacity to take control over her life projects; instead, life (including pregnancy) simply happens to her. Furthermore, the
     surroundings within which adolescent mothers grow up may not provide them with positive role models to help them
     identify concrete educational and occupational goals or the steps necessary to achieve these goals. Additionally, social
     norms may favor the passivity women within relationships, communities, and society, which, in itself, is contrary to the
     exercise of agency. Finally, multiple factors within relationships and the community may disempower young girls, thereby
     hindering them from making decisions and engaging in the necessary steps to implement these decisions.

     Both the qualitative and the quantitative parts of the study showed that one of the key constraints facing teenage
     mothers in making meaningful choices and making decisions to shape their own future is related to the capac-
     ity of these girls to aspire. With regard to the quality and the remuneration of the jobs they will be performing in the
     coming decade, adolescent mothers have lower expectations than their peers who do not have children in adolescence.
     When they were asked about their educational aspirations, the adolescent mothers interviewed for the study generally
     agreed that education is important, but this appreciation was generic: their recognition of the value of education was not
     accompanied by a clear plan of the concrete steps they would have to take to improve their own educational outcomes.
52
     Furthermore, when asked about their visions for their own lives, they expressed little clarity in general, and they had
     identified no concrete mechanisms that were available to them so they could shape their own future. This lack of control
     over their life projects is reflected in their pregnancies: the in-depth interviews conducted during the study showed that
     pregnancy was neither completely intended nor completely unintended in the vast majority of cases. Most interviewees
     did not mention an explicit, conscious motivation for pregnancy; at the same time, pregnancy does not seem to interrupt
     careers or planned life paths. Thus, pregnancy occurred without the majority of the girls showing signs of control over or
     conscious decision making about this important life event.

     Context-related factors can limit or strengthen agency among adolescent girls. Not only the family environment,
     but also peers and society influence the way adolescent girls see themselves, how they imagine themselves in the
     future, and if and how they are enabled to make meaningful decisions regarding their present and their future.
     Aspirations are also shaped by observation. Thus, compared with their nonpregnant peers, a smaller share of adolescent
     mothers said their families provided them with some form of role model (89 percent versus 75 percent).c Similarly, sever-
     al results from the qualitative and quantitative components of the study indicate that role models for teenage mothers are
     not common among their peers. Teenage mothers are more likely to know male peers that engage in risky behavior, such
     as violence and gang activities, compared with girls who are not mothers. Teenage mothers also reported that their friend
     groups had earlier sexual debuts. Gender norms can limit the options of individuals in terms of behavior, occupations,
     and roles, for example. The survey shows that teenage mothers agree with gender stereotypes more often compared with
     their peers who are not mothers.d
Box 4. Teenage pregnancy and lack of agency: Key results from a mixed-methods study in Paraguay


Girls in several social and cultural contexts lack the power to influence the behavior of others, which can turn
them into passive figures in relationships, in families, or in communities. Limitations in access to information are
motivated to a much greater extent by constraints such as fear, economic issues, and shame among teenage mothers
relative to girls who are not mothers: 40 percent of teenage mothers declared these to be the reasons they did not access
relevant information compared with 29 percent of girls who were not mothers. This suggests that adolescent mothers are
not sufficiently empowered to receive the information they need and want, while girls who are not mothers lack access
mostly because of choice (no necessity or no interest were the more common responses). Access to accurate and com-
plete information is an essential basis for decision making.e Finally, the average age gap between teenage mothers and
their partners (if the girls are in relationships) was twice the corresponding age gap among girls who were not mothers
(six years versus three). Significant age gaps can result in greater constraints on women’s decision making as a result of
the power imbalances within the couple. Some adolescent mothers also depended financially on their partners, and sev-
eral interviewees mentioned that their decision-making capacity was limited by their partners. A larger share of teenage
mothers reported some form of controlling behavior by their partners (47 percent among girls who were not mothers
versus 76 percent among teenage mothers).

a. The study was implemented by the Sociedad de Estudios Rurales y Cultura Popular, led by Daniel Campos Ruiz Díaz, María Celsy Benavidez,
and Pedro Amado de Llamas Granada.

b. Following López-Calva and Cord (2013), the study groups enablers of agency as follows: (1) enablers internal to individuals (aspirations,
self-drive, and so on), (2) context-related environmental enablers (norms, informal and formal sector institutions that enable or prevent one
from acting), and (3) external empowerment (economic, political, and other conditions that help society act to further the appropriate rights and
interests of the individual). The results described here are correlations; they do not show causal effects.

c. Teenage mothers are more likely to have witnessed psychological violence between their parents such as screaming and insults: 31 percent of
teenage mothers report this behavior by their parents versus 23 percent of notpregnant teenagers.

d. Teenage mothers responded to the following statements in a way that reflected gender stereotypes: women should not work, but should be
devoted to the home and the children; the man should be the economic provider of the household; men should not cry; university education is             53
more important for men than women; if jobs are scarce, men have more right to the available jobs compared with women; men are generally
better political leaders compared with women; and to be a man, it is necessary to have at least one child; to be a woman, it is necessary to have
at least one child. Teenage mothers also tended to respond in a more biased manner to statements that reflected traditional gender stereotypes
with regard to sexual behavior, such as female submission and male domination. The survey included the following statements: the woman not
the man should use contraception during sex; condoms are difficult to use; people who use condoms have frequent sex with lots of people; I feel
ashamed to buy contraceptives; my partner does not like to use condoms; the majority of men do not like to use condoms; it is not necessary to
use condoms if one knows one’s partner; if I use a condom, my partner will be suspicious of me; if a girl goes out with a boy for a long time and
does not want to have sexual relations, she does not love him; the majority of my friends have lost their virginity; if my first sexual experience is
(or was) much later in life than the first sexual experiences of my friends, they will make fun of me; for a woman, losing one’s virginity is an act
of love.

e. The effective use of contraceptives is an important factor in a woman’s control over her own body and fertility. Teenage mothers show lower
self-efficacy in contraceptive use in their current relationships compared with girls who are not mothers: 66 percent of girls who were not moth-
ers said they were either very or somewhat secure that they would not have sexual intercourse if their partners did not want to use any birth
control method, compared with 55 percent of teenage mothers.

Third Pillar: Strengthening agency
•	   Policies to expand women’s opportunities in the labor
     market will reduce labor gaps (employment, earnings,
     and quality) and will also enhance women’s agency,
     self-esteem, and aspirations.                             59

a.	 Strengthen and expand systems that support wom-
    en’s inclusion in the labor market through, for in-
    stance, access to childcare and professional training.

b.	 Improve labor conditions in woman-dominated sec-
    tors, such as domestic services, by formalizing the ac-
    tivities, introducing a minimum wage, and promoting
    social security payments for pensions and health in-
    surance.

c.	 Empowering girls through the promotion of life skills
    training and raising expectations through career de-
    velopment and activities likely to enhance aspirations
    and agency among girls and boys, through, for in-
    stance, youth mentoring programs.

d.	 Mitigation efforts to ameliorate the effect of adoles-
    cent childbearing in the short run can include support
    for teenage mothers through access to alternative
    school schedules and childcare to reduce dropout
    rates.
