2   IDA MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: MARCH 31, 2014
Introduction
This document should be read in conjunction with the International Development Association’s (IDA)
financial statements and management’s discussion and analysis issued for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013.
IDA undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statements. Box1 provides IDA’s selected
financial data as of and for the nine months ended March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2013 as well as for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2013.

I.       Organizational Overview and Business Model
IDA is an international organization established in 1960 and is owned by its member countries. It is the largest
multilateral channel for providing concessional financing to the world’s poorest countries. With its overarching
goals to reduce poverty and promote shared prosperity, IDA plays a pivotal role in the global aid architecture
and agenda. IDA pursues these goals by providing concessional development credits, development grants and
guarantees to its recipient member countries for programs and operations that help meet development needs. It
provides technical assistance (including through reimbursable advisory services), policy advice, and global
knowledge services through economic sector work and country studies. IDA supports member countries with
disaster risk financing and insurance to help increase their financial resilience against natural disasters, as part
of their broader disaster risk management agenda. In addition, IDA also provides or facilitates financing
through trust fund partnerships with bilateral and multilateral donors.

The resources available to IDA for funding its lending activities constitute its commitment authority. IDA
finances its development credit, development grant and guarantee commitments primarily from contributions
from partner countries, funds from its internal resources, as well as transfers from IBRD’s net income, and
grants designated out of IFC’s retained earnings. Since IDA’s lending is highly concessional, its resources are
periodically replenished. Since its inception, IDA’s resources have been replenished sixteen times,
complemented by an additional replenishment agreed to in 2006 for financing the Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative (MDRI). Details of the Sixteenth Replenishment of IDA’s Resources (IDA16) are provided in Chart
1.
In December 2013, a global coalition of 46 developed and developing country partners pledged contributions
towards the estimated USD Eq. $52 billion lending envelope of the Seventeenth Replenishment of IDA’s
Resources (IDA17), which runs from July 1, 2014 to June 30, 2017. The International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development (IBRD) and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) are expected to provide close to $3
billion towards the IDA17 lending envelope.

II.      Resource Allocation
IDA’s lending, grant financing and guarantee activities are funded by partner and internal resources, and
transfers and grants from affiliated organizations. These key activities are presented and discussed below.
Sources of Funds
Partner Resources (Subscriptions and Contributions): IDA finances its new commitments for development
credits and development grants primarily through partner resources. The partner resources are in the form of
subscriptions and contributions with assigned voting rights.
Internal Resources: These comprise contractual principal repayments (including any accelerated repayments
and voluntary prepayments), interest income on blend credits and income from the investment portfolio.
Transfers and Grants from affiliated organizations and trust funds: These are primarily transfers from
IBRD’s net income and grants from IFC’s retained earnings.
Applications of Funds
Disbursement of development credits and grants: Through its development operations, IDA’s development
credits, development grants and guarantees benefit the poorest and least creditworthy members.
Administrative Expenses
IDA’s policy is to maintain its service and commitment charges at a level that will cover its administrative
expenses. Commitment charges are set annually and take into account the extent to which service and certain

                                                           IDA MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: MARCH 31, 2014    3
           interest charges, and partner compensation for development grant financing and forgone charges on
           development credits forgiven under the Heavily Indebted Poor Country Initiative (HIPC) and the MDRI, cover
           administrative expenses. Management is currently undertaking an expenditure review to help identify how
           resources can be redirected to more effectively support the World Bank Group strategy1.

           Commitment Authority
           Chart 1 provides a breakdown of the principal sources making up the total lending envelope under the revised
           IDA16 Commitment Authority Framework and the extent to which these sources have been used for
           commitments of development credits, grants and guarantees through March 31, 2014.
           With three months remaining under IDA16, cumulative commitments made under IDA16 as of March 31,
           2014 amounted to approximately 88% of the IDA16 available resources. Any unused resources under the
           IDA16 commitment authority are expected to be rolled over into the IDA17 commitment authority.

           In billions of U.S. dollars equivalent




           a. Commitment Authority is measured and monitored in SDR. The chart represents the U.S. dollar equivalent amounts for presentational
               purposes only, which is based on IDA16 foreign exchange reference rate of USD/SDR 1.50233. Actual commitments are recorded based on
               historical USD rates.
           b. Amounts may not add due to rounding.
           c. Includes U.S.dollar equivalent 5.3 billion of partner commitments for compensation of debt relief provided under MDRI.
           d. IDA16 guarantee commitments to date totaled $708 million, of which only 25% ($177 million) is used for the purposes of the Commitment
               Authority.




           III.        Basis of Reporting
           IDA prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
           States of America (U.S. GAAP), referred to in this document as the “reported basis”. The financial statements
           provide a basis upon which users are able to analyze IDA’s sources and uses of resources. Under the reported
           basis, IDA’s Statement of Income does not reflect the true economic results of IDA due to a number of
           asymmetries, which are explained in detail in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) for the
           fiscal year ended June 30, 2013.



           IV.         Statement of Activities Analysis
           The Statement of Activities (Table 1) is designed to reflect how IDA manages its sources and applications of
           funds in executing its operating activities, and ensuring that it has sufficient funds available in its investment
           portfolio to conduct its development operations. The Statement of Activities presents the cash flows associated
           with IDA’s operating activities and the impact of these activities on the net asset value of IDA’s investment
           portfolio. This presentation addresses the asymmetries (explained in detail in IDA’s June 30, 2013 MD&A)
           embedded in IDA’s reported basis results.


           1.The other principal institutions of the World Bank Group are the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International Finance
           Corporation (IFC), and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA).

Results from Operating Activities
IDA’s operating activities resulted in a net cash inflow of $601 million for the nine months ended March 31,
2014 (FY14 YTD). This primarily reflects the $5,269 million of cash receipts relating to members’
subscriptions and contributions, $2,504 million of cash receipts relating to principal repayments and $883
million of transfers and grants from affiliated organizations and trust funds, partially offset by $8,461 million
of outflows for disbursements.
Following the results of operating activities, IDA’s core liquidity position as of March 31, 2014 is sufficient to
cover approximately 11 months of average monthly gross disbursements, and remains within the historical
range of 10 to 14 months for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2010 through 2013. See Section VII for more
details on IDA’s core liquidity position.
IDA’s funding position at March 31, 2014 was 79%, the same as that at June 30, 2013. The remaining funding
gap will primarily be covered by future receipts of cash, demand notes already committed by partners and
repayments on outstanding credits. IDA enters into new commitments based on the commitment authority
available. See Section II for further details on IDA’s Commitment Authority.
The following are additional details of the key drivers of IDA’s results from operating activities:
Members’ subscriptions and contributions
The subscriptions and contributions of $5,269 million represent the cash contributions received from members
and the encashment of demand notes. This excludes $205 million of member contributions received to finance
foregone charges for debt relief and development grant financing, which is shown as part of administrative
activities.
Transfers and Grants from Affiliated Organizations and Trust Funds
The third installment of IBRD’s transfer under IDA16 of $621 million was received on October 16, 2013. The
third installment of IFC’s grant under IDA16 of $251 million was received on January 23, 2014.

           Development Credit and Grant Disbursements
           Gross disbursements of development credits and
           grants during FY14 YTD were $8,461 million,                               USD Mns                         Gross Disbursement
           an increase of $1,110 million from FY13 YTD.
           In terms of regional focus, disbursements to                                 FY 14 YTD                  6,804              1,657
           Africa alone increased by $931 million. Africa
           and South Asia together accounted for 77% of                                 FY 13 YTD                 5,978         1,373

           under IDA14 and the remaining 2% related to
           commitments made under earlier
           replenishments.
           The majority of the $284 million increase in development grants disbursed in FY14 YTD as compared to FY13
           YTD was attributable to the Middle East and North Africa and the South Asia regions. This increase
           corresponds with higher grant commitments which increased by $605 million during the same period.


           Administrative Activities
           The increase in administrative expenses, net, of $10 million was primarily due to higher expenses directly
           attributable to IDA, consistent with the increase in IDA’s lending operations.

V.       Balance Sheet Analysis
The principal components of IDA’s balance sheet are development credits outstanding, investment assets net of
related liabilities, and subscriptions and contributions paid-in. Movements in these principal components
between March 31, 2014 and June 30, 2013 are discussed further below.

Development Credits Outstanding and Accumulated Provision for Debt Relief and for Losses on
Development Credits
Development credits outstanding increased by $7,495 million during FY14 YTD, primarily due to net positive
disbursements of $4,233 million and positive translation adjustments of $3,334 million resulting from the 2.8%
appreciation of the SDR against U.S dollar.


Investment Assets, net of related Liabilities
The net investment portfolio increased from $27,487 million as of June 30, 2013 to $28,981 million as of
March 31, 2014. The increase of $1,494 million reflects the net results of IDA’s cash related operating
activities, effects of non operating items (primarily unrealized mark to market gains/losses), and the effects of
movements in exchange rates. See Section IV for variance analysis of operating activities.
Subscriptions and Contributions
The $6,587 million increase in subscriptions and contributions paid-in is primarily attributable to the receipt
from members of $4,780 million of demand notes and $1,452 million of cash contributions along with a
positive translation adjustment of $355 million.

VI.      Financial Risk
IDA is subject to four main types of financial risk: Funding risk, Liquidity risk, Credit risk and Market risk.
Funding Risk is managed using the Commitment Authority Framework and monitored, in part, by the funding
position, see Section II, Resource Allocation and Section VII, Funding and Liquidity Positions.
Liquidity Risk is managed through a combination of cash flow monitoring, timing of partner contributions
and investment policies. IDA’s liquidity position is a key indicator of liquidity management; see Section VII,
Funding and Liquidity Positions.
Credit Risk includes two types: Country credit risk and Commercial credit risk.

                                                                    IDA MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: MARCH 31, 2014   7
           Country credit risk is managed by the IDA Resource Mobilization Department which regularly reviews the
           credit risk of its recipient countries in terms of the country’s debt sustaining capacity. These reviews provide
           an input into the composition of development credits versus grants for new operations.
           Table 4 provides details of the top five borrowers with the largest development credits outstanding as at March
           31, 2014. These borrowers represented 50% of total development credits outstanding as of that date.

           Commercial Credit Risk: The monitoring and managing of this risk is a continuous process due to changing
           market conditions. IDA's commercial counterparty credit risk is concentrated in investments in debt
           instruments issued by sovereign governments, agencies, corporate entities and banks, as shown in Table 5. The
           credit quality of IDA’s portfolio remains concentrated in the upper end of the credit spectrum, with 92% of the
           portfolio rated AA or above, reflecting IDA’s continued preference for highly rated securities and
           counterparties across all categories of financial instruments. Total commercial counterparty credit exposure,
           net of collateral held, was $32.6 billion as of March 31, 2014.

           Market Risk: IDA faces foreign exchange risk with respect to its future partner contributions, which it
           manages by hedging using currency forwards and by rebalancing the currency composition of its investment
           portfolio, and interest rate risk on its investment portfolio which is managed by aligning the duration of the
           investment portfolio with that of the projected net cash requirements. The impact of these strategies is shown
           on IDA’s Statement of Income, however, the economic offset is not reported. Further details on these
           asymmetries can be seen in IDA’s June 30, 2013 MD&A. The analysis below discusses the impact of these
           activities on IDA’s Statement of Income and the economic offset.
           Foreign Exchange Risk
           The payable leg of the currency forward contracts economically hedging partner pledges are denominated in
           non-functional currencies. Appreciation (depreciation) of these currencies against the U.S. dollar results in
           exchange rate losses (gains), which are reported in the Statement of Income.



8   IDA MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: MARCH 31, 2014
The translation adjustment loss on non-functional currencies of $38 million in FY14 YTD was due to the
appreciation of majority of the non-functional currencies against the U.S. dollar. This was offset by the
translation adjustment on the economic offset to the currency forward contracts; the future inflows from
partners, which was a gain of $36 million in FY14 YTD. In FY13 YTD, the significant appreciation of the
non-functional currencies against the U.S. dollar resulted in higher translation adjustment losses of $159
million on the payable leg of the currency forward contracts, offset by translation adjustment gains of $162
million on the flows associated with the economic offset. The differences between the reported translation
adjustments and the related translation adjustments on the economic offsets primarily represent the translation
adjustments on the partner contributions in non-functional currencies that are not hedged.
Interest Rate Risk
The primary objective in the management of IDA’s investment portfolio is to provide a ready source of
liquidity when needed by IDA to meet projected net cash requirements. Accordingly, IDA’s assets are invested
so that their duration closely matches the duration of these projected net cash requirements. Given IDA’s
lengthy disbursement profile, the duration for IDA’s investment portfolio is therefore relatively long. This long
duration, combined with volatility in market interest rates, results in significant year-on-year variability in
unrealized mark-to-market gains/losses on the portfolio. The economic offset to the unrealized mark-to-market
gains/losses on the investment portfolio would be the change in the present value of the projected net cash
outflows.
IDA’s investment portfolio had a duration of approximately three years as of March 31, 2014, and has two
components: core liquidity and partner asset and liability management. During FY14 YTD, the investment
portfolio experienced unrealized mark-to-market losses of $4 million, resulting from the offsetting movements
of the yield curves for the major currencies. In contrast, in FY13 YTD, the investment portfolio experienced
unrealized mark-to-market gains of $112 million due to flattening of the yield curves for all the major
currencies.
The currency forward contracts incurred unrealized mark-to-market losses of $31 million during FY14 YTD,
as compared to losses of $79 million in FY13 YTD, resulting from the more pronounced downward movement
of yield curves of the majority of the payable currencies during FY13 YTD.

VII.     Funding and Liquidity Positions
Management monitors IDA’s funding and liquidity positions to assess IDA’s ability to conduct its operations.
Since IDA does not borrow from the capital markets, even though it is allowed to do so under its Articles of
Agreement, it is important that IDA has sufficient funding resources and liquidity to meet its contractual
obligations to disburse approved development credits and grants in a timely manner.


Funding Position                                         Liquidity Position




As of March 31, 2014, the investment portfolio and       As of March 31, 2014, core liquidity accounted for
unrestricted demand notes covered 79% of all             $10,832 million, comprising short-term and medium-
undisbursed commitments of development credits and       term investments. IDA’s liquidity position was
grants, which is the same when compared with the         sufficient to cover approximately 11 months of
postion as at June 30, 2013.                             average monthly gross disbursements.
IDA’s funding position has been relatively stable for    IDA’s liquidity postion has been relatively stable for
the last four years, ranging from 77% to 81%.            the last four years, ranging from 10 to 14 months of
                                                         average monthly gross disbursements.

NOTES TO CONDENSED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE A—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND RELATED POLICIES
Basis of Preparation
These unaudited condensed quarterly financial statements should be read in conjunction with the June 30, 2013
audited financial statements and notes included therein. The condensed comparative information that has been
derived from the June 30, 2013 audited financial statements has not been audited. In the opinion of management,
the condensed quarterly financial statements reflect all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of IDA’s
financial position and results of operations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (U.S. GAAP).
Management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed quarterly financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in
making those estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. Areas in which significant estimates have
been made include, but are not limited to, the provision for debt relief and losses on development credits and other
exposures, and valuation of certain financial instruments carried at fair value. The results of operations for the first
nine months of the current fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full
year.
Certain reclassifications of the prior year’s information have been made to conform with the current year’s
presentation.
These financial statements were approved for issue on May 12, 2014, which was also the date through which
IDA’s management evaluated subsequent events.
Accounting and Reporting Developments
In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) became law. The Act
seeks to reform the U.S. financial regulatory system by introducing new regulators and extending regulation over
new markets, entities, and activities. The implementation of the Act is dependent on the development of various
rules to clarify and interpret its requirements. As the rules are being developed, IDA continues to assess the impact
on its business. As of March 31, 2014. IDA believes that the Act has not had any significant effect on its business.
In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Disclosures about Offsetting
Assets and Liabilities. The ASU requires entities to disclose both gross information and net information about
instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position, and instruments and
transactions subject to a master netting agreement and agreements similar to master netting agreements.
Subsequently, in January 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-01, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Clarifying the Scope
of Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities, which clarified that the scope of ASU 2011-11 applies to
derivatives accounted for in accordance with Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, including bifurcated embedded
derivatives, as well as repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and
securities lending transactions that are either offset in accordance with US GAAP or subject to an enforceable
master netting arrangement or similar agreement. For IDA, the ASUs were effective from the quarter ended
September 30, 2013, and resulted in additional disclosures which are reflected in Note C-Investments and Note
D-Derivative Instruments.
In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-02 Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reporting of Amounts
Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI). The ASU introduces new presentation
requirements about the amounts reclassified out of AOCI. It requires an entity to present information about the
reclassified amounts by component and to provide additional details about such reclassifications. The ASU does
not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial
statements or which items could be reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income. For IDA, the
new requirements will be effective for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2015. As IDA does not reclassify items from
other comprehensive income to net income, this ASU does not have an impact on its financial statements.

Valuation Methods and Assumptions
Summarized below are the techniques applied in determining the fair values of investments.
Investment securities
Where available, quoted market prices are used to determine the fair value of trading securities. Examples include
futures contracts and most government and agency securities.
For instruments for which market quotations are not available, fair values are determined based on model-based
valuation techniques, whether internally-generated or vendor-supplied, that include the standard discounted cash
flow method using market observable inputs such as yield curves, credit spreads, and prepayment spreads. Where
applicable, unobservable inputs such as constant prepayment rates, probability of default, and loss severity are
used.
Unless quoted prices are available, time deposits are reported at face value which approximates fair value.
Securities purchased under resale agreements, securities sold under repurchase agreements, and securities lent
under securities lending agreements
These securities are of a short term nature and are reported at face value, which approximates fair value.




20 IDA CONDENSED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: MARCH 31, 2014 (UNAUDITED)
Commercial Credit Risk
For the purpose of risk management, IDA is party to a variety of financial transactions, certain of which involve
elements of credit risk. Credit risk exposure represents the maximum potential loss due to possible
nonperformance by obligors and counterparties under the terms of the contracts. For all securities, IDA limits
trading to a list of authorized dealers and counterparties. In addition, credit limits have been established for
counterparties by type of instrument and maturity category.
Swap Agreements: Credit risk is mitigated through a credit approval process, volume limits, monitoring
procedures and the use of mark-to-market collateral arrangements. IDA may require collateral in the form of cash
or other approved liquid securities from individual counterparties to mitigate its credit exposure.
IDA has entered into master derivatives agreements which contain legally enforceable close-out netting
provisions. These agreements may further reduce the gross credit risk exposure related to the swaps. Credit risk
with financial assets subject to a master derivative arrangement is further reduced under these agreements to the
extent that payments and receipts with the counterparty are netted at settlement. The reduction in exposure as a
result of these netting provisions can vary due to the impact of changes in market conditions on existing and new
transactions. The extent of the reduction in exposure may therefore change substantially within a short period of
time following the balance sheet date. For more information on netting and offsetting provisions, see note D –
Derivative Instruments.
Securities Lending: IDA may engage in securities lending and repurchases, against adequate collateral, as well as
securities borrowing and reverse repurchases (resales) of government and agency obligations and ABS.
These transactions have been conducted under legally enforceable master netting arrangements, which allow IDA
to reduce its gross credit exposure related to these transactions. For Balance Sheet presentation purposes, IDA
presents its securities lending and repurchases, as well as resales, on a gross basis. As of March 31, 2014, amounts
which could potentially be offset as a result of legally enforceable master netting arrangements were $467 million
($251 million-June 30, 2013).
Transfers of securities by IDA to counterparties are not accounted for as sales as the accounting criteria for the
treatment as a sale have not been met. Counterparties are permitted to repledge these securities until the repurchase
date.

The following is a summary of the carrying amount of the securities transferred under repurchase or securities
lending agreements, and the related liabilities, as of March 31, 2014 and June 30, 2013:

As of March 31, 2014, the liabilities relating to securities transferred under repurchase or securities lending
agreements did not include any repurchase agreement trade that had not settled at that date as there were no such
trades ($344 million—June 30, 2013). The entire amount of $344 million in June 30, 2013 represented
replacement trades entered into in anticipation of maturing trades.
In the case of resale agreements, IDA receives collateral in the form of liquid securities and is permitted to
repledge these securities. While these transactions are legally considered to be true purchases and sales, the
securities received are not recorded on IDA’s balance sheet as the accounting criteria for treatment as a sale have
not been met. As of March 31, 2014, securities purchased under resale agreements included $1,032 million of
securities which had not settled at that date. For the remaining purchases, IDA received securities with a fair value
of $867 million ($465 million—June 30, 2013). Out of this amount, $21 million of these securities had been
transferred under repurchase or securities lending agreements (Nil—June 30, 2013).

NOTE D—DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
IDA uses derivative instruments in its investment portfolio and for asset-liability management purposes. All
derivative instruments are classified as either Level 1 or Level 2 for the purposes of fair value hierarchy
classification.
The following table summarizes IDA’s use of authorized derivatives in its various financial portfolios.

Under its derivative agreement with IBRD, IDA is not required to post collateral as long as it maintains liquidity
holdings at pre-determined levels that are a proxy for a AAA credit rating. As of March 31, 2014, having met the
liquidity holdings requirement, IDA had not posted any collateral with IBRD.

The following tables provide information on the fair value amounts and the location of the derivative instruments
on the Condensed Balance Sheet, as well as the notional amounts and credit risk exposures of those derivative
instruments, as of March 31, 2014 and June 30, 2013:

Offsetting assets and liabilities
IDA enters into International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) master netting agreements with
substantially all of its derivative counterparties. These legally enforceable master netting agreements give IDA the
right to liquidate securities held as collateral and to offset receivables and payables with the same counterparty, in
the event of default by the counterparty.
The presentation of derivative instruments is consistent with the manner in which these instruments are settled.
Interest rate swaps are settled on a net basis, while currency swaps are settled on a gross basis.
The following tables summarize information on derivative assets and liabilities (before and after netting
adjustments) that are reflected on IDA’s Condensed Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2014 and June 30, 2013. Total
derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally
enforceable master netting agreements. The net derivative asset positions have been further reduced by the cash
and securities collateral received.

Inter-level transfer
During the three and nine months ended March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2013, there were no inter-level transfers in
the derivatives portfolio.
Valuation Methods and Assumptions
Derivative contracts include currency forward contracts, interest swaps and currency swaps, and TBA securities.
These are valued using the standard discounted cash flow methods using market observable inputs such as yield
curves, foreign exchange rates and basis spreads and funding spreads.
NOTE E—DEVELOPMENT CREDITS AND OTHER EXPOSURES
Development credits and other exposures are generally made directly to member countries of IDA. Other
exposures include irrevocable commitments, guarantees and repaying project preparation facilities.
Development credits are carried and reported at amortized cost. Of the total development credits outstanding as of
March 31, 2014, 89% were to the South Asia, Africa, and East Asia and Pacific regions combined.
Based on IDA’s internal credit quality indicators, the majority of the development credits outstanding are in the
Medium-risk and High-risk classes.
As of March 31, 2014, development credits outstanding totaling $2,749 million (representing about 2% of the
portfolio) from five borrowers were in nonaccrual status.
Credit Quality of Sovereign Development Credits
Based on an evaluation of IDA’s development credits, management has determined that IDA has one portfolio
segment — Sovereign Exposures. Development credits constitute the majority of sovereign exposures.
IDA’s country risk ratings are an assessment of its borrowers’ ability and willingness to repay IDA on time and in
full. These ratings are internal credit quality indicators. Individual country risk ratings are derived on the basis of
both quantitative and qualitative factors. For the purpose of analyzing the risk characteristics of IDA’s exposures,
exposures are grouped into three classes in accordance with assigned borrower risk ratings which relate to the
likelihood of loss: Low, Medium and High risk classes, as well as exposures in nonaccrual status. IDA considers
all exposures in nonaccrual status to be impaired.
IDA’s borrowers’ country risk ratings are key determinants in the provisions for development credit losses.
IDA considers a development credit to be past due when a borrower fails to make payment on any principal,
service, interest or other charges due to IDA, on the dates provided in the contractual development credit
agreements.
The following tables provide an aging analysis of development credits outstanding as of March 31, 2014 and June
30, 2013:

Accumulated Provision for Losses on Development Credits, Debt Relief (HIPC Debt Initiative and MDRI)
and Other Exposures
Provision for Losses on Development Credits and Other Exposures
Management determines the appropriate level of accumulated provision for losses, which reflects the probable
losses inherent in IDA’s exposures. Probable losses comprise estimates of losses arising from default and
nonpayment of principal amounts due, as well as present value losses. Management reassesses the adequacy of the
accumulated provision on a periodic basis and adjustments are recorded as a charge against or addition to revenue.
Provision for Debt Relief
HIPC Debt Initiative and MDRI provisions are based on quantitative and qualitative analyses of various factors,
including estimates of Decision Point and Completion Point dates. These factors are reviewed periodically as part
of the reassessment of the adequacy of the accumulated provision for debt relief. Provisions are released as
qualifying debt service becomes due and is forgiven under the HIPC Debt Initiative, and are reduced by the
amount of the eligible development credits written off when the country reaches Completion Point, and becomes
eligible for MDRI debt relief.

Changes to the accumulated provision for losses on development credits and other exposures, as well as the debt
relief under HIPC Debt Initiative and MDRI for the nine months ended March 31, 2014 and the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2013 are summarized below:

On January 25, 2013, Myanmar cleared all of its overdue principal and charges due to IDA and the credits to, or
guaranteed by, Myanmar were restored to accrual status on that date. Revenue from development credits for the
period ended March 31, 2013, increased by $90 million, $87 million of which represents revenue that would have
been accrued in previous fiscal years had these credits not been in nonaccrual status.
During the three and nine months ended March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2013, no development credits were placed
into nonaccrual status.
During the three and nine months ended March 31, 2014, service charge revenue recognized on development
credits in nonaccrual status was less than $1 million in each period (Nil—three and nine months ended March 31,
2013).

Guarantees
Guarantees of $438 million were outstanding at March 31, 2014 ($359 million—June 30, 2013). This amount
represents the maximum potential undiscounted future payments that IDA could be required to make under these
guarantees, and is not included on the Condensed Balance Sheet. The guarantees issued by IDA have original
maturities ranging between 9 and 23 years, and expire in decreasing amounts through 2035.
As of March 31, 2014, liabilities related to IDA’s obligations under guarantees of $36 million ($30 million—June
30, 2013) have been included in Other liabilities on the Condensed Balance Sheet. These include the accumulated
provision for guarantee losses of $7 million ($9million—June 30, 2013).
During the nine months ended March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2013, no guarantees provided by IDA were called.
Segment Reporting
Based on an evaluation of its operations, management has determined that IDA has only one reportable segment.
Charge revenue comprises service charges and interest charges on outstanding development credit balances and
guarantee fee revenue. For the nine months ended March 31, 2014, charge revenue from one country totaling $153
million was in excess of ten percent of total charge revenue.

Buy-down of Development Credits

During the nine months ended March 31, 2014, two development credits, with outstanding carrying value of $134
million, were purchased under the buy-down mechanism by the Global Program to Eradicate Poliomyelitis Trust
Fund, for present value equivalent of $67 million, resulting in a $67 million write-off. A provision of $30 million
was recorded during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 for one development credit, and a provision of $37
million was recorded during the nine months ended March 31, 2014 for the other. These provisions were recorded
when all performance goals as well as conditions necessary to effect the buy-downs were completed.

In addition, for one development credit with an outstanding carrying value of $40 million, all performance goals as
well as conditions necessary to effect the buy-down were completed during the nine months ended March 31,
2014. As a result, a provision for losses of $15 million was recorded during the nine months ended March 31,
2014. The provision is equivalent to the difference between the carrying amount of the development credit and the
estimated amount to be received.

During the nine months ended March 31, 2013, one development credit with outstanding carrying value of $49
million was purchased for a present value equivalent of $23 million under the buy-down mechanism by the Global
Program to Eradicate Poliomyelitis Trust Funds, resulting in a $26 million write-off.

 a. Includes amounts receivable from IBRD for IDA’s share of investments associated with PCRF. This receivable is included in
      Receivable from affiliated organization on the Condensed Balance Sheet.

Administrative Services: The payable to IBRD represents IDA’s share of joint administrative expenses, net of
other revenue jointly earned. The allocation of expenses is based upon an agreed cost sharing formula, and
amounts are settled quarterly. At March 31, 2014, the amount payable for administrative service was net of IDA’s
share of investments associated with PCRF.
For the three and nine months ended March 31, 2014, IDA’s share of joint administrative expenses totaled $371
million and $1,142 million, respectively (three and nine months ended March 31, 2013—$378 million and $1,111
million, respectively).
Other revenue: Includes IDA’s share of other revenue jointly earned with IBRD during the three and nine months
ended March 31, 2014 totaling $68 million and $180 million, respectively (three and nine months ended March 31,
2013—$63 million and $160 million, respectively). Other revenue is allocated on the basis consistent with that
applied to joint administrative expenses.
For the three and nine months ended March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2013, the amount of fee revenue associated
with services provided to other affiliated organizations is included in Other revenue on the Condensed Statement
of Income, as follows:

For the fiscal years ending June 30, 2014 and June 30, 2013, the commitment charge rate on the undisbursed
balances of IDA grants was set at nil percent.

NOTE H—PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
IBRD, along with IFC and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency sponsor a defined benefit Staff
Retirement Plan, a Retired Staff Benefits Plan and a PEBP that cover substantially all of their staff members.
While IDA is not a participating entity to these benefit plans, IDA shares the benefit costs and reimburses IBRD
for its proportionate share of any contributions made to these plans by IBRD, as part of IBRD’s allocation of staff
and associated administrative expenses to IDA based on an agreed cost sharing ratio.
During the three and nine months ended March 31, 2014, IDA’s share of IBRD’s benefit costs relating to all the
three plans totaled $75 million and $224 million, respectively (three and nine months ended March 31, 2013—$82
million and $244 million, respectively).
The cost of any potential future liability arising from these plans would be shared by IBRD and IDA using the
applicable share ratio.

NOTE I—ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
Comprehensive income consists of net income and other gains and losses affecting equity that, under U.S. GAAP,
are excluded from net income. For IDA, comprehensive income is comprised of net income (loss) and currency
translation adjustments on functional currencies. These items are presented in the Statement of Comprehensive
Income.
The following table presents the changes in Accumulated other comprehensive income balances for the nine
months ended March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2013.
