OUR PROJECTS
From Malawi to Bhutan to Nicaragua, our projects are making a difference in the lives of millions of small farmers across
the world. From coffee plantations in Central America to the mango orchards of Malawi, our combined investment and
advisory services have supported private sector agribusiness in low-income countries, and linked smallholder farmers to
markets by improving their access to finance, technology, expertise and inputs. In total, our 36 combined investment
projects are expected to reach nearly 3.3 million farmers. Below is a list of our current projects:

A SNAPSHOT AT OUR PORTFOLIO
The PrSW continues to play a major role in lending and providing guarantees through risk-sharing facilities with financial
institutions including social lenders, microfinance institutions and commercial banks.

Geographically, nearly three quarters of the PrSW is allocated in Sub-Saharan Africa, where sixty percent of IDA countries
are located. However, recent fiscal years have seen some exciting new investments in Asia, specifically in Cambodia,
Myanmar and Bhutan.
