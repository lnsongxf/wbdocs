EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The principal objective of this report is to propose improvements on management of revenue
from the auctioning of EU ETS allowances, as well as describe possible use of flexibility
mechanisms in Romania, in order to mobilize and enable both public and private actors to reduce
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from economic activities in non EU ETS sectors in line with EU
targets. The report focuses on possible actions in the timeframe 2016-2020, aligned with EU ETS
phase and EU target for 2020 and 2030.

The report is positioned amid the wider context of a vision for Romania to become a climate
resilient, low-carbon economy, which has mainstreamed its climate policies and actions into
smart, green, and inclusive growth, described in the National Climate Change and Low Carbon
Green Growth Strategy for Romania 2016-2030 and 2015-2020 Climate Action Plan prepared by
the World Bank for Romania. The hope is that, by 2050, the country will have made the transition
to a society in which social, economic, and environmental policies and actions are interlinked,
and designed to ensure sustainable development, with high living standards for all, and a high
environmental quality.

The report found that until now, there had been no clear and effective procedure for the
administration of ETS auctioning revenue, and no selection and prioritization criteria. The lack of
selection and prioritization criteria and guidance for using ETS auctioning revenue to finance GHG
emission reduction projects allowed for the selection of projects without proper assessment in
terms of their reduction of GHG emissions, as well as cost effectiveness and other important
factors.

The authors of the report also come to the conclusion that in order for the ETS auctioning revenue
to constitute a viable and longer term climate financing program, it is necessary to amend the
legislation in force, and approve an updated financial and organizational scheme for the use of
these funds. In the process of designing the financial scheme from the EU ETS revenues, it should
be taken into account that the absorption of EU funds is a priority for Romania. Thus, the design
of climate financing programs from ETS revenue should address other categories of stakeholders
not currently covered by existing EU funds.

In order to maximize the environmental, social, and economic impact of possible sectoral climate
investment programs, and based on international experience, the World Bank’s expert team
proposes to use the following criteria for prioritizing and selecting non-EU ETS sectoral programs
to be financed with EU ETS auctioning revenue:

1.     Cost efficiency of Emissions Reduction;

2.     Leverage of public money to private finance;


                                                                                                 8
3.     Possibility for rapid development and scale up,

4.     Lack of other financing mechanisms;

5.     Support for job creation;

Based on these criteria, the report recommends supporting the following climate investment
programs for the years 2016-2020:

1)      Replacing household light bulbs, air conditioning units, individual heating systems,
refrigerators, and washing machines with more performant ones;

2)     Upgrading household buildings insulation;

3)     Implementing local, small- and household-scale renewable energy production;

4)     Forestry and biomass production, and land use improvements.

Additionally, the report recommends spending up to 5% of the EU ETS revenue available for
climate action on management of the ETS scheme in Romania, as well as up to 5% on
administration of the above described climate investment programs.

To address possible improvements for the use of funds from ETS revenues in the organizational
scheme, the report proposes to use the following institutional arrangements of climate
investment programs:

- Ministry of Public Finance (MPF) will continue to be Romania’s auctioneer on European Energy
Exchange (EEX). MPF will collecting the revenues from the EU ETS auctioning and after taking 29%
of revenues to state budget, it will transfer 71% of the revenues to the special “climate” account
of the MEWF;

- Ministry of Environment, Waters and Forests (MEWF) will set up a Coordination Unit (CU) of the
Climate Investment Fund inside the ministry. The CU will supervise the Climate Investment Fund;

- MEWF will set up Advisory Committee (AC), that will consist of representatives of the central
authority for public finance (currently Ministry of Public Finance), central authority for economy
(currently Ministry of Economy, Trade and Tourism), central authority for energy (currently
Ministry of Energy, Small and Medium–Sized Enterprises, and Business Environment), central
authority for agriculture (currently Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development), central
authority for regional development (currently Ministry of Regional Development and Public
Administration) and other concerned ministries as well as representatives from private
businesses, climate science and non-governmental organizations. It will provide input and
guidance concerning strategic objectives for implementation of the climate programs that will be
financed by CIF;


                                                                                                9
- MEWF will set up Climate Investment Fund. CIF will have overall responsibility for
implementation of climate programs and selection of Implementing Agencies.

- Implementing Agency will have responsibility for implementation of particular climate program
and will directly work with beneficiaries.

Based on the World Bank analysis, the report estimates that in the years 2016-2020, Romania
will have EU ETS revenue available for climate investment programs in amount of about 1.278
billion Euros. To increase leverage of public money to private finance and based on experience
of similar programs in other countries, the report recommends the following initial grant/subsidy
levels (which could be increased up to 50% if there will be low interest to participate or
government of Romania wants to assist low income families) and corresponding possible budgets
for the climate investment programs:

1)     Household building insulation: with a subsidy level of 35%, and total possible budget of
about 750 million Euros, this program could attract up to 1.39 billion Euros of private money;

2)      Replacement of household light bulbs, air conditioning units, individual heating systems,
refrigerators, and washing machines: with a subsidy level of 30%, and possible budget of about
88 million Euros, this program could attract up to 205 million Euros of private money;

3)      Developing small- and household-scale renewable energy production: with a subsidy level
of 35%, and possible budget of about 330 million Euros, this program could attract up to 612
million Euros of private money;

4)      Forestry, biomass production, and land use improvements: due to activities on public land
only, this program will have subsidy level of 100%, and total possible budget of about 110 million
Euros.

We believe that effective information campaign about expected financial benefits during lifetime
of efficient appliances or family house insulation or renewable energy equipment will assist to
overcome “lack of information/public awareness” barrier, while the provided subsidy will
overcome the financial barrier – relatively high cost of efficient appliances or family house
insulation or renewable energy equipment for average Romanian SME or household. The
inclusion of energy audit’s or feasibility study’s cost into list of eligible subsidy expen ses will also
assist to overcome important information and financial barrier.

It is concluded that the proposed improvements on managing revenue from the auctioning of EU
ETS allowances laid out in this report could be used by the Ministry of Environment, Waters and
Forests, as a responsible body for climate policy, for internal discussions with other Romanian
ministries and agencies to reach consensus on the next steps.



                                                                                                      10
As the government aims to build the country into a climate resilient, low-carbon economy that
has mainstreamed its climate policies and actions into smart, green, and inclusive growth by
2030, the efficient use of revenue from the auctioning of EU ETS allowances could be an effective
tool to reach this goal in the sectors not covered by existing climate finance mechanisms and
policy regulations.

The main objective of the report is to provide recommendations for an efficient implementation
of the provisions of the EU ETS directives regarding the use of revenues from auctioning of EUAs.
All the measures proposed in this report are contributing to the objectives set up under the
Romanian National Climate Strategy 2016 – 2030 and National Action Plan 2016 – 2020.

INTRODUCTION
At the request of the Government of Romania (through its Ministry of Environment and Climate
Change and Ministry of European Funds), a two-year Reimbursable Advisory Service (RAS)
Program on climate change and low-carbon green growth was launched by the World Bank in
July 2013. The RAS project focuses on operationalizing Romania’s national climate change
strategy and action plan, identifying and integrating climate-related actions in new operational
programs, building a solid analytical base for impact assessments and climate-related decision
making, and enhancing climate-friendly practices and monitoring systems.

Component D aims at supporting the Government institutions in implementing, monitoring, and
evaluating climate change actions and sharing their experiences. One of the deliverables is to
propose prioritization criteria for climate mitigation opportunities in Romania that could be
financed from revenues obtained from the auctioning of EU Allowances in the period 2016 –
2020.

In this context, the present report provides an overview of climate policy and climate finance in
EU and Romania and proposes non EU ETS sectors/programs to be supported from revenues
from auctioning of EU ETS allowances and possible improvements in legal and institutional
framework for implementation of the proposed climate programs. The report also describes
possible use of flexibility mechanisms in non EU ETS sectors.

CHAPTER 1: THE CONTEXT OF CLIMATE FINANCE SET-UP IN NON-EU ETS
SECTORS IN ROMANIA
1.1 Overview of climate policy in EU
Out of its total set of 4 legislative acts, the EU 2020 Climate Package includes two main pieces of
legislation to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions:

1. The EU Emissions Trading Scheme Directive (EU ETS) that covers emissions from large
installations in the power and industrial sectors, and

2. The Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) that sets emissions reductions targets for sectors not covered
under the EU ETS. The non-ETS sectors account for nearly 60% of the EU’s emissions and
therefore the Effort Sharing Decision, governing these non-ETS greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions,
is one of EU’s central pieces of climate legislation.

1.1.1. EU ETS

The EU’s Emissions Trading System (ETS) covered in the phase I and II more than 10,000 energy-
intensive facilities across the 27 EU Member countries, including oil refineries, power plants over
20 megawatts (MW) in capacity, coke ovens, and iron and steel plants, along with cement, glass,
lime, brick, ceramics, and pulp and paper installations. These covered entities emit about 40%-
45% of the EU’s total greenhouse gas emissions, and almost two -thirds of them are combustion
installations. The trading scheme does not cover either carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the
transportation sector (except aviation), which account for about 25% of the EU’s total
greenhouse gas emissions, or emissions of non-CO2 greenhouse gases, which account for about
20% of the EU’s total greenhouse gas emissions. The Phase I trading period ran between January
1, 2005, and December 31, 2007. The Phase II trading period began January 1, 2008, covering the
period of the Kyoto Protocol 2008 - 2012, and a Phase III covers 2013 - 2020.

The EU ETS is one of the key climate policy instruments in the EU. It was introduced to help
participating countries reach their emissions reduction targets under the Kyoto Protocol as well
as the internal EU targets for 2020 and beyond, through cost-efficient emission reductions at
point sources across the EU.

In Romania, the provisions of Directive 2003/87/EC (EU Trading Scheme) were implemented
starting with 1st January 2007, the accession date to the European Union. Romania participated
to EU ETS only for the last year of Phase I of the scheme (2007), the legislative and institutional
framework for the ETS implementation being also established since 2006 when the technical
assistance project “Implementation of Directive 2003/87/CE and NAP development” started .

In this way, the Romania’s National Allocation Plan covering the last year of Phase I and the entire
Phase II was developed in April 2006 and notified to the European Commission in December
2006, as one consolidated paper.

The Romanian NAP was prepared through a working group coordinated by the Ministry of
Environment with the technical support of National Environmental Protection Agency, the
Institute for Studies and Power Engineering, Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Administration and
Interior, National Institute for Statistics and the National Commission for Forecast, and with the
assistance from Ecofys (Germany) and Netherlands.

After rounds of consultation with the Romanian authorities regarding the principles and the
amount of allowances allocated for each installation falling under the provisions of Directive
2003/87/EC, in October 2007 the Commission decided on NAP 2007 and 2008-2012 as follows:

-   the total amount of allowances for 2007 to be 10% less than the national cap proposed by
    the Romanian authorities (74,343,356 allowances) and


                                                                                                 14
-   the total amount of allowances for 2008–2012 to be 20.7% less than the national cap
    proposed by the Romanian authorities (349,671,593 allowances).

The Commission’s decisions were implemented by the Romanian Government through GD no.
60/2008 approving the National Allocation Plan for 2007 and 2008-2012 periods which foresees
that:
- allocation of allowances is free of charge;
- New Entrants Reserve (NER) is established only for the second period of the scheme and not
   for 2007;
- project credits (ERUs and CERS) can be used up to 10% of the total quantity allocated to
   installation, both for 2007 and 2008 -2012;
- auction is not used as allocation methodology for 2007 and 2008–2012; the Government will
   auction only the allowances from NER unused at the end of 2012;
- Early Action Reserve for 2008–2012 was established at 4.48% from the total amount of
   allowances;
- a JI set-aside for JI projects for 2008–2012 (as requested by Decision 2006/780/EC) was
   established at 1.91% form the total amount of allowances;
- a cogeneration Reserve for 2008-2012 for CHP installations with overall efficiency higher that
   65% was established at 0.95% from the total amount of allowances;
- in the second Phase of the scheme Romania will not auction allowances other that the excess
   from the New Entrants Reserve.

The following principles for the allocation of allowances were proposed by the Romanian
authorities through NAP and approved by the European Commission:
- the total number of allowances allocated (national cap) was determined through “top–down”
   projections, based on historical achievements and the forecast of macro-economic and sector
   specific indicators proposed in the Governmental strategies and policies;
- allocation to installations was done in two steps: firstly to sectors and subsequently to each
   installation within the sectors;
- allocation at sector level (for: energy, refineries, production and processing of ferrous metals,
   cement, lime, glass, ceramics, pulp and paper) was done considering the “top -down”
   projections, based on historic emissions (2001-2004), projected growth of production during
   2007-2012 and reduction of carbon intensity;
- allocation of allowances at installation level was done on the basis of the share of relevant
   emissions in the total relevant emissions of that sector;
- relevant emissions of an installation during the historical reference period 2001-2004 are
   determined as the average emissions of the two years with the highest emissions within this
   period.

                                                                                                15
Romania took into account the extended scope for the definition of “combustion installation” as
it had been agreed in the Climate Change Committee on May 2006.
Taking into account that Romania took part to ETS only for the last year of Phase I of the scheme,
the Romanian authorities decided to develop two separate procedures for issuing the GHG
permits: one for 2007 and one for 2008-2012 period, in order to allow the operators to receive
one permit covering 2007 and another permit for 2008–2012.

Upon this 244 ETS installations received the GHG permit for 2007 and 229 installations were
permitted for the period 2008–2012.

Since the beginning of 2012 the EU ETS also covers emissions from aviation.

In 2013, the EU ETS entered its third trading period (2013–2020). It has a wider scope than the
previous trading periods, as additional countries, gases and sectors have entered the scheme.
The third trading period is governed by a new set of rules: the cap is set at EU level, with a linear
reduction factor and a trans-sectorial factor, rather than national allocation plans (NAPs) drawn
up by participating countries. Auctioning has become the default method for allocation, with
about half of the allowances being auctioned; however, there remains a substantial share of free
allocation until 2020.

The EU ETS Phase 3 no longer provides an individual cap for every Member State, but a single cap
for the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. As of 2013, around 43 % (excluding NER 300) of
the emission allowances have been auctioned, and this share is expected to increase over time.

Since 2009, a growing surplus of allowances and international credits has been available on the
carbon market, leading to a fall of the carbon price. In 2013 the emission allowances surplus
reached approximately 2.1 billion allowances - which was partly due to the economic crisis and
has significantly weakened the carbon price. Furthermore, the structural surplus is expected to
remain in the system up to and beyond 2020.

To address this imbalance, the Commission proposed to postpone ('back-load') the auctioning of
900 million allowances from the early years of Phase 3 of the EU ETS to the end of the trading
period. The 'back-loading' was adopted by amending the Auctioning Regulation on 25 February
2014.

On 22 January 2014, the Commission furthermore adopted a legislative proposal to establish a
market stability reserve. On May 2015 the member states permanent representatives endorsed
the informal agreement reached between Council and European Parliament representatives on
the decision concerning the establishment and operation of a market stability reserve (MSR).




                                                                                                  16
The main features3 of the package are:

-     a market stability reserve will be established in 2018 and will be operational from 1 January
      2019
-     "backloaded" allowances (the 900 million allowances whose auctioning was postposed from
      the years 2014-2016 until 2019-2020) will be placed in the market reserve
-     unallocated allowances will be transferred directly to the MSR in 2020 and their future usage
      is to be considered under the wider EU ETS review
-     temporary exemption of the "10% solidarity component" of allowances from the scope of the
      MSR until the end of 2025
-     the EU ETS review is to consider the possible use of a limited number of allowances before
      2021 to supplement existing resources to promote CCS, renewables and low-carbon
      industrial innovation projects
-     the EU ETS and MSR reviews to take into account carbon leakage and competitiveness
      aspects, as well employment and GDP related issues.

1.1.2. Guidance for use of revenue from auctioning of EU ETS allowances

EU ETS Directive 2009/29/EC, Article 10 states that: “Member States shall determine the use of
revenues generated from the auctioning of allowances. At least 50 % of the revenues generated
from the auctioning of allowances […] should be used for one or more of the following: (a) to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including by contributing to the Global Energy Efficiency and
Renewable Energy Fund and to the Adaptation Fund [..], (b) to develop renewable energies [...](c)
measures to avoid deforestation […] (d) forestry sequestration in the Community; (e) the
environmentally safe capture and geological storage of CO2, in particular from solid fossil fuel
power stations; (f) to encourage a shift to low-emission and public forms of transport; (g) to
finance research and development in energy efficiency and clean technologies in the sectors
covered by this Directive; (h) measures intended to increase energy efficiency and insulation or
to provide financial support […] (i) to cover administrative expenses of the manageme nt of the
Community scheme.”

It is up to each EU Member State to decide “in accordance with their respective constitutional
and budgetary requirements” (EU council 2008) on the use of its EU ETS revenues.

This provision was transposed into Romanian legislation GD 204/2013, requiring in Article II (2)
that the funds obtained as revenues from the EU ETS auctioning will be used for projects aiming
the reduction of GHGs emissions, as follows:

a) financing research and development as well as demonstration projects for reducing emissions
and adapting to climate change, including participation in initiatives within the strategic plan for
Energy Technology and the European Technology Platforms;
b) development of clean technologies and development of other technologies contributing to the
transition to a low-carbon economy and increase energy efficiency;
c) forestry sequestration;
d) carbon capture and storage in a safe environment, in particular from the power plants that
produce energy from solid fossil fuel and from a range of sectors and sub-sectors, including in
third countries;
e) encouraging the shift to forms of public transport with low greenhouse gas emissions;
f) financing research and development on energy efficiency and clean technologies in the sectors
covered by this decision;
g) measures intended to increase energy efficiency and the insulation or financial support to
address social aspects in households with lower and middle incomes;
h) covering administrative costs for managing the EU ETS.

1.1.3. Effort Sharing Decision (ESD)

The Effort Sharing Decision (406/2009/EC) sets national emission targets for 2020, expressed as
percentage changes from 2005 levels. It also lays down how the annual emission allocations
(AEAs) for each year from 2013 to 2020 are to be calculated.

Of the total emissions under ESD, the top contributing sectors are transport (34% of ESD
emissions); households (19%) and agriculture (18%).

By 2020, the national targets will collectively deliver a reduction of around 10% in total EU
emissions from the sectors covered compared with 2005 levels. Together with a 21% cut in
emissions covered by the EU ETS, this will accomplish the overall emission reduction goal of the
climate and energy package, namely a 20% cut below 1990 levels by 2020.




                                                                                                 18
Figure 2. National ESD targets for 2020.




In contrast to sectors in the EU ETS, which are regulated at EU level, it is the responsibility of
Member States to define and implement national policies and measures to limit emissions from
the sectors covered by the Effort Sharing Decision. Such policies could include: reducing transport
needs, shift to public transportation, shift from fossil fuels transport, energy efficiency in
buildings (thermal retrofitting), more efficient heating and cooling systems, renewable energy
for heating and cooling, climate-friendly farming, conversion of livestock manure to biogas. At
the same time, EU-wide measures also contribute to the reduction of the emissions under ESD
(emission standards for new cars, energy performance of buildings, eco-design requirements for
energy products, energy labelling to inform consumers, restrictions on fluorinated industrial
gases (F-gases), etc.). The most important EU policies in achieving the global 10% target are the
Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, the Directive on Landfill and Waste, and the
Regulation on certain fluorinated greenhouse gases.

The current ESD target, 10% reduction below 2005 emission levels by 2020, can be easily met at
no net cost to the European economy and even delivers net benefits to the economy through
efficiency savings. At EU level, an overachievement of this target of up to 5% by 2020 is already
expected. Overall, the majority of Member States are expected to reach their 2020 target under
the Effort Sharing Decision.

A thin majority of Member States is expected to overachieve their target by between 2% and 44%
with already implemented measures4. The difference between already implemented and

inventories to UNFCCC (15/04/2013) and projections of non-ETS emissions available as of 15/04/2013.

                                                                                                      19
additional planned measures is relatively small for most of them. This indicates that most
Member States would already achieve their targets as a result of a business-as-usual trajectory
and they therefore did not need to plan any additional measures.

Also, most of the overachievers are countries that are allowed to increase their emissions,
including Romania. The ESD targets are therefore insufficient as they lock in a business-as-usual
scenario.

Source: EEA, 2014. Romania is currently well under targets (2012: 90.1% of 2005 emissions, 2013 target: 101.9%
compared to 2005, 2020 target: 119% compared to 2005).



1.1.4. 2030 Climate and Energy Policy Framework

On October 2014 the European Council adopted conclusions on a 2030 Climate and Energy Policy
Framework (European Council 2014). As part of the conclusions the Council laid down some
principles for an EU Effort Sharing Decision for the period 2021-2030 (ESD II).

Currently the new proposal for the ESD II is under public consultation at the EU level. The aim is
to reduce emissions by 30% compared to 2005 and contribute to the overall EU emission
reduction target of 40% compared to 1990. The ESD vision for after 2021 is similar to the current
one: the overall EU target is to be shared among member states based on the solidarity principle
(relative GDP per capita), with some adjustments. Thus, all member states would contribute to


                                                                                                           20
the overall reduction with targets ranging from 0-40% compared to 2005. But the targets for the
richer countries could be "relatively adjusted to reflect cost-effectiveness in a fair and balanced
manner".

Also, flexibility instruments under the 2013-2020 ESD would be significantly enhanced so as to
ensure cost-effectiveness of the collective EU effort and convergence of emissions per capita by
2030. The vision is to introduce a new flexibility in achieving targets for richer Member States
with national reduction targets significantly above the EU average and their cost effective
reduction potential. This would consist of a limited, one-off, reduction of the ETS allowances, to
be decided before 2020. The same flexibility would be available to Member States that did not
have free allocation for industrial installations in 2013.

Post-2020, more focus would be put on the transport sector.

The European Council in October 2014, invited the European Commission to further examine
instruments and measures for a comprehensive and technology neutral approach for the
promotion of emissions reduction and energy efficiency in transport, for electric transportation
and for renewable energy sources in transport also after 2020. The European Council calls for a
rapid adoption of the Directive laying down calculation methods and reporting requirements
pursuant to Directive 98/70/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to the
quality of petrol and diesel fuels. It also recalls that under existing legislation a Member State can
opt to include the transport sector within the framework of the ETS.

The EU leaders decided also that the emissions and removals related to land use, land use change
and forestry (LULUCF) will be integrated into the 2030 climate framework, which so far have been
treated outside the EU’s 2020 climate framework. In contrast to the other sectors, the LULUCF
sector is a net sink of carbon which means that the sector stores more carbon than it emits.
Through the carbon storage potential of soils and forests, the LULUCF sectors could potentially
generate credits in the order of 1.4 billion (or 1,400 Mt CO2-eq) in the 2021-2030 period5 . While
it is essential that also the LULUCF sector contributes to greenhouse gas mitigation, several EU
countries see the LULUCF sink as a way to displace efforts in other sectors such as agriculture.
However allowing forestry offsets into the ESD would severely undermine the emission
reductions needed in the ESD sectors and could lead to a 23% increase of EU’s greenhouse gas
emissions in the 2021-2030 period. The LULUCF emissions and removals are characterized by
potentially large annual fluctuations, while there are uncertainties relating to data reliability.
These characteristics make the sector unfit for any flexibility with the ESD that has an annual
compliance cycle. Similarly, planting trees in order to displace efforts in sectors where major

an ambitious target.

emissions reductions are needed is risky because the forest sector is a large carbon sink where
the permanence of stored carbon cannot be guaranteed, while the emissions from fossil fuels
are permanent.

Using EU ETS auctioning revenues in order to reduce the GHG emissions from non-ETS sectors
could be an opportunity to be explored to take actions for implementing measures for the 2030
target.

1.2 GHG emission status in non EU ETS sectors

1.2.1. GHG emissions in non EU ETS sectors in EU

In April 2009 Decision 406/2009/EC (Effort Sharing Decision) was adopted jointly by the European
Parliament and Council that focuses on the effort of Member States to meet the Community's
commitments to reduce GHG emissions by 2020 in sectors not covered by EU ETS. This decision
aimed to establish the minimum contribution of Member States to reduce GHG emissions in the
period 2013-2020.

The current ESD target, 10% reduction below 2005 emission levels by 2020, can be easily met at
no net cost to the European economy and even delivers net benefits to the economy through
efficiency savings. Overall, the majority of Member States are expected to reach their 2020 target
under the Effort Sharing Decision.

1.2.2. Overview of GHG emissions in Romania in 2012

According with the Romanian GHG Inventory, the total GHG Romanian emissions in 2012,
excluding removals by sinks, amounted to 118,764.15 Gg CO2 equivalents.

Figure 5. Sectoral distribution of GHG emissions in 2012 in Romania.

The energy sector represents the largest source of GHG emissions in Romania.
According to IPCC the following categories are included in this sector: Energy industries;
Manufacturing Industries and Construction; Transport; Other sectors (commercial/institutional,
residential, agriculture/ forestry/ fisheries); Other (stationary, mobile – according to IPCC);
Fugitive Emissions from Fuels.
Compared to the other GHG emissions sectors (Industrial Processes, Agriculture, LULUCF, Waste),
the Energy sector represents the largest source of anthropogenic GHG emissions in Romania.
In 2012, the Energy sector was responsible for about 69.23% of the total GHG emissions.
The GHG emissions resulted from the Energy sector decreased with 59.60 % compared with the
base year 1989.
Industrial Processes contributes to total GHG emissions with 10.42%. A significant decrease of
GHG emissions was registered in this sector (65.10% decreases in 2012 compared to the level in
1989) due to the decline or the closure of certain production activities.
Solvent and Other Product Use the trend of emissions resulted from this sector follows the
general trend: emissions have decreased seriously after 1989, then the emissions were relatively
stable from 1992 to 2002; after 2002, emissions started to increase, and due to the revitalization
of the relevant economic activities (automobile manufacture, construction and buildings).




                                                                                               23
The GHG emissions level decreased in 2012 by 80.22% in comparison with the level recorded in
19896.
Agriculture GHG emissions have also decreased. The GHG emissions in 2012 are 55.35% lower in
comparison with the 1989 emissions due to: the decline of livestock; the decrease of rice
cultivated area; the decrease of crop productions level; the decline of N synthetic fertilizer
applied amounts.
In 2012, 15.31 % of the total GHG emissions resulted from the agriculture sector.
LULUCF: The net GHG removals/emissions level is 34.35% higher in 2012 in comparison with the
level in the base year. The Romanian land use sector acts as a net sink, at an average uptake of
20,544.21 Gg/year, being relatively stable over the last 22 years.
Waste sector emissions have increased in 2012 with 25.62% in comparison with the level in 1989.
The contribution of the waste sector to the total GHG emissions in 2012 is 4.93%.
The Figure 6 below shows the GHG emissions trends by each sector. The GHG emissions are
expressed in Gg CO2 equivalent.

The emissions trend for the entire period is characterized by a continuos decrease, which is due
to a number of factors:
 the decline of economic activities and energy consumption;
 the economy being in transition, some energy intensive industries reduced their activities,
    this being reflected in the GHG emissions reduction especialy during 1989–1999 period;
 the decrease of the natural gas national reserves;
 increase of energy efficiency at the end consumer by changing the old technologies with new
    technologies, decreasing energy consumption in large cities due to drastic decline in thermal

   in 2006, the available energy resources rised over the level in the previous year. The increase
    was based mainly on the increased import of energy carriers (+3.1%), offsetting the small
    decrease of the primary energy production due to diminished crude oil (-8.1%),
   the increase of natural gas resources in 2006 was driven by the significant increase in imports
    (+14.3 %);
   the decrease of crude oil and hydropower resources in 2011 was compensated by the
    increase of natural gas available for use;
   imports of natural gas have increased in 2011 over the level in the previous year, representing
    35.7% of the total imports of energy products; meanwhile a decreased level was registred in
    case of imports of crude oil, which represent 47.1% of the total imports of energy products
    (Source – Romanian National Institute for Statistics);

The emissions accounted on the non-ETS sector could be shared between the following sectors:
 Residential – 17.0%
 Transport – 23.8%
 Agriculture – 28.7 %

                                                                                                25

     Others – 21.2%.

1.2.4.        ESD implementation in Romania

The estimation of the share of the ETS/ESD sectors is a determining factor in drawing up the
forecasts associated to GHG emissions, considering the legal requirements governing such
sectors and the need to observe the annual targets established for the ESD sectors, in accordance
with the provisions of Decision no. 406/2009/EC. The increase by 19% of GHG emissions
compared to the emissions afferent to 2005 is stipulated for the ESD sectors in Romania, between
2013 and 2020. The annual levels of emissions allocated to Romania for each year between 2013
and 2020, calculated by applying the values of the global warming potential defined in the
second, respectively the fourth assessment report drawn up by the IPCC, established in annexes
I and II of Decision no. 162/2013/EU, are shown in the following table:

The activities carried out to determine the share of the ETS sectors of the total GHG emissions
were as follows:
- the analysis and selection of the nationally available data to estimate the share of the ETS
    sectors;
- the estimation of the ETS sector share of the total GHG emissions.
For estimating the trend of GHG in Romania, three scenarios have been developed: no measure,
with measures and with additional measures.

1.3 Existing financing programs in non EU ETS sectors

1.3.1.   Additional measures in some EU countries

Most EU Member States are expected to overachieve the ESD targets even without additional
measures. However, seven EU countries need to implement additional policies or use flexibility
mechanisms (Bulgaria, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Slovenia) and will focus
mostly on energy efficiency in buildings. Six other countries (Austria, Belgium, Finland, Ireland,
Luxembourg and Spain) need to implement further policies and measures (not yet planned) or
use offsets or purchase AEAs.

Overall, the European Commission proposed country-specific recommendations to 16 Member
States7. Ideally, countries should promote fiscal frameworks to internalize environmental costs
in prices, e.g. by the introduction of a carbon price in non-ETS sectors. Other recommendations
include:

•     Use of the revenues from auctioning of EU ETS allowances;
•     Energy efficiency policies, particularly for buildings;
•     Investment in green technologies, renewable energy sources and energy infrastructure;
•     Reduction of emissions from the transport sector;
•     Shifting the tax burden away from labour to environmental taxation (which would also
enhance competitiveness);
•     Removing environmentally harmful subsidies.
The seven countries which are expected to underachieve their ESD targets have proposed a list
of measures. Most measures consist of policies that generate revenues to the budget: such as
fuel taxation or reduction of subsidies in sectors with high emissions, traffic taxation,
environmental taxes. Implementation of these revenue-generating measures would allow
reduction of other taxes or resources for support for other environmental measures. A few
proposed measures require public resources, particularly subsidies for energy efficiency in
buildings or replacement of vehicles. Several countries (Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg) might not
be able to implement the proposed measures because of lack of political will, e.g. in Luxembourg
the Government is reluctant to introduce fuel taxation so as not to discourage tourism or Finland
to reduce energy subsidies in certain energy-intensive industries. Another issue is the lack of
institutional coordination between federal and regional authorities, e.g. in Belgium. If they
cannot reach the ESD targets, these countries might instead take advantage of the trading
flexibilities in ESD.

1.3.2. Use of EU ETS revenues in EU

According to the consolidated Directive 2009/29/EC from 2013 onwards, Member States shall
auction all allowances which are not allocated free of charge in accordance with Article 10a and
10c.

The total quantity of allowances to be auctioned by each Member State shall be composed as
follows:

(a) 88 % of the total quantity of allowances to be auctioned being distributed amongst Member
States in shares that are identical to the share of verified emissions under the Community scheme
for 2005 or the average of the period from 2005 to 2007, whichever one is the highest, of the
Member State concerned;

(b) 10 % of the total quantity of allowances to be auctioned being distributed amongst certain
Member States for the purpose of solidarity and growth within the Community, thereby
increasing the amount of allowances that those Member States auction under point (a) by the
percentages specified in Annex IIa;

(c) 2 % of the total quantity of allowances to be auctioned being distributed amongst Member
States the greenhouse gas emissions of which were, in 2005, at least 20 % below their emissions
in the base year applicable to them under the Kyoto Protocol.

If necessary, the percentages referred to in points (b) and (c) shall be adapted in a proportional
manner to ensure that the distribution is 10 % and 2 % respectively.


                                                                                               29
Member States shall determine the use of revenues generated from the auctioning of
allowances. At least 50 % of the revenues generated from the auctioning of allowances should
be used for one or more of the following:

(a) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including by contributing to the Global Energy Efficiency
and Renewable Energy Fund and to the Adaptation Fund as made operational by the Poznan
Conference on Climate Change (COP 14 and COP/MOP 4), to adapt to the impacts of climate
change and to fund research and development as well as demonstration projects for reducing
emissions and for adaptation to climate change, including participation in initiatives within the
framework of the European Strategic Energy Technology Plan and the European Technology
Platforms;

(b) to develop renewable energies to meet the commitment of the Community to using 20 %
renewable energies by 2020, as well as to develop other technologies contributing to the
transition to a safe and sustainable low-carbon economy and to help meet the commitment of
the Community to increase energy efficiency by 20 % by 2020;

(c) measures to avoid deforestation and increase afforestation and reforestation in developing
countries that have ratified the international agreement on climate change, to transfer
technologies and to facilitate adaptation to the adverse effects of climate change in these
countries;

(d) forestry sequestration in the Community;

(e) the environmentally safe capture and geological storage of CO2, in particular from solid fossil
fuel power stations and a range of industrial sectors and subsectors, including in third countries;

(f) to encourage a shift to low-emission and public forms of transport;

(g) to finance research and development in energy efficiency and clean technologies in the
sectors covered by this Directive;

(h) measures intended to increase energy efficiency and insulation or to provide financial support
in order to address social aspects in lower and middle income households;

(i) to cover administrative expenses of the management of the Community scheme.

EU is currently discussing how it should revise its Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) for the post
2020 period. In July 2015, the European Commission released its proposal on the revision. Under
the current legislative proposal, the compensation of indirect costs related to the carbon leakage
exposure is proposed to be allocated from the auctioning revenues.




                                                                                                30
Under the Monitoring Mechanism Regulation, Member States were requested to report for the
first time by 31 July 2014 on the amounts and use of the revenues generated by the auctioning
of ETS allowances in the year 2013.

The total ETS auctioning revenues for the EU were €3.6 billion8. The EU ETS Directive provides
that at least 50% of auctioning revenues or the equivalent in financial value of these revenues
should be used by Member States for climate and energy related purposes. All Member States
have reported to have used or to plan to use 50 % or more of these revenues or the equivalent
in financial value of these revenues for climate and energy related purposes (87 % on average
representing approximately €3 billion), largely to support domestic investments in climate and
energy.

Only some Member States reported information on the split of the use of revenues per type of
actions. For instance, France, the Czech Republic and Lithuania use all their auctioning revenues
in projects to improve the energy efficiency of buildings. Bulgaria, Portugal and Spain use most
of their revenues to develop renewable energy. Poland uses most of its revenues that are
dedicated to climate change in support of energy efficiency and renewable energy. In Germany,
all auctioning revenues are used for climate and energy related purposed, with most of those
revenue directed to a specific climate and energy fund, which supports a wide range of projects.
Finland channels its auctioning revenues to Official Development Assistance activities, including
climate finance. The UK uses around 15 % of auctioning revenues to provide financial assistance
to low income households in relation to energy expenses.

Countries like UK, Portugal, and Ireland are using part of the revenues for covering of
administrative expenses of the management of the ETS scheme or other general and
administrative expenses of the Climate Change Special Programme like Lithuania.

Table 3 below is based on MMR Article 17 questionnaire: MSs Reporting on the use of auctioning
revenues pursuant to Article 24 from the Commission Regulation N°525/20139 – for the year
2013 (the latest data found in open sources).

1.3.3. Multiannual Financial Framework

Sectoral Operational Programs financed by EU

The 2014-2020 Multi-annual Financial Framework (MFF) adopted by the European Council in
February 2013 requires increasing climate-related expenditures to at least 20% of the EU
spending.

Those requirements were transposed in the Romanian Operational Programs objectives in order
to comply with the EU legislation on climate change and to improve absorption rate of EU money.
World Bank under the Component B of the OPERA CLIMA program developed the Identification
and Integration of climate-related investment actions in the 2014 – 2020 Operational Programs
for EU Funds11.
For the period 2014-2020, the Government will undertake several measures included in the
sectoral Operational Programs (OPs), to be financed by EU with national co-financing and has
adopted several state aid schemes and support mechanisms in various sectors with the goal to
reduce emissions of GHG. The measures cover most of the ETS and non-ETS sectors, though not
all have clear, explicit targets on the reduction of GHG emissions, but some are focused towards
climate or mobility objectives that have as side effect also the reduction of emissions of GHG
(e.g., energy efficiency, modal shift from transport modes with higher emissions to lower
emissions, increase of share of renewables etc.).

The reduction of GHG emissions by ETS installations from the energy system is already tackled in
a special application approved by the European Commission during 2011,, through the National
Investment Plan, funded through the mechanism of the so-called "10(c) derogation", with the
scope of supporting the investments for the modernization of the energy sector. Below a
summary of the major allocations for GHG-reducing projects in sectoral OPs. Based on these
already existing measures, we recommend focusing the revenues from ETS auctions to the gaps
(missing priorities or missing beneficiaries that are not covered in the existing policies).

Residential sector and energy efficiency:

The Operational Program Large Infrastructure (OPLI) is financing measure for improving energy
efficiency, like:

- "smart grids" - developing and implementing smart electricity distribution at low and medium
voltage: Large Infrastructure OP, aims to reduce average power consumption of households
(from 1.35 to 1.2 MWh/household/year). Total amount: 40.5 mil. EUR (EU contribution - 32.4

program

                                                                                                     36
mil.), the program covers only 10% of needs and must be scaled up to 80% by 2018, as EU
commitment.
- Increasing energy efficiency of district heating networks in Bucharest and 7 cities: Large
Infrastructure OP, would contribute to the reduction of losses from district heating grids -
transmission and distribution. The target to be reached at national level is the reduction of heat
losses from 26.76% to 15% in 2023. Total amount: 293.5 mil EUR (of which EU contribution -
234.5 mil). The program covers about 40-50% of the needs to reach national target.
- energy efficiency for industrial consumers: Large Infrastructure OP, to install metering for
energy consumption on industrial platforms, 12.5 mil EUR (9.99 mil. EU financing). The global
target is to improve energy efficiency from 183 ktoe/1,000 EUR to 121.5. The total allocation in
OPLI covers 10% of needs.
- possible "waste-to-energy" projects could be financed for Bucharest under LIOP Axis 3, were a
project for the integrated management of waste in Bucharest is eligible for financing.
And the Regional Program is focusing on energy efficiency in urban area:
- public and residential buildings and public lighting: thermal insulation of households (blocks),
improved efficiency in heating including the modernization of block/block entrance boilers,
renewable heating solutions; and public lighting, including replacement of bulbs, extension of
existing public lighting systems, public lighting with renewable energy sources and local
strategies: Regional OP, 1.187 mil EUR. The measure would contribute to the reduction of
primary energy consumption in public buildings (from 0.19 Mtoe/year to 0.12), in the residential
sector (from 0.96 to 0.47) and energy savings in public lighting from 669 to 446 GWh/year. The
annual reduction of GHG would be 228,742 tons CO2 equivalent.

Transport:
The Regional Operational Program and the Large Infrastructure Operational Program are
supporting measures that enhance energy efficiency or reduce GHG emissions in public
transport, such as:
- construction of railways infrastructure: the Large Infrastructure OP supports construction of
railways (1.4 bn EUR, of which EU funding 1 bn. EUR), and investments to improve sustainability
and quality of rail transport (392 mil. EUR, of which EU funding 276 mil. EUR). Both measures are
intended to improve mobility, but also to limit the modal shift from rail to roads, which would
have an effect on GHG emission reduction, though not quantified.
- Development of the metro system in Bucharest: Large Infrastructure OP (726 mil. EUR, of which
512 mil. EUR EU financing). The measure contributes to reducing GHG emissions in Bucharest
public transport (not quantified). Projects for the development of the metro system such as those
financed so far by ad hoc amendments of OUG 115 would be eligible for this source of financing,
while in addition allowing proper prioritization and monitoring of actual emission reductions.


                                                                                               37
- investments to support the urban mobility plans: Regional OP, 1.187 mil. EUR, investments
consist of development of public transport, introduction of electric cars and infrastructure for
sustainable urban transport. The global target is to cap CO2 emissions to 17 MtCO2e.
- investments in urban transport to support urban mobility plans and transport - infrastructure,
reduction of CO2 emissions, accessibility to public transport, replacement of existing fleet,
dedicated lanes, e-ticketing, development for urban mobility plans for other cities. For this
financing source would be eligible projects to replace public transport fleet such as those covered
so far by ad hoc amendments of OUG 115, while in addition allowing proper prioritization and
monitoring of the reduction of emissions Regional OP, 1.126 mil. EUR.
- Apart from EU funding, as a national program supported from the budget, "Rabla" program is
administered by the Administration of Environment Fund and supports the replacement of old
vehicles. World Bank estimates that in 2016-2023 a budget of 164 mil. EUR would be required
for the program in order to reach a GHG reduction of 0.241 MtCO2e12.

Waste: The Operational Program Large Infrastructure13 is assuring:
- investment in the waste sector to meet the requirements of the Union’s environmental acquis:
Large Infrastructure OP 374 mil. EUR (299 mil. EU financing). The measure supports development
of modern landfills and has an indirect effect on emissions of GHG, not quantified.

Agriculture and Forestry:
The National Rural Development Program for 2014-2020 support the following measures for
climate mitigation:
- raising awareness of the importance of climate change;
- promoting knowledge transfer and information for sustainable resource use that can
    contribute towards climate change mitigation by farmers and other rural stakeholders;
- investments in modern facilities and equipment for the storage and spreading of livestock
    manure;
- invetsments in installations for production and use of on-farm renewable energy sources,
    including energy efficiency;
- production and use of energy from renewable resources within agri-food processing units
    and energy efficiency;
- investments in production of fuels from bio-mass and green energy;
- afforestation of agricultural and non-agricultural land, thus promoting the increase of carbon
    sequestration;

-      conversion to and/or maintenance of organic farming that is generally beneficial for
       reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by reducing inputs (such as synthetic fertilizers and
       pesticides) and reducing nitrous oxides and methane emissions.

All those funds should not overlap and should complement each other for covering as many
sectors and stakeholders as possible, or for attracting more money.

In those circumstances for designing the financing scheme from the ETS revenues, it should be
taken into consideration that absorption of EU funds is a priority and before spending the EU
allocation for a specific priority, no other funds should be allocated, excepting the case when is
addressing other categories of stakeholders not covered by the EU funds.

1.3.4. New reserve of 2% of the EU ETS allowances

In October 2014 the European Council also decided to introduce a new reserve of 2% of the EU
ETS14 allowances that will be set aside to address particularly high additional investment needs
in low income Member States (GDP per capita 1 below 60% of the EU average). It will have the
following characteristics:
– the proceeds from the reserve will be used to improve energy efficiency and to modernize the
energy systems of these Member States, so as to provide their citizens with cleaner, secure and
affordable energy;
– the use of the funds will be fully transparent;
– allowances from the reserve will be auctioned according to the same principles and modalities
as for other allowances;
– the reserve will serve to establish a fund which will be managed by the beneficiary Member
States, with the involvement of the EIB in the selection of projects. Simplified arrangements for
small-scale projects will be ensured. Until 31 December 2030 the distribution of funds will be
based on the combination of a 50% share of verified emissions and a 50% share of GDP criteria,
but the basis on which projects are selected will be reviewed by the end of 2024.

1.4 Existing legal and institutional framework for use of revenues from
auctioning of EU ETS allowances

1.4.1. Legal framework on EU level

Changes made by the ETS 2009/29/EC Directive amending its Directive 2003/87/EC included
provisions regarding the auctioning of allowances. It also sets out the basis upon which
allowances were to be distributed between Member States. A total of 88 per cent of allowances


14
     http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/145356.pdf

                                                                                               39
were distributed according to Member States’ share in verified emissions under the EU ETS in
2005 or the average for the period from 2005‐2007 (whichever was highest).
The remaining 12 per cent was distributed on a different basis with 10 per cent distributed among
certain Member States for the purpose of ‘solidarity and growth’ within the Community, thus
increasing the number of allowances of certain Member States by a percentage specified in
Annex IIa of the Directive.
Two per cent of allowances were distributed in recognition of ‘early effort’ to achieve a reduction
in greenhouse gas emissions. These were allocated to the Member States that were, in 2005, at
least 20 percent below their emissions in the base year applicable to them under the Kyoto
Protocol.

While Member States determine the use of revenues generated from the auctioning of both sets
of allowances, at least 50 per cent should be spent on one or more of a menu of nine activities
relating to the mitigation of, as well as the adaptation to, climate change.

1.4.2. Legal and institutional framework in Romania

The legislation that is setting up the institutional framework in order to use ETS revenues is the
Governmental Emergency Ordinance (GEO) 115 / 21.12.2011 as subsequently amended.

According to this legislation the Ministry of Public Finance was designated the auctioneer for
Romania on the European common auction platform European Energy Exchange (EEX) and it is
acting consequently on the common action platform and will auction the allowances for
greenhouse gas emissions, both those relating to the year 2012 and the period starting with 2013.

The competent authorities responsible for applying Regulation (EU) no. 1031/2010 on the timing,
administration and other aspects of auctioning of emission allowances greenhouse gas emissions
under Directive 2009/29/ EC are: Ministry of Public Finance (MFP), Ministry of Environment,
Waters and Forests (MEWF), National Authority for Regulating and Monitoring Public
Procurement (ANRMAP), National Regulatory Authority for Energy (ANRE), Financial Supervisory
Authority (ASF) and the National Office Prevention and Control of Money Laundering.

According to Article 3 (1) Pursuant to art. 22 para. (1) of the EC Regulation, the Ministry of Public
Finance is designated as auctioneer authority until the establishment / designation of a national
authority on climate change at the national level to ensure implementation of the greenhouse
gases emissions trading scheme.

The ETS auctioning revenues are distributed according to art. 10 and art. 11 of the GEO 115/2011.
Article 10 provides that the revenues obtained from the auctioning of the stationary sector
allowances (the bulk of the proceeds), are distributed as follows:


                                                                                                  40
a) 29% of the gross amount is transferred to the state budget;

b) 71% will be used to finance projects submitted by beneficiary ministries to be approved by
Gouvermental Decision by the MEWF and MPF after they were analyzed and selected by the
Environmental Fund Administration. The project should be in line with the purposes listed in the
EU ETS Directive 2003/87/EC, article 10 paragraph 3 and in compliance with specific state aid
legislation.

The GEO no 115/2011 provisions mention that beneficiary ministries prepare projects, and
submit the projects for assessment and selection at the Environmental Fund Administration
(EFA). Based on this assessments, Ministry of Public Finance and Ministry of Environment, Waters
and Forests should initiate a Governmental Decision to finance the projects selected by the
Environmental Fund Administration.

Article 11 provides that:

The revenues obtained from the auctioning of the aviation sector allowances, in accordance with
Government Decision no. 780/2006 will be directed as follows (the amounts are negligible):

a) 70% of the gross amount is transferred to the Ministry of Transport;

b) 30% of the gross amount is transferred to the Ministry of Environment, Waters and Forests.

The Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of Environment, Waters and Forests are using those
amounts to finance projects aimed at reducing greenhouse gases emissions. To use these funds,
Ministry of Transport and Ministry of Environment, Waters and Forests should initiate
Governmental decision for the GHG emissions reduction projects, according to the provisions of
the GEO no. 115/2011.

Financial allocations from ETS auctioning revenues for the GHG emissions reduction projects
must comply with EU's state aid rules. This also means that proceeds from ETS auctioning
revenues cannot be used as co-financing for EU funds.

1.4.3. Use of revenues from auctioning of EU ETS allowances in Romania

While the original version of the GEO no. 115/2011 issued in 2011 specifies that projects should
be asses and selected by the Environmental Administration Fund, in practice, the proceeds until
2015 have been approved for specific projects, by directly amending the provisions of the GEO
no. 115/2011 and derogating from the original rule. In 2013-2014, according to MEWF, the total
amount collected from ETS auctioning is 260 mil. EUR.

Until now, there is no clear, effective procedure for the administration and share of ETS
auctioning revenues and no selection and prioritization criteria and guidance at the

                                                                                             41
Environmental Administration Fund. Until presently, 139 mil. EUR were allocated ad hoc by
derogation on several projects:

     investments in the Bucharest subway (Drumul Taberei - Universitate line) - 104 mil. RON (24
      mil. EUR). Beneficiary: Ministry of Transport
     purchase of school buses - 76 mil. RON (17 mil. EUR) for buses and 90.3 mil. RON (21. mil EUR)
      for microbuses for the transport in rural areas and for transport of participants in sports
      activities. Beneficiary: Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration
     purchase of microbuses and buses - 20.6 mil. RON (5 mil. EUR) for transport of participants in
      sports activities. Beneficiary: Ministry of Youth and Sports
     purchase of buses - 20.1 mil. RON (5 mil. EUR) for transport of participants in sports activities.
      Beneficiary: Ministry of Education
     reconversion of public transport buses from Diesel to liquefied gas - 22.3 mil. RON (5 mil.
      EUR). Beneficiary: municipality of Ploiesti
     implementation of bicycle infrastructure in Bucharest - 44.6 mil. RON (10 mil. EUR).
      Beneficiary: Ministry of Environment
     investments in the Bucharest subway Line IV - 188.5 mil. RON (43 mil. EUR) and Otopeni line
      - 38.5 mil RON (9 mil. EUR). Beneficiary: Ministry of Transport15.

The lack of selection and prioritization criteria as well as guidance for using the ETS auctioning
revenues for financing the GHG emissions reduction projects, allows the selection of projects
without proper assessment of benefits in terms of reduction of GHG emissions, cost effectiveness
and other important factors and might lead to the bias in the selection of projects. In addition,
these projects are often not well coordinated with sectoral OPs or other instruments to reduce
GHG emissions and there are few institutional links between Ministry of Environment, Waters
and Forests and the beneficiary ministries that would allow better coordination.

In brief, the situation in Romania could be described as follows:

-     ETS auctioning revenues are indeed used, but only in an ad hoc manner, because the properly
      defined financial and organizational scheme was not developed yet.
-     Money collected from the auctioning are deposited in the bank account of the Ministry of
      Public Finance and only by exception to the provisions of GEO no. 115/2011 is allocated for
      different priority projects that are considered by the Government.
-     Due to the RAS project, climate change topic was introduced into the Partnership Agreement
      and into the Operational Programs. Unfortunately most of the OPs are under serious delay.
-     On NER 300 there were 2 award sessions and Romania has not any project approved.

-   On Research and Inovation Program – Horizont 2020 the stakeholders encounter serious
    problems with cofinancing the projects, except for the state institutions that have support
    from the state budget for implementing such projects.

In order to constitute a viable and longer term climate financing program it is necessary to
amend the legislation in force and approve an updated financial and organizational scheme for
the use of funds from ETS revenues.

Even 4 years after its release, the GEO has still a provisory character as described in the article 3:
the Ministry of Finance is designated as auctioneer authority until the establishment/designation
of a national authority on climate change at the national level responsible for ensuring
implementation of the scheme for greenhouse gases emissions trading.

Since 2013, the Ministry of Environment, Waters and Forests was designated by the Government
as the national competent authority in charge at national level with the development of climate
change policies and strategies and the implementation of EU ETS as well.

Also, the current provisions of GEO are allowing only the ministries to be the beneficiaries of the
funds, excluding other potential stakeholders (for example: households, SMEs, farmers, local
authorities, NGOs etc.) that could contribute with significant emissions reduction. Or in a larger
interpretation if the responsible ministry is applying for its constituency (for example if the
Ministry of Regional Development is applying for households) the financial scheme will become
much complicated.

It is recommended that the current legislation should be revised and made more flexible and
based on clear procedures and competencies between authorities.

CHAPTER 2: PRIORITIZATION OF SECTORAL PROGRAMS TO BE
SUPPORTED FROM EU ETS ACTIONS REVENUE in Romania
2.1 Proposed criteria for prioritization
In order to maximize the environmental, social and economic impact of the possible sectoral
programs as well as based on international experience the World Bank expert team propose to
use the following criteria for prioritization of programs to be financed from EU ETS auctioning
revenues:

1.   Cost efficiency of Emissions Reduction;
2.   Leverage of public money to private finance;
3.   Possibility for rapid development and scale up,
4.   Lack of other financing mechanisms;
5.   Support for job creation.

2.2 Emission reduction potential and cost in non EU ETS sectors
An economic model developed by the WB in the RAS Climate Change program proposes green
actions for four sectors that will contribute to emissions reduction in the country by 45 Mt CO2
eq. in 2050, an equivalent of a 25 percent decrease in emissions from the level projected for the
Business as Usual scenario (BAU) in 2050. The largest share of abatement – 42 percent of the
total - is projected for electricity supply. Energy demand will provide a third of the overall
abatement and forestry one-fifth. The lowest share of the total emission reduction is projected
for transport. See Figure 9 for more details.




                                                                                              44
Figure 9. Romania Marginal Abatement Curve, cross-sectoral, 2050.

The graph shows that several household energy efficiency measures have negative costs
(benefits are exceeding the costs), this includes energy efficient lighting, energy efficient air
conditioning, and energy efficient household appliances (refrigerators and washing machines).
Also, several technologies in power supply, forestry and agriculture have positive, but very low
cost, this includes solar PV, wind, hydropower, and concentrated solar, as well as forest
protection management and housing insulation. The least cost efficient technologies are in the
transport sector.
A review by sector shows that energy efficiency measures are most beneficial in the Romanian
context, they have both high abatement potential and low, mostly negative cost. Electricity
supply measures also deliver significant abatement level at a relatively low (but positive) cost.
Forestry provides large abatement potential. Agriculture measures – no tillage and manure
management – are relatively cost efficient; they also promise to provide a significant abatement
benefit. The transport measures, however, have very high costs and, at the same time, a limited
abatement potential. This is consistent with the discussion of the transport MACs in literature
and is explained by the nature of the transport mitigation: the transport measures have multiple
objectives, including, apart from abatement, reduced pollution, lowered traffic, controlled noise,
reduced number of accidents, and improved quality of life. Abatement is not necessarily the main
objective or the main benefit of these measures; in some cases, such as with urban congestion

                                                                                               45
control, the objective is not abatement, but economic and social development (urban growth
and improved quality of life). Therefore, the transport measures have, by their nature, many co-
benefits.
The graph is presenting all the potential measures for reducing GHG emissions until 2050. The
most cost-efficient measures are those on the left side of the graphs that shall be implemented
first.
The average costs in each of the four sectors analyzed are also reflected in Figure 10. They range
from the negative Euro 78 per ton CO2e abated in energy demand, to Euro 15/tCO2e abated in
energy supply, to 49 Euro/tCO2 abated in forestry, to Euro 19/tCO2e abated in agriculture, and to
Euro 303/tCO2e abated in transport16.

2.3 Lack of other financing mechanisms
Based on analysis made in Section 1.3, the following sectoral programs could be a focus for the
allocation of revenues from ETS auctioning due to the gaps in existing financing:
Investments:


16
  It should be noted, however, that the ease of implementation of the measures and how soon the GHG reductions
are realized is not uniform. These factors should also be taken into account when selecting which ones to introduce.

                                                                                                                  46
1. Household’s building insulation (others than those included in the Regional Operational
Program and National Program Thermal Rehabilitation of the multi-levels buildings as indicated
above).
2. Replacement of the households’ light bulbs, households’ air conditioning, individual heating
systems, refrigerators and washing machines.
3. Developing small scale and household scale renewable energy production (existing
investments cover only larger producers).
4. Forestry, biomass production and land use improvement (complementary to any action
proposed in National Rural Development Plan for 2014-2020 or not covered at all in it).

In the process of designing the financing scheme from the EU ETS revenues, it should be taken
into consideration that absorption of EU funds is a priority for Romania and before spending
the EU funds for a specific priority, no other funds should be allocated, excepting the case when
it is addressing other categories of stakeholders not covered by the EU funds .

2.4 Support for job creation
Job creation potential as an important additionality to emissions reduction, due to it positive
effect on social cohesion, economic development and tax collection.
The biggest potential for job creation in Romania has the possible program for household’s
building insulation since it is labor intensive and most insulation materials are made in Romania.
From experience of Czech Republic (see Annex 1) the subsidy for thermal insulation of buildings
has proven to be one of the most effective in terms of creating job opportunities within the
national economy, particularly due to the high multiplication effect of ‘minor’ construction
activities. The multiplication effect occurs due to the high degree of work involved in the total
generated value in the sector and also to its established links to domestic suppliers, since most
of the input is also of domestic origin. The result of this chain is the markedly above-average
impact on economic growth of every RON invested within a short time period. Moreover, the
effect on the creation and maintenance of job opportunities is regionally distributed, which may
also be considered to be a major advantage of the program. Minor construction is one of the
basic components of a local economy and does not require any workforce migration or
immigration. According to authors rough estimates this program could create up to 15,000 jobs
during its implementation.
Implementation of small scale and household scale renewable heat and electricity production
program has also good potential for job creation in Romania since it requires installation by
domestic suppliers and is regionally distributed. According to authors rough estimates this
program could create up to 3,000 jobs during its implementation.



                                                                                               47
2.5 Leveraging of public funds
In this report leveraging refers to the process by which private sector capital is mobilized as a
consequence of the use of public sector finance and financial instruments.
It is an important factor since public funds are always limited and the possible program needs to
try to attract as much as possible of private finance to increase its climate mitigation effect.
Though this criteria depends on program design and selection of financing mechanisms, we
believe that the best potential for leveraging 1 RON of public money with 1-2 or more RON of
private money (savings of households’, loans from commercial banks to households and small
businesses, small businesses’ own investments) have the following possible programs:
1. Replacement of the households’ light bulbs, households’ air conditioning, individual heating
   systems, refrigerators and washing machines.
   If the public funds for the program will be equal to 88 mln. Euro, the program could attract
   up to 205 mln. Euro of private money, under conditions that public subsidy level will be 30%
   (explanation on calculation of investment program budgets, please see in Section 4.1.1).

2. Household’s buildings insulation.

   If the public funds for the program will be equal to 749 mln. Euro, the program could attract
   up to 1.39 billion Euro of private money, under conditions that public subsidy level will be
   35%.

3. Small scale and household scale renewable energy production.

   If the public funds for the program will be equal to 330 mln. Euro, the program could attract
   up to 612 million of private money, under conditions that public subsidy level will be 35%.

These subsidy levels are based on experience of similar programs in other countries and should
be considered as initial ones. However, if there will be low interest to participate in the programs
under proposed subsidy levels or government of Romania will want to assist low income families,
the subsidy levels could be increased up to 50%. The 30-50% subsidy for replacement of electric
appliances, buildings insulation and renewable energy installations will incentivize households
and SMEs to provide private finance for other 50-70% of the project costs.

2.6 Possibility for rapid development and scale up
The score on this criteria is based on combination of the following factors:
   -   program simplicity (as few institutions involved as possible, as few selection criteria as
       possible),
   -   compliance with state aid rules,


                                                                                                 48
   -   social and political acceptance,
   -   prior experience and existing expertise on the proposed or similar program,
   -   existing capacity to implement the proposed program.
The following possible programs have a good score on this criteria:
1. Replacement of the households’ light bulbs, households’ air conditioning, individual heating
   systems, refrigerators and washing machines.
   The program will have high social and political acceptance (will cover about 10% of Romanian
   households), will comply with state aid rules (there will be no preference to particular
   manufacturers), and Romanian government has previous experience with a similar program
   for scrappage of old cars (Rabla). The program could involve implementing agency, retailers
   and commercial banks. The energy consumption requirements for appliances could be made
   rather straightforward.

2. Forestry, biomass production and land use improvement

   The program, that to be focused on ecological reconstruction of forests damaged,
   establishment of growing woody crops for energy and non-energy purposes and
   establishment of forest belts and green corridors in areas with high natural risk, will
   contribute in a rather straightforward manner to emission reduction by enhanced removals.
   Such actions would have local and regional impact on rural economy, as well as higher
   protection of communities from natural disturbances and enhanced resources availability.
   Additionally, it will be also socially and politically acceptable, since forests have recreational,
   water regulation, soil conservation, and biodiversity values as well as provide timber and non-
   timber forest products and other values for public. Such program could be implemented
   quickly by Romsilva, which has capacity and prior experience for implementation of similar
   program.

These programs were either already implemented on a smaller scale or quite similar to already
implemented programs in Romania.

2.7 Proposed sectoral programs to be supported from EU ETS auctioning revenues
Based on the proposed criteria for prioritization, the following sectoral climate programs could
be considered during for 2016-2020 years.

2.7.1. Climate investment programs

1) Replacement of the households’ light bulbs, households’ air conditioning, individual heating
   systems, refrigerators and washing machines.


                                                                                                   49
A number of national campaigns focusing on the replacement of those appliances could generate
a considerable amount of emission reductions and could also contribute to collection of the
electrical waste. The program will have negative costs (benefits are exceeding the costs) – it will
generate more financial savings during several years for households than cost of electric
appliances. The program will have good leverage to private finance (households’ savings and
loans from commercial banks) and could be developed and implemented rather quickly since the
replacement and installment of electric appliances do not take much time. It is not supported by
other financial mechanisms and complies with state aid rules.

The campaigns could be run in partnership with the organizations responsible for recycling and
appliances and old equipment could be recycled and replaced by a new one with higher energy
efficiency and this could increase the public interest.

Also, the retailers of electrical equipment shall be involved as well as commercial banks focused
on consumer loans.

For implementing such a campaign there are a couple of options that could be developed:

a) A campaign run by the environment authority (s) with the support and co-financing from the
   organizations responsible for recycling bulbs and appliances. In this case there will be a
   double benefit – emissions reduction and collection of the electrical waste.
b) A program run by environmental authority in partnership with specialized NGOs and retailers
   accompanied by a media campaign on TV. The retailers that will decide to be involved will be
   reimbursed based on the effective sells of bulbs and appliances.
c) A competition for NGOs for developing regional campaigns.
Working with NGOs could offer the advantage to make the inventory of the withdrawn
equipment with its characteristics. This inventory is an important tool in calculating the emissions
reduction. It is expected that retailers will be pretty reluctant to develop such an inventory,
because it is over their mission.

An example of criteria for defining the program could be the followings:

- the type of electrical equipment that will be withdraw from households (ex. refrigerators,
washing machines, air conditioning etc.);

- the age of the equipment (ex. refrigerators older than 5 years) or energy class (only those from
class B- E) or energy consumption;

- the number of equipment that intend to withdraw ( ex. 200,000 of washing machines);

- the financial incentive that a household is receiving for buying a more performant equipment
(ex. 200 lei for buying refrigerator from the class A++ , 150 lei for buying one from A+ and 100
lei for class A or the same amount 150 lei for any refrigerator for the class A – A++).

                                                                                                 50
- the length of the campaign (ex. 6 months).

The second option is to produce a number of vouchers equal with the number of equipment that
was decided to be withdraw that could be distributed to retailers.

At the acquisition of a new appliance, if the owner decides to return an old one, he/she could
receive a voucher for discount (where the characteristics of the replaced equipment and those
of the new one should be inserted).

Every new equipment that is part of the campaign and respects the recommended energy class
will be discounted with the established amount.

It is important that the scrappage campaign will be accompanied by the media campaign, which
will underline that buying an energy efficiency equipment contribute the emission reduction. This
will contribute also to public awareness regarding the energy consumption and climate change
effects.

In this way apart of the emission reduction there will be also additional benefits:

- collection of electrical equipment;

- population awareness;

- market’s stimulation for energy efficient products.

The possible budget of the program could be 88 mln. Euro for 2016-2020 years. We consider that
the average cost of energy efficient appliance (such as washing machine) will be about 400 Euro.
The program could provide 30% subsidy (about 120 Euro per appliance) to cover cost of the
appliance. Since households will need to invest their own (or borrowed) funds, we expect that
the program will cover 10% of the Romanian households – about 732,000 (calculated as possible
program budget divided by subsidy per appliance).

We believe that information campaign about bigger financial savings during several years than
cost of efficient appliances will assist to overcome “lack of information/public awareness”
barrier, while the provided subsidy will overcome the financial barrier – relatively high cost of
efficient appliances for average Romanian household.

2) Household’s buildings insulation

The program will focus on individual private houses and not on multi-levels apartment buildings
that are covered by the Regional Operational Program.
It will cover only partially the costs of thermal rehabilitation to leverage private finance and will
have also the biggest potential for job creation in Romania. It will use construction materials that
are produced nationally, using local labor force and 1 euro invested into the program could bring

                                                                                                  51
about 2 euros of private money (savings of households or loans from commercial banks). We
propose that 35% of the thermal rehabilitation costs of a building could be provided as a
grant/subsidy and the other 65% will be provided by household.
The program could generate significant emission reductions and has low cost per ton of CO2e
reduction. It is not supported by other existing financial mechanisms and programs. The program
will comply with state aid rules because it is a private person who is receiving the grant and not
a company.
Each individual person who is insulating the house during the implementation period of the
program could apply for the reimbursement of the percentage established, based on the financial
and technical dossier submitted to the Implementing Agency of the program.
Also an energy audit will be requested to be provided by the applicants that will provide
specifications for the rehabilitation of the house and also assure the calculation of the emissions
reduction that could be accounted for the program’s indicators. The cost of energy audit could
be eligible for financing from provided subsidy.
The Ministry of Environment, Waters and Forests could increase the subsidy level for areas with
high levels of poverty and unemployment in a separate sub-program that could be managed in
cooperation with the Ministry of Labor, Family, Social Protection and Elderly and local authorities.
UNDP Romania in partnership with MRDPA and MEWF implemented between 2011 – 2015 years
the project “Improving Energy Efficiency in low-income households and communities in
Romania”.
A number of studies have been developed regarding population facing fuel poverty and its
consequences, measures that should be taken to mitigate fuel poverty and improve energy
efficiency, ecological materials for building’s insulation, that are available for public on UNDP
Romania website http://www.undp.ro/projects.php?project_id=63
Based on the studies already done the Implementing Agency of the program could develop a
separate sub-program for buildings rehabilitation for people facing fuel poverty in low income
communities.
The possible budget for the program is 749 mln. Euro for 2016-2020 years. Taking into account
the average cost of family house insulation in Czech Republic (19,730 Euro) and the fact that
average salary level in Czech Republic is about two times higher than in Romania, we consider
that average cost of insulation for family house in Romania will be about 10,000 Euro. The
program will provide 35% subsidy to cover the cost of insulation and thus the average proposed
subsidy could be 3,500 Euro per family house. Since households will need to invest their own (or
borrowed) funds, we expect that the program will cover 2.9% of the Romanian households –
about 214,000 (calculated as possible program budget divided by subsidy per family house).

                                                                                                 52
We believe that effective information campaign about expected financial savings during lifetime
of efficient family house insulation will assist to overcome “lack of information/public awareness”
barrier, while the provided subsidy will overcome the financial barrier – relatively high cost of
family house insulation for average Romanian household. The inclusion of energy audit ’s cost
into list of eligible subsidy expenses will also assist to overcome important information and
financial barrier.

3) Implementing local small scale and household scale renewable energy production

Though the renewable energy production is generally supported by other funds, the local small
scale production and consumption of renewable energy is not supported by any program.
This type of projects could be very useful for SMEs and households with individual family houses
who are interested to cover their consumption or for the small local authorities (small cities or
communes) that could discount the energy produced locally from the local consumption, which
will be beneficial for local budget.
It has good potential to generate significant emission reductions and has low cost per ton of CO2e
reduction. The program will have good leverage to private finance and will comply with state aid
rules.
The proposed budget of the program is 330 mln. Euro for 2016-2020 years. The program could
provide 35% subsidy to cover cost of the equipment. Since programs will cover households, SMEs
and small local authorities, which will have different investment needs, it is difficult to estimate
how many households, SMEs and small local authorities it will cover. The program will need to
have upper limit for installed capacity of renewable energy sources since it is not designed to
support large scale renewable energy installations.

In case of this program we again believe that effective information campaign about expected
financial benefits during lifetime of renewable energy equipment will assist to overcome “lack of
information/public awareness” barrier, while the provided subsidy will overcome the financial
barrier – relatively high cost of renewable energy equipment for average Romanian SME or
household. The inclusion of feasibility study’s cost into list of eligible subsidy expenses will also
assist to overcome important information and financial barrier.

4) Forestry, biomass production and land use improvement

The program will have medium cost per ton of CO2e reduction and could generate significant
emission reductions (carbon sequestration) as well as substantial contribution to improvement
in local people life, both by higher protection of communities against extreme events and
enhanced access to natural resources.
Proposed program will contain the following:


                                                                                                  53
GHG mitigation actions:
1) ecological reconstruction of forest damaged by natural and/or anthropogenic causes in the
regions with low forest cover;
2) establishment of fast growing woody crops for energy and non-energy purpose:
3) establishment of forest belts and green corridors in areas under natural risks and around
human communities (especially around cities);
4) establishment and improvement of grazing pastures in areas with public use.
Adaptation action:
5) Improvement of torrential catchments in river basins with critical risk for human and material
losses, with focus on high density populated area;
Activities proposed here are in line with the Climate Change Strategy and National Action Plan.
All these have to be complementary to any activity which may be funded from the National Rural
Development Plan (NRDP) 2014-2020, i.e. any eligible project under NRDP would not get finance
under this scheme. In order to ensure this, the program implementing agency would restrict the
funding applications and would also perform a project-by-project check against eligibility criteria
established under relevant NRDP measures (e.g. under M08). Moreover, specific terms of
reference for actions prioritization and project selection would be developed by the State
Secretariat for Forestry from the MEWF, with key focus on GHG emission reduction, CO2 removals
benefits and non-permanence risks assessments.
Solution for the implementation of this program has to be adopted within MEWF, with the
consultation of the Forestry Department, considering highest priority ranking among proposed
activities, operatively implementation and availability of technical skills needed.
Such activities can be achieved on private or public land, while projects can be either
implemented by National Forest Administration - Romsilva or other entity (e.g. private accredited
companies).
Actions proposed above should be financed 100% from public funds. This is because practically
there is no direct economic return expected for the proposed activity 1), 3), 4) and 5) for at least
first 20 years. For activity 2) there is a strong need to stimulate entrepreneurship above all in
rural areas close to land resources, being recognized a strong national potential highlighted and
prioritized in various strategy (e.g. Romania’s renewable action plan). Additional reason to offer
more public funding is an acute lack of financial resources demonstrated by insignificant effect
of past similar support, e.g. Measure 121 from NRDP 2007-2013 required partial co-financing of
afforestation or biomass crops establishment.



                                                                                                 54
In order to safeguard a positive contribution of Forestry and LULUCF to national climate change
mitigation objective an annual rate of 2,000 ha of afforestation (consistent with the National
Action Plan for Climate Change) and ecological reconstruction is proposed. The program possible
budget could be 110 mln. Euro during 2016-2020 for following activities: afforestation of 10,000
ha, establishment and improvement of grazing lands on 5,000 ha, and support for other activities
described above.
Actual costs follow technical specifications in individual project documentation, upon the activity
implemented. For example, for afforestation type activity, the average cost is around 5,000-7,000
Euro/ha until the complete establishment of trees (max 5 years since plantation started). In strict
terms of GHG mitigation benefit, afforestation generates an average annual amount of CO 2
removals of around 8tCO2/ha/yr (estimated for the first 20 years since plantations
establishment). Thus 10,000 ha of afforested land will provide annual emission reductions
(carbon sequestration) of about 80,000 tCO2 during the next 20 years after plantations
establishment. For 2021-2030 years this afforested land area will reduce GHG emissions in
Romania on about 0.64 million tCO2.

2.7.2. Research and technical assistance

Apart of those sectoral measures there are a number of cross-sectoral measures that could be
supported from the ETS revenues:
1. Developing capacity building for local and central authorities (training programs, climate
partners model presented in the capacity building report, etc).
2. Studies for improved knowledge on mitigation as well as on the early understanding of
potential effects on the national forest and forestry sector caused by projected climate change
and analysis on the adaptation options: e.g. monitoring systems for anthropogenic impact,
development of climate driven scenarios and simulation of forest production and productivity for
until 2050, genetic resources impact).
3. Studies that are included into the Climate Change National Action Plan and any other relevant
studies in line with the objectives of the EU ETS directive and Effort Sharing Decision.
All research and technical assistance activities should be in line with requirements of Directive
2009/29/EC.
We propose to use up to 1% of the revenue from the EU ETS actions (possible budget could be
up to 14.5 mln. Euro) for the research and technical assistance activities.

At the EU level, climate research was one of the main research themes of the EU's 7th Framework
Programme (2007- 2013) and now it is central to Horizon 2020, the new EU program for research



                                                                                                55
and innovation 2014-2020, budgeted to € 79 billion. At least 35% of the Horizon 2020 budget is
expected to be invested in climate-related objectives.

For example, the Horizon 2020 Societal Challenge "Climate Action, Environment, Resource
Efficiency and Raw Materials” (with a budget of about € 3 billion), supports mitigation research
and innovation projects. These projects aim at analyzing and mitigating the pressure on the
environment (oceans, atmosphere, and ecosystems) and improving the understanding of climate
change. In addition, research actions will focus on assessing impacts, vulnerabilities and solutions
for adapting to climate change, developing strategies for disaster risk reduction and stimulating
a transition to a low-carbon society and economy.

Due to the fact that EU ETS auctioning revenues is national financial funds, it can be used for
encouraging co-financing for the stakeholders that are applying to other European funds focusing
on climate change, like Horizont 2020 or Life plus.

2.7.3. Education and public awareness

Developing campaigns on education and public awareness regarding climate change issues
should be in line with the Climate Change Strategy and National Action Plan. We propose to use
up to 1% of the revenue from the EU ETS actions (possible budget could be up to 14.5 mln. Euro)
for education and public awareness activities.

2.7.4. Management and administration funds

Also, we recommend to use 5% of the revenue from the EU ETS actions (possible budget could
be up to 72.6 mln. Euro) for the management of the ETS scheme and 5% of the ETS revenues
(possible budget could be up to 72.6 mln. Euro) for the administration of the climate investment
programs).




                                                                                                 56
CHAPTER 3: PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS IN LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL
FRAMEWORK for use of revenues from auctioning of EU ETS allowances
in Romania
3.1 Inconsistencies of the current legal framework
Government Emergency Ordinance 115/2011 should be amended in such a way to offer efficient
and transparent implementation.

Current legislation is ineffective due to the following issues:

- Ministry of Public Finance is the auctioneer but the Government has to decide who will take
over this attribution permanently, because the GEO 115/2011 establishes that the MPF is the
auctioneer until a competent authority for climate change will be established.
- Environmental Fund Administration had to develop procedures for selection and assessment
criteria list and guidance and for developing the program and until now it did not happen;
- In the absence of clear view, strategic directions and lack of eligibility criteria and program
  methodology the projects were approved by Governmental Decision.
- The line ministries had a low interest for this legislation and did not develop the state aid
schemes according to GEO 115/2011.
- The Ministry of Environment, Waters and Forests as public authority responsible for
implementation of the EU ETS scheme in Romania has the duty to report to the European
Commission regarding the use of auctioning revenues according to the provisions of art. 17 of
MMR Regulation though its involvement into the process of distribution and management of EU
ETS revenues is limited and projects that are financed are not the most efficient ones and does
not have methodology for emission reduction calculation;
- The only applicants under the current legislation are the line ministries and other stakeholders
are not eligible to apply;
- Experience with the present legislation shows that more clear guidance is needed on
operationalization of the EU ETS auctioning revenues spending.

Implementation of the RAS Climate Change program with the World Bank offer a clear vision on
the big potential for emission reduction, the sectors where the most efficient measures should
be applied and the time frame for implementing those measures.

The process for elaboration the current report and the process of consultation with other
ministries and stakeholders revealed possibilities for improving existing legislation in order to
make it effective. Subsequent legislation need to be develop for setting up the program,
nominating the authorities responsible for its implementation, specifying the procedures and
monitoring and evaluating the emissions reduction.

                                                                                               57
Apart of the current legislation GEO 115/2011 some other regulations and procedures should be
developed such as:

-      Legislation for setting up the Climate Investment Fund;

-      Regulation on Advisory Committee;

-      Specific rules for grant budget administration;

-      Internal rules for personnel managing the fund;

and any other legislation that regulates the institutional arrangements.

3.2 Possible options for institutional arrangements of climate programs
Regarding the institutional arrangements, the World Bank expert team has analyzed the
followings four options for the fund/programs management:

1) Ministry of Environment, Waters and Forests will be the coordinator of the fund/programs;
2) Environmental Fund Administration will implement the fund/programs;
3) Other organization(s) with experience in managing funds/programs will manage
   fund/programs and select projects based on the terms of references prepared by the MEWF;
4) 4) MEWF will share the programs management with an organization having grant making
   experience.

For a better understanding a SWOT analysis will be done for each of the options.

3.2.1. Ministry of Environment, Waters and Forests manages funds/programs directly

At national level, the MEWF has the responsibility for setting up the national climate change
priorities on medium and long term to meet the EU objectives and obligations on climate change
targets in accordance with the latest EU policy developments on climate change an energy,
including for the post 2020 period.
MEWF knows exactly the importance of those funds and has the responsibilities of reporting the
results, having the interest to demonstrate domestic emissions reduction.
The weaknesses are related with the lack of expertise in grant making and the limited personnel
that the ministry has, correlated with the often uncompetitive level of salary (comparing with the
private sector or with salaries of Environmental Fund Administration) for some categories of
staff. As well, the management of the funds will require the increase of number of personnel in
order to allow the performance of activities.
On the other hand a dedicated fund/programs for mitigating climate change will raise the subject
on the public agenda and will increase the visibility of the ministry.

                                                                                               58
As the ministry has not in its attributions this type of activity a correction to the functional law
(GEO 215/2011 amended) should be done.
One major threat in the case of the MEWF as the manager of the fund/programs is that the
legislation regarding end of the fiscal year requires public authorities to redirect all the unspent
money to consolidated budget.
 S                                                  W
 - The MEWF’s responsibility for setting up the     - Lack of expertise in administrating funds

                                                    priorities or assigned personnel


3.2.2. Environmental Fund Administration manages funds/programs directly

The Environmental Fund Administration (EFA) has the advantage to have a specific law that is
governing grant making and having an experience of more than 10 year. Also an important point

                                                                                                 59
is that their programs are covering different type of stakeholders (local authorities, NGOs,
schools, companies, etc).
EFA has a considerable number of personnel specialized on programming, implementation,
evaluation etc.
The weaknesses are related with a controversial perceived reputation that it is using very
bureaucratic procedures and focusing mainly on the amount of spent money and less on the
results of the projects and the lack of specific knowledge and expertise on national and European
climate change policies as well on assessing the climate change impact in terms of emissions
reductions.
Giving the management of the funds/programs to EFA will require an institutional restructure to
build capacity on climate change issues and to build confidence in the institution.
Environmental Fund Administration was nominated into the GEO 115/2011 as the authority that
will manage the funds and had to develop the procedures for setting up the program, fact that
did not happen until now.
Also, EFA is designated to come with a solution for the use of the revenues from the Joint
Implementation - new entry reserve, accounting 1.6 million Euro, which also didn’t happen.

3.2.3. Other organization(s) (public or private) with expertise in grant making manages
     funds/programs directly

There are various public or private institutions that during the last years managed private or
public money (public money from other states like Norway or Switzerland).
For example on the energy efficiency sector the Romanian Energy Efficiency Fund (FREE) is well-
known for the companies and municipalities. Another company that managed funds in the
energy sector is Tractebel.
For the NGOs’ sector there are following foundations that are managing funds from the
government of Norway and Switzerland: Foundation for Civil Society Development and
Partnership Foundation Romania. Additionally, Partnership Foundation has expertise on climate
change, as well.
There are also other public institutions that are managing Swiss funds. One implementation body
is belonging to the Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration. Short
information about some of these organizations and their responsibilities cold be found in annexes
to this report.
One major obstacle in involving a private entity is the acquisition of the services if it will be done
with the minimum price as the law of public acquisition is requiring.

3.2.4. MEWF and other grant making organization manage funds/programs in partnership
     based on a legal framework

The last option could be the shared management of the fund/program between the MEWF, as
body responsible for the implementation of the EU ETS and reporting of revenues (coordinator)
and another grant making institution based on a legal framework.
The advantages are:

- MEWF could continue monitor the implementation of the program and focus on cooperation
with other ministries and strategic issues.
- MEWF could make the prioritization of the programs taking into account the obligations arising
at national level under the 20-20-20 package and those under the new 2030 energy and climate
legislative package in respect to the: emissions reduction, the transition to a low carbon
economy, improvement of energy efficiency and the renewable energy production.
- The grant making institution will contribute on monitoring the results/indicators of the project
in terms of cost efficiency and will provide MEWF further support for analyzing the impact of
financing the investments.
- Diminishing the risks due to separation of oversight and implementation part of the program as
well as political support provided by the ministry.
- Flexibility in managing the operational issues of program implementation by other grant making
organization.
- Efficiency due to combined existing expertise in grant making and monitoring as well as climate
change issues.

 - Linking CC policy with available funds and make it more
 coherent
 - Linking CC with other sectors priorities
 - Raising expertise on CC

3.3 Proposed financial and organizational scheme
The most suitable solution from the World Bank perspective is the fourth option where the
Ministry of Environment, Waters and Forest will set up a Coordination Unit (CIF CU) inside the
institution for supervision of the Climate Investment Fund. The Climate Investment Fund will be
created as a body subordinated to the MEWF and responsible for efficient use of EU ETS revenue
on climate investment, research and technical assistance, education and public awareness
programs. The Climate Investment Fund will select grant making and other organizations through
a tendering process that will implement concrete climate programs and will play the role of
Implementing Agencies (IAs).
The proposed main financing mechanism for the climate investment programs is combination of
public subsidy (30-35%) and private funds from households, SMEs and small local authorities
(savings or borrowed money from commercial banks – 65-70%), with exception for the “Forestry,
biomass production and land use improvement” program, which will be 100% financed by the
auction revenues (public funds). The subsidy level for concrete program could be increased from
the proposed in this report as a result of low interest to participate in the program or defined
need to focus on poorer strata of population.
We also recommend to explore in the initial phase of the Climate Investment Fund operation the
possibility of creation revolving fund program that will provide soft loans (below market rate) in
the sphere of renewable energy production and energy efficiency for SMEs and local authorities.
However, the operation of such revolving fund will go beyond the time period of 2016-2020 years
and that is why we did not include it as a separate proposed climate investment program.

CHAPTER 4: PROPOSED IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS FOR USE
OF REVENUES FROM AUCTIONING OF EU ETS ALLOWANCES in Romania
4.1 Rules and procedures of Climate Investment Fund

4.1.1. Introduction

Scope of the fund

Climate Investment Fund (CIF) is the tool for using revenues generated from the auctioning of
allowances from EU ETS for climate-friendly investments.

For the purposes of this report climate-friendly investments are defined as low-carbon or climate-
resilient investments that are aligned with the emissions reductions required to meet the EU
policy target of limiting global warming to 2°C. This means climate investments must not just
have a positive climate impact but must deliver emission cuts in a cost-efficient way.

Note: Environmental investments that have a positive environmental outcome but no low-
carbon or climate-resilient impact are not in scope for this report. An example of green non-
climate investments is investments for land to be used by a municipality for community parks
and recreational use. Although there may be social and aesthetic benefits to such investments
there is little climate mitigation or adaptation benefits. Instead, this report focuses on climate-
friendly investments.

CIF is an important tool that could contribute to the fulfillment of the Climate Change Strategy
objectives and respectively the implementation of National Action Plan.

CIF will not overlap with other available national or European funds dedicated to mitigate or to
adapt to climate change. It will be complementary to them. The funds from CIF could be also
used in case EU funds require national contribution as an application requirement.

Principles governing the fund

The principles that are governing the fund shall be similar with the principles for auctioning
allowances that are laid down in Article 10(4) of the ETS Directive: openness, harmonization,
transparency, and non-discrimination, simplicity, fairness, cost effectiveness (including
avoidance of undue administrative costs), predictability and efficiency. Fairness and efficiency
also imply mitigation of risks of market abuse (i.e. insider dealing and market manipulation)
through the auctions.

Institutions in charge with the implementation of the fund and their attributions

1. MPF will continue to be Romania’s auctioneer on European Energy Exchange (EEX).

                                                                                                64
In conformity with the provisions of art. 22 (alin. 2) of the EC regulation nr 1031/2010, the
Ministry of Public Finance is the competent authority for signing on behalf of Romania the
contract with the common platform and with any other system of compensation and discount
related with this.

MPF is managing the accounts for collecting the revenues from the EU ETS auctioning and for
disbursement to the other institutions. After taking 29% of revenues to state budget, the MPF
will transfer 71% of the revenues to the special “climate” account of the MEWF.

2. MEWF will set up a Coordination Unit of the Climate Investment Fund inside the ministry that
will have the following attributions:

- to prepare legal framework for establishment of the CIF;

- to prepare regulatory and procedural rules for Advisory Committee to the Minister of
Environment, Waters and Forests concerned with operation of CIF;

- to set up the fund in terms of regulatory and procedural rules and institutional capacity;

- to set up the objectives, priorities and framework for operation of the fund, including climate
investment programs;

- to select the climate programs and their corresponding budgets;

- to supervise operation of the fund by analyzing monthly and quarterly operational reports as
well as annual financial and implementation reports about progress in implementation of climate
programs;

- to monitor that the Fund adhere to the established by AC guidelines in its operations, including
selection of IAs, monitoring, reporting and verification activities of IAs and prepare proposals to
adjust priorities and organizational structure of the fund if necessary;

- to report to the European Commission on the use of ETS revenues.

The CIF Coordination Unit will be a structural unit of the Directorate General for Climate Change,
MEWF. Its status and attributions will be set up by the Minister of Environment, Waters and
Forests through internal ministerial regulation. The chief of the unit will report to Head of
Directorate General for Climate Change. Staff of CU will be selected by MOEWF as per
appropriate regulations for selection of civil servants.

After establishment of the Fund, CU will monitor activities of the Fund by analyzing monthly and
quarterly operational reports as well as annual financial and implementation reports about
progress in implementation of climate programs. In case of having questions on the reports the
CU will ask the Fund to prepare answers/clarifications on these questions. If CU will see the need


                                                                                                65
for corrective actions by the Fund in its implementation of climate programs, it could organize
working meeting at the level of chief of CU and relevant staff of the Fund or at the level of Head
of Directorate General for Climate Change and Director of CIF. If necessary the CU could elevate
the issue to the level of minister and AC.

Besides supervision the CU will support the Fund in its relations with other ministries and public
organizations, NGOs, private organizations, international organizations, Romanian Parliament,
mass media.

3. Advisory Committee (AC) will consist of representatives of the central authority for public
finance (currently Ministry of Public Finance), central authority for economy (currently Ministry
of Economy, Trade and Tourism), central authority for energy (currently Ministry of Energy, Small
and Medium–Sized Enterprises, and Business Environment), central authority for agriculture
(currently Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development), central authority for regional
development (currently Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration),
representatives from private businesses, climate science and non-governmental organizations..
The AC will provide credibility to the CIF and support it in its development, from the strategic
point of view, and the well-functioning of the fund.

The legal status of AC should be established by amended GEO no. 115/2011 (or possible new
law). The operational rules for AC as well as its composition will be set by MEWF regulation. It
will be a consultative body within MEWF focused on operation of CIF and implementation of
climate programs. It is recommended that AC will include not more than 10 members in order to
be effective. The representative of MEWF will chair the AC. The decision of AC will be made by
qualified majority (two third) of AC members. The decisions of AC should be approved by the
Minister of Environment, Waters and Forests in order to be implemented by CU and CIF.

The main tasks of Advisory Committee will be the following:

- provide input and guidance concerning strategic objectives for implementation of the climate
programs that will be financed by CIF;

- adopt guidelines on reporting and monitoring;

- adopt guidelines on disbursement;

- adopt guidelines on access to information on the CIF and climate programs;

- verify the evaluation process of the fund;

- provide input on the proposed tender rules for selection of Implementing Agencies, prepared
by CIF;

- approve annual financial and implementation reports of the CIF.

                                                                                               66
The AC will not supervise day-to-day operation of the CIF. This function is delegated to CU.

4. Climate Investment Fund (CIF) will have the following main attributions:

- to prepare the amount dedicated to the each call of proposals on concerned program, based on
the MEWF technical assessment and the Advisory Committee opinion;

- to organize tendering for selecting the Implementation Agencies;

- to supervise activities of the Implementing Agencies in order to ensure efficient implementation
of the climate investment, research and education programs;

- to approve the eligibility criteria for the projects, proposed by the IAs;

- to approve final list of projects to be financed and the amount dedicated to the each call of
proposals on concerned program, based on the MEWF opinion;

- to assess the progress and results of the programs based on the assessment of IAs, also in terms
of CO2 emission reductions achieved by the programs;

- to report to MEWF on implementation of climate programs.

CIF will be public institution and a legal person subordinated in its activities to the MEWF. The
Director of CIF will be appointed by the Minister of Environment, Waters and Forests through
open competition process. Its status will be established by amended GEO no. 115/2011 (or
possible new law). The MEWF will coordinate activities of CIF through CU. Staff of CIF will be
selected based on rules prepared by CU and approved by AC and Minister of Environment,
Waters and Forests.

5. Implementing Agencies will have the following main attributions:

- to elaborate the eligibility criteria for climate program, the guidelines and procedures for the
different calls of proposals, the indicators for monitoring and verification;

- to prepare concrete plan for implementation of the climate program, based on parameters
established by the CIF;

- to inform the stakeholders about the scope and parameters of the program;

- to launch the calls of proposals;

- to evaluate the received project proposals;

- to prepare the proposed list of projects to be financed and the amount dedicated to the each
call of proposals on concerned program and submit them for approval to CIF;

- to inform the beneficiaries about the results of their project proposals;

                                                                                               67
- to assess the emissions reductions to be achieved through the projects selected before making
the preparing the final list of projects to be financed;

- to supervise as well as work in closed cooperation with the projects proponents;

- to arrange the disbursements to the beneficiaries based on the rules and procedures;

- to monitor and evaluate the progress and the results of the projects;

- to report to CIF about the progress and results of concrete climate program;

- to evaluate and report to CIF the climate change indicators reached within the program.

The IA could be an existing public, non-governmental and private organization that is legal person
and has relevant experience, capacity and knowledge to implement particular climate program.
CIF will select IA through tender and coordinate/manage IA under guidance from AC and
supervision from CU. IA will directly work with beneficiaries of particular climate program.

In some cases, when there is no organization in Romania with relevant experience, capacity and
knowledge, CIF could implement climate program directly, without IA. However, such cases
should be properly justified and approved by AC and CU.

Legal framework applicable to the program

CIF should be in line with the provisions of the ETS-Directive 2009/29/EC, Article 10, which states:
“Member States shall determine the use of revenues generated from the auctioning of
allowances. At least 50 % of the revenues generated from the auctioning of allowances […] should
be used for one or more of the following: (a) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including by
contributing to the Global Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fund and to the Adaptation
Fund [..], (b) to develop renewable energies [...](c) measures to avoid deforestation […] (d)
forestry sequestration in the Community; (e) the environmentally safe capture and geological
storage of CO2, in particular from solid fossil fuel power stations; (f) to encourage a shift to low-
emission and public forms of transport; (g) to finance research and development in energy
efficiency and clean technologies in the sectors covered by this Directive; (h) measures intended
to increase energy efficiency and insulation or to provide financial support […] (i) to cover
administrative expenses of the management of the Community scheme.”
                                                                                                   69
Apart of the modification on the current legislation regarding revenues from ETS there will be
necessary new pieces of legislation regarding setting up and operationalization of the CIF,
attributions of the Coordination Unit, Implementing Agency and Advisory Committee,
functioning procedures, etc. that will be developed further on.

Time frame

The CIF will be set up for the time frame of 5 years 2016 – 2020.

The first year of the program (2016) will used for setting up the legal framework, administrative
frame, institutional capacity and launching of the programs, and the other 4 years for effective
implementation.

The program could be extended taking into consideration the amount available and the results
of the ex-post evaluation of the program.

Financial frame

Latest estimation by World Bank

The World Bank in its report “The EU ETS up to 2030: decoding auctioning challenges for
Romania” (mostly prepared in the end of 2014) estimated that Romania could earn from ETS
revenues an amount of 2.379 billion Euros in 2016-2020 years (five year period) under scenario
of annual reduction factor of 1.74% and middle range price scenario (6-12 Euro per EUA). Taking
into account the difference between the actual figures of EU ETS revenues for 2013 and 2014
years, received from the Romanian government, and the WB estimates, the World Bank team
applied 14% discount factor to the projections from its report. This way we came to figure of
2.046 billion Euros of EU ETS revenues during 2016-2020 years.

The 29% of those revenues are transferred to the consolidated budget and from the remaining
funds (in amount of 1.453 billion Euros), that should be spent on emission reduction activities,
we proposed to use 1% for the research and technical assistance, 1% for education and public
awareness, 5% for the management of the ETS scheme in Romania and 5% for
administration/management of the investment programs, financed from EU ETS revenues (see
Section 2.7 of this report). Thus we come to about 1.278 billion Euros available for investment
programs during 2016-2020 years with the following distribution among the proposed programs:

1. Household’s building insulation – up to 750 million Euros.

2. Replacement of the households’ light bulbs, households’ air conditioning, individual heating
systems, refrigerators and washing machines – up to 88 million Euros.

3. Developing small scale and household scale renewable energy production – up to 330 million
Euros.

                                                                                              70
4. Forestry, biomass production and land use improvement – up to 110 million Euros.

Review of the annual allocation shall take place every year and unspent allocation on the current
year will be redistributed for the next years.

Management costs

Estimated value of the management cost is 5 % of the allocated budget (up to 72.6 million Euros)
for 2016-2020 years or up to 14.5 mln. Euros annually.

Management costs shall include the costs of running the fund, costs of the evaluation and
monitoring, costs of internal and external audit, costs of publicity and information sharing.

Beneficiaries

-   Local communities

-   Individuals/households/farmers

-   Private sector

-   Local authorities

-   NGOs.

All the beneficiaries and their applications should comply with the eligibility criteria of the
program. A proposed list of eligibility criteria is presented in Annex 3 of the report.

4.1.3. Eligibility of expenditure and subsidy level

Eligibility of expenditure

   Additionality of funding

The CIF is intended to create an additional source of funding for mitigating and adapting to
climate change and shall not replace financial support from other sources, including local and EU
grants, subsidies, bank loans etc.

   Starting date for eligibility of expenditure

Eligibility of expenditures incurred after the signing of the contract, if it is not decided on another
way.

Percentage of Grant/Subsidy

Proposed percentage of grant/subsidy

1. Household’s building insulation – 35%.
2. Replacement of the households’ light bulbs, households’ air conditioning, individual heating
systems, refrigerators and washing machines – 30%.

                                                                                                    72
3. Developing small scale and household scale renewable energy production – 35%.
4. Forestry, biomass production and land use improvement – 100%.

These subsidy levels are based on experience of similar programs in other countries and should
be considered as initial ones. However, if there will be low interest to participate in the programs
under the proposed subsidy levels or government of Romania will want to assist low income
families, the subsidy levels could be increased up to 50%.

Grant rate for private sector will be in accordance with the State Aid legislation in Romania.
State aid shall be granted in accordance with the terms and conditions specified in the Regulation
of the Council of Ministers dated 22 December 2006 on establishing the scheme of regional aid
for certain environmental protection investment projects (Journal of Laws No. 246, item 1795, as
amended).
The intensity of the state aid for Greening Activities is calculated by taking into consideration the
total value of state aid from all sources stipulated in the financial engineering of a given project
and cannot exceed the acceptable intensity of public aid specified in the Regulation of the Council
of Ministers dated 22 December 2006 on establishing the scheme of regional aid for certain
environmental protection investment projects (Journal of Laws No. 246, item 1795 as amended).

4.1.4. Cost overruns and savings on investment budget

In case the project costs exceed the budgeted cost in the grant agreement, the Beneficiary shall
ensure additional funding.
If the final cost of the project is below the total cost stipulated in the grant agreement, the overall
sum of grant paid will be reduced accordingly and any unduly paid amounts reimbursed by the
Beneficiary.
The Coordination Unit may recommit the unused funds for new programs/projects. Applications
for the recommitment of funds shall be processed in the same way as applications for other
projects.

4.1.5. Application procedure

Applicants

All public or private sector bodies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) constituted in
Romania as legal entities and operating in the public interest - e.g., national, regional and local
authorities, education/research institutions, environmental bodies, voluntary and community
organizations and Public-Private Partnerships and demonstrating concern and activity on climate
change sector may apply for grant.

                                                                                                    73
Partnerships between private and public institutions should be encouraged but not for avoiding
public tenders.

Publicity and access to information

The IA and the Beneficiary of the grant shall ensure that the existence of the CIF as well as
information on approved projects are communicated in the most efficient way to users and the

                                                                                             75
public at large and that the contributions of the CIF are given adequate publicity. The CIF shall
ensure that a publicity plan is prepared for the program by the IA and similary the IA shall ensure
that each project has a communication component that is submitted along with grant
applications.

The IA shall be responsible for the financial control and audit (in case of big projects) of approved
projects. The IA shall ensure that efficient and prompt investigations of any suspected and actual
cases of fraud and irregularity shall be undertaken and shall inform CIF thereof.

Audits and inspections

The CIF may decide on audits and inspections at the IA anytime and will inform CU before an
audit/inspection is carried out.

The authorized representatives of the CIF or accredited auditors employed by the CU shall be
granted access by the IA to any documents or information they deem appropriate, including
those created or stored in electronic form. They shall in particular be given access to the accounts
of audited institutions and documents relating to expenditure financed by a grant from the CIP.

The authorized representatives shall also be given unrestricted access to projects implemented
by private or commercial institutions and NGOs.

The results of the audits shall be presented to CU and AC.

4.1.8. Completion of projects

Completion of projects

The IA shall prepare a project completion report according to the requirements of the grant
agreement. The CIF shall make the final disbursement based on the project completion report.
The completion report shall be done in accordance with guidelines on reporting and monitoring
adopted by the Advisory Committee.

                                                                                                  76
Mid - term review and Ex-post evaluation of the climate programs
The mid-term review shall take place after 2 years of implementation of the climate program. An
ex-post evaluation shall be carried out after completion of the program.
The mid-term review and ex-post evaluations shall be carried out by an independent body
selected through tender. The body carrying out program evaluation shall submit a report to the
CU and AC.
The ex-post evaluation report shall not replace other reporting requirements.
The ex – post evaluation shall contain also the climate change indicators (GHGs reductions,
carbon intensity, etc.) and recommendations for continuation and improvement of the program.

Other post-completion obligations

IA shall ensure that projects that involve investment in real estate and/or land (including
renovation) are operational at least 10 years after they have been completed, unless otherwise
stipulated in the grant agreements.

An ex-post evaluation of projects that demonstrates non-compliance with the Rules and
Procedures and the grant agreements may give the CIF reasons to take corrective action,
including claiming the reimbursements of funds.

4.2 Project implementation scheme
The projects follow the project management cycle:

1.      Initiation stage – starts with the launching of the call for funds based on the priorities
established by the Advisory Committee of the Climate Investment Program.

The program shall provide all the necessary information on time for potential beneficiaries.

It is recommended that a number of information sessions to take place in different cities, for
explaining the aim of the fund, the objectives and the eligibility criteria.

At the time of launching, all the administrative documents shall be ready and public, for being
analyzed with the stakeholders (applications guides, indicators, letter of intent, application form,
etc.).

The documents should not be changed during the implementation stage. This was one of the
reason why the Operational Program on Human Resources Development 2007 – 2013 had
multiple problems in implementation.



                                                                                                 77
 The deadline for submitting the applications is an important key in the process. Preferably for
 the transparency and predictability of the program the number of calls should be known from
 the very beginning. It is recommended to have 1 or 2 calls per year and the launching time to be
 maintained every year (for example: April and October). This can help also the beneficiaries in
 setting up their priorities and estimating the efforts for project proposal writing and
 implementation process. The allocated amount for each call it is also important to be known in
 time. That’s why a multi-annual allocation is important to be done from very beginning.

2. Appraisal and Due Diligence stage
The IA shall receive the project proposals at the deadline established in the guide of applicants,
register them, and inform the applicants regarding the application number received.
It is recommended to the IA to develop and use an electronic web- based platform for registering
the applications online, in order to ensure transparency of the program.
IA shall assure the evaluation process based on clear and transparent evaluation criteria. A
proposal shall be evaluated by at least 2 evaluators. The evaluators are responsible for their
appraisal. The ranking set up by the evaluators are submitted by the IA to the CIF that can check
randomly the submitted applications.
In case of inadvertences in evaluations the CIF could ask IA for re-evaluation.
IA shall inform CIF on the final approved list of projects as well as the list of reserves and the list
of not- approved projects and will made them available to the public with the score obtained.
All the participants shall be informed about the score obtained.
The applicants could submit a contestation at the evaluation that will be treated responsible and
will receive a clear and valid answer in a certain time (ex. 1 week).

3. Approval and signing stage
Upon receiving approval of the final list of projects from the CIF the IA shall conclude the
contracts with the beneficiaries.

4. Implementation, Supervision and Monitoring
CIF shall transfer the advance payment to the beneficiaries and the projects implementations
starts.
IA has the duty to supervise the implementation of the projects and to run at least one monitoring
visit to each big project during the implementation time.
All the beneficiaries shall submit progress report about the stage of implementation, estimated
expenditures done and results. At the middle term of project implementation each beneficiary
submit a narrative and financial report.
Only after approval of the midterm report, the beneficiaries shall receive the next disbursement.
The last installment will be disbursed at the end of the project implementation based on the final
narrative and financial reporting.

5. Completion and evaluation stage
A completion report shall be done by IA for each project and submitted to the CIF.
The IA shall make an annual evaluation for the projects implemented or under implementation
that shall be submitted to the CIF.




                                                                                                    79
The evaluation shall contain also the climate change indicators like carbon intensity, ton of CO 2e
reduction, etc. IA shall also evaluate the way how the program was implemented and to proposed
to the CIF a list of proposals for improvement.
IA could conduct consultations with the beneficiaries in order to find better ways for
implementing the program. The CIF takes note of the IA proposals and could propose to CU and
AC new measures for improvement of the program.

CHAPTER 5: POSSIBLE USE OF FLEXIBILITY MECHANISMS IN NON EU ETS
SECTORS
   5.1 Flexibility mechanisms in ESD
The Effort Sharing Decision contains flexibility mechanisms to help Member States achieve their
targets until 2020. The current flexibilities can be grouped in three categories:
a) Within a Member State: banking and borrowing between years
b) Between Member States: trading of AEA and project-based mechanisms
c) International: credits from CDM/JI projects

The purpose of these flexibilities for Member States is to enhance the overall cost-effectiveness
of reaching the EU-wide 2020 target.
For the 2030 perspective the European Council has expressed its desire that "the availability and
use of existing flexibility instruments within the non-ETS sectors will be significantly enhanced in
order to ensure cost-effectiveness of the collective EU effort and convergence of emissions per
capita by 2030." Flexibility instruments should be simple, transparent and easy to manage for
Member States. The intention that international project credits will not be allowed in the ESD
after 2020 means that a stronger emphasis on the two existing internal flexibility mechanisms
will be needed.

   5.2 Banking and borrowing of AEAs during the compliance period
Member states are allowed to carry forward during 2013-2019 a limited amount (up to 5%) of
AEAs from the following year and carry over unused AEAs to subsequent years up to 2020 to
cover any AEA shortage in specific years. Different levels of borrowing than the current 5% limit
could be envisaged for the period after 2020 to help Member States achieve their annual targets
by managing their own AEAs, bearing in mind that a higher level of borrowing early in the
commitment period could increase the risk of individual Member States not meeting their targets
later in the period.

   5.3 Transfers of AEAs between EU Member States
During 2013-2019 EU Member States may transfer up to 5% of their AEA for a given year to other
Member States, which can use this emission allocation until 2020 (ex-ante). Overachievements
in a year between 2013 and 2019 may also be transferred to other Member States, which may
use this emission allocation until 2020 (ex post).
There are several possible ways to stimulate AEA transfers among Member States. These include
creating a more transparent market for AEA transfers, being less restrictive in how much Member
States can transfer among each other before the compliance checks, and more direct measures

                                                                                                 81
to enhance availability of AEAs, such as project-based mechanisms or auctioning of a number of
AEAs.
Market transparency could be enhanced by requiring Member States to report more openly and
frequently on AEA transactions and prices or by encouraging transfers to pass through certain
trading platforms.
The current 5% limit for AEA transfers before the compliance check could be increased, however,
it should be noted that increasing this limit could also increase the risk of individual Member
States not meeting their targets later in the commitment period 2021-2030.
Different kinds of project-based mechanisms for cost-efficient compliance within the ESD could
be considered. Such an approach could attract targeted investments in ESD sectors prioritized by
the host Member State and ensure more certainty that AEAs will become available for transfers
by potentially allowing private sector initiatives. However, a verification and certification system
would need to be established to guarantee the environmental integrity and validity of the credits
which would entail upfront administrative costs.
Auctioning of a certain percentage of AEAs could ensure that an annual supply of AEAs becomes
available for MS to acquire.
Romania is overreaching its target for 2020 and it will be in the position to sell AEAs to other
countries. Based on the EEA analysis, currently 13 MSs will need additional efforts to meet
domestically their 2020 targets, while other 15 MSs are already projected to reach these
commitments with existing policies and measures.

   5.4 Credits from CDM/JI projects
Member states are also allowed to a certain extent to purchase international credits every year
(CERs - under Clean Development Mechanism and ERUs - under Joint Implementation
mechanism). The use of project-based emission credits is capped yearly to 3 % of 2005 ESD
emissions in the Member State. Member States that do not use their 3 % limit for the use of
project-based credits in any specific year can transfer their unused part for that year to other
Member States or bank it for their own use until 2020.

   5.5 Situation with emissions under ESD in 2013
The Figure 12 below presents the situation for 2013.
It is expected that for 2030 the allocation to be more restrictive, but on the other hands the
borrowing between two phases seems not to be possible at least at this moment.
The next phase of ESD is under public consultation at this moment.



                                                                                                 82

projections have been checked yet by EEA.

ANNEX 1: Experiences of EU countries on use of EU ETS revenue
CZECH EXPERIENCE

In the Czech Republic, legislation introduced in 2008 enabled the sale of AAUs (later applicable
to EUAs in 2009-2012). In 2012, the new emissions trading act was approved, which applies the
same rules for ownership and management of allowances as previously for AAUs. The proceeds
from auctioning of allowances are income of the state budget, of which at least 50 % are
earmarked for measures that reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions, increase energy
efficiency, for district heating networks, industry, buildings, transportation, for research and
development, adaptation to climate change, climate-related development aid and administration
of EU ETS and Registry. The earmarking of just 50% for climate targets is not compliant with EU
ETS Directive, which requires that 62.35 % of EUA and 100 % of EUAA revenues should be
earmarked for climate, whereas the Czech Republic has earmarked only 50 % of EUA+EUAA
revenues. In 2014, the legislation was amended so that revenues up to 12 mil. CZK (450 mil. EUR)
should be 100 % earmarked for stated purposes, and revenues exceeding this amount are
transferred to the state budget (point a in the graph below). The share of earmarked revenues
cannot be lower than 100 % of EUAA revenues + share of EUA revenues as in Art. 10(3) of the ETS
Directive. If total revenues from auctioning of allowances reaches 19 mil CZK (point b in the graph
below), the funds that are transferred to state budget, SEF budget and MIT budget should
increase in the same proportion.




The total revenues would be split 50:50 between the State Environment Fund (SEF) and the
Ministry of Industry and Trade (MIT). Unlike SEF, until now MIT does not have a well-designed
program with clear priorities (it organizes calls for energy savings in public buildings, which
duplicate OP Environment and is not implemented; supports renewables, not implemented; and
finances an information campaign related to proper use of energy labels of buildings). In practice,
until 2014, funds were transferred from MIT to SEF to supplement the budget.

The Czech Government has set up a State Environmental Fund (SEF) as agency within the Ministry
of the Environment. It supports environmental investments and administrates national and EU
programmes. The funds may be carried over to the next year. The Fund operates a Green Savings
Programme since 2009 and for 2014-2020 a new Programme has been approved, following also
the amendment of the legislation concerning the use of proceeds from auctioning the
allowances. The amendments of the program take into account the findings of studies in 2012
undertaken for the Ministry of Environment, which showed that investments in construction
activities in district heating networks and energy efficiency improvement in buildings have a GDP
multiplier of about 2.63. The new program brings several adjustments: it is less focused to
complex insulation of buildings, it cancelled the list of qualified suppliers to meet the
requirements of the public procurement legislation, it recommended a list of products and
technologies. It also extended the eligibility to investments previously made and simplified
administration (e.g. banks not involved, less documents needed, no check from AAU buyers).

Flow of funds to SEF: Allowances are auctioned by the power exchange OTE, and the revenues
are transferred to the Ministry of Environment. The Ministry issues guidance on how the money
should be spent and projects should be prioritized. SEF administers the application process,
whereas payments are approved by the Ministry of Environment, which manages the funds.

Since 2009, the SEF administrates the Green Savings Programme which finances insulation of
buildings; replacement of heat sources with low efficiency; and promotes low-energy
construction of buildings. Eligible expenditures include actual insulation for households - family
houses and apartment buildings, with or without panel technology, and public buildings; project
documentation; and technical assistance. Applicants include individuals and legal persons
(associations of flat owners, municipalities). Apartment houses are eligible only in Prague (other
regions may apply for funding from EU funds administered by the Ministry of Regional
Development). Also, the call for public buildings should not be opened until funding from OP
Environment will be disbursed, to avoid overlaps. The application process is as follows:

1) finding a project designer and an energy expert

2) discuss the project with local construction authorities

3) filling in an overview form with the energy specialist

4) filling in an online application

5) printed application and other documents are submitted at one of the SEF offices within 5 days

6) application check

7) application acceptance

                                                                                               85
8) finding a constriction supervisor

9) choice of materials, suppliers, realisation of the project (A: 18 months, B: 24 months, C: 9
months)

10) final application evaluation

11) registration and decision on subsidy assignment

12) payment of the subsidy

13) final project evaluation

The application may be submitted before, during or after the implementation of the project. SEF
might approve only partial payments, depending on the level of environmental improvements
achieved.

Subsidies may cover a maximum of 50 % of eligible costs: for family houses up to 5 mil. CZK (0.2
mil. EUR); for apartment houses up to 10 mil CZK. Other factors might be included to support
investments in specific areas, e.g. in regions with worse air quality eligible costs are increased by
a factor of 1.1 and in sites with historical buildings by a factor of 1.3.

Building insulation was defined as a priority based on a study (Deloitte) that indicated the
potential for emissions reduction and the program was also very popular and politically feasible.
The most popular projects financed under the Green Savings Programme are housing insulation
and replacement of coal-fired boilers with biomass boilers.

In 2009-2014, SEF disbursed 20,300 mil. CZK (750 mil. EUR). SEF is financed from sales of AAUs
(20.5 bn. CZK) and national budget (0.5 bn. CZK).




                                                                                                  86
SEF undertakes on-site inspections before, during and, after execution of the project, to check
the quality of works. There are also financial inspections to check the proper disbursement of
funds. About 8% of all applications are checked.

POLISH EXPERIENCE

Poland administers a complex program to reach its climate targets, fully correlated within
national and regional public budgets, consisting of a multi annual framework (6 years), in line
with EU and with the national strategy for environment.

Since 2008, when Poland met the criteria to trade AAUs, the Ministry of Environment executes
the AAU Purchase Agreements on behalf of the State Treasury of the Republic of Poland. Since
2009 the Ministry of Environment concluded 10 AAU Purchase Agreements amounting to EUR
190 million. The scheme for the management of the proceeds from the sale of allowances is
illustrated below. The revenues are administered by National Fund for Environmental Protection
and Water Management.

The National Fund is a Governmental agency with an annual budget of €1–2 billion. The Fund
administers all programs concerning environment and climate (see figure below), regardless of
sources of funding. It has its own strategy for support programs, which is approved by a
supervisory board that includes several line ministries. Certain priorities are earmarked,
according to requirements from specific legislation (e.g., Energy Law, which provides penalties
for non-compliance with certain obligations and requires the proceeds from such penalties to be
used only for energy projects). Apart from the earmarked funds, the remaining sources are
"pooled" and allocated to priority programs with own budgets, own deadlines for
implementation, ecological objectives, and assessment criteria, which are integrated in NEF's
strategy. The model requires high level of technical competencies, complex prioritization for the
preparation of NEF strategy, solid coordination among line ministries to decide the strategy, and
coordination with the regional environment funds from each of the 16 vojvodships (regions).


                                                                                              87
The National Fund selects projects through a competitive procedure, supervises Greening
Activities implementation, ensures proper monitoring & reporting and reports on the
implementation to the Ministry of Environment.

Figure: Polish model of managing proceeds from sales of allowances




The National Fund's main revenue sources are: replacement charges for energy obtained from
RES and penalties according to the Energy Law; fees resulting from the Act on Recycling of End-
of-Life Vehicles; concession and maintenance fees; fines and fees for economic use of the
environment; financial revenues; and revenues from the sale of AAUs. It also supports projects
in a variety of forms, as repayable loans, as grants, as subsidies for interest rates.




                                                                                            88
The Fund manages a series of broad horizontal environment priorities and programs, which are
fully correlated with national and regional environment strategies. The selection of projects to
be financed under each of these priorities is done through competitive calls depending on
available funding. The selection criteria consist of:

- eligibility criteria: formal criteria and substantive criteria

- environmental effect, immediate and sustainable; data and assumptions must be reliable

- technical feasibility - proper selection of technologies, realistic implementation schedule

- cost analysis - proper assessment of costs for investments, operation, maintenance

- financial structure (including cofinancing)

- choice of technology based on alternatives

- criteria for selection of project: cost efficiency.

The main programs supported by the NEF are:

1. The Green Investment Scheme „GIS” (Total budget 860 mil. EUR for 2010-2017). The main
source for GIS consists of proceeds from auctioning of allowances.

GIS aims at reducing CO2 emissions by funding projects to improve energy efficiency in public
buildings and in buildings owned by national budget units. Eligible public buildings include local
authorities and associations, Volunteer Fire Brigades, universities, health care institutions,
NGOs, churches etc. that provide services in health care and social assistance. Buildings under
national budgetary entities concern building belonging to government administration, state
budget institutions, Polish Academy of Sciences and its research institutes, state and local cultural
institutions, municipal and district state owned fire brigades. The main investments concern
thermal insulation and efficient lighting. The GIS provides grants (30% of eligible costs) and/or
loans (up to 60% of costs) for public buildings. For the buildings owned by national budgetary
entities, GIS provides grants of up to 100% of eligible costs. So far, GIS has supported energy
efficiency measures in 1,533 buildings and contributed to a reduction of CO 2 emissions by
200,000 Mg/year.

2. "LEMUR" Energy-efficient Public Buildings (Total budget 69 mil. EUR for 2010-2017)

LEMUR supports projects for the construction or reconstruction of low energy or passive public
utility buildings and finances design documentation and construction of buildings. Eligible
beneficiaries consist of legal entities that provide public utility services, e.g., legal entities of the
public finance sector (excluding state budget institutions), local legal entities, commercial

                                                                                                      89
companies 100% owned by local governments, NGOs, churches etc. The amount and type of
financing (loans or grants) varies from 10% to 60%, depending on the environment gains
(emission reduction, energy savings). The CO2 savings would reach 30,000 Mg/year.

3. Energy efficiency improvement (71 mil. EUR 2013-2022)

The program supports energy efficiency in new constructions of residential buildings. Eligible
applicants are individuals and provides grants (up to a certain amount) for the support of
construction or purchase of single-family houses or flats. The funding is channelled through 6
banks.

4. „BOCIAN”- decentralised, renewable energy sources (136 mil. EUR in 2015-2023)

BOCIAN supports energy production from renewable sources construction of small capacities:
wind farms, PV micro-hydropower plants, geothermal, biomass (max. power 20 MW) and biogas
biomass high-efficiency cogeneration, solar collectors for thermal energy generation with heat
storage and agricultural biogas plants. Applicants are entrepreneurs. The program finances loans
of up to 85% of eligible costs and maximum 40 mil PLN. Until now, 48 projects have been
approved.

5. Promotion of renewable energy sources

- Grants for solar thermal collectors (107 mil. EUR in 2010-2014): The program supports the
reduction of CO2 emissions by providing funding for heat production from renewable sources.
Beneficiaries include individuals and housing associations. The funding is channelled through 6
banks. The support consists of a bank loan (from the bank’s own funds) up to 100% of project
costs, whereas the National Fund provides a 45% grant to partially repay the principal of bank
loans. Over 67,000 installations have been supported so far.

- „Prosument” – RES installations (190 mil. EUR, 2014-2022). The program provides support to
increase electricity and heat production from small scale renewable sources and finances both
the equipment and the technical documentation. The goal is to reduce CO2 by 215,000 Mg/year
and increase energy from RES by 470 MWh / year. The financing is administered through local
communities, through banks, or through the regional environmental funds. It provides partial
grants (20% for heat, 40% for electricity); partial subsidy for interest for bank loans; and the level
of financing declines in 2016. Total financing per beneficiary is also capped.

6. „KAWKA”- elimination of low emission supportive growth of energy efficiency and
development of distributed RES (68 mil. EUR, 2013-2028).

The program supports the elimination of low emission related to improving energy efficiency and
the use of high-efficiency cogeneration systems and RES reduction of air pollutant emissions from

                                                                                                   90
municipal transport. It supports the switch from individual or coal heat boilers to district heating;
expansion of district heating; high-efficiency boilers, heat pumps, solar collectors, thermal
renovation of blocks of flats, and the reduction of air pollutant emissions from municipal
transport. It provides grants and loans and applicants can be from cities above 10,000 inhabitants
or touristic areas. The CO2 target is a reduction of 65,764 Mg/year.

FRENCH EXPERIENCE

The French had different legislations before and after 2013 for the use of revenues from
auctioning of allowances. Before 2013, there were no auctions scheduled in French NAPs I & 2,
though France announced its intention to use the market to fill up the NER when needed. In 2012,
at the end of phase 2, France obtained 43.46 M€ from non-aviation early auctions. In 2013, under
ETS, France obtained about 210 M€. Since 2013, France changed its legislation on the use of
revenues from ETS auctioning. It earmarked all revenues for housing programs undertaken by
the National Agency of Housing (ANAH) up to 590 M€ per year to meet the presidential
commitment to renovate 500,000 homes per year by 2017 (120,000 social housing and 380,000
private housing). Housing renovation was a priority in view of the increasing concerns on “energy
poverty” (i.e. higher share of energy bills in households’ spending), but also because such work s
are labour-intensive and could reduce unemployment.

Since 2013, when money is allocated for housing:




Priorities: ANAH's budget is targeted at 4 priorities: renovation of degraded houses; promoting
energy-efficient renovations and fighting energy poverty; adapting homes to the loss of

                                                                                                  91
autonomy due to disability or aging; supporting distressed condominiums. The budget for 2015
was allocated as follows:




Staff: 120. ANAH operates through 186 local delegations (Local offices of the National Agency for
Housing), which distributed 46% of Anah’s subsidies in 2014.

Instruments: ANAH uses grants for means-tested beneficiaries (individuals - owners, home-
lenders; condominium associations); and also grants for social, financial and technical assistance
to ensure quality, ambition and cost-effectiveness of renovations. Grants cover only up to 50%
of the cost and up to a certain amount, depending on income levels. All projects have to include
an energy audit (before and after), which allows reporting on the use of auction revenues.
Another Government program, "Habiter mieux", with a budget of 125 M€, and local budgets, can
top up funding from this scheme.

Project selection: Eligible projects are identified in collaboration with regional administrative
units. At the regional level, the State representatives (préfets) forecast the needs for ANAH’s
subsidies, according to the Agency priorities and with the help of the regional administration. In
2014, 69% of subsidies are granted for operations planned in collaboration with local authorities.
Local authorities (city and department levels mainly) organize call for proposals for beneficiaries,
based on specific tools developed at the national level to help (e.g. Energy-efficiency
ambassadors scheme). There is also a national information platform created in 2013
(“Rénovation Info Service”) which aggregates existing calls and opportunities. Applications are
submitted at the local level and projects are approved when all due administrative documents
are provided. ANAH circulates detailed instructions on project evaluation and provides support
to local teams at the national level (“hot-line” + training sessions). Justifications of the works
have to be provided to trigger ANAH’s payment.




                                                                                                 92
During implementation, projects are monitored and audited internally and externally, first at
local level and by sample by central level. External audits are mandated by the Ministries of
ecology and housing. The whole program is evaluated mid-term and at the end.

Results: In 2014 there were 75,000 houses renovated, 716.8 M€ distributed for a total of 1,400
M€ worth of works (179.3 M€ outside of ANAH’s budget). The average subsidy amounted to
6,318€ for homeowners. The average energy efficiency improvement: 38%. 3 out of 4 projects
benefitted also from Habiter mieux financing. Under Habiter mieux, there were 49,831 EE
renovations (+60% from 2013; +300% from 2012) and 571 M€ distributed (average subsidy
11,460€).

50% of beneficiaries are 60 or older, 46% live in small or very small towns and 45% under the
poverty threshold (compared to their share of just 14% in the general population). In June 2013,
the means tests were lowered meaning more couples and less-than-40 homeowners became
eligible.

Expenses in 2012-2014 in M€




Main lessons learned: The choice for massive financing of one policy creates political visibility
and coherence, though ex-ante earmarking creates uncertainty regarding the actual amount of
funds available. However, earmarking revenues facilitates traceability and reporting.

Revenues were estimated in 2012 while EU ETS allocation for phase 3 was not finalized. The
market price dropped between 2012 estimates and 2013 auctions, which required that ANAH
had to use its treasury to close the year. Including ex-ante estimates in the budget of ANAH
created major problems. Renovation subsidies have gained more clarity since 2013. The main


                                                                                              93
changes included simplification of eligibility criteria (only two categories of beneficiaries) and
simplification of subsidies’ levels. This policy needs strong involvement of local partners.
Unbalanced budgets requiring budget subsidy to complete the program could jeopardize the
system’s stability. In addition, renovation works are complex and take time to be decided and
implemented. The communication campaign since 2013 has attracted more public interest.
Possible solutions to the issue of having to forecast earmarked revenues are to use (very)
conservative assumptions for the first years that can be fine-tuned later. Also, another method
could be to delay the use of auction revenues to the following years.

FLEMISH EXPERIENCE

The Flemish Climate Fund was set up in 2012 to contribute to the Flemish mitigation plan for
non-ETS. The Fund is financed through the auctioning of EU emission permits. The generated
revenues are used to finance the effective and cost efficient implementation of Flemish climate
policy with a focus on mitigation. For 2013 and 2014 the budget is € 36.5 million. The Fund's
structure is presented in the illustration below:




Since in the BAU scenario the emission targets could not be reached, the Flemish Climate Fund
can co-finance measures to reduce emissions below the BAU case and integrate mitigation in all
relevant policy domains. The funds are used for projects in various sectors (housing, agriculture,
energy consumption metering, transport measures such as bicycle lanes, replacement of public
transport vehicles, renewable energy sources etc.

Project selection: projects are submitted by different ministries. They are evaluated based on
multiple criteria: cost efficiency (75%, determined as EUR from the fund to reduce 1 ton of CO 2);

                                                                                               94
additionality (complementarity without overlap with other policies) and other criteria
(implementation trajectory, low carbon economy, renewable energy, sustainability -
environment, economy, social). There are trade-offs among various criteria which have to be
taken into account. E.g. Efficiency vs additionality - very efficient measures would perhaps be
undertaken without support. Efficiency vs long term climate goals: e.g. heat pumps not efficient
now but needed to reach 2030 and 2050 goals. Measures should also stimulate other policy
domains, e.g. stimulate directly initiatives of private sector, NGOs and local authorities. Also, it
might be more difficult to finance many small measures than to finance a single large project with
less burden. There is also a trade-off between the political freedom to select and decide vs
objective framework for selection of measures and budget allocation.

Different ministries proposed 34 new measures, of which 14 were selected and allocated 20 M€
in total.

Allocation by sector:



                                 2%


                        23%

                            Agriculture

The main projects financed included:

1. Buildings

           •   Grants for deep renovation:

                   •    Subsidy for deep renovation for Social Housing Companies (7,9M€)


                                                                                                 95
                    •   Increased renovation grant for combined investment in wall insulation and
                        glazing (3,7M€)

           •     Specialized energy advice for:

                    •   Heritage buildings (350.000€)

                    •   Tourist infrastructure (450.000€)

           •     Telemetry (electricity, gas and water) in school buildings (25.000€)

           •     Increased energy efficiency grants for SMEs

2. Non-ETS industry

           •     Intensive sectorial energy guidance and advice for SMEs

3. Transport

           •     Additional Flanders Logistics consultant for SMEs (750.000€)

           •     Subsidy for charging infrastructure for electric vehicles on carpool parkings
                 (500.000€)

           •     Shore-power infrastructure for inland navigation (100.000€)

           •     Subsidy for CO2-low busses (600.000€)

4. Agriculture

           •     Energy consultancy project for farmers (400.000€)

           •     Investment support for small scale fermentation (pocket digestion) on farms
                 (2.250.000€)

           •     Investment grant for pilot project low value residual heat from waste incinerator
                 for greenhouse cluster (1.900.000€)

 So far, half of the selected policies were implemented. The total expected reduction of GHG is
 4.5 Mton CO2-eq reduction over the lifetime of the investments, for 20M€ (compared to total
 non-ETS emissions Flanders in 2012 = 49.9 Mton CO2-eq).

SPANISH EXPERIENCE

In Spain, since 2005, the auctioneer is the Secretary of state for Environment, which signed a
cooperation agreement. The funds are received the day after the auction in a target account in

                                                                                               96
the Bank of Spain, managed by the Secretary of State, and weekly, revenues are transferred to
the Treasury. Legislation in 2012 specified that 90% of the auction revenues, up to €450 million,
would be allocated to the power sector (renewable energies), in a program managed by the
Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism; and 10% of the auction revenues, up to €50 million,
would be used for other climate change policies, managed by the Ministry of Agriculture, Food
and Environment. Since 2012, the amounts collected reached 1 bn. EUR.

Most of the support went to the production of power from renewable sources.

                                                                                     Average support (EUR/MWh)

The Carbon Fund for a Sustainable Economy (FES-CO2) provides financial support to projects that
reduce emissions by purchasing carbon credits. It supports GHG reduction projects in sectors
such as buildings, transport, non-ETS industry, agriculture, waste, HFCs. Its priorities are on
meeting climate change commitments; transition to low carbon sustainable economy;
enhancement of economic activity, growth and employment; and support for the Spanish
productive sector: public-private cooperation to foster green economy.

Among projects financed:

–    Agriculture: Farm: Recovery of methane from anaerobic digestion of manure to produce
     energy/heat with this biogas.

–    Residential: Sport complex: Replacement of diesel/butane boiler for biomass boiler to supply
     heat.

–    Waste: Waste treatment facility: Production of biofuel by flash pyrolysis of solid waste.

–    Industry: Manufacturer of beverage cans: Implementation of new processes to reduce
     heating needs.

–    Transport: Chemical company: Modal shift for raw materials transport from road to rail.




                                                                                                                        97
–     F-gasses: Supermarkets: Substitution of fluorinated coolants with high GWP for other with
      lower/non GWP.

Project selection: The funding is granted based on a payment for ton of CO2-eq reduced. To be
eligible, projects must be developed in Spain; to ensure additionality (not required by other
sectoral regulation); must reduce emissions from non-ETS sectors; and they must have
measurable and verifiable emission reductions so they can be reflected in the national GHG
inventory. Applicants must send an initial project concept; then for shortlisted projects a more
detailed project design document. There are clear guidelines for the concept (project idea note);
for the design document; methodologies to estimate GHG reductions ex ante and ex post;
assessment criteria; verification manual.




Monitoring: Verified emission reductions of each project achieved during the first four years of
the project are acquired (performance-based finance inspired by Kyoto project based
mechanisms).

- PIMA Aire: Subsidies for replacing vans for less emitting models; also purchasing electric bicycles
(€9.6 million for PIMA Aire4, €40 million aprox in total)

- PIMA SOL: Emissions reductions bought by the Government when hotels are refurbished to
improve energy efficiency (€5.2 million, EIB to provide financing)

- PIMA Tierra: Subsidies for replacing agricultural tractors for less emitting models: €5 million

- PIMA Residuos: Subsidies in waste-related projects: €8.2 million

- PIMA Empresa: Emission reductions are bought by the government when enterprises reduce
their carbon footprint - €10 million, under preparation.
