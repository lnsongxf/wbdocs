Abstract: This report aims to provide an updated analysis of labor market trends for the health workforce
in Peru, focusing on the basic health team —physician, nurse, and midwife—and other health professionals
related to current priorities. Peru has been labeled as a country with a shortage of health professionals (that
is, with less than 25 professionals per 10,000 inhabitants), and although the most recent numbers indicate
that the situation has improved, the shortages are bound to become more acute as the country aims to
achieve Universal Health Coverage. We found that the country trains both in public and private universities
a large number of professionals, but that the majority of trained professionals do not then go on to work for
the public sector. This dynamic had not been described before and challenges current assumptions of
human resources needs and availability. There is very little reliable data on numbers, type and work
conditions for human resources working outside the public sector, including the social security insurance
health system (EsSalud), other health insurance providers, and the private sector, and as a result no
detailed information can be obtained about the distribution of health professionals outside the public sector.
For policy purposes, it is necessary to improve the quality and integration of HRH information across the
sector.

                                      EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report aims to provide an updated analysis of labor market trends for the health workforce in Peru,
focusing on the basic health team—physician, nurse, and midwife—other professionals related to health
priorities—specifically nutritionists, psychologists, pharmaceutical chemists, dentists, and medical
technologists—as well as main medical specialists—anesthesiologists, family and community doctors,
general surgeons, internists, obstetricians/gynecologists, and pediatricians. Moreover, the study reviews
and synthesizes the existing peer-reviewed and grey literature on human resources for health (HRH) in
Peru and provides guidance on potential policy interventions and management changes focused on these
professions that may improve the current situation of human resources for health in the country.

The study’s main limitation is that it is focused mainly on public employees, that is, those hired by the
Ministry of Health (MINSA) and the regional governments. The information (for instance, the number, type,
and distribution of professionals) of human resources working in the social security health insurance
(EsSalud) and the private subsector is limited to current data held by the MINSA’s National Observatory on
Human Resources for Health, which is provided voluntarily and not necessarily on a regular basis. Lack of
information on current salary levels and how these compare across subsectors, as well as unemployment
rates for these professionals are other limitations of this study.

We used three main strategies for data analysis: (1) Reviewing documents, reports, or academic literature
published by MINSA, other national and international organizations, or published by research groups in
scientific journals; (2) using data from primary sources without merging them with other data; and (3)
merging and/or combining data from different sources. Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain reliable
primary data for our migration and retention analyses.

This study is organized according to a conceptual framework that seeks to represent specific characteristics
of the flow of human resources for health through the Peruvian labor market (Figure 1.1). The report is
organized in six sections, each one of which corresponds to one component of the framework: training of
health professionals, transition of graduates to the labor market, contracting, migration, retention, and
postgraduate training.

TRAINING OF HEALTH PROFESSIONALS

We analyzed the current state of supply and demand for training of health professionals, and the number
of graduates. Overall, there is a high interest in, and demand for, training at a professional level for careers
that form the basic health team, and more than 70 percent of this training1 is supplied by private universities.

We also reviewed the competency profiles of trained professionals as evidenced by: (a) the curricula of the
medical, nursing, and midwifery training programs with the highest number of students; (b) the standards
prepared by the National Council of University Evaluation, Accreditation and Certification (CONEAU) that
are used to accredit education programs for these professions; (c) the competency profiles developed by
the respective professional associations for the purpose of certifying graduates. These curricula and profiles
were compared to the prioritized competency profiles of primary care physicians, nurses, and midwives
prepared by MINSA. The objective was to determine whether the current training programs prepare
professionals to work at the primary care level—as defined by the MINSA competency profile. Results
showed a clear disparity between the profiles of health professionals at the training/graduate stage and the
one required by MINSA at the primary care level, which is the main employer of health professionals in the
country. In particular, physicians and nurses appear to lack preparation to work at the primary care level.

Furthermore, we find that MINSA’s profiles for professionals in the basic health team lack skills related to
prevention, health promotion, and management. For example, MINSA’s competency profile for nurses only
requires them to provide adult care in the case of tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS, while the full burden of
preventing and treating NCDs is assigned to physicians. MINSA’s approach to NCDs at the primary care
level may result in a lack of appropriate attention to the prevention and treatment of people with early
symptoms of NCDs who need to implement lifestyle changes (diet, exercise) to prevent progression of the
disease.

CONEAU is the institution responsible for accrediting training programs and certifying professionals, and it
has established a process to regulate and guarantee the quality of university education. However, the
accreditation process has advanced slowly: as of July 2013, 45 universities had registered for accreditation
234 training programs for the professions (physicians, nurses, midwives, nutritionists, psychologists,
pharmaceutical chemists, dentists, and medical technologists) included in this report, but only 2 of these
programs had completed the accreditation process.

TRANSITION OF GRADUATES TO THE LABOR MARKET

In the second section of the report, we review data on the transition of graduates to the labor market via
the Rural and Urban Marginal Health Service (Servicio Rural y Urbano Marginal en Salud—SERUMS).
SERUMS is one of the strategies used by MINSA to increase coverage of primary health care professionals
in rural and marginal areas, and is a requirement for those health professionals who would like to work in
the public sector. The vast majority of health professionals who enroll in SERUMS spend a year working at
the primary care level in rural or urban-marginal areas.

We reviewed data on the number of SERUMS positions, applicants’ profiles (that is, the university they
graduated from), number of graduates who take up SERUMS positions, number of those completing
SERUMS who start to work for the public sector in subsequent year, and the conditions of their employment.

                                                       xi
For most professions included in this study, except for physicians, a significant number of graduates do not
to take up a SERUMS position. This finding indicates that currently the labor market of human resources
for health in Peru offers other job opportunities that do not require previous SERUMS experience. After
completion of SERUMS, only 25 percent of professionals are incorporated into (hired by) the public sector
the subsequent year. Furthermore, those who do join the public sector after completing SERUMS do so
mainly under temporary employment agreements. Considering the data reviewed, we conclude that the
market offers other job opportunities to these professionals that are more attractive than SERUMS and
public sector employment.

CONTRACTING OF HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR

In this section we present the distribution of health professionals within the public sector at a national level,
and provide information on the contracting modalities used within this subsector. The information on HRH
working outside the public sector (contracted by either MINSA or the regional governments) is incomplete
and therefore it was not possible to review contracting of health professionals in the labor market outside
of the public sector or make any comparisons. The public sector has at least 10 contract modalities or labor
conditions; we presume there is a great variability in salaries though we had no access to data of salary
levels for this study. Even though salary may not be the only factor shaping workers’ decisions about a job
position, such salary variability is probably an obstacle in attracting and retaining high-quality and motivated
professionals to the public sector.

We also estimate the number of health professionals that the public sector needs to provide services
compared to the number of professionals in the current health workforce, the time needed to reduce the
health workforce gap in the public sector, and the measures that may be adopted to accelerate that
process.2 We find that in a scenario in which the number of professionals incorporated into the system is
doubled, the gap of physicians required by MINSA3 could be closed by 2020; alternatively, if the absorption
rate stays at the current level, such a gap would be closed by 2027. The respective numbers for nurses, at
the absorption rates described, would be 2019 and 2024. For midwives, our calculations show that the gap
may be resolved by 2017 with the current hiring rate. It is worth mentioning that these calculations are
based on relatively simplistic assumptions and do not control for the increased need of HRH related to
population increases or an increase of the elderly population, natural attrition, or workforce turnover and
retirement for instance.

MIGRATION

We examined published information on migration of Peruvian health professionals, as well as health
professions students’ intentions to migrate abroad. Data from the university census carried out in 2010
showed that a majority of students reported that they intended to migrate to practice their profession (78
percent of medical students, 67 percent of nursing students, and 60 percent of midwifery students). Other




2. The gaps are based on the actual demand of medical procedures of the Essential Health Insurance Plan (Plan
Esencial de Aseguramiento en Salud—PEAS), as well as other administrative and training activities that are part of the
labor duties of these professionals at the primary care level.
3 This gap is estimated by quantifying the difference between the need for and the availability of human resources for
health care services. The need for human resources is estimated using an estimate of the time required to provide the
medical services of the Essential Health Insurance Plan ( Plan Esencial de Aseguramiento en Salud —PEAS) as well
as other health care activities not considered in PEAS, and management and training activities that are part of job
duties in the primary care level. The unit that is used to calculate the human resource gap for health care services of
the primary care level is the health micro-network.

reports show that many professionals, particularly physicians and nurses, do indeed migrate, and the loss
for the country, especially of professionals trained by public universities, is high. This section highlights the
need for improved information on migration flows of Peruvian health professionals to gain an understanding
of the migration situation and design policies to respond to it.

RETENTION

In this section, we summarize and discuss the few available studies on incentives to attract and retain
health professionals. These studies show that very few physicians expect or aspire to work at the
community level or in rural areas. Furthermore, many have already migrated to larger urban areas to pursue
their studies. A discrete choice experiment of job preferences related to remaining in working placements
located in rural Ayacucho highlights the significance of incentive packages, and how they can change
according to profession, years of experience, and gender. Data collected by MINSA’s Quality Office show
that the majority of health workers consider their job environment could be improved, which could be an
indicator of job satisfaction. However, the available information for analysis is limited, since there are no
labor force surveys, for instance, or more information about salaries and benefits in other subsectors.

POSTGRADUATE TRAINING

We describe the supply and demand for specialized physician training focused on specialties related to
health priorities: anesthesiology, family and community medicine, general surgery, internal medicine,
obstetrics and gynecology, and pediatrics. Furthermore, we present the distribution of those specialists per
level of care and department, and analyze the demand for specialists’ training and their integration into the
public sector workforce once they have completed their residency.

We find a high demand for training in these priority medical specialties. In 2013, more than 43 percent of
physicians beginning their residencies were associated with them. We find that the distribution of specialists
between the different levels 4 of health establishments is relatively appropriate as it responds to
requirements established by MINSA; however, geographic distribution is extremely unbalanced with more
than half of the specialists being located in Lima.

The National Committee of Medical Residency (CONAREME), which regulates medical specialist training
in Peru has developed competency profiles for each specialty. We examined the profiles of priority
specialties to determine the extent of priority or approach given to the primary care level. We find that only
the gynecology and obstetrics, and the family and community medicine specialties, give some priority to
primary or community care. Although, primary care training might not be expected for general surgeons,
internists and anesthesiologists, as they would not be expected to perform necessarily at primary care
levels, it could be expected that some consideration would be included in pediatricians’ training, given that
they might be providing care at primary care level.

The analysis of the resident training dynamics and of the incorporation of specialists into the public sector
shows that only 10 percent of specialists start working for the public sector in the first two years after
completing their residencies, indicating that a significant number of specialized human resources are not




4. Health establishments are categorized according to the level of care that they can provide —from the least complex
to the most complex.

                                                         xiii
used in the public sector. Unfortunately, little is known about where these specialists choose to work, how
many migrate (from/to where), or how to attract a larger number of them to work in the public sector.

RECOMMENDATIONS

Our recommendations can be grouped in four areas: (i) the relevance of skills of health professionals; (ii)
contracting, compensation, and retention policies to improve absorption and retention of health
professionals in the public sector; (iii) the quality of information on HRH; and (iv) research to inform the
policies for implementation.

Relevance of skills of health professionals
 We recommend that MINSA’s General Director’s Office for Management of Human Resources
   Development (Dirección General de Gestión del Desarrollo de Recursos Humanos—DGGDRRHH)
   work with public and private universities to review existing training programs and develop new programs
   focused on training professionals to work specifically at the primary care level. Programs could look
   beyond the currently available programs and include shorter, more community-oriented courses. If
   these shorter courses are associated with a high likelihood of employment after completion, they may
   be well received in a market with a high demand for training. Considering that private institutions
   currently provide the majority of training in the health professions, they would play an essential role in
   the development of new training programs. In addition, it would be important to offer these courses in
   the local regions close to student residences, as students from rural areas may be more likely to enroll
   and work in their region of origin.
 The accreditation process for training programs will need to be made more agile if it is to guarantee
   training quality. We recommend a more detailed assessment of CONEAU’s processes to understand
   the difficulties and propose steps that could speed up the certification process.
 Professional associations are already playing a role in certifying professionals; however, this process
   does not add value or improve a professional’s employment opportunities in the labor market, and it is
   unclear whether it includes any assessment of skills. The certification process should be widened to
   include an assessment of skills that would guarantee professional quality and improve job opportunities.
 MINSA’s profiles for the basic health team would need to be updated to adjust responsibilities for caring
   for NCDs and adult conditions. Nurses need to assume a larger role in the prevention and management
   of chronic conditions. Furthermore, other skills such as administrative management, and public health
   prevention and promotion need to be considered within these profiles.

Contracting, compensation, and retention policies within realistic budgetary scenarios
 In terms of contracting, the public sector relies on a multitude of contract regimes, which seem to be
   paired with wide divergences in salary. We recommend that MINSA take a global look at contractual
   regimes and payment schemes and strategically review compensation mechanisms.
 The SERUMS program has been successful at ensuring the presence of health professionals in rural
   and remote areas; however, it is not accompanied by a mechanism to retain these professionals in the
   public sector. We recommend that SERUMS be complemented with a retention strategy, based on a
   more complete assessment that includes studies that explore the job aspirations and expectations of
   new graduates. Post-SERUMS professionals signaled their interest in working for the public sector by
   enrolling in SERUMS—the public sector should capitalize on this knowledge in its attempts to hire and
   retain professionals.

Quality of information on HRH
 There is a fragmentation in the information systems between MINSA, EsSalud, the other health
   insurance providers and the private sector, and as a result, no comprehensive information can be

                                                     xiv
    obtained about the distribution of health professionals by subsector. For policy purposes, it is necessary
    to improve the quality and integration of HRH information both in the public sector and outside of it. To
    achieve this, there is a need for strategic alliances with entities that routinely collect data on human
    resources in these subsectors, such as EsSalud, private insurance providers, professional
    associations, and corporations managing clinics and private hospitals. The challenge would be to
    create a relationship in which there is common interest in sharing this information. Such information will
    strengthen subsequent studies on the employment market of HRH as it provides a more complete
    vision of the entire sector.
   In regards to migration, there are still many unanswered questions. For instance, there is little
    information on how many professionals leave the country to work, how many continue studying, how
    many come back, and when. There are outstanding questions as to when more aggressive retention
    strategies should be applied, for example, before or after SERUMS, before or after the residency? To
    be able to answer some of these questions, MINSA will need to work with the Bureau of Immigration
    and Naturalization (DIGEMIN) to improve the quality of information on health professional migration.

Research to inform the policies for implementation
 Professional incorporation into the public sector will require the development of contractual, incentive,
   and retention packages that are based on better understanding of health professionals’ aspirations,
   expectations, and needs. Studies on new graduates, those who complete their SERUMS, current public
   sector workers, other subsectors workers, and unemployed health professionals may provide
   information on job expectations, relative options in the market, and salary and social benefit
   expectations, which we were not able to analyze in this study. Some methodologies that may be used
   include surveys, discrete choice studies, and focus groups, among others.
 In our analysis of the dynamics of medical specialist training and absorption of specialists by the public
   sector, we find that absorption by the public sector is minimal, at approximately 10 percent. It would be
   important to research the flow of medical specialists within the market and understand what happens
   with them, where they end up working, and why. Moreover, we need to understand how MINSA can
   manage to attract and retain more specialists within its budgetary limitations.

LIMITATIONS

This study has several main limitations:

   The discussion of human resources in health that is presented in this report focuses on the public
    sector, and this limitation was mainly driven by availability of data. At the same time, the discussion on
    human resources in health should be framed within a broader discussion on the role of the public sector
    in health service delivery, and the role of other providers including EsSalud, the other
    insurance/provisions institutions like the Metropolitan Solidarity System (Sistema Metropolitano de la
    Solidaridad—SISOL) and the private sector providers.
   Even within the public sector, our analysis is limited by availability of data in several areas.

JUSTIFICATION

In 2011, Japan celebrated the 50th anniversary of its own achievement of Universal Health Coverage
(UHC). On this occasion, the government of Japan and the World Bank conceived the idea of undertaking
a multicountry study to share country experiences from countries at different stages of adopting and
implementing UHC strategies, including Japan itself. This led to the formation of the Japan-World Bank
Partnership Program for Universal Health Coverage. A total of 11 countries participated in the study,
including Bangladesh, Brazil, Ethiopia, France, Ghana, Indonesia, Peru, Thailand, Turkey, and Vietnam.
(Ikegami et al. 2014) This report is a background report to the Peru Country Summary Report that was
prepared by the World Bank. This study also is part of the implementation of a September 2013
Memorandum of Understanding between the Peruvian Ministry of Health and the World Bank, which
outlines a program of cooperation and technical assistance between the two institutions.

The Peruvian government has started implementing Supreme Resolution No. 001-2013-SA, and it has
proposed a series of guidelines and reform mechanisms for the health sector (July 2013). 5 Of particular
importance among these are the following: strengthening the health public sector, encouragement of health
promotion actions; protection of individuals and families by extending the current insurance coverage until
universality is achieved; upgrading of health professionals’ work conditions to support prop er conditions for
their development and for carrying out their duties; improving regulation of and access to quality medicines;
and improving the use of health resources, reducing household out-of-pocket expenses, and increasing
public funding for health.

Therefore, this study aims to meet the objectives of the Japan-World Bank Partnership Program for
Universal Health Coverage, as well as MINSA’s needs, within the context of the abovementioned reform.
This study was carried out in collaboration with the General Director’s Office for Management of Human
Resources Development (Dirección General de Gestión del Desarrollo de Recursos Humanos —
DGGDRRHH) of MINSA, PARSALUD, and the World Bank.

OBJECTIVES

The objectives of this report are the following:

   Analyze recent trends of the health labor market in Peru for the basic health team professionals
    (physician, nurse, and midwife) and other professionals related to health priorities, specifically
    nutritionists, psychologists, pharmaceutical chemists, dentists, and medical technologists, as well as
    how they impact the UHC strategy implementation in the country.
   Review and synthetize existing literature on the health workforce situation in Peru to provide context to
    the labor market analysis.
   Provide guidance on potential political interventions and management changes focused on these
    professions, which may improve the current situation of human resources for health in the country.

BACKGROUND AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

Achieving the goal of UHC requires an expansion of benefits and coverage that generally requires an
investment in the health workforce. Countries that embark upon UHC face increasing pressures to ensure
that there are sufficient health workers to respond to the growing demand for appropriate and effective
health services. The WHO estimates that a health workforce density of 22.8 skilled health professionals per
10,000 people is the lower level needed to achieve relatively high coverage for essential health
interventions. (WHO 2006) According to the World Development Indicators, the number of doctors, nurses
and midwives in Peru has increased in recent years to reach 26.5 per 10,000 people in 2012, from 18.4 in
1999, mainly due to an increase in the number of nurses and midwives (Figure 1.2). So while the density
of skilled health professionals may no longer be at critical levels according to the WHO definition, it is low
compared to other countries that have achieved UHC or are close to achieving it. For example, Japan and
France have 63.3 and 126.6 skilled health professionals per 10,000 people respectively, while Brazil has
81.4 and Turkey has 41.1 (Maeda et al. 2014).

Human resources for health in Peru include all professionals and workers of the sector, including
administrative staff, as well as physicians in training in a clinical specialty (known as residents), who are
hired during their training period (usually three years), and professionals working in the Rural and Urban
Marginal Internship Program (Servicio Rural Y Urbano Marginal de Salud—SERUMS). This study focuses
on the basic health team professionals (physician, nurse, and midwife) and other professionals related to
the priorities outlined by MINSA during the preparing of this report, specifically dentists, nutritionists,
psychologists, pharmaceutical chemists, and medical technologists. At the postgraduate level we also
included those specialties that are related to the health priorities—that is, anesthesiology, family and
community medicine, general surgery, internal medicine, gynecology and obstetrics, and pediatrics.




                                                      2
The Peruvian health sector is divided into five distinct groups of service providers: (a) The public subsector,
which includes the Ministry of Health (Ministerio de Salud—MINSA) and the regional governments; (b)
Social Health Insurance (EsSalud); (c) the Armed Forces and National Police health service; (d) the
Metropolitan Solidarity System (Sistema Metropolitano de la Solidaridad—SISOL), which provides services
within the Lima metropolitan area; and (e) the private subsector. 6 Due to lack of availability of data, this
study focuses mostly on the public subsector.

The labor market is the economic environment in which the supply of labor—formed by the population’s
ability and willingness to work certain numbers of hours in particular paid activities—and demand for labor—
constituted by job opportunities—interact. The supply is the workforce that is available, whereas the
demand is formed by employers looking for workers. The degree of balance between these two factors
determines the market conditions at a given time.

This study evaluates the current labor market conditions and trends for human resources in health (HRH)
in Peru. This study is organized according to a conceptual framework that seeks to represent specific
dynamics of the Peruvian labor market for the health sector (Figure 1.3). The important flows of Human
Resources in Peru include the following: Professionals are initially trained in public and private universities.
After training, graduates transition to the labor market; if they are interested in working for the public sector
or (in the case of physicians in specialist training)—they must complete the SERUMS internship program.
After the SERUMS, transition of graduates into the public sector can happen through various contracting
regimes, but graduates are also able to work in other sectors (social security insurance, private sector,
etc.). At the same time, the Peruvian health labor market is characterized by high rates of out-migration and
difficulties in retaining employees in rural and remote locations. Following the outlined dynamics, the report
has been organized in six sections, each corresponding to a specific part of the framework: training,
transition of graduates to the labor market (SERUMS), health labor contracting in the public sector,
migration, retention, and postgraduate studies (that is, specialist training for physicians).




6. By and large, the arrangement of service providers mirrors financing arrangements: The public sector is financed by
general taxation resources from the Ministry of Finance and by resources from the Comprehensive Health Insurance
Scheme (Seguro Integral de Salud—SIS). EsSalud is an integrated entity that insures and provides services to mostly
formal sector workers using its own providers, financed by payroll taxes. The Armed Forces and National Police health
service have their own financing and service provision network. Finally the Metropolitan Solidarity System is a public-
private partnership that provides care on a out-of-pocket fee-for-service basis, albeit at affordable rates. There are
various relatively limited arrangements between the service provision networks to finance and provide services across
networks.

METHODOLOGY

This study is focused mainly on public workers who work in the service delivery networks managed by
MINSA and the regional governments. A significant limitation for this study is that the information on human
resources working for EsSalud, other service providers, and the private subsector is limited only to the
current data held by the MINSA’s National Observatory for Human Resources for Health. Another limitation
is the lack of information on salaries7 and levels of unemployment.8

This study used existing data and information from different sources, which are listed in annex 1. Three
strategies were used for data analysis: (1) Reviewing documents, reports, or academic literature published
by MINSA, other national and international organizations or scientific journals; (2) Using data from primary
sources, that is, without mixing them with other data; and (3) Combining and handling data from different
sources. Each section specifies the data and information sources. Data and information from primary
sources in the Migration and Retention sections are limited so the analysis is mainly a summary of already
published information.




7. This data was not included in the databases that MINSA shared with the group carrying out the study.
8. To the knowledge of the group there were no recent, publicly available labor market surveys that could have informed
this component.

                           1. TRAINING OF HEALTH PROFESSIONALS

In this section we analyze the current state of supply and demand of training for the health professions and
the number of graduates. We also analyze the profile of the basic health team professionals currently in the
market, through (a) an analysis of the curricula of training programs for members of the basic health team
(physicians, nurses, and midwives) in those universities with the largest number of students, according to
the 2010 University Census; (b) an analysis of competency profiles prepared by professional associations
for the certification of professionals; and (c) an analysis of the standard used by the National Council of
University Evaluation, Accreditation and Certification (CONEAU) to accredit education programs for these
professions. These profiles were then compared to the prioritized competency profiles of primary care
physicians, nurses, and midwives prepared by MINSA to determine whether the current market offers the
professional profile most needed by MINSA.

DATA S OURCES

The data and information sources used for this section are the following:

   National Council of University Evaluation and Accreditation (Comisión Nacional de Evaluación y
    Acreditación Universitaria—CONEAU): Progress of training programs’ accreditation, and authorization
    of professional associations to certify them.
   National Assembly of Rectors (Asamblea Nacional de Rectores—ANR): Information on how many
    students apply, enroll, and graduate from health training programs.
   Professional associations: Competency profiles used to certify professionals.
   National Institute of Statistics and Informatics (Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática—INEI):
    2010 National University Census.
   Public and private universities: Training programs’ curricula of the basic health team ( physicians,
    nurses, and midwives) from universities that train at least 4 percent of the student population belonging
    to these professions, according to the 2010 University Census.
   MINSA: Prioritized competency profiles of primary care physicians, nurses, and midwives.

SUPPLY OF HEALTH TRAINING PROGRAMS

Peru has a wide array of health training programs at the university level, both public and private. Out of the
100 universities that participated in the 2010 University Census, 78 offered training programs in the
professions covered by this report: medicine, nursing, midwifery, nutrition, psychology, pharmaceutical
chemistry, dentistry, and medical technology. The 2010 census included 33 medical schools and 58 nursing
training programs, whereas in 1960 there were only 3 medical schools and 8 nursing schools (MINSA
2011), which shows a rapid growth in the supply of training. The programs are provided by both public and
private universities, though the latter offer a larger number of programs and take in more students. Of those
universities with a larger number of medical students (defined in this report as 4 percent or more of
registered students in accordance with the 2010 University Census), seven were private universities (with
11,214 registered students) and two were public universities (with 1,767 students). For nursing and
midwifery, the universities with a larger number of registered students were all private, five for nursing and
four for midwifery. The training programs of these universities are summarized in annex 2, and are
discussed in more detail below.

The National Council of University Evaluation and Accreditation (CONEAU) is responsible for registering
and accrediting university education in Peru. CONEAU data show that, as of July 2013, 45 universities had

                                                      5
registered 234 training programs for the professions covered by this report (see annex 3 for the list of
universities that have registered programs). The number of programs is particularly high because
universities that have several campuses register the programs by campus rather than in a centralized
manner. For instance, Alas Peruanas University registered its nursing program 14 times since it is offered
in 14 different campuses. Table 1.1 shows the number of universities with registered training programs, the
total number of registered training programs (counting all campuses), the number of training programs that
have started the accreditation process, and the number that have completed it. As of November 2013, only
two undergraduate health training programs had been accredited by CONEAU: dentistry at the Universidad
Peruana Cayetano Heredia, and nursing at the Universidad Católica Los Angeles de Chimbote. As is clear
from Table 1.1, there is a large pending agenda in terms of accreditation of training programs. Based on
the information collected for this study, it is not possible to comment specifically on possible hurdles in the
accreditation process. However, the apparent need to accredit training programs separately by campus
appears to be a requirement that may cause delays without providing clear benefits.

APPLICATIONS AND ADMISSIONS TO TRAINING PROGRAMS

Overall, there appears to be a large interest from potential students in health training programs, and the
number of applicants vastly exceeds the number of admissions. Figure 1.4 presents applications and
admissions to professional training in the areas of medicine and nursing. According to the information
provided by the National Assembly of Rectors (Asamblea Nacional de Rectores —ANR), in recent years
approximately 20 percent of applicants to nursing programs at public universities ended up entering the
programs, whereas for private universities the admission rate is close to 90 percent. In medical training, 5
percent of applicants to public universities entered the programs, whereas 26 percent of those applying to
private institutions were admitted 9 (Figure 1.4 and Figure 1.5). Similar gaps between the supply and




9. Applicants to several programs would be counted for each program to which they apply. However, applications are
done separately to each university, with separate admission exams, and there is no information as to extent to which
applicant pools overlap.

demand of professional training can be observed in other health-related professions; in those areas as well,
there are similar difference between public and private universities (Table 1.2).

GRADUATES FROM HEALTH TRAINING PROGRAMS AND CERTIFICATION

To estimate the number of entrants into the health labor market, we estimated the graduation rates for
training in the health professions within the established time period of training (for example, seven years
for physicians and five years for nurses and midwives). Using data on the number of applicants, entrants,
and graduates during 2007–11, we estimate that in this period an average of 6,579 students per year
entered nursing training, whereas in that same period, the average yearly number of graduates was 2,814.
Likewise, in medical training we observe an average of 3,353 entrants per year, whereas the annual
average number of graduates was 1,784 (Table 1.3). Overall, of those students admitted to medical and


                                                               8
nursing schools, an estimated 43 percent and 53 percent, respectively, actually graduated within the
established training period.

Before graduates are allowed to exercise their professions, they must be certified by their respective
professional associations, which are themselves authorized by CONEAU. All professional associations
related to the professions analyzed in this report are authorized to issue certifications.10

COMPARISON BETWEEN TRAINING CURRICULA, PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATION PROFILES ,
CONEAU’S STANDARD NUMBER 25, AND MINSA P ROFILES

In this section, we aim to determine whether health professionals entering the labor market upon completion
of their training have the necessary competency profile to function at the primary care level. We analyze
the curricula of universities that enrolled at least 4 percent of medicine, nursing, and midwifery students,
according the 2010 University Census. We then compare the curricula to the profiles created by
professional associations for the purpose of certifying graduates so they can exercise their professions,




10. Data on the number of professionals who do not seek certification was not available to be included in this study.

                                                          9
and to the standards prepared by CONEAU to accredit the training programs for these professions.
Accreditation of training programs consists of assessment on 98 standards (CONEAU 2010). To make the
analysis easier, this study focused on standard no. 25, which is used to assess the curricula. The curricula,
professional association profiles, and CONEAU’s standard No. 25 were then assessed against the profiles
developed by MINSA for the basic health team at the primary care level. Annex 4 presents the profiles
prepared by MINSA, those prepared by professional associations, and CONEAU standard no. 25.

Physicians
Our analysis suggests that medical training programs recognize the importance of the primary care level
since they include it in their graduates’ profile and offer community/public health courses and community
health externships. The training programs of the Santa Maria Catholic University and Antenor Orrego
Private University are exceptions, since they mainly have a clinical approach and offer no community
externships. Nevertheless, none of the curricula we analyzed are specifically oriented toward the primary
care level. For instance, the number of credits related to primary care-related courses and community
externships varies from 4 to 11, out of a total (average) of 298 credits required to graduate, which evidences
a relatively low priority afforded to this care level in the analyzed curricula.

We then compare the prioritized competency profile of the primary care physician prepared by MINSA, the
profile prepared by the Peruvian Medical Association, and Standard no. 25 of CONEAU (table A4.1, annex
4). The profile prepared by the Peruvian Medical Association includes management, critical data
assessment, and public health/prevention skills. It also makes clear that physicians are responsible for
planning, directing, and assessing health teams’ work. This type of skill is strikingly absent from the MINSA
profile. However, an important area specified in MINSA’s profile is the treatment of people suffering from
depression, alcoholism, or violence. This shows an acknowledgment of the high prevalence of these
conditions (Prince et al. 2007) and the importance of providing services for them at the primary care level.
The profile of the Peruvian Medical Association does not include specific mental health–related skills.
Regarding disease coverage, it is worth highlighting that in MINSA’s profile for physicians puts them in
charge of addressing the entire burden of care for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), while the nurse
profile does not include any skills related to these diseases. Standard no. 25 includes knowledge of primary
care, public health, and health management—all relevant for the profile required by MINSA. However, this
is only one of eight requirements, and the other requirements are related to developing professionals who
work in other care levels as well. Considering the curricula and profiles that we analyzed, we conclude that
professionals that enter the labor market will not be specifically prepared to work at the primary care level.

Nurses
Our analysis of the nursing training curricula shows that some of them have more of a community-based
approach than others, though none has a predominantly community-based approach (annex 2, table A2.1)
The curriculum of San Juan Bautista University stands out because it emphasizes community care in its
profile; it also includes community-based courses and a community internship program. The curricula of
Los Angeles de Chimbote University, the only one accredited by CONEAU, also stands out: it requires the
approval of 322 credits for graduation, as compared to an average 220-credit requirement in other
universities.

We then compare the competency profile for primary care nurses prepared by MINSA, the profile prepared
by the Peruvian Nursing Association, and CONEAU’s standard no. 25, which is used to accredit nurse
training programs (annex 4, table A4.2). MINSA’s profile focuses mainly on medical care for infants and
children; for adults, nurses’ duties are linked specifically to TB and HIV-related care. An important finding
is that MINSA’s profile has a purely clinical care–oriented approach, which does not include management,


                                                     10
prevention/promotion, and evaluation skills, which are in fact included in the Peruvian Nursing Association’s
profile. By contrast, the profile of the Peruvian Nursing Association is more general, which makes sense
given that it is used to certify nurses who also work in the secondary and tertiary care levels. At the same
time, the PNS profile does include management, activity planning, evaluation, and prevention and
promotion skills, which are key at the primary care level. CONEAU’s standard no. 25 presents a list of the
subjects that the curricula should include for the training program to be accredited, but none of the subjects
on this list is directly related to community health or to the primary care level. In addition, there is no other
standard requiring, for instance, an internship at this level. This analysis shows that while CONEAU does
not require that training programs include community health–related knowledge and/or internships, in reality
most of the curricula analyzed do include them. However, as is the case with physicians, the graduate
nurses entering the labor market will not be specifically prepared to work at the primary care level.

Midwives
Our analysis of midwifery curricula shows that Los Angeles de Chimbote University and San Martin de
Porres University have courses focused on community health; however, these universities do not include a
community health rotation (table A2.2, annex 2). Alas Peruanas University, on the other hand, does have
community rotations. While it is beyond this study’s scope to comment on the implications of this difference,
it is worth mentioning that CONEAU does not have a standard to guide this aspect of training programs.

We then compare the prioritized competency profile of the primary care midwife prepared by MINSA, the
profile prepared by the Peruvian Midwifery Association, and CONEAU’s standard no. 25, which is used to
accredit midwifery training programs (annex 4, table A4.3). These three profiles are very similar, except
that the Midwifery Association’s profile includes reproductive health–related skills with a community-level
approach, as well as planning and implementation of promotion and prevention activities, while MINSA’s
profile does not include this type of preventive activity. Standard no. 25 of CONEAU presents a list of
subjects that need to be included in the curricula, including public health and community midwifery, which
are both relevant for the primary care level. Overall, we conclude that the curricula, as well as the Midwifery
Association and CONEAU standards include community health skills, which contrasts with the medicine
and nursing training programs.

DISCUSSION

Overall, we find that there is a high supply and demand for training in health-related professions in Peru.
CONEAU has initiated regulation and accreditation so as to guarantee training quality; however, this
process is slow and is far from being completed; therefore it is difficult to objectively assess the quality of
available training. However, we cannot immediately conclude that lack of accreditation means low quality,
as some institutions have nationally and internationally recognized training programs that have trained
capable and effective professionals for decades. For the purpose of our analysis of the labor market for
health professionals, what is important is the existing commitment to training regulation and to guaranteeing
a minimum standard, which we think is necessary because it could eventually be reflected in the type of
graduates from these programs and in the quality of human resources in health. However, this is a long-
term goal and much remains to be done in the short and medium run.

The profiles created by MINSA are specific for the primary care level, which should fill 70 to 80 percent of
the population’s health service needs, and therefore these positions are key for the government to meet its
UHC commitment. Nevertheless, we find that the university curricula, professional association profiles, and
CONEAU’s standard no. 25 to accredit training programs are all such that professionals entering the labor
market are not necessarily or specifically trained to work at the primary care level. Therefore, there is a low


                                                       11
likelihood that MINSA would be able to get the number and type of professionals it needs to work at the
primary care level.

Professional associations could play a role in certifying professionals; however, it is not clear whether
certification also includes an assessment of professionals’ skills, since traditionally the associations have
required registration and membership fee collection, rather than competency assessment. However, the
existence of the profiles represents an opportunity to integrate professional associations to HRH
management.

For MINSA and regional governments to find primary care–trained professionals in the market, it is
necessary to create programs specifically focused on training professionals to work at this level, and
simultaneously work with professional associations to specifically certify these professionals. MINSA and
regional governments, as the largest employers, have the opportunity to work with training institutions,
which, for the most part, are private.

Finally, we find significant gaps in MINSA’s profiles for professionals in the basic health team: specifically
(i) the profiles lack skills related to prevention, promotion, and management; (ii) MINSA’s profile for nurses
only includes a limited number of skills related to adult care (only two related to tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS),
and profiles assign the full burden of preventing and treating NCDs to physicians. Internationally, a
discussion is ongoing around the need to widen the nonclinical services that are provided by health staff
(WHO 2010). Yet MINSA’s clinical approach to NCDs may result in a lack of appropriate attention at the
primary care level for people with early symptoms of NCDs who need to implement lifestyle changes (diet,
exercise) to prevent progression of the disease.



                  2. TRANSITION OF GRADUATES TO THE LABOR M ARKET

In this section we analyze the dynamics of integration of recent graduates into the labor market. In particular,
we analyze the availability of Rural and Urban-Marginal Internship (SERUMS) positions, SERUMS
professionals’ university of origin, the number of graduated professionals taking up SERUMS positions, the
number of SERUMS graduates who join the public sector, and the conditions of their employment.

    b. Database of SERUMS (2007–13), including information of applicants’ university of origin
   ANR: Information about the number of graduates from health training programs

THE RURAL AND URBAN-MARGINAL INTERNSHIP PROGRAM

One of the strategies used by MINSA to increase coverage of primary health care professionals is the Rural
and Urban-Marginal Internship Program (Servicio Rural y Urbano Marginal en Salud— SERUMS). This
internship is a requirement for those health professionals who would like to work in the public sector, and
for physicians who would like to go on to specialist training. Health professionals who enroll in SERUMS
spend a year working at the primary care level in rural or urban-marginal areas. In 2009, the SERUMS


                                                      12
system started using the Poverty Map prepared by the Social Compensation and Development Fund
(FONCODES) to prioritize the poorest districts for SERUMS positions (MINSA 2011). There has also been
a significant increase in the number of available positions: Table 1.4 presents the number of positions by
source of financing in the years 2007 to 2013.

Currently it is mandatory that all SERUMS take place at the primary or secondary care level. The regional
governments are in charge of deciding the localities and establishments, with advice from DGGDRRHH.
Data from 2011 show that this strategy has been effective at increasing the presence of health professionals
in the most remote and disadvantaged locations. For instance, in 2008 among the poorest 800 districts in
the country, only 53 percent had at least one SERUMS physician; by 2011 this had increased to 89.
Furthermore, in the three poorest regions of Peru, the presence of physicians increased significantly to 95
percent of the districts in Ayacucho, 97 percent in Apurimac, and 95 percent in Huancavelica (MINSA 2011).

THE TRANSITION BETWEEN UNIVERSITIES AND THE SERUMS PROGRAM

Even though SERUMS is a requirement to work in the public sector, not all graduates of university training
programs apply immediately. Table 1.5 shows estimations on the number of graduates in 2010 and 2011,
and SERUMS positions taken in 2011 and 2012, respectively. For physicians, the number of SERUMs
tracks closely the number of graduates from the previous year, though we observe that in some years
graduates appear to delay the take-up of a SERUM, which can result in a higher number of SERUMs in
subsequent years. For example, 2,011 professionals graduated from medical school in 2011, but the
number of SERUMS positions taken up in 2012 was 2,496. For all other health-related professions, the
number of professionals taking up a SERUMS position is lower than the number of graduates in the previous
year, which may indicate an oversupply of graduates, a limited number of SERUMS positions for these
professions, or alternative job opportunities. 11




11. The data obtained do not allow us to distinguish those professions where there might be a lack of applicants to
SERUMS from those professions where there might be a lack of SERUMS positions.

According to information provided by MINSA, in 2013 the number of SERUMS applicants across all
professions had increased 62 percent compared to 2008 (Table 1.6). In addition, the distribution of
universities of origin has substantially changed in that period: in 2008 the San Marcos National University
and San Martin de Porres Private University provided the largest number of applicants; in 2013 Inca
Garcilaso de la Vega Private University and Alas Peruanas University (private) had overtaken them in terms
of the number of SERUM applicants.

For the medical profession, the following medical schools provided the largest share of SERUMS applicants
in 2013: San Martin de Porres Private University (11 percent), Latin-American School of Medicine (7
percent), Antenor Orrego Private University (7 percent), and San Juan Bautista Private University (7
percent). The Latin-American School of Medicine is a Cuban institution that trains students from many Latin
American countries, who then return to their countries, and thus has started to provide a representative
percentage of SERUMS applicants (Figure 1.6).

THE TRANSITION FROM SERUMS TO THE PUBLIC SECTOR HEALTH LABOR MARKET

In this section, we analyze the transition of SERUMS graduates to the public sector, by using MINSA-
provided information on professionals who took up a SERUMS position between 2007 and 2012, as well
as professionals who were working in the public sector as of September 2013. 12 Figure 1.8 shows that most
SERUMS graduates do not enter the public sector health labor market after completing the SERUMS. The
gap represents professionals who went to work in EsSalud, in the private sector or independently, those
who are underemployed or unemployed, and those who migrated. So even though the SERUMS program
has proved effective at increasing the presence of health professionals in rural and remote areas,
participation in SERUMS is not necessarily the immediate preceding step to gaining employment in the
public sector. Finally those who do join the public sector after completing SERUMS do so mainly under a
temporary agreement (Table 1.10). We also observe that 10 percent of SERUMS graduates enter the
system as residents (see section 6).




12. Note that health professionals currently in SERUMS (that is, in the 2012-II and 2013-I cohorts) are considered a
part of the current workforce, and therefore it is not possible to analyze their transition to the public sector health labor
market.

Furthermore, it is possible to identify the dynamics of different professions in terms of entering the public
sector. Figure 1.9 to Figure 1.16 illustrate the number of graduated professionals each year, the number of
people taking up SERUMS positions, and the number of these who join the public sector in the following
year. For those joining the health sector we were able to carry out an individual match from the SERUMS
database to the database of the National Observatory on Human Resources for Health. It is worth
highlighting that in the case of physicians in recent years (Figure 1.9), the number of people taking up
SERUMS positions is higher than the number of graduated professionals; this is possible because
graduates do not necessarily apply to SERUMS immediately upon graduation from their training programs.
For all professions other than physicians, there are a significant number of graduates who do not take up
SERUMS positions, and many of those who do, do not necessarily join the public sector workforce.

DISCUSSION

The results presented in the last section show that for the health professions included in the study, except
for medicine, there are a significant number of graduates who decide not to take up a SERUMS position—
a prerequisite for work in the public sector and for ongoing specialist training in the case of physicians. This
may indicate that the labor market is offering opportunities for which SERUMS is not a requirement. There
is also an increase in the number of graduates from private universities —for example, Inca Garcilaso de la
Vega Private University and Alas Peruanas University—who take up SERUMS positions, whereas the
number of graduates from public universities, for example, San Marcos National University, has been
steadily decreasing. Finally, the public sector fails to absorb the majority of professionals completing
SERUMS, and the vast majority of those graduates who are hired into the public sector, work under
temporary contracts. This analysis indicated that the deficit of health professionals in the public sector is
not due to the lack of trained professionals in the market, but instead to the inability of the public sector to
absorb them.

The government has relied on SERUMS as a strategy to ensure human resources for health in rural and
remote areas, and evidence shows that this has been a successful strategy. However, given that the
insertion level of SERUMS graduates into the public sector is rather low, and that most of those who do get
inserted, do so under temporary agreements (




                                                      24
Table 1.8), we conclude that SERUMS and public sector employment do not compete with other job
opportunities provided by the market to these professionals. 13 Therefore, it is necessary to develop
deployment policies that go beyond SERUMS and make sure that MINSA and regional governments have
access to the necessary budget to attract and retain health professionals in the public sector. To develop
these retention policies it is necessary to conduct a more complete assessment, including studies with new
graduates to explore and acquire a deeper understanding of their employment aspirations and
expectations, and job features that they appreciate the most, and to contrast this with a market assessment
and an exploration of the other opportunities that are available to these new graduates. In addition, it is
necessary to investigate the reasons why many professionals who complete SERUMS do not pursue their
profession in the public sector, despite being qualified to do so. It would be critical to understand what could
make the public sector an attractive or feasible job option for some graduates once they complete their
SERUMS, and what measures could be implemented to attract and retain these professionals, for example
flexibility to extend and renew SERUMS contracts and not have gaps in between contracts.



         3. CONTRACTING OF HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR

In this section we analyze how the public sector contracts health professionals, how these professionals
are distributed within the sector, and which contract regimes are used. Furthermore, we evaluate the time
required to close the health workforce gap and the measures that may be adopted to speed up this process.

DATA S OURCES

We reviewed the literature and analyzed the following data:

   MINSA:
    o Database of the National Observatory on Human Resources for Health
    o Calculation of health workforce gaps, using a methodology updated to 2013
   ANR: Information of how many people graduate from professional health training programs
   INEI: Population projection nationwide as of June 2013



DISTRIBUTION OF HEALTH PROFESSIONALS BY SUBSECTOR

Information on health professionals working within the different subsectors of the health care system is
shown in Table 1.9. Data on human resources working in the public sector is much more accessible and
complete than that available for other subsectors. Even though the National Observatory on Human
Resources for Health is in charge of collecting information from all subsectors, this is not complete enough
to allow analysis beyond the overall numbers that are presented in Table 1.9. This in itself points to a major
challenge for HRH policies in Peru: there is no information system that provides a complete picture of
human resources across the subsectors, and as a result, no comprehensive information can be obtained
about the distribution of health professionals.




13. With the available data, it is difficult to distinguish whether the lack of absorption is due to lack of openings to work
in the public sector, or lack of applicants to available positions.

CONTRACT REGIMES TO HIRE HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR

Health professionals in the public sector are hired under many different contractual regimes, leading to a
wide variation in salary levels and benefits. Workers hired under permanent contracts, as described by
Legislative Decree 276, may receive up to twice the salary of those under temporary contracts, such as the
Administrative Contract for Services (Contrato Administrativo de Servicios—CAS). The salary differences
are especially large for physicians; for other professional categories, although there are differences, these
are smaller (MINSA 2011). The CAS was created in 2008 with the intention of improving the hiring system,
suppressing Non-personal Services Agreements (Servicios No Personales—SNP), a previous type of
temporary contract, and establishing a contract that has a specific term, schedule, job description, provides
social benefits through EsSalud, and contributes to the pension system. Since the creation of CAS, all SNP
employees became CAS employees; however, the temporary character of the CAS still leads to instability
in employment (MINSA 2011).

Table 1.10 presents information on HRH currently working in the public sector and their contract regimes.
Overall, 53 percent of human resources have permanent appointments; 32 percent work under temporary
CAS agreements; and 11 percent are working in a SERUMS position. SERUMS positions are more
prevalent in predominantly rural regions such as Huánuco, Huancavelica, Pasco, and Tumbes, where they
account for approximately 25 percent of health professionals (data not shown).

When one compares health professionals working in the public sector with those working in EsSalud, the
difference is even larger especially for professionals who are not physicians: public employees receiving
up to S/. 19,000 less in salaries and benefits per year (MINSA 2011). In 2006, Webb and Valencia estimated
that physicians’ salaries in the public sector fell by 75 percent in real value between 1976 and 2004 (from
S/. 7,974 in 1976, to S/. 1,919 in 2004, adjusted to the 2001 value of nuevos soles).

Finally, we encountered some anecdotal evidence that suggests that many physicians are engaged in dual
practice between the public and private sectors—however, we could not find any information or data on this
topic so we are unable to verify the extent to which this happens.

THE HEALTH WORKFORCE G AP IN MINSA AND REGIONAL G OVERNMENTS’ HEALTH C ARE
ESTABLISHMENTS —2013

We reestimated the health workforce gaps for basic health team professionals (physicians, nurses, and
midwives), using a methodology developed by MINSA to quantify the difference between the need for and
the availability of human resources for health care services. The need for human resources is estimated
using an estimate of the time required to provide the medical services of the Essential Health Insurance
Plan (Plan Esencial de Aseguramiento en Salud—PEAS) as well as other health care activities not
considered in PEAS, and management and training activities that are part of job duties in the primary care
level. The unit that is used to calculate the human resource gap for health care services of the primary care
level is health micro-network. The methodology is summarized in Figure 1.17.

We calculated that in 2013 Peru has a deficit of 11,779 physicians, 8,780 nurses, 4,950 midwives, and
27,515 dentists (annex 5). On the positive side though, the gap for some human resources has been closed
in a number of regions. The deficit for dentists is not surprising, since the number of dentists entering the
system is minimal. Compared with 2009, we observe a significant increase in the gap for physicians (30
percent) and for dentists (26 percent), whereas the gap for nurses and midwives remained constant.

We use this gap information, together with INEI’s population growth projections, and projections on the
number of health professionals to assess in how much time the estimated gaps could potentially be filled,
depending on the absorption rate of graduates into the public sector. Using the information available from
the ANR, we first calculate the ratio of graduates to the number of entrants five years earlier15 (Table 1.11)
After applying the calculated ratio to the number of students entering public and private universities from
2008 to 2011, it is possible to project number of graduates from those universities for the period 2012 to
2015.16 Table 1.12 summarizes these results.




15. In this case, we made the calculation for five years of study, since the available information corresponds to such
period of time. It is worth indicating, however, that medical training lasts seven years.
16. It is worth specifying that as of the date of this report, the National Assembly of Rectors only had information for the
2007–11 period. Thus, we will work with the projection for 2012.

Furthermore, using information on the dynamics of professionals and their entry into SERUMS, as
presented in Figure 1.9 to Figure 1.16, it is possible to calculate an average ratio (percentage) of those who
take up a SERUMS position and of those who stay in the system. Using this ratio, it is possible to project
the number of professionals who would enter SERUMS and then the public sector (Table 1.13 and Table
1.14).

PROJECTION OF THE HEALTH WORKFORCE G AP

Finally, we calculated a projection of the health workforce gap for 2013–40 (annex 6, table A6.1). For this
projection, we assumed that, starting in 2016, the number of professionals taking up SERUMS positions
would stay constant and be equal to the projections for that year. It is worth mentioning that even though
we expect an increase in the number of new professionals, we should also consider that every year a
certain number quit, so we are using a conservative assumption that the number of additional entries into
SERUMS meets the number of those who complete or quit SERUMS. Furthermore, we assume that the
ratio of professionals who keep working in the public system also remains constant. Under those
assumptions, we estimated that the gap of physicians would be closed in 2027, the gap of nurses in 2024,
and the gap of midwives in 2017. By contrast, the gap of dentists would not be closed in the indicated term,
which is to be expected because of the low ratio of dentists entering the public system through SERUMS
(annex 6, table A6.1).

We also carried out a simulation with different scenarios, in which we varied the percentage of professionals
who join the public sector after completing SERUMS and calculated the year in which the gap would be
closed (Table 1.15). Increasing the rate of absorption into the public system by 10 percent would reduce
the time to close the gap by no more than three years. By doubling the rate of absorption (100 percent
increase), it would be possible to close the gaps between 2016 and 2020.

DISCUSSION

MINSA and the regional governments are the largest employers of the health sector in Peru, and this gives
them substantial weight in influencing the health labor market. On the other hand, there is only limited
available information on human resources working outside the public sector (MINSA and regional
governments). The little comparative information available indicates that public sector salaries are lower
than those offered by other subsectors such as EsSalud. In addition, the public sector relies on a large
number of contract regimes for hiring HRH, which is associated with large discrepancies in terms of salary.
In addition, most new hires into the public sector are done on the basis of temporary CAS contracts.
Although it has been proven that salary is not the only factor considered by workers in employment
decisions, these salary differences and temporary employment conditions are an obstacle to attracting high-
quality, motivated employees to the public sector.

The Peruvian government is promoting basic health teams—physician, nurse, midwife—as the basis for
primary care services and as a means to guarantee universal health coverage. In practice, however, filling
those positions is not straightforward. Our analysis shows that a significant number of graduates do not
take up SERUMS positions and thus do not join the public sector and that this is in part related to the lack
of labor stability and the lower salaries offered in the public sector.

Our projections show that if the government were able to double the absorption of physicians into the public
system after their SERUMS internship, it would close the gap by 2020, seven years earlier than if the
absorption ratio remains constant; for nurses it might be 2019 versus 2024. Regarding midwives, the

                                                    32
calculations show that the gap might be closed in 2017 with the current absorption ratios. This type of
information is important in developing incentive policies to increase the level of human resource absorption
into the public sector.



                                               4. MIGRATION

In this section, we analyze migration patterns of health professionals.

DATA S OURCES

Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain records of migratory flows of health professionals into and out of
Peru. The following are the data and information sources used in this section:

   Publications related to human resources for health in Peru and the region found by searching in Google
    Scholar (http://scholar.google.com/) and PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed)
   2010 National University Census

STUDENTS’ INTENTION TO MIGRATE

Given that there is no accurate information about actual flows of migration to other countries, we have to
rely on other sources of information. There are two studies that look at students’ desire to migrate. The
2010 University Census asked students about their desire to migrate to another country after finishing
professional studies. Table 1.16 shows the responses for health professionals. The intention to migrate is
highest among medical students (78 percent) and is significantly higher than in 2008 according to Mayta-
Tristán (Mayta-Tristán, 2008). In this previous study, medical interns at San Marcos National University
were asked about their intention to migrate for work reasons. The results showed that 38.1 percent of
interns had the intention to migrate, and of these, 70 percent planned to migrate to Europe and 23 percent
to North America. The main reason was better economic prospects, and students were more likely to intend
to migrate if they had an extracurricular rotation, or if they had presented at least one scientific paper at a
student congress. This difference between the two studies in the intention to migrate may be due to the fact
that the census sample included private as well as public university students, while the Mayta-Tristán study
was limited to one public university.

A 2013 report published by the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO), “Migration of Qualified Health
Professionals, Financial Impact, Recognition of Diplomas: Challenges and Perspective in Andean
Countries”, documents that Peru has the highest number of migrating physicians and nurses in the region,
losing an average 588 physicians and 881 nurses annually, thereby accounting for 44.7 percent of doctor
and nurse migrations in the region. The outflow of Peruvian nurses is particularly alarming, since they
represent 68.1 percent of the total nurse migration of the region. The PAHO report estimated that the cost
of this migration would be between 13.3 and 25.7 percent of the total value of exports, depending on
whether the professionals were trained in private or public universities. The report concluded that human
resources’ migration costs are significant for the region and have an impact on the amount and quality of
local supply.

Two publications study the migration of Peruvian physicians (Bernardini-Zambrini et al. 2011) and of
physicians and nurses of the Andean region, to Spain in particular (Álvarez Velasco 2012), using migration
data provided by Spanish authorities. Both studies report that Peru contributes a significant and
progressively increasing number of professionals to the Spanish health system. Figure 1.18 was adapted
from Álvarez Velasco (2012) and shows an increase in the number of official recognitions of physicians and
nurses’ degrees from the region. The Bernardini-Zambrini report, on the other hand, finds that two out of
every five Peruvian physicians who migrated to Spain chose a family medicine position.

DISCUSSION

We conclude that there is a high intention to migrate among students in the health professions, and that
many professionals eventually fulfill their intention, especially physicians and nurses, from whom we had
more information. The losses for the country, particularly if those professionals were trained in public
universities, are high. Overall, it would be helpful to have more information on migratory flows of health
professionals into and out of Peru.

In order to develop incentive policies to attract and retain health employees, it is essential to have first –
hand information on employee preferences and motivations. However, obtaining such information is not
straightforward. Very few studies survey preferences and motivations directly, and those that do cannot
necessarily be generalized outside of the original sample, that is, to other geographical areas, to people
trained in other professions, or to other phases in their careers (new graduates vs. more experienced
personnel). In this section we summarize the results of the available studies and present recent information
from MINSA’s Quality Office on employee satisfaction.

DATA S OURCES

The data and information sources used in this section are the following:

   MINSA’s Quality Office—survey on internal user satisfaction
   Publications related to human resources for health in Peru and the region, found by searching in Google
    Scholar (http://scholar.google.com/) and PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed)

HUMAN RESOURCES FOR HEALTH ASPIRATIONS , EXPECTATIONS , AND NEEDS

A study about the current situation and professional perspectives of medical students in nine Latin American
countries (Mayta-Tristán et al. 2010) found that 37 percent of them study in a place other than where they
were born, whereas 82 percent plan to work in hospitals, and only 2.3 percent in health care centers. 47.6
percent agree that the average salary received by physicians in their countries is insufficient. Among
Peruvian students, 47.7 percent intend to migrate to practice their profession, and only Colombia and El
Salvador have larger percentages. Another study in Peru surveyed physicians who were undergoing the
Peruvian Medical Association registration process (n=782) on job projections, and found that 7.0 percent
planned to work in the interior of the country and only 0.5 percent in rural areas. This intention was positively
related to having both parents living outside of Lima, knowing Quechua, and having done their internship
outside of Lima (Mayta-Tristán et al. 2011).

Three publications report the results of a discrete choice experiment conducted with physicians, nurses,
and midwives working in Ayacucho. Different job packages were presented to them, with different
combinations of salaries and benefits, to understand what conditions would encourage them to choose to
continue to work in a rural area. For nurses and midwives, the likelihood of choosing an urban position was
almost 15 times higher than for choosing a rural position. The top reasons to choose a rural job included a
salary increase, an assignment to a “better” type of health center, and scholarships to continue their
professional training. Increasing the number of years to secure a permanent contract appeared to be a
disincentive for both rural and urban jobs. Simulations showed that a package that includes a 75 percent
increase in salary and more scholarships for specialization could increase the percentage of nurses and
midwives accepting a rural job from 36.4 to 60.0 percent (Huicho et al. 2012a). On the other hand,
physicians were five times more likely to choose an urban position than a job in a rural community. A salary
increase and bonus points for specialization would serve as incentives to choose a rural area, whereas an
increase in the number of years required to secure a permanent position would be a disincentive. Being
male and currently employed at a hospital considerably reduces the likelihood of accepting a rural job.
Simulations showed that a package with a salary increase of 75 percent, permanent contract after two years
in the rural area, and bonus points for specialization would increase the percentage of physicians accepting
a rural job from 21 to 77 percent. A package with a 50 percent salary increase, plus bonus points for


                                                       36
specialization would also increase the probability of physicians accepting a rural job from 21 to 52 percent
(Miranda et al. 2012). A qualitative study that was conducted as a part of this experiment identified that the
job conditions of many health professionals were hard, and that there is no systematic incentive strategy
for attracting and retaining employees in rural areas. The main incentives requested by the employees
included—besides the abovementioned—more contractual stability and labor benefits, infrastructure
enhancement, equipment and supplies for health professionals, training opportunities, better housing,
better food, and better care and recognition (Huicho et al. 2012b).

Bobbio and Ramos (2010) surveyed the job satisfaction of physicians, nurses, midwives, and nursing
technicians in the Dos de Mayo National Hospital. They show that 22.7 percent of physicians, 26.2 percent
of nurses and midwives, and 49.4 percent of nursing technicians were satisfied with their jobs. The
multivariate analysis shows that for physicians, factors associated with job satisfaction included the hygiene
and tidiness of the job environment, and satisfaction with department heads; for nurses and midwives, the
factors were appropriate workload, and proper promotion opportunities; and finally for nursing technicians,
these factors were satisfaction with their monthly salary and satisfaction with job supervision.

HEALTH FACILITY EMPLOYEE S ATISFACTION

MINSA makes use of a continuous survey to assess the organizational climate of health centers, which we
were able to access for this study. The survey assesses the internal users’ (that is, health facility employees)
satisfaction. The survey has 28 questions in which the users have to respond on a 1 to 4 point scale, with
4 being the “healthiest” score. Thus, the overall score that can be obtained varies from 28 to 112. If the
overall score is more than 84, the organizational climate is labeled as “healthy”; between 56 and 84, the
climate is considered to need improvement, while if the score is lower than 56, the organizational climate
is labeled as unhealthy (MINSA 2013).

In accordance with the results obtained in the last surveys conducted in 2011 to 2013, none of the health
care centers show an unhealthy environment. However, the largest number of health care centers have a
score between 56 and 84 (to be improved), and less than 10 percent show a healthy climate (Table 1.17).
Even though it is true that in health care centers where the organizational climate needs to be improved,
the average score is not too low (over 70); it is still important to highlight that the number of organizations
that lack a healthy environment is high—almost comprising the 90.5 percent of surveyed institutions during
this period.

DISCUSSION

The 2011 study by Mayta-Tristán et al. indicate that very few physicians expect or aspire to work at the
community level or in rural areas. Besides, many have already migrated for study reasons. The discrete
choice experiment in Ayacucho highlights the significance of incentives to retain health professionals
working in rural areas. Information about organizational climate shows that for the majority of health
employees there is a need to improve their working environment. This may be an indicator of labor
satisfaction. Nevertheless, the available information for analysis in this section is limited, and more studies
are necessary to better understand what incentives are needed to attract and retain health professionals to
the primary care level within the public sector.



                    6. POSTGRADUATE TRAINING: M EDICAL SPECIALTIES

In this section, we look into the organization, supply and demand of postgraduate training for medical
specialties. We analyze the distribution of specialists within the system and the dynamics of incorporating
these specialists into the public sector.

DATA S OURCES

The data sources used in this section are the following:

   MINSA: Database of the National Observatory of Human Resources for Health

ORGANIZATION OF POSTGRADUATE TRAINING FOR MEDICAL SPECIALTIES

The admission process to medical residency is managed by medical schools and financed by the MINSA.
To apply for admission, applicants must be physicians, belong to the Peruvian Medical Association, be
accredited by the medical association to practice medicine, and have completed a SERUMS. Applicants
can only apply to one medical school, and the selection process is conducted annually and simultaneously
for each medical residency program. The admission exam is prepared by the Peruvian Association of
Medical Schools (ASPEFAM, http://aspefam.org.pe/), application is by clinical, surgical, or subspecialty
area; and positions are allocated in strict order of results among the approved applicants.

Herrera-Añazco et al. (2012) note that universities play a smaller role during medical residencies, as training
is the responsibility of the teaching hospitals. Some teaching hospitals do not include scientific and
academic activities in their training program, while others do but often do not conduct the corresponding
activities due to the fact that residents are needed to fill in for the lack of assistant specialist doctors. Galán-
Rodas et al. surveyed 416 physicians that applied to a residency program and found that this was not the
first application for more than half of these applicants. Among those interviewed, 67.5 percent favored a
single national exam, while 39.2 percent preferred a separate selection process by specialization.
Moreover, 78.1 percent disagreed with MINSA’s proposal of implementing additional mandatory time of
service in the medical residency in the less developed regions of the country.

This section describes the supply and demand for medical specialist training focused on the specializations
linked to health priorities: internal medicine, pediatrics, surgery, anesthesiology, gynecology, and midwifery,
and family and community medicine. Additionally, it describes the distribution of these specialists within the
public sector and analyzes the training and absorption dynamics of the public sector.

POSTGRADUATE T RAINING OF MEDICAL SPECIALTIES : SUPPLY AND DEMAND

The number of available openings for training of medical specialists is mostly limited by the capacity of
teaching hospitals and health centers, while the number of candidates depends on the number of graduated
physicians who have completed SERUMS (since this is a requirement to access the medical residency)
and their interest in pursuing a specialization. According to CONAREME, 2,036 physicians entered the
medical residency in 2013, with 1,968 admitted for specialization and 68 for sub-specialization. Table 1.18
shows the number of candidates that applied for admission as well as the number of actual admissions.
The lowest admissions-to-candidates ratio can be found in general surgery and pediatrics, where the
demand is high and only about 30 percent of applicants get a resident position. Also, the data for family
and community medicine show the number of applicants is lower than the number of entrants, which results
from a DGGDRRHH strategy to increase the number of positions for residents.

CONAREME determines the minimum training standards for priority specialties, including anesthesiology,
pediatrics, gynecology and obstetrics, internal medicine, general surgery, and family and community
medicine. Annex 7 presents a summary of these standards. We examined the standards to determine
whether they included developing competencies related to the primary care level, since health facilities at
level I-2 and above can include a physician with a specialty, and health facilities at level I-4 and above
should have a specialist.17 The CONAREME standards show that the only specialties with community care-
oriented skills are gynecology and obstetrics, and family and community medicine.




17. Primary health facilities are labeled level I-1 to I-4, secondary facilities are labeled II-1, II-2, and II-E (specialist
secondary level facility), and tertiary level facilities are labeled III-1, III-2, and III-E.

                                                                 39
DISTRIBUTION OF MEDICAL SPECIALISTS WITHIN THE SYSTEM

In November 2012, MINSA estimated that there were 7,048 specialists in the public health sector, of which
4,063 or 57.6 percent were concentrated in Lima (MINSA 2012). Among the 4,069 medical specialists in
the 6 priority areas, 53 percent were concentrated in Lima. Table 1.19 shows the unbalanced distribution
of priority medical specialists by department.

We also analyze the distribution of priority medical professionals by health establishment category. Table
1.20 shows that there some specialists at primary levels I-3 and I-4, particularly for gynecology and
obstetrics and pediatrics; however, they are mostly concentrated at the secondary and tertiary care levels.
The table also shows that there are only a few (n=58) specialists in family and community medicine within
the system, even at the primary care level.

DEFICIT OF MEDICAL S PECIALISTS

The deficit of specialists in Peru is not new, but it has become more salient within the context of universal
health coverage—which has increased the demand for health services and for infrastructure and
equipment—and given the high rate of migration of physicians. In 2011 Zevallos et al. analyzed the need
for medical specialists based on two methodologies: the required number of specialists according to the
categorization standard of health establishments, and the number required according to the epidemiological
and demographical profile of the population. The difference between the calculated need and the number
of practicing specialists defined the gap of medical specialists. According to the categorization standard,
there was a total need for 11,176 medical specialists, and according to the epidemiological and
demographical profile the need was 11,738. The number of specialists in the public sector at that time was
6,074; thus the estimated gaps nationwide are similar with both methods. The gap is largest in gynecology
and obstetrics, pediatrics, internal medicine, and general surgery.

RESIDENT TRAINING DYNAMICS AND INCORPORATION INTO THE PUBLIC SECTOR

To analyze the dynamics of medical specialist training and incorporation into the system, we looked at
information on physicians entering residency in 2009 and 2010, who would complete their residency in
2012 and 2013. These individuals were compared to those who currently work in the public sector. We find
that only 9.9 percent of the total specialists who completed their specialties in the last two years currently
work for the public sector. The highest absorption percentage is for general surgeons, followed by
pediatricians and anesthesiologists. It is telling that out of the 75 residents who entered the family and
community medicine specialty in 2009 and 2010, only one specialist currently works in the public sector
(Table 1.21).

DISCUSSION

This section shows that there is a high demand for training for priority medical specialties. In 2013 more
than 43 percent of total residents were associated with those specialties. The competency profiles prepared
by CONAREME show that only the programs in gynecology and obstetrics, and family and community
medicine give attention to the primary care level. The number of family and community medicine residencies
has increased considerably, yet their current number within the system is low (n=58), and absorption of
new graduates of this specialty into the public system seems virtually inexistent. On the other hand,
although the distribution of specialists according to the health facility level appears appropriate, the
geographical distribution is extremely unbalanced; more than half the specialists are concentrated in Lima,
and there is still a significant deficit within the system.

The resident training and specialist absorption dynamics show that a great number of professionals do not
start working for the public sector in the first two years after finishing their residency. This indicates a
significant loss of specialized human resources and training investment. This analysis is based on two
relatively recent years, however, and information on entrants in former years may better inform these
dynamics. If in fact this low absorption of specialists into the system is confirmed, it would be important to
study where these specialists work, how often they migrate, and how to attract a larger number of them to
work within the public sector.

                                            CONCLUSIONS

In this report, we used existing data and information, so the strength of the results and conclusions reached
depend on the quality of the corresponding data. The sections with better data are training of health
professionals, transition of graduates to the labor market, contracting of health professionals, and
postgraduate training. The migration and retention sections mainly summarize previous publications.

The Training section shows that there is a high demand for training in the basic health team professions
and other professions related to health in Peru, and that most of the training supply is provided by private
universities. Even though there is a commitment to standardize training and assure its quality, the process—
managed by CONEAU—has been slow and still needs work. It is hard to objectively discuss the present
quality of training in Peru, so long as this process fails to make additional progress.

The comparison of MINSA’s competency profile for the basic health team in the primary care level and the
professional profiles in the market highlights that basic health team graduates are not specifically prepared
to work in the primary care level. Therefore, there is a low likelihood that MINSA would find the type and
number of professionals it requires to work in the primary care level. For MINSA and the regional
governments to find the professional profile for primary care level in the market, it is necessary to create
training programs focused specifically on training professionals to work at this level and—at the same
time—work with professional associations to certify these professionals. There is an opportunity for MINSA
and the regional governments—as the majority employers—to work with training institutions, most of which
are private, to influence the content of the training and the certification process.

In the analysis of the SERUMS program, we observed that for most of the professions included in the study,
except for medicine, take-up of SERUMS is lower than the actual number of graduates. There are a
significant number of graduates who choose not to participate in SERUMS, which is an indicator that the
labor market is offering other opportunities that do not insist on SERUMS as a prerequisite. Furthermore,
the analysis shows that the public sector fails to absorb the majority of professionals completing SERUMS,
which indicates that the deficit of health professionals in the public sector is not due to the lack of
professionals in the market, but rather to the fact that there is no mechanism complementing SERUMS to
enable incorporation of these professionals into the public sector, and possibly because there are other
more attractive employment opportunities in the market. Though there is evidence that SERUMS has been
effective at assuring the presence of human resources in rural and remote areas, the question arises of
how to retain those professionals who complete SERUMS. In other words, what retention policies and
budgetary changes must be implemented to assure the incorporation of more professionals into the public
sector?

These training dynamics followed by SERUMS and the low number of graduated professionals joining the
public sector show that the health professional gap in the system is not a result of a lack of trained
professionals, but of the low level of absorption into the public sector. We used projections of training and
incorporation into the system to simulate the amount of time necessary to fill MINSA’s estimated gaps.
Calculations show that if we double the number of professionals joining the system, the gap for physicians
might be filled by 2020, seven years earlier than if we were to continue at the present absorption rate; for
nurses it would be five years earlier (2019 vs. 2024). Regarding midwives, the calculations show the gap
might be closed in 2017 with the current absorption rates. This type of information is significant for
developing incentive policies to increase the absorption level of human resources into the public sector.

Intention to migrate among health professions students is high, and many professionals currently fulfill such
intentions. However, it is necessary to improve the quality of available information on migratory flows from
Peru to develop a more robust analysis.

To improve the incorporation of health professionals into the public sector, it is necessary to explore and
understand their aspirations, expectations, and needs—not only of new graduates but also the more
experienced professionals—since their motivations would be different. Available data are still insufficient to
develop effective incentive packages.

Resident training and specialist absorption dynamics presented in section 6 are based on only two years
of data. Analyses show that the vast majority of specialists do not start working for the public sector in the
first two years after completing their residencies, indicating a significant loss of specialized human
resources and training investment, which is financed entirely by the government. It is necessary to conduct
a more detailed study to understand what happens with those specialists—where do they end up working,
and how many of them migrate—in order to develop effective retention policies.

It is noteworthy that the lack of information on health professionals who work outside the public sector
(MINSA and regional governments), on prevailing salary levels and on unemployment among health
workers are the most significant limitations for this study.


                                        RECOMMENDATIONS

Our recommendations can be grouped in four areas: (i) the relevance of skills of health professionals; (ii)
contracting, compensation, and retention policies to improve absorption and retention of health
professionals in the public sector; (iii) the quality of information on HRH; and (iv) research to inform the
policies for implementation.

Relevance of skills of health professionals
 We recommend that MINSA’s General Director’s Office for Management of Human Resources
    Development (Dirección General de Gestión del Desarrollo de Recursos Humanos—
    DGGDRRHH) work with public and private universities to review existing training programs and
    develop new programs focused on training professionals to work specifically at the primary care level.
    Programs could look beyond the currently available programs and include shorter, more community-
    oriented courses. If these shorter courses are associated with a high likelihood of employment after
    completion, they may be well received in a market with a high demand for training. Considering that
    private institutions currently provide the majority of training in the health professions, they would play
    an essential role in the development of new training programs. In addition, it would be important to offer
    these courses in the regions, as students from rural areas may be more likely to enroll and work in their
    region of origin.
   The accreditation process for training programs will need to be made more agile if it is to guarantee
    training quality. We recommend a more detailed assessment of CONEAU’s processes to understand
    the difficulties and propose steps that could speed up the certification process.
   Professional associations are already playing a role in certifying professionals; however, this process
    does not add value or improve a professional’s employment opportunities in the labor market, and it is
    unclear whether it includes any assessment of skills. The certification process should be widened to
    include an assessment of skills that would guarantee professional quality and improve job opportunities.
   MINSA’s profiles for the basic health team would need to be updated to adjust responsibilities for caring
    for NCDs and adult conditions. Nurses need to assume a larger role in the prevention and management

                                                     44
    of chronic conditions. Furthermore, other skills such as administrative management, and public health
    prevention and promotion need to be considered within these profiles.

Contracting, compensation, and retention policies within realistic budgetary scenarios
 In terms of contracting, the public sector relies on a multitude of contract regimes, which seem to be
   paired with wide divergences in salary. We recommend that MINSA take a global look at contractual
   regimes and payment schemes and strategically review compensation mechanisms.
 The SERUMS program has been successful at ensuring the presence of health professionals in rural
   and remote areas; however, it is not accompanied by a mechanism to retain these professionals in the
   public sector. We recommend that SERUMS be complemented with a retention strategy, based on a
   more complete assessment that includes studies that explore the job aspirations and expectations of
   new graduates. Post-SERUMS professionals signaled their interest in working for the public sector by
   enrolling in SERUMS—the public sector should capitalize on this knowledge in its attempts to hire and
   retain professionals.

Quality of information on HRH
 There is a fragmentation in the information systems between MINSA, EsSalud, the other health
   insurance providers and the private sector, and as a result, no comprehensive information can be
   obtained about the distribution of health professionals by subsector. For policy purposes, it is necessary
   to improve the quality and integration of HRH information both in the public sector and outside of it. To
   achieve this, there is a need for strategic alliances with entities that routinely collect data on human
   resources in these subsectors, such as EsSalud, private insurance providers, professional
   associations, and corporations managing clinics and private hospitals. The challenge would be to
   create a relationship in which there is common interest in sharing this information. Such information will
   strengthen subsequent studies on the employment market of HRH as it provides a more complete
   vision of the entire sector.
 In regards to migration, there are still many unanswered questions. For instance, there is little
   information on how many professionals leave the country to work, how many continue studying, how
   many come back, and when. There are outstanding questions as to when more aggressive retention
   strategies should be applied, for example, before or after SERUMS, before or after the residency? To
   be able to answer some of these questions, MINSA will need to work with the Bureau of Immigration
   and Naturalization (DIGEMIN) to improve the quality of information on health professional migration.

Research to inform the policies for implementation
 Professional incorporation into the public sector will require the development of contractual, incentive,
   and retention packages that are based on better understanding of health professionals’ aspirati ons,
   expectations, and needs. Studies on new graduates, those who complete their SERUMS, current public
   sector workers, other subsectors workers, and unemployed health professionals may provide
   information on job expectations, relative options in the market, and salary and social benefit
   expectations, which we were not able to analyze in this study. Some methodologies that may be used
   include surveys, discrete choice studies, and focus groups, among others.
 In our analysis of the dynamics of medical specialist training and absorption of specialists by the public
   sector, we find that absorption by the public sector is minimal, at approximately 10 percent. It would be
   important to research the flow of medical specialists within the market and understand what happens
   with them, where they end up working, and why. Moreover, we need to understand how MINSA can
   manage to attract and retain more specialists within its budgetary limitations.

LIMITATIONS

This study has several main limitations:

   The discussion of human resources in health that is presented in this report focuses on the public
    sector, and this limitation was mainly driven by availability of data. At the same time, the discussion on
    human resources in health should be framed within a broader discussion on the role of the public sector
    in health service delivery, and the role of other providers including EsSalud, the other
    insurance/provisions institutions like the Metropolitan Solidarity System (Sistema Metropolitano de la
    Solidaridad—SISOL) and the private sector providers.
   Even within the public sector, our analysis is limited by availability of data in several areas.

   Sources: Ministry of Health and authors’ calculations, 2014.
   Note: The gap has been calculated as the difference between human resources need and availability, in which the difference results being negative (excess of job
   supply) has not considered the total sum, because it distorts the real gap calculation. This methodology is similar to the one applied by the Ministry of Health, when
   calculating the gap by Healthcare Center.

This report aims to provide an updated analysis of labor market trends for the health workforce in Peru,
focusing on the basic health team —physician, nurse, and midwife—and other health professionals related
to current priorities. Peru has been labeled as a country with a shortage of health professionals (that is,
with less than 25 professionals per 10,000 inhabitants), and although the most recent numbers indicate
that the situation has improved, the shortages are bound to become more acute as the country aims to
achieve Universal Health Coverage. We found that the country trains both in public and private
universities a large number of professionals, but that the majority of trained professionals do not then go
on to work for the public sector. This dynamic had not been described before and challenges current
assumptions of human resources needs and availability. There is very little reliable data on numbers, type
and work conditions for human resources working outside the public sector, including the social security
insurance health system (EsSalud), other health insurance providers, and the private sector, and as a
result no detailed information can be obtained about the distribution of health professionals outside the
public sector. For policy purposes, it is necessary to improve the quality and integration of HRH
information across the sector.
