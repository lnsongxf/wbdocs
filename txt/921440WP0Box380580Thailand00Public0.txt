THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: DB2014 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2014 that capture the effects of s uch
factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practic e or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

        An application for a permit to construct, alter, remove, or reallocate a
        building is required for any building. For buildings of no more than four
        stories or 15 meters in height, which excludes any tall building,
        extraordinarily large building, hotel, hospital, all kinds of factories
        (except a household business or any business that does not cause any
        disturbance to the public), the application must be submitted to the
        relevant District Office with the following documents attached:
        • A copy of the applicant's corporate registration
        • A copy of the land title deed
        • Permission to use the land space for construction or lease agreement.
        • The personal and tax identification cards of the applicant
        • Written permission of the architect and a copy of a valid professional
        license
        • Written permission of the design/calculation engineer and a copy of a
   1    valid professional license                                                   1 day           THB 650
        • Building plan
        • A calculation of building structure
        • For an industrial factory, hospital, fresh market, condominium,
        apartment, and any undesirable commercial building, details of the
        water treatment system and its calculation must be provided

        The fees vary depending on the actual space area and size of the
        building:
        • THB 0.50 per square meter for a building not taller than 12 meters or
        two floors
        • THB 2.00 per square meter for a building taller than 12 meters but not
        more than 15 meters or three floors
        • THB 4.00 per square meter of the entire building space area for a
        building taller than 15 meters or three floors

        In the case considered here, the cost is THB 0.50 per square meter, or
        THB 650.00 total.

      A notice to the local authority in lieu of the building permit could be
      made. The application could be submitted to the local authority in a
      situation where construction work must be commenced urgently. The
      following supporting documents must be attached to the application to
      the local authority:
      • A copy of the applicant's corporate registration
      • A copy of the land title deed
      • Permission to use the land space for construction or lease agreement

      professional license
      • Written permission of the senior design/calculation engineer and a
      copy of a valid professional license
      • Written permissions of the architect and engineer who will be the
      construction supervisors and copies of their valid professional licenses
      • Certificate of building design
      • Building plan
      • Calculation of the building area

      Acknowledgement of the notification is normally granted within the
      day of filing the complete application. The cost is the same as for
      obtaining a building permit.

      The Land Officer calculates all the registration fees and expenses and
      asks the parties to pay and submit to him the receipts. The registration
      fee is 2% of the appraised value calculated by the Bureau of Property
      Valuation (GAV) and announced by the Treasury Department, Ministry of
      Financed every 4 years (Government Appraised Value (GAV)).



      The seller has to pay a 1% withholding tax on sale price or GAV -
      whichever is higher. (Seller may apply this as a credit towards their
      corporate income tax on any capital gain). As the seller is a company,
      withholding tax is calculated on the greater of the appraised value and
      the sale price.



      The seller has to pay stamp duty, which is 0.5% of the appraisal value if
      holding period for the individual is more than 5 years. If not, the transfer
      will be subject to the Specific Business Tax (SBT). This SBT implies that
      the Seller has to pay 3.3% of the appraisal value or the sales price,
      whichever is higher. The 3.3% SBT includes a 0.3% municipality tax.



      The SBT is imposed on persons who sell their property for trade or a
      profit-seeking purpose. Companies who sell real property in Thailand are
      deemed to be selling for trade or profit and are subject to specific
      business tax. Even if a company sells property in order simply to move to
      a new place, it is still deemed to have sold for a trade or profit seeking
      purpose.



      Accordingly, the company who is the seller in this example will be
      subject to SBT. The registration fee, withholding tax and SBT are
      collected by the Land Office. The cheques for the taxes are payable to
      the Ministry of Finance but collected by the Land Office.



      The Land Officer then attaches the receipts to the application, and
      submits all documents to the Chief in charge who is authorized to
      approve the registration of the transfer. Once the reigistration is
      approved, it is deemed completed. The seller will receive one copy of the
      registered sale agreement. The buyer will receive another copy of the
      registered sale agreement and the original Land Title Deed.



      The Seller will need to produce the construction permit and household
      registration of the building as evidence to transfer the building.

The dispute in the case study involves the breach of a

the quality of the goods in dispute. This distinguishes
the case from simple debt enforcement. To make the
data comparable across economies, Doing Business
uses several assumptions about the case:
       The seller and buyer are located in the
        economy’s largest business city. For the 11
        economies with a population of more than               The seller requests a pretrial attachment to
