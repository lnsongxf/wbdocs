CONTEXT:
As in many developing nations, mapping information in Nepal
has been often outdated, missing data, and sometimes only
accessible on a pay-per-view basis. This creates societies
without knowledge of village names, governments without
access to their assets, and confusion as to where to provide
aid in the case of a natural disaster. The potential for a
large earthquake in Nepal spurred the Open Cities Project, a
program under GFDRR’s Open Data for Resilience Initiative
(OpenDRI) to build seismic resilience in the Kathmandu
Valley’s education and health infrastructure by training
civilians to map their local areas.

APPROACH:
Mapping activities in the Kathmandu Valley were aimed at
preparedness and risk reduction, with the knowledge that
any data would be valuable when the next earthquake struck.
Supporting these efforts remotely, student volunteers began
to map and digitize information for over 130,000 buildings,
including businesses, schools, and hospitals. The remote
mapping was combined with extensive on-the-ground                “The Open Cities Project gave us lots of opportunities
