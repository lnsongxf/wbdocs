 Excerpt from RUSA document
 The formation of SHEC forms the primary block towards building a sound planning and funding mechanism
 for higher education at state level. Given the number of state universities and the large number of students
 they cater to, it only makes sense to have state as the unit of planning for higher education. State universities,
 numerous as they are, cannot be monitored though a central system. Also, Center only has a partial role in
 funding these institutions while States provide the rest of the funding. The lack of coordination between States
 and Center produces an information gap that leads to faulty resource planning and allocation. The states have
 often expressed their need to stay informed regarding central allocations to state institutions. Thus, it is necessary
 to create SHEC as a body that is at an arm’s length from the state as well as center, synergizes their resources
 and fulﬁls these functions of planning, monitoring, quality control and co-ordination at the state level. The
 SHECs would be responsible for planned and coordinated development of higher education in the State and
 to foster sharing of resources between universities, beneﬁt from synergy across institutions, lead academic and
 governance reforms at the institution level, establish principles for funding institutions, maintain a databank
 on higher education and conduct research and evaluation studies. Ministry of Human Resource Development,
 2013 p. 149.

 Examples of Statewide System Governing Boards
 California
 All California public institutions are under the jurisdiction of one of three state boards: the Board of Regents of
 the University of California governs 10 universities and 3 research centers, the Board of Trustees of the California
 State University governs 23 universities, and the Board of Governors of the California Community College System
 oversees 109 community colleges. No intermediary body exists between the three system governing boards and
 state government (the Governor and State Legislature).
 North Carolina
 All North Carolina public institutions are under the jurisdiction of either the Board of Governors of the University
 of North Carolina governing 16 universities and or the State Board of Community Colleges governing 59 colleges
 and technology centers. No intermediary body exists between these system governing boards and state government
 (the Governor and State Legislature).

 Examples of Coordinating Board States
 Texas
 The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board is responsible for overseeing a highly complex system of six system
 governing boards, each responsible for multiple universities; three universities with single governing boards; and
 50 community colleges organized as multi-campus and single campus institutions.
 Virginia
 The State Council for Higher Education in Virginia is responsible for coordinating a highly decentralized system of
 16 universities each with its own governing board (board of visitors), and 23 community colleges governed by the
 statewide Board of the Virginia Community College System.
