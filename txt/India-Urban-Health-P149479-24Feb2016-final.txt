1.   OVERVIEW

India’s urban population is large and growing. In 2014, India’s total population was about 1.3
billion. (World Bank, 2015) Between 1991 and 2011, the proportion of the population of India
living in urban areas rose from 26 to 32 percent (377 million). However, these figures are based
on an administrative definition for urban areas that likely results in an underestimation of the size
of the urban population in India. An alternative measure, the agglomeration index, indicates that
already in 2008, more than half of the country’s population lived in urban areas, (World Bank,
2013; Uchida and Nelson, 2008) a figure more consistent with historical experience and with
India’s economic growth, which averaged 7.2 percent annually during 2000-2010.

Urbanization is increasingly recognized as both accompanying and fostering economic growth
through agglomeration economies. Economic benefits of agglomeration come about through
improved access to labor, suppliers, markets and services, easier knowledge exchange, and
increased specialization and economies of scale. At the same time, congestion costs can counteract
the benefits of agglomeration, as increasing size and density of cities raises costs and affects living
standards, including through increased risks of disease, accidents and crime. (Quigley, 2009; Ellis
and Roberts, 2016)

Mirroring the agglomeration/congestion dichotomy are the notions of urban health advantage and
urban health penalty. Perceptions of urban health in developing countries are shaped by the
historical record of the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, as the populations of rapidly
growing cities suffered worse health conditions than rural populations. (Woods, 2003) However,
by the early 20th century, improved sanitation, hygiene and medical technology, as well as reduced
poverty and better access to nutritious foods, led to a reversal of urban-rural differences in health
conditions. (World Bank, 2009) In currently developing countries, household surveys generally
show that health and nutrition indicators are on average better in urban areas than in rural areas,
although with significant inequalities within urban populations. (Van de Poel, O’Donnell and Van
Doorslaer, 2007) This urban health advantage can be attributed to higher average incomes in urban
areas compared to rural areas, improved hygiene and sanitation conditions as governments
establish services in growing cities, and better access to health care services. (Leon, 2008)

This paper is an exploratory analysis of this dichotomy in the context of urban India, drawing on
available literature, administrative information and government reports, census and household
survey data, and qualitative information from visits to four case study cities – Chennai,
Bhubaneswar, Meerut and Shillong.

1.1. Urban health advantages
Overall, the urban health advantage in India is considerable, although with significant exceptions.
For example, in 2012, average under-five mortality in urban areas was 32.0 per 1,000, 45 percent
lower than the rate of 58.0 per 1,000 in rural areas. (Figure 1.1) This urban-rural difference is of
similar magnitude, although somewhat larger, than the 40 percent gap in 1992-93. A significant
urban advantage is also evident with regard to service utilization indicators, although urban-rural
differences have narrowed in recent years as coverage has improved faster in rural areas. The

urban-rural difference in delivery care coverage dropped from 251 percent (of the rural level) in
1992-93 to just 12 percent in 2014, when 89.2 percent of births among the urban population took
place in health facilities, compared to 79.6 percent of births among the rural population.

On average, urban populations also use more inpatient medical care than rural populations,
although the urban advantage has disappeared with regard to outpatient care. (Figure 1.2) In 2014,
in urban areas the annual hospitalization rate was 44 per 1,000 population, more than double the
rate of 20 per 1,000 in 1995-96. The hospitalization rate in rural areas similarly more than doubled
during the period, but the difference between the urban and rural rates remained similar.

The urban health advantage is evident at all household economic levels. In 2005-06, among the
poorest 20 percent of households under-five mortality was 45.0 per 1,000 in the urban population
compared to 63.2 per 1,000 in the rural population. There was similarly a large urban-rural
difference in fertility at the poorest quintile, while the difference in child malnutrition was not as
large. A similar pattern is seen with service utilization indicators. For example, in 2014, among
the poorest quintile of urban households, 85.2 percent of births were in health facilities, compared
to 74.9 percent among the poorest quintile of rural households. (Figure 1.3) This pattern is evident
for such indicators as vaccination coverage, antenatal care utilization and contraceptive use, where
the poorest urban quintile in the four states where our case studies are located consistently showed
better results than the poorest rural quintile.

Better access to private sector health services accounts for a significant portion of urban-rural
differences in service utilization. For example, in 2014, among the urban population, 47.5 percent
of births were delivered in private sector health facilities, compared to 24.1 percent among the
rural population. (2014 National Sample Survey, 71st Round) However, urban-rural differences in
use of private sector services are not as large with regard to general outpatient and inpatient care.
For example, in 2014, among the urban population, 69.4 percent of persons ill in the previous 15
days went to private providers for outpatient care, compared to 62.5 percent among the rural
population. At the same time, there are considerable differences between cities in the use of private
sector services. In Meerut, where use of the private sector for outpatient care was on average 89.6
percent, the poorest quartile tended to use the private sector slightly more, at 93 percent. In
contrast, the poorest quartile in Chennai reported using the private sector considerably less (36.6
percent) than the average for the city (65.2 percent). (2005-06 National Family Health Survey 3)

While, as described in the next section, urban households, particularly the better-off, pay more out-
of-pocket for health care than do rural households, they are somewhat more likely to have access

to insurance to cover health costs. On average, in 2014, 18.1 percent of urban residents received
health insurance benefits, compared to 14.1 percent of rural residents. This difference is largely
driven by higher coverage of better-off households by private health insurance, although benefits
received from government health insurance are comparable in urban and rural areas. Urban
residents are also less likely to need to resort to informal insurance mechanisms such as borrowing,
selling assets and receiving contributions from others, in order to meet health care costs. Again,
the urban-rural difference is higher at higher household economic levels. (Figure 1.4) On average,
in 2014, 25.1 percent of urban households needed to draw on such coping mechanisms to pay
hospital bills, compared to 32.2 percent of rural households.

An urban advantage is also manifested in access to water and adequate sanitation, services with
significant effects on health and nutrition. In 2011, although most urban and rural households (98
and 96 percent respectively) used what is considered a safe source for drinking water, the water
source for 71 percent of urban households was within their premises, compared to just 35 percent
of rural households. While in urban India 20 percent of households did not have toilets, and 68
percent of these households defecated in the open, 70 percent of rural households did not have a
toilet facility, of which 97 percent resorted to open defecation. (2011 Census) These urban-rural
differences were evident at all levels of household economic status.

Better health, nutrition and population outcomes and service utilization indicators in urban areas
are firstly reflective of better economic conditions in cities. For example, in 2011-12, average
monthly per capita expenditure among the urban population was Rs 2,630 (US$ 52), compared to
Rs 1,430 (US$ 28) among the rural population. (2011-12 National Sample Survey, 68th Round)

Urban health advantages are also partly due to some specific agglomeration economies, especially
the concentration of health services in urban areas. This is the case with regard to private health
services, but it is also true for government hospital services (although not government primary


                                                                         4
health care services). The case studies point to the concentration of health services as an important
agglomeration economy. Chennai, Bhubaneswar and Shillong all benefit from being state capitals,
leading to concentration of hospital services in particular. Meerut’s proximity to Delhi provides
access to tertiary hospital services.

A further potential agglomeration economy, closely tied to the urban economy overall, relates to
the value of land in urban areas. It is estimated that governments in India could monetize their land
holdings to generate as much as US$ 27 billion annually for urban development investments.
(McKinsey & Company, 2010) A number of state and local urban governments, in Delhi for
example, have traded access to land for private hospital development for commitments to reserve
hospital beds for the urban poor, initiatives that have shown mixed success.1 A more sophisticated
effort is a planned public-private partnership in Bhubaneswar that involves development by a
private partner of the Municipal Corporation’s network of hospital and outpatient services. The
private entity is largely motivated by access to the location of the Municipal Corporation’s hospital
on land that it would not otherwise be able to acquire or develop. This partnership provides an
example of another potential agglomeration economy - innovation linked to the dynamism of the
private sector in cities. Another example of innovation is high-volume and low cost surgical care
provided by private hospitals, often purchased by government-financed insurance schemes, such
as cardiac procedures provided by a Bangalore hospital to thousands of patients. (Mukherji and
Swaminathan, 2013)

The population density of urban areas provides an inherent agglomeration economy in that it is
easier and more cost effective to reach people with services, such as immunization. Investments
in infrastructure and services, such water supply and sanitation, are necessarily more cost-effective
with higher population densities.

Finally, the age distribution of the urban population in India may also point to an urban economic
advantage, since in comparison with the age distribution of the rural population, the urban
population has a greater proportion in the most economically productive ages between 20 and 59
years. In urban areas, this age group accounts for about 56 percent of the population, compared to
about 48 percent in rural areas, suggesting that the so-called demographic dividend is currently
centered on urban economies in India.

1.2. Urban health penalties
The major exception to the urban advantage in health, nutrition and population outcomes is the
ratio of females to males, which is worse among urban populations compared to rural populations,
worse among the better-off compared to the poor (in both urban and rural areas), and has been
getting worse over time. The 2011 census found that among the urban population in India there
were 902 girls for every 1,000 boys aged 0 to 6 years, while the ratio among the rural population
was 919. There has been a deterioration among both urban and rural populations, as the ratios in
1991 were 935 and 948 respectively. Survey data in 2005-06 indicated that this urban penalty held

at every household economic level and that the sex ratio worsened at higher economic levels.
(Figure 1.5) In the poorest quintile in urban areas, the number of girls for every 1,000 boys was
910, lower than in the poorest quintile in rural areas, where it was 923, but significantly better than
in the highest quintile in urban areas, where it was 820. The lower sex ratio in urban areas is
consistent with persistent cultural preference for sons combined with lower fertility, growing
household economic resources providing greater access to ultrasound and abortion services, and
greater availability of such services in urban areas. (Jha et al., 2011)

The urban-rural difference in sex ratios is apparent in 2011 census data for the districts where our
city case studies are located. Consistent with national patterns, the lowest ratios are in Meerut
District and the highest in Chennai and East Khasi Hills. Worse ratios in urban areas compared to
rural areas of these districts are observed in Khorda District (which includes Bhubaneswar),
Meerut District, and East Khasi Hills District (which includes Shillong). Nonetheless, Chennai
provided an exception to the general pattern, as the ratio of 950 in urban Chennai was better than
the rural average of 936 for the state.

There is also some indication that nutrition outcomes may be worse in some instances among the
urban poor compared to the rural poor. In 2005-06, the national average rates of child stunting
among the poorest quintiles in urban (53.6 percent) and rural areas (58.8 percent) were similarly
very high, while in Tamil Nadu, the rate of 42.3 percent among the poorest urban quintile was
higher than the rate of 35.6 percent among the poorest rural quintile. Although national surveys
find that rates of reported diarrhea suffered by children are similar in urban and rural areas, in some
cases, reported prevalence can be higher among urban populations. In Meghalaya, 4.8 percent of
under-five children in urban areas had diarrhea in the two weeks prior to the survey, compared to
2.8 percent in rural areas. This is likely related to poor sanitation in urban areas.

Some infectious diseases are associated with urban areas, although definitive conclusions cannot
be drawn due to uncertainties about incidence in both urban and rural areas. Tuberculosis has long


                                                                                    6
been associated with urban congestion and poor living conditions in slums. While studies in India
have found higher prevalence among rural populations, a 2005 prevalence survey indicated higher
risk infection among urban populations. (Chadha, 2005) Recent emergence of drug-resistant
tuberculosis may be concentrated in particular urban areas, such as Mumbai. (Dalal et al., 2015)
Incidence of the viral disease dengue is increasing worldwide, including in India, associated with
urbanization. (Guha-Sapir and Schimmer, 2005) However, again, at least one study in India found
similar prevalence in both urban and rural areas. (Tripathi et al., 2008) Dengue is transmitted by
the aedes aegypti mosquito, which also carries the chikungunya and zika viruses; the mosquito’s
habitat is adapted to urban conditions. India is estimated to contribute one-third (33 million
infections in 2010) of the global burden of apparent dengue infections. (Bhatt et al., 2013). In
2015, the number of reported dengue cases in Delhi was the highest in 20 years.2

With regard to chronic, or non-communicable, diseases, the picture is mixed. Urban-rural
differences in reported prevalence as well as risk factors such as tobacco differ in different
circumstances. For example, self-reported prevalence of diabetes and hypertension were
significantly higher in urban Khorda District (containing Bhubaneswar) than in the rural part of
the district. This was the case in Meerut District with regard to diabetes, but not hypertension.
(2012-13 Annual Health Survey) The presence of biometric signals of diabetes and hypertension
was similar among urban and rural populations of East Khasi Hills District (containing Shillong).
(2012-13 District Level Household and Facility Survey 4) Nationally, in 2005-06, tobacco use by
men was lower in urban areas (28.7 percent) than in rural areas, and alcohol use was similar. (2015-
06 National Family Health Survey 3)

Nonetheless, over-nutrition is clearly more prevalent among urban populations, posing increased
risks for non-communicable diseases. In 2005-06, 15.9 percent of men were overweight or obese
in urban India, compared to 5.6 percent in rural areas; the proportions for women were 23.5 percent
and 7.4 percent in urban and rural areas respectively. (2005-06 National Family Health Survey)

Air pollution represents a significant urban health penalty. Ambient air pollution is estimated to
contribute to 3 percent of the total burden of disease in India, and pollution levels – from vehicles,
industry, electricity generation and heating and cooking – are likely higher in urban areas. Air
pollution in the form of fine particulate matter (PM) (particularly particles that are less than 10 or
2.5 microns in diameter, PM10 and PM2.5 respectively), penetrates deep into the lungs and is
associated with cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, lung cancer and mortality. One study
estimates that 650,000 premature deaths in India each year are associated with air pollution.
(Lelieveld, Evans, Fnais, Giannadaki, & Pozzer, 2015) Concentrations of PM2.5 tend to be higher
in larger and more densely populated cities. Air pollution in Delhi in particular has been
characterized as among the worst in the world. For the more dangerous PM2.5, in 2013, Delhi had
mean annual levels that were almost 15 times higher than guidelines, along with Patna and
Gwalior. Among our case study cities, Meerut had five times the recommended level of PM2.5 and
six times the recommended PM10 levels, while the other cities were closer to guidelines. (World
Health Organization, 2014). Nonetheless, household or indoor air pollution is estimated to

contribute a larger proportion of the national disease burden (6 percent), and may be a greater
problem in rural areas where indoor cooking and heating fires are more prevalent. (Balakrishnan,
Coen and Smith, 2014) Among our case studies, self-reported asthma is higher in rural Khorda
and Meerut Districts than in urban areas of those districts. (2012-13 Annual Health Survey)

Injuries and deaths due to road traffic accidents, as well as crime, are thought to contribute to an
urban health penalty, but again urban-rural contrasts are not clear. A nationally-representative
mortality survey found that, in 2005, 2 percent of all deaths in India were due to road accidents,
with a slightly higher rate among urban populations. (Hsiao, 2013) At the same time, surveys find
that the rate of reported injuries of all kinds is higher in rural areas than in urban areas. For example,
in Tamil Nadu, 4 percent of the urban population reported suffering any type of injury, compared
to 5.4 percent of the rural population. (2012-13 District Level Household and Facility Survey 4)

Overall, even though child mortality and the burden of infectious diseases generally are lower
among urban populations, maternal and child health conditions still represent a significant
challenge. At the same time, it is evident that injuries and non-communicable diseases, along with
associated risk factors like over-nutrition and air pollution, present important and likely growing
burdens on urban populations. This dual burden of disease may represent somewhat of an urban
health penalty, although the pattern also characterizes rural populations.

With regard to service utilization, the main exception to the urban advantage is government-
provided nutrition services, which are used more by rural populations and by the poor. Overall, in
2005-06, 10.0 percent of under-six children in urban areas received supplementary nutrition from
government services, compared to 22.7 percent of rural children. Among the poorest quintile, these
proportions were 16.9 percent of urban children and 25.9 percent of rural children. (2005-06
National Family Health Survey 3)

Utilization of government nutrition services is a reflection of a general pattern of urban populations
using less government services, particularly at the primary level, compared to rural populations,


                                                                        8
although differences are lower among the poor. For example, in 2014, among the urban population,
41.7 percent of births were delivered in government health facilities, compared to 55.5 percent
among the rural population. In the poorest urban quintile, the proportion was 53.5 percent,
compared 58.0 percent in the poorest rural quintile. (Figure 1.3) Other indicators of reproductive
and child health service utilization show that urban populations are less likely to use government
services than rural populations. Similarly, in 2014, use of general outpatient care from government
health services was lower in urban areas (18.7 percent) compared to rural areas (24.7 percent).
However, as an indication that government hospital services are more available in urban areas,
urban populations used more government inpatient services (18 percent) compared to rural
populations (11 percent).

Reflecting greater use of health services, especially private sector health services, higher out-of-
pocket spending on health care by urban households can be considered an urban penalty. In 2011-
12, average monthly health expenditures by urban households totaled Rs 146 (US$ 2.90),
compared to Rs 95 (US$ 1.89) by rural households. (2011-12 National Sample Survey, 68th
Round). However, health spending by the poorest in both urban and rural areas was quite similar
in both absolute terms and as a proportion of total household consumption expenditures. As
household economic status increased, household spending on health care increased, both in rupee
terms and as a proportion of total expenditures, and the urban-rural gap increased. (Figure 1.6)
Thus, this urban penalty is mostly felt by the better-off, reflecting their better access to private
health care services, but, as noted above, better-off households in urban areas have better access
to formal insurance and are less likely to use informal insurance mechanisms to cover health care
costs. On the other hand, urban populations benefit slightly less from government-supported health
insurance (12.0 percent), compared to rural populations (13.1 percent). (2014 National Sample
Survey, 71st Round)

Disparities in health, nutrition and population outcomes and service utilization can also be
considered an urban health penalty, although they are just as relevant for rural populations.
Mirroring disparities between states across India, linked to differing economic conditions, there
are considerable differences between the four city case studies, with indicators generally better in
Chennai, followed by Bhubaneswar and Shillong, and lastly Meerut. In 2005-06, under-five
mortality among the poorest quartile in Chennai was 44.8 per 1,000, considerably lower than the
overall average in Meerut (62.8) and half the rate among the poorest quartile in Meerut (83.9).
(2005-06 National Family Health Survey 3)

Within urban populations, indicators generally (except sex ratio and out-of-pocket expenditures)
show improvements with increased household economic status. In 2005-06, under-five mortality
among the highest household economic quintile among the urban population was 19.9 per 1,000,
less than half the rate of 45.0 among the lowest urban quintile. Similarly, in 2014, while 95.9
percent of births among the highest urban quintile were delivered in health facilities, 85.2 percent
of births among the lowest urban quintile were delivered in an institutional setting. (Figure 1.3) In
2014, while 38.4 percent of urban households in the highest economic quintile received benefits
from health insurance, the proportion among urban households in the poorest quintile was 9.5
percent. (Figure 1.6)


                                                 9
Urban slums are the most visible concentration of the variety of congestion costs associated with
urbanization, including urban health penalties. Because slum populations are socio-economically
heterogeneous, health outcome and service utilization indicators in slums are generally better than
those of the poorest households in the urban population, but also generally worse than overall
urban averages. The 2011 census enumerated 65.5 million people living in slums, or around 17
percent of the total urban population of 377 million. Meerut and Chennai are among the cities with
the highest proportion of their populations living in slums, at around 40 percent. In 2005-06, under-
five mortality among the slum population in Meerut was 86.1 per 1,000, compared to 69.4 among
the population living outside of slums; in Chennai, these estimates were 46.3 and 31.5 respectively.
Utilization of various types of health care and nutrition services by slum inhabitants is lower than
by non-slum populations, while slum populations are more likely to make use of government
health services, even though government health facilities are generally not located in slums. At the
same time, a 2012 survey found that between 15 and 29 percent of surveyed slums experienced
improvements in medical facilities over the previous 5 years. (2012 National Sample Survey, 69th
Round)

Slum residents also suffer from penalties (in relation to the urban population as a whole) with
regard to water and sanitation. Although 65 percent of slum households have access to water from
an improved source, the water source is located within their premises for only 42 percent, as
compared to the urban average of 71 percent. More strikingly, 34 percent of slum households do
not have a toilet facility in their premises, compared to the urban average of less than 20 percent,
and almost one in five slum residents defecate in the open. (2011 Census)

1.3. Policy responses
Implicit in the notion of congestion costs, which restrain the acceleration of economic growth
fostered by urbanization, is the proposition that governments can and should reduce these costs in
order to maximize the benefits of urbanization. (Ellis and Roberts, 2016) From this perspective,
despite the fact that, with regard to health, nutrition, and population, urban populations in India are
generally doing better than rural populations, it is likely that they could be doing even better, and
that this would enhance the social and economic benefits of urbanization. This view is consistent
with the broader notion that better health, nutrition and population conditions contribute to
improved human capital, increasing the population’s capacity to pursue economic devel opment.
(Sachs, 2001) Even more broadly, improved health and nutrition are considered development
objectives in themselves, (Sen, 1999) which should motivate government action to improve
conditions for the urban poor in particular.

India’s constitution assigns to state governments responsibility for local administration, health
services, and water supply and sanitation. The 73rd and 74th amendments to the constitution,
adopted in 1992, set out standards for how rural and urban local governments respectively should
be organized, providing lists of options for local government responsibilities to be devolved by
state governments. This was to a great extent motivated by the notion that empowered local
governments would be more responsive to local demands for better social services. (Mullen, 2011)
However, in contrast with rural local governments, possible responsibilities for urban local



                                                  10
governments listed under the 74th amendment do not include services such as education and health
care, focusing on urban infrastructure such as water supply and sanitation and. “Public health” is
mentioned, but the term refers to environmental hygiene and sanitation rather than medical
services.

Given the dramatic growth of cities in India, administrative fragmentation is common as a given
urban area may be governed by a combination of a long-standing municipal corporation in the
historical center of the city, other urban local governments in parts of the city that have grown over
time, and state and local government structures (i.e. Districts, Blocks, Panchayats) in place for
newly-urban areas that are still considered administratively as rural. For example, the Municipal
Corporation of Chennai recently expanded, gaining a population of about 2.5 million, in order to
encompass urban areas on its periphery, but another 1.5 million people in the larger urban
agglomeration of Chennai still remain outside its boundaries. In addition, within cities there can
be differences in the administrative status of neighborhoods, particularly differences between
slums and established neighborhoods and between different categories of slums, which may be
officially-recognized or not, affecting extension of government services. Among the over 3,000
slums in Chennai, only 751 are “notified,” or officially recognized under relevant legislation. In
Bhubaneswar, 436 slums were enumerated by the 2011 census, of which 99 were authorized.
Administrative fragmentation contributes to considerable differences in access to services. In
Chennai, access to treated drinking water ranges from 46 percent of households in ward 110 to 94
percent in ward 15. (2011 Census)

There are large differences in the structures and capacities of urban governments in India. The
municipal corporations of several large cities, notably Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata, benefit from
significant resources and capacity due to their historical legacies. Along with managing transport,
water, sanitation and other infrastructure and systems associated with urban government, these and
some other large cities provide health services through their own networks of facilities and staff.
The Chennai Municipal Corporation runs almost 150 primary health care facilities of different
types, while the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation manages a hospital and a half dozen primary
facilities. However, in most urban areas in India, government health services are part of state
government systems. This is the case in Meerut and Shillong.

Observers have suggested that until about a decade ago, the central government’s response to
urbanization was characterized by neglect, if not active discouragement. The political economy of
urban areas has been described as a situation where the middle class is able to exert its political
influence in order to receive basic services, notably water and sanitation, while poor and slum
populations struggle to influence governments to make the necessary investments in public
infrastructure for their benefit. (Chaplin, 2011) However, recent central government initiatives
mark recognition of the need to effectively manage urbanization as a force for economic growth.
(Mukhopadhyay, 2006) These focus on urban transport, water and sanitation infrastructure,
housing, and slum resettlement and development.

In the health sector, larger government hospitals are located in urban areas, but the main focus of
government support to primary health care has been on rural areas. There are less than 2,000



                                                 11
government primary health care facilities designated as urban facilities, (Government of India,
2013c) compared to more than 25,000 Primary Health Centres in rural areas. (Government of
India, 2015a) The central government’s flagship investment program, started in 2005, was called
the National Rural Health Mission and did not include investment plans for health services
managed by urban local governments.

A National Urban Health Mission was approved by the central government in 2013, when both the
rural and urban programs were subsumed under the National Health Mission. The urban program
adopted a similar approach as the National Rural Health Mission, with objectives for availability
of different levels of government services, including community health workers, auxiliary nurse
midwives, Urban Primary Health Centres and Urban Community Health Centres. (Government of
India, 2013a) With an urban population of 377 million, this would imply investment in about 5,000
new Urban Primary Health Centres and 1,000 Urban Community Health Centres. Support for
community-based organizations is also planned. Administration of the Urban Health Mission is
integrated with the existing implementation of the National Rural Health Mission, led by the state
governments, although the program encourages “active participation” of urban local governments.
Possible exceptions are Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and
Ahmedabad, where municipal corporations may take the lead in implementation. (Government of
India, 2013a) In our city case studies, the urban health investment program is largely at the
planning stage, with initial work focused on upgrading existing facilities. Chennai has the most
ambitious plans, aiming to create 20 new Urban Primary Health Centres and proposing support to
15,000 community-based organizations (Mahila Arogya Samitis). In contrast with the efforts
mentioned above to leverage the value of government land to improve access to hospital services
by the poor, land values and availability have presented a barrier to government investment in new
urban primary health care infrastructure. (Government of India, 2014b)

In fiscal year 2014-15, the budget for the National Health Mission was Rs 220 billion (US$ 3.6
billion), of which Rs 20 billion (US$ 315 million) was allocated for investments under the urban
health program.3 The annual budget was similar (US$ 320 million) for the central government’s
investment program for new tertiary-level institutions in urban centers across the country.

Another major policy direction in the health sector in recent years, taken by the central and some
state governments, involves government-financed health insurance for the poor. These programs
provide coverage for inpatient services for eligible households, purchasing services from both
government and private hospitals. A total of 36.3 million households are currently enrolled in the
central government health insurance program targeting poor households, 4 and it has been
estimated that by 2015, about 500 million people will have become eligible for benefits under
various central and state government insurance programs. (La Forgia and Nagpal, 2012) For
example, both government and non-government hospital services in Shillong provide services

purchased by the state government’s Megha Health Insurance Scheme based on the central
government program to which the state government has added resources in order for the entire
state population to be eligible.

The 2010 Clinical Establishments Act provides a legislative basis for state governments to regulate
private sector health care providers.5 The Act requires health facilities to be registered and to meet
minimum requirements to be defined for different types of services. The Act currently applies to
nine states. However, detailed regulations and guidelines for implementation of the Act, including
minimum standards, have not yet been adopted, hampering effective implementation. Although
Uttar Pradesh has adopted the national legislation, implementation is still limited to the
requirement for facilities to register with the state government. Over 2,300 private health care
providers are registered in Meerut, but no estimates are available of the substantial number of
unqualified providers. Experience with government-financed health insurance schemes indicates
that regulation and quality control of private sector providers is likely to be most effective when
linked to government purchasing of services.

Governments in India spend about 1 percent of GDP on health, two-thirds of which comes from
state governments. (Government of India, 2014c) However, the programs described above
illustrate how the central government’s fiscal power has been used to set national strategies and
standards. The financing of these programs, as well as, in nutrition, of the Integrated Child
Development Services, has until recently been split 75:25 between the central and state
governments. Between 2005-06 and 2014-15, central government funding for the National (Rural)
Health Mission rose from Rs 44.3 billion (US$ 1.0 billion) to Rs 171.2 billion (US$ 2.8 billion).
(Government of India, 2015a) Central financing of the Integrated Child Development Services was
Rs 54.0 billion (US$ 1.3 billion) in 2007-08, rising to Rs 162.7 billion (US$ 2.7 billion) in 2014-
15. (Government of India. 2015b) However, with the theme of “cooperative federalism,” the
central and state governments are moving towards greater unconditional fiscal transfers to the
states and less funding tied to centrally-directed programs. In particular, the proportion of tax
revenue transferred to the states by the central government has risen from 32 percent to 42 percent,
while the number of central government schemes will be cut, and the center-state financing ratio
will be changed to 60:40 for the National Health Mission, Integrated Child Development Services,
and other central schemes. (Government of India, 2015f)

This direction in fiscal policy means that state governments will have increasing importance for
urban health and nutrition services. This is all the more the case since, in contrast to the thrust of
development of rural local governments, health and nutrition services are not envisioned as part of
urban government responsibilities, with the possible exception of large municipalities that manage
existing health services. Nonetheless, a large proportion of funding for the National Health Mission
will still be provided by the central government (60 percent), so that the program will remain an
important tool for setting the agenda as well as for leveraging state government funding. Over the
past several years, there has been debate at the national level over the direction of health policy
(High Level Expert Group for Universal Health Coverage, 2011), and a draft strategy has been

strategy’s fiscal implications.7

1.4. Conclusions
This exploratory analysis provides an overview of the status of health, nutrition and population in
urban India, putting basic data on the table as well as examining the specifics of four cities. Overall,
we find that there is a considerable urban health advantage, drawing on agglomeration economies
related to the concentration of health services in cities, as well as contributing to urbanization as
an engine for economic growth. However, there are important exceptions, particularly relating to
the urban sex ratio, child malnutrition in some cases, especially among the poor, some infectious
diseases such as dengue, and the growing burden of injuries and non-communicable diseases.
Urban populations, while benefiting earlier than rural populations from the demographic dividend,
are also faced earlier with a dual burden of disease. Large disparities, between the urban poor and
better-off, as well as between cities in different parts of the country, are also major challenges.

With regard to the policy response to congestion costs associated with health, nutrition and
population, although government hospital services are concentrated in urban areas, until recently,
government investment in primary health care and nutrition services has been focused on rural
areas. Some of the trend data on basic services such as immunization and delivery care, which
show faster improvements in rural areas along with growing use of government services, suggest
that investment in government primary health services can have an impact on improving coverage.
This is the main thrust of the central government’s urban health investment program. At the same
time, there has been positive experience, at a feasible fiscal cost, with government-financed health
insurance covering inpatient care and targeting the poor. (Sood et al., 2014) These two strands of
government policy are likely to continue and, in our view, make sense given our understanding of
the overall picture of urban health, service delivery and financing. That is, continuation of this dual
strategy involves improved supply of government-delivered maternal and child health (and
nutrition) services in urban areas, combined with government financing of higher-level and more
costly hospital care for the poor in order to prevent catastrophic and impoverishing out-of-pocket
expenditures. The growing burden of non-communicable diseases indicates that the package of
primary-level services delivered by the government in urban areas should also include relevant
cost-effective services to address non-communicable diseases, the evidence base for which is
becoming established based on experience in India. (Krishnan et al., 2013; Basu, Bendavid and
Sood, 2015)

It is likely that households are better able to self-insure to cover more predictable ongoing
outpatient care (through coping mechanisms such as borrowing or selling assets), as opposed to
large unpredictable expenses for high-level hospital care. (Gertler and Gruber, 2002) This is the
justification for targeting limited fiscal resources to cover higher-level inpatient services for the

poor. At the same time, the private sector under-supplies basic maternal and child health services
(and perhaps also cost-effective non-communicable disease services); thus the justification for
allocating resources to government provision.

These two policy directions, however, do not adequately deal with where the bulk of health care
services are provided and household out-of-pocket spending are incurred (especially in urban
areas): private sector outpatient services. While it has been pointed out that current government
insurance schemes, focusing on inpatient care, do not address most out-of-pocket health spending
(the majority of which is spent on medicines) (Shahrawat and Rao, 2012), advocates have pushed
for greater investment in government delivery of outpatient services (High Level Expert Group for
Universal Health Coverage, 2011), achieving temporary success in a short-lived government
commitment to provide medicines free-of-charge. (Nagarajan, 2015) Policymakers are balking at
the fiscal implications while questioning the feasibility of the government system replacing the
preponderant private sector supply of general outpatient care. Over time, as their fiscal resources
and capacities grow, governments in India will surely start to undertake a combination of supplying
and purchasing general outpatient health services. In the meantime, government action to improve
urban health, nutrition and population will likely follow the existing policy directions of
strengthening basic preventive, maternal and child health (and perhaps non-communicable
disease) services at the primary level, along with supplying (through government hospitals) and
financing (through insurance schemes purchasing private services) high-cost hospital services for
the poor. This will continue to leave the bulk of general outpatient care to be paid for out-of-pocket
and supplied by the private sector.

At the same time, ongoing changes to fiscal federalism that are empowering state governments
may in the medium term result in state-level experimentation with different strategies. One could
envision, for example, a strategy in Meerut (where 93 percent of the poorest quartile generally use
private services when sick) focused on purchasing private services and a strategy in Chennai
(where 63 percent of the poorest quartile generally use government services) focused on
government service provision targeting the urban poor.

Government action is also needed to address congestion costs in other sectors that have large
impacts on health and nutrition, especially water supply and sanitation, as well as air and water
pollution control. Other urban development issues, such as urban planning, land and property
tenure, and transport, also have effects on health and nutrition, both direct, through improved living
conditions, and indirect, through improved economic growth and household economic levels.
Similar to the health sector, the national government is supporting a number of programs that, in
conjunction with state and local governments, aim to address these issues. However, in contrast
with the health sector, there is also a considerable emphasis on strengthening the responsibilities
and capacities of urban local governments in these areas. Part of the rationale is the notion that
urban communities will be able to more easily hold accountable for service delivery their elected
local governments in comparison to state or national governments. Indeed, it is suggested that
urban development investments will not be effective as long as it is the case that urban residents
cannot vote out the real decision-makers at the state and central levels. (Mukhopadhyay, 2006)



                                                 15
In the health sector, however, this hoped-for dynamic will not be relevant to most urban areas in
India. (Even the large municipal corporations that will continue to run health services will rely on
central and state government funding, particularly for investment). Other accountability
mechanisms will be all the more important for improvement in urban health and nutrition
conditions. These could include regular measurement of key indicators (including through the type
of household surveys that provide much of the data for this analysis), effective use of information
systems and routine service delivery data, data transparency, substantive involvement of
community-based organizations, accountability mechanisms built into health and nutrition
programs themselves such as patient feedback systems, and clearly defined service packages and
benefits. At a minimum, urban health investment and service delivery programs implemented by
state governments should include substantive involvement of elected urban local governments.

2.   INTRODUCTION

It is increasingly recognized that India is urbanizing rapidly, that urbanization is accompanying
and contributing to economic growth, but that living conditions in urban areas are often not
adequate, particularly for the poor. Health, nutrition and population conditions are an important
part of the urbanization equation. This paper explores the extent to which health, nutrition and
population conditions may be contributing to the benefits of urbanization, as well as the extent to
which they may reflect its costs. This is an exploratory study that reviews available information
on health, nutrition, and population conditions in urban India. Recognizing that national
generalizations and statistics may mask considerable diversity in how the opportunities and
challenges of urbanization and health are met in different cities across the country, this paper also
draws on specifics of four case studies: Chennai in Tamil Nadu, Bhubaneswar in Odisha, Meerut
in Uttar Pradesh, and Shillong in Meghalaya.

The preceding summary section provides an overview of this exploratory analysis, discussing the
patterns and issues that emerge, along with policy implications. This introductory section briefly
discusses how urbanization and health may be conceptualized, and describes the methodology of
this paper. Section 3 describes governance and organization of urban health systems. Sections 4
and 5 review data on the demographic and epidemiological situation in urban India, as well as
service utilization. Section 6 analyzes disparities in health outcomes and access to services, and
section 7 focuses on water supply and sanitation in urban areas.

2.1. Urban health advantage and penalty
Economic development is accompanied by increased urbanization. Currently, in developing
countries, the proportion of the population that lives in urban areas is rising in conjunction with
economic growth, mirroring the historical pattern of developed countries. The transition from an
agrarian economy to one dominated by manufacturing and services is accompanied by the growth
of towns and cities where these industries are mostly located. (World Bank, 2009) At the same
time, urbanization in itself is thought to foster economic growth through what are called in the
economics literature agglomeration economies. These come about through improved access to
labor, suppliers and markets, facilitated knowledge exchange, increased specialization, economies
of scale, increased productivity, greater opportunities for innovation and entrepreneurship and
improved access to services. (Quigley, 2009) At the same time, congestion forces can counteract
the economic growth effects of agglomeration, as increasing size and density of cities raises costs
and affects living standards. Congestion forces can include high land prices and wages, unpriced
negative externalities such as traffic jams and pollution, unmet need for essential services, and
effects of population density such as increased risks of disease, accidents and crime. (Quigley,
2009; Ellis and Roberts, 2016)

Mirroring the agglomeration/congestion dichotomy, the public health literature includes the
notions of urban health advantage and urban health penalty. Perceptions of the relationship
between urbanization and health in developing countries, like that between urbanization and socio-
economic development more general, has been shaped by the historical experience of richer
countries. During the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, the populations of rapidly growing


                                                 17
cities in Western Europe suffered worse health conditions than rural populations due to crowding,
poor housing and poor sanitation. Mortality exceeded fertility while the urban population
nevertheless grew dramatically due to migration. (Woods, 2003) Crowding, poor housing, unsafe
water supply, inadequate sanitation, environmental pollution, fires, violence, epidemics, alcohol
abuse and lack of access to nutritional foods, were all factors contributing to the urban health
penalty during this period, and indeed remain important today. In addition, growth in the burden
of non-communicable diseases, as well as injuries and death due to road accidents, can plausibly
be associated with increased urbanization. (Campbell and Campbell, 2007) Both historically and
now, social alienation and inequalities among urban populations are thought to contribute to poor
health outcomes, including mental health. (Galea and Vlahov, 2005) There is considerable focus
on the health situation of poor populations in urban areas, including residents of slums. (Rice and
Steinkopf Rice, 2009)

The historical experience of cities during the Industrial Revolution is that, by the early 20th century,
improved sanitation, hygiene and medical technology, as well as reduced poverty and better access
to nutritious foods, eventually led to a reversal of urban-rural differences in health conditions.
(World Bank, 2009) In currently developing countries, household surveys have shown for some
time that health and nutrition indicators are on average better in urban areas than in rural areas,
although with significant inequalities within urban populations. (Van de Poel, O’Donnell and Van
Doorslaer, 2007) This urban health advantage can be attributed to higher average incomes in urban
areas compared to rural areas, improved hygiene and sanitation conditions as governments
establish services in growing cities, and better access to health care services. Indeed, it became
apparent in the 1970s and 80s that governments in many developing countries were devoting
disproportionate resources to health services in urban areas, particularly hospital services available
to the urban elite and middle class. At the same time, private sector health services are concentrated
in cities, so that overall, urban populations have significantly greater access to health services than
do rural populations. It has also been suggested that the health impacts of highly effective
technologies, such as immunization, are multiplied in urban areas where concentrated populations
are easier to reach. (Leon, 2008)

The urban health penalty can be considered as among the negative externalities of congestion,
requiring government intervention in order to maximize the economic benefits of agglomeration.
(World Bank, 2009) At the same time, the urban health advantage may make positive contributions
to agglomeration economies. Concentration in cities of higher-level medical services and
education may, like in other industries, involve productivity gains. (Baicker and Chandra, 2010)
More available and higher quality health services may be a pull factor, contributing to attracting
and retaining people in urban areas. More broadly, better health conditions may contribute to
improved human capital, increasing the population’s capacity to pursue economic development.
(Sachs, 2001) Finally, improved health can be considered as a development objective in itself (Sen,
1999).

2.2. Methodology
This is an exploratory analysis drawing on available literature, administrative information and



                                                  18
government reports, census and household survey data, and qualitative information from visits to
the four case study cities. This exploratory approach was necessary to provide an overview of a
subject – urban health in India – on which little is available in either published or grey literature.

We initially conducted a literature review that identified relevant published papers, reports and
data sources relevant to health in urban India. This reviewed a somewhat limited literature focused
on urban health in particular, some analysis of urban health issues in developing countries and only
a few studies focused on urban health in India. We then chose several cities in India as case studies.
Given the wide variety of urban contexts in India it is impossible to select a “typical” city to
examine. Selection criteria included that the cities together represent a range of contexts, sizes,
and institutional arrangements, and that there also be some pre-existing contact between the World
Bank and government authorities in order to facilitate access to stakeholders. We selected Chennai,
Bhubaneswar, Meerut and Shillong. Chennai presents a combination of being one of the half dozen
large “metros” of over five million population, capital of a more economically wealthy southern
state with better social indicators, and governed by a well-established municipal government. On
the other hand, Meerut is a large non-capital city in one of the poorer states with poor social
indicators, and with a less well-established local government structure. Bhubaneswar falls
somewhere in between, as a middle-sized state capital, providing some examples of innovation in
the context of urban health. Shillong, although also a state capital, is a small city in a mountainous
area, providing an example from the North-East region of the country. The authors are cognizant
that these four cities are not sufficient to fully represent the range of urban contexts in the country,
but they provide considerable variation in important aspects that can deepen our understanding of
patterns evident in national data.

We collected background information on each city, and then visited the cities to interview a range
of stakeholders. These included government officials (at all levels, including in the fields of health,
medical education, water, and sanitation), local academics, non-governmental organization
representatives, service providers and patients at both public and private clinics. Reports on each
case study were drafted and drawn upon for this synthesis paper.

This synthesis paper uses the case studies as a basis to investigate a broad gamut of urban health
issues relevant for India. Administrative data from government programs in the case cities were
used, as well as district, state and national-level quantitative data from the 2011 census and a
number of household surveys, notably the series of National Family Health Surveys, Annual
Health Surveys, District Level Household and Facility Surveys, and National Sample Surveys.

3.   URBAN HEALTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE AND ORGANIZATION

This section examines how the health sector in urban areas is organized by the central, state and
local governments in India. It reviews the division of responsibilities between the different levels
of government, recent policy directions, and how health system organization works in practice in
the four city case studies.

3.1. Division of responsibilities
India’s constitution, adopted in 1950, includes, as part of its “Directive Principles of State Policy,”
Article 47 on the government’s overall responsibilities in health and nutrition: “The State shall
regard the raising of the level of nutrition and the standard of living of its people and the
improvement of public health as among its primary duties […].” (Government of India, 2007)
India’s government can be characterized as federal in structure, and the constitution sets out
responsibilities for the central (Union) and state governments. State governments are clearly
assigned responsibility for health services and other closely-related sectors such as water supply
and sanitation. At the same time, the constitution’s list of responsibilities shared between the
central and state governments includes numerous pieces of the health sector, including population
control and family planning, mental health services, education, medical education and regulation
of medical professions, vital statistics, and epidemics (across state borders). Economic and social
planning, social security and social insurance, are also shared responsibilities. The central
government has exclusive responsibility for international quarantine measures, tobacco taxation,
and the regulation of goods, including pharmaceuticals, traded across state borders or exported.

In practice, the division of constitutional responsibilities has been characterized as imbalanced, as
the state governments do not have fiscal powers commensurate with their constitutional
responsibilities. The states can tax goods, but the central government possesses the power of
income and corporate taxation. The central government’s fiscal power underlies interventions in
areas of state government responsibility, including health and nutrition services. In conjunction
with central financing and programs, the central government has a strong role in standard-setting,
so that health and nutrition services are organized similarly across the country.

States are fully responsible for local government; however, with the 73rd and 74th amendments,
adopted in 1992, the constitution sets out standards for how they are to be organized in rural and
urban areas respectively. With these amendments, local governments were given status under the
constitution, and were required to be elected, with one third of seats reserved for women. The
amendments were to a great extent motivated by the notion that empowered local governments
would be responsive to local demands, including for better social services. (Mullen, 2011)
However, the process was driven by an impetus to reform local governance in rural areas, with the
74th amendment, relating to urban areas, included almost as an afterthought. (Ramanathan, 2007)

The 74th amendment set out three types of urban local governments: Nagar Panchayats for areas
transitioning from rural to urban; Municipal Councils for smaller urban areas; and Municipal
Corporations for larger urban areas. There are 2,108 Nagar Panchayats, 1,595 Municipal Councils,
and 139 Municipal Corporations. (Indiastat)


                                                  20
The 73rd and 74th amendments provide latitude to state governments to decide on the functions that
they devolve to local governments, drawing on separate lists of possible functions for rural and
urban areas. The list of possible functions for rural local governments has a significant focus on
service provision, including health (“hospitals, primary health centers and dispensaries”), family
planning, nutrition (“women and child development”), education, subsidized food distribution,
water supply and sanitation. In contrast, the list of possible functions for urban local governments
focuses on urban infrastructure such as roads, sanitation and water supply, rather than on service
delivery. The list does not include education and nutrition services, while it mentions “public
health” in conjunction with sanitation and solid waste management, clearly referring to
environmental health measures such as pollution and vector control and not to medical services.
State-level legislation determines which functions are devolved to urban local governments.
(States are free to choose to assign responsibilities to local governments other than those listed).

The 74th amendment envisions establishment of State Finance Commissions every five years to
determine the financing of local governments by state governments. In practice, many states have
not set up such commissions and, if they have, often do not apply their recommendations. Other
potential sources of revenue for urban governments are limited; property taxes are not clearly
linked to property values while fees for services such as water supply are similarly not directly
linked to costs. This has been characterized as a situation of “rich cities, poor urban governments,”
that do not have sufficient fiscal resources to fulfil their responsibilities. (Mehta and Mehta, 2010)

The 73rd and 74th amendments do not apply to tribal areas in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, Mizoram,
and Nagaland, as well as parts of other states declared as “scheduled areas.” Different types of
arrangements for local government in these areas are specified in the constitution, including
regional, district and local administrations. Health, education and other social services are listed
as possible responsibilities of such bodies, which would apply to both rural and urban areas.

There are large differences in the structures and capacities of urban governments in India. The
municipal corporations of several large cities, notably Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata, benefit from
significant resources and capacity due to their historical legacies, having been established several
hundred years ago. Along with managing transport, water, sanitation and other infrastructure and
systems associated with urban government, these and some other large cities provide health
services through their own networks of staff and facilities. However, in most urban areas in India,
health services are part of the state government system.

Delhi presents a particular case, as powers and responsibilities are shared between the national
government, the government of the National Capital Territory (largely functioning like a state
government), and three municipal corporations. Given the dramatic growth of cities in India, such
administrative fragmentation is, in fact, the norm, as particular urban areas may be governed by a
long-standing municipal corporation in the historical center of the city, other urban local
governments in parts of the city that have grown over time, and state and local government
structures (i.e. Districts, Blocks, Panchayats) in place for newly-urban areas that are still
considered by the administration as rural. In addition, within cities there can be differences in the
administrative status of neighborhoods, particularly differences between slums and established



                                                 21
neighborhoods and between different categories of slums, which may be officially-recognized or
not, affecting extension of government services.

3.2. Policy directions
       3.2.1. Urban development

Observers have suggested that until about a decade ago, the central government’s response to
urbanization was characterized by neglect, if not active discouragement. The political economy of
urban areas has been described as a situation where the middle class is able to exert its political
influence in order to receive basic services, notably water and sanitation, while poor and slum
populations struggle to influence governments to make the necessary investments in public
infrastructure for their benefit. (Chaplin, 2011) However, initiation of the Jawaharlal Nehru Urban
Renewal Mission in 2005 marked recognition of the need to effectively manage urbanization as a
force for economic growth. (Mukhopadhyay, 2006) The program focused on urban infrastructure
development, conditioning financing on implementation by the states of the measures included in
the 74th amendment to the constitution, including electoral and administrative reforms. Recent
initiatives further reflect the increasing policy priority given to managing and improving
urbanization. Improved housing, particularly in slums, is the aim of Rajiv Awas Yojana (2013) as
well as a proposed Housing for All program. The Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban
Transformation and the Smart Cities Mission (2015) focus on improving urban infrastructure,
including water supply and sanitation. A recently-launched national program with the aim of
ending open defecation in India by 2019, Swachh Bharat (2014), includes an urban component
focused on building household and community toilets as well as improving solid waste
management.

       3.2.2. Health and nutrition services

In the health sector, larger and higher-level government hospitals, run by central, state and
municipal governments, are located in urban areas, although the numbers of hospitals and beds in
rural areas are significant. In 2013, there were over 1.4 million beds in over 13,000 hospitals in
urban areas; this compares with about 500,000 beds in over 45,000 government hospitals in rural
areas (including Community Health Centres). (Open Government Data Platform India) A major
thrust of central government development policy in the sector focuses on tertiary-level medical
education institutions. In 2012, the central government established in urban centers across the
country six new tertiary-level hospitals on the model of its flagship All India Institute of Medical
Sciences in Delhi, and intends to invest in at least a further ten institutions. The 2014-15 budget
for this investment program was Rs 19,560 million (US$ 320 million).

With regard to primary health care, there have been long-standing national programs that cover
both rural and urban areas, including in the areas of family planning, disease control and nutrition.
With central and state government funding, these programs are implemented through the health
services managed by state governments, as well as through those health services managed by some
municipal governments. Nonetheless, the main focus of government support to primary health care
has been on rural areas. There are less than 2,000 government primary health care facilities


                                                 22
designated as urban facilities (Urban Family Welfare Centres and Urban Health Posts), of which
about 1,200 include a physician on staff. (Government of India, 2013c) In contrast, there are more
than 25,000 Primary Health Centres in rural areas, all of which are supposed to be staffed by at
least one physician (2,000 reportedly do not have a doctor on post). (Government of India, 2015a)
Similarly, the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), the government’s main nutrition-
related service delivery program, is largely focused on rural areas. There are over 1.3 million
Anganwadi Centres in the country, the great majority of which are in rural areas.8 In 2013-14, 36.7
percent of children aged 6-36 months received supplementary food from an Anganwadi Centre in
urban areas, compared to 53.8 percent in rural areas. (Government of India, 2015d)

The rural focus of government support to primary health care is exemplified by the fact that the
central government’s flagship program, started in 2005, was called the National Rural Health
Mission (NRHM). The NRHM encompassed various ongoing disease-specific and maternal and
child health programs, along with investments and human resources aimed to improve state
government primary health services. Support under specific programs was available to health
services managed by municipal governments, the scale of which, as mentioned above, is quite
limited, while investment plans for health services managed by urban local governments were not
included in the program.

        3.2.3. National Urban Health Mission

Although an urban health program was also discussed at the time the National Rural Health
Mission was initiated, the National Urban Health Mission was not approved by the central
government until 2013, when both the rural and urban programs were subsumed under the National
Health Mission. The urban program adopted a similar approach as the National Rural Health
Mission, with objectives for availability of different levels of government services. The program
aims to have in place one community health worker (ASHA) for 200-500 urban households, one
auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM) per 10,000 population,9 one Urban Primary Health Centre per 50-
60,000 population, and one Urban Community Health Centre for 5-6 Urban Primary Health
Centres. With an urban population of 377 million, this would imply investment in about 5,000 new
Urban Primary Health Centres and 1,000 Urban Community Health Centres. The urban program
guidelines include the possibility that services be delivered by private organizations, particularly
non-profit. The NRHM strategy also envisions this, but implementation has been limited. The
National Urban Health Mission’s stated objectives emphasize improving services for slum
populations and other under-served groups. Support for community-based organizations, called
Mahila Arogya Samiti, is envisioned, with a focus on slums. (Government of India, 2013a)

Administration of the Urban Health Mission is integrated with the existing implementation of the
National Rural Health Mission, led by the state governments, although the program encourages
“active participation” of urban local governments. Existing state and district-level implementation

8
  The authors could not find data on the number of Anganwadi Centres in urban areas.
9
  Unlike in rural areas, no health facility (Sub-Centre) is envisioned from which ANMs provide services. ANMs and
Female Health Workers would be based at Urban Primary Health Centres and responsible for outreach services.
(Government of India, 2013a)


                                                       23
structures have added the National Urban Health Mission to their responsibilities. Exceptions are
Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad, where municipal
corporations may take the lead in implementation. State governments have the freedom to decide
to hand over implementation to urban governments in other large cities where they have the
capacity. State plans and budgets are developed on the basis of city-specific plans for approval by
the central government. The National Urban Health Mission targets 779 cities with a population
above 50,000 as well as all district headquarters and state capitals. Urban areas with populations
less than 50,000 are to be supported through the existing National Rural Health Mission
mechanisms. (Government of India, 2013a)

The NUHM is in the initial stage of implementation, focused on institutional arrangements,
planning, and investments in existing urban health facilities. The government recognizes that “the
progress of implementation of National Urban Health Mission has not been satisfactory in many
states. Most of the activities sanctioned under the programme have not been taken up and there is
poor utilisation of the funds released under the programme.”10 In the government’s fiscal year
2014-15, the budget for the National Health Mission was Rs 220 billion (US$ 3.6 billion), of which
Rs 20 billion (US$ 315 million) was allocated for investments under the urban health program.11

        3.2.4. Government-financed insurance schemes

The other major policy direction in the health sector in recent years, taken by the central and some
state governments, involves government-financed health insurance for the poor. These programs
provide coverage for a defined set of inpatient services for eligible households, purchasing services
from both government and private hospitals. Long-standing government-subsidized programs for
public sector workers have been joined by government-financed insurance aimed at households
who possess a Below Poverty Line (BPL) card (issued by state governments, providing access to
social benefits, notably subsidized food). The central government program, Rashtriya Swasthya
Bima Yojana (RSBY), launched in 2008, covers secondary-level inpatient care up to an annual
limit of Rs 30,000 (US$ 450). To be eligible for benefits, BPL households need to enroll and pay
a nominal premium of Rs 30 (US$ 0.45) per family member. Started under the Ministry of Labour,
the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has recently been assigned responsibility for the
program. Like other central schemes, RSBY is implemented by state governments, some of whom
have added covered services and have expanded eligibility. (La Forgia and Nagpal, 2012)
Currently, 23 states participate in the program. Several large separate insurance programs,
covering tertiary care services, have been put in place by the state governments of Andhra Pradesh,
Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. (Sood et al., 2014) The Karnataka program does not involve an
enrolment process or premium payment; BPL card holders are automatically eligible for benefits.

A total of 36.3 million households are currently enrolled in RSBY, holding smart-cards issued by

the scheme, and 9.8 million hospitalizations have been covered since its inception.12 It has been
estimated that by 2015, about 500 million people will have become eligible for benefits under such
central and state government insurance programs. (La Forgia and Nagpal, 2012) The central
government estimated that 13.7 percent of the urban population, or 52.8 million people, were
below the poverty line in 2010-11. (The estimate for the rural population was 25.7 percent, or
216.5 million people). (Government of India, 2013d) However, state governments issue BPL cards
to larger numbers of households on the basis of a variety of criteria. The 2014 National Sample
Survey found that 12.0 percent of the urban population benefited from government health
insurance, compared to 13.1 percent of rural inhabitants.13 In the poorest quintile in urban areas,
this proportion was 7.7 percent, compared to 15.1 percent among the highest quintile. 14 A
significant proportion of the hospital services purchased by these schemes are provided by
facilities in urban areas, particularly higher-level services.

        3.2.5. Regulation of private sector health services

The central government has recently taken steps towards strengthening regulation of private sector
health care services, which provide the majority of health care services in both urban and rural
areas. The preponderance of private health care in urban areas in particular makes regulation a
crucial aspect of government action on urban health. The 2010 Clinical Establishments Act
provides a legislative basis for state governments to regulate private sector health care providers
(although it also applies to government health facilities). The Act requires health facilities to be
registered and to meet minimum requirements to be defined for different types of services. The
law also requires health services to maintain records and provide information to the government,
notably in cases of epidemics and disasters. It prescribes public posting of information on services
and prices, as well as requiring that emergency services be provided when they are needed (to the
extent of the facility’s capacity).15

Because health care regulation is the responsibility of the states, state government legislatures
would need to pass a resolution in order for the law to apply to their states. The Act currently
applies to nine states. Detailed regulations and guidelines for implementation of the Act, including
minimum standards, have not yet been adopted, hampering effective implementation. For the most
part, adequate implementation capacity has not yet been put in place by state governments.
Nonetheless, the Act provides a necessary legislative platform to start improving regulation of
private health care services that are currently largely unregulated.

        3.2.6. Fiscal federalism

Governments in India spend about 1 percent of GDP on health, two-thirds of which comes from
state governments. (Government of India, 2014c) The central government’s fiscal power has been
used to shape state government action in the health sector. Recently, as described above, this has
been done through the National Health Mission and government-financed insurance schemes that
purchase services from private (and to a lesser extent, public hospitals). The financing of these
programs, as well as the Integrated Child Development Services, has been split 75:25 between the
central and state governments.16 Between 2005-06 and 2014-15, central government funding for
the National (Rural) Health Mission rose from Rs 44.3 billion (US$ 1.0 billion) to Rs 220 billion
(US$ 3.6 billion). (Government of India, 2015a) Central financing of the Integrated Child
Development Services was Rs 54.0 billion (US$ 1.3 billion) in 2007-08, rising to Rs 162.7 billion
(US$ 2.7 billion) in 2014-15. (Government of India. 2015b)

However, under the term “cooperative federalism,” the central and state governments are moving
towards a system of greater unconditional fiscal transfers to the states and less funding tied to
centrally-designed and directed programs. In particular, the proportion of tax revenue transferred
to the states by the central government has risen from 32 percent to 42 percent, while the number
of central government schemes will be cut, and the center-state financing ratio will be changed to
60:40 for the National Health Mission, Integrated Child Development Services, and other central
schemes. In addition, a greater proportion of the budgets of those schemes (25 percent) will be
determined by individual state governments. (Government of India, 2015f) Consistent with this
policy direction, central government funding allocations for the National Health Mission and
Integrated Child Development Services were reduced in the 2015-16 national budget in
comparison to the previous year. (Sharma, 2015)

This direction in fiscal policy means that state governments will have increasing importance for
urban health and nutrition services. This is all the more the case since, in contrast to rural
panchayats, health and nutrition services are generally not envisioned (under the 74th amendment,
for example) as part of urban government responsibilities. Possible exceptions are the municipal
governments of large cities that manage existing health service systems. At the same time, the
government’s main policy document on fiscal federalism recognizes that education, health, child
nutrition, water supply and sanitation, are “broad sectors that fall under the category of overlapping
responsibilities […] where principles and objectives of externality, redistribution and equalisation
are critical.” (Government of India, 2015e) A large proportion of funding for the National Health
Mission will still be provided by the central government (60 percent), leaving the program as an
important tool for setting the agenda as well as for leveraging state government funding. Over the
past several years, there has been debate at the national level over the direction of health policy
(High Level Expert Group for Universal Health Coverage, 2011), and a draft strategy has been
formulated (Government of India, 2014c), but this has not been finalized due to disagreement over

  The financing split was 90:10 for the eight North East states, as well as Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and
Jammu and Kashmir, until recently called “Special Category” states.

the respective roles of government-managed and private sector health services,17 as well as the
strategy’s fiscal implications.18

3.3. Case studies
The four case studies provide illustrations of how the governance arrangements and policies
described above have played out in a variety of ways across urban areas in India. Table 3.1 provides
census data on the four case study cities that illustrate how administrative boundaries do not often
coincide with the geographic locations of urban populations. The 2011 census measured the
populations of both rural and urban administrative entities, as well of what are termed “urban
agglomerations.” These encompass contiguous urban areas that are centered on a larger urban core
but are not governed by a single administrative structure. In addition, each city is located in a
district which is part of the state government administration.

Chennai urban agglomeration has a population of 8.7 million, of which about 7 million live within
the boundaries of the Chennai Municipal Corporation, located in Chennai District but also
extending beyond it into Thiruvallur and Kancheepuram Districts. (Prior to its expansion in 2011,
the Chennai Municipal Corporation was contiguous with Chennai District, with a population of
about 4.7 million). With its expansion, the Municipal Corporation absorbed dozens of

municipalities, towns, “census towns,” and “out-growths.”19

The urban agglomeration of Bhubaneswar, with a population of almost 900,000, includes the
Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation, with a population of about 850,000, and over 20 “out-
growths,” entirely located within Khorda District. The Meerut urban agglomeration, with a
population over 1.4 million, is similarly almost entirely composed of the Meerut Municipal
Corporation, with a population of about 1.3 million, plus a military cantonment and four “census
towns,” all located within Meerut District. The population of the Shillong urban agglomeration, at
over 350,000 is more than double that of the Shillong Municipal Board, as it includes a military
cantonment and ten towns (governed by traditional tribal councils called Durbars).

        3.3.1. Health system governance

A range of governance arrangements are in place across the four cities, and the urban
agglomeration centered on each city encompasses a mix of administrative structures. All four cities
are located in districts that include peri-urban and rural populations. All of the urban local
governments examined have responsibilities for water supply, sanitation and solid waste
management, although in the cases of Meerut and Shillong these responsibilities are divided
between various state and local administrative bodies.

With regard to health services, the Chennai Municipal Corporation has a strong role based on its
historical legacy and management of a network of health services. Like Tamil Nadu as a whole,
Chennai benefits from a tradition of focus on public health separately from medical services.
Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation also manages health services but the lead on urban health
system development, particularly at the primary health care level, is being taken by the state
government. The Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation is working on leveraging its existing health
service infrastructure to develop hospital and outpatient curative services through a public-private
partnership. The various administrations in the Shillong urban agglomeration have no role in
government health services, which are largely run by the state government.

Chennai

The Chennai (formerly Madras) Municipal Corporation has a long history with health care and
public health. The first hospital in India was the Madras General Hospital, founded in 1679, while
four other hospitals were established in Madras between 1800 and 1820. In 1939, the Madras
Public Health Act was passed, the first of its kind in India. The city (and indeed Tamil Nadu as a
whole) benefits from high political support for health programs. The Chennai Municipal
Corporation is responsible for government health services and implements national and state
government health programs. The Municipal Corporation is headed by an elected Mayor, who
presides over an elected council representing the city’s 200 wards.

The planning and management of public health and health care services in most states is under one

   “Census towns” are urban centers administered as rural areas, while “out-growths” are urbanized areas connected
to a larger urban area but with no administrative status separate from the rural administration in which they are
located.

government department. This has generally led to the subordination of public health services, such
as environmental health measures and preventive health interventions, to medical services – in
terms of the proportion of health budgets spent on public health programs, career opportunities for
public health staff, the numbers of staff recruited, and the quality of public health training they
receive. In Tamil Nadu, however, three separately funded and staffed health directorates exist;
these are the Directorate of Medical Services, Medical Education and Public Health. The last is
endowed with a budget comparable to the others, and has a large workforce on the ground
complemented with well-trained technical staff with a significant amount of responsibility and
decent career incentives. Observers suggest that this has strengthened public health and preventive
health care in the state. (Das Gupta et al., 2010) Thus, within the Chennai Municipal Corporation,
two departments are responsible for health services – Family Welfare and Public Health. The
Public Health Department conducts public health activities, including vector control, such as anti-
mosquito interventions. Both departments manage facilities that provide health services and
function independently. While Urban Primary Health Centres are under the oversight of the
Department of Public Health, Emergency Obstetrics Centres are accountable to the Department of
Family Welfare. As a result, services are disjointed since the Department of Public Health deals
largely with preventive services and vertical disease programs, while the Department of Family
Welfare deals mainly with reproductive and child health services. There have also been problems
with integrating workers employed under different disease-specific programs, as well as in
managing career paths of medical staff recruited by one or the other of the Public Health or Medical
Services directorates.

In 2011, the Municipal Corporation boundaries expanded significantly to incorporate neighboring
urban areas. It grew from 174 square kilometers to 426 square kilometers, and its population
increased from 4.7 million to 7 million, with an additional estimated 1 million migrant population
that includes large numbers of construction workers and small traders. Chennai also hosts a
floating population of about 150,000 daily. The Municipal Corporation is now divided into 15
zones and 200 wards, as compared to 10 zones and 155 wards before the expansion. The new areas
lack infrastructure and are poorer; posing a challenge to the Municipal Corporation to extend
services. A number of indicators related to contraceptive use and antenatal care appear to have
worsened according to recent survey data, which can likely be explained by the recent expansion
of Chennai’s administrative boundaries. Use of any method of family planning was 63 percent in
2012-13, compared to 58 percent in 2007-08. Likewise, the proportion of pregnant women who
received any antenatal checkup fell from 100 percent to 81 percent, and the proportion of children
who were exclusively breasted between 0 and 5 months declined from 73 percent to 59 percent.
(2007-08 and 2012-13 District Level Household and Facility Surveys) The Corporation plans to
use mobile clinics to reach the populations recently included in its boundaries.

Bhubaneswar

The modern city of Bhubaneswar was developed in 1946 as the capital of the state of Odisha
(previously called Orissa), to replace Cuttack. It is a planned city, with wide roads and open green
spaces. The 2011 census reports a total city population of about 840,000, accounting for 12 percent
of the total urban population of the state. Bhubaneswar is located in Khordha district (which has a


                                                29
population of about 2.3 million). The population has expanded dramatically, growing 29 percent
over the decade 2001-11, which has led to squatter settlements and slums. Bhubaneswar has 436
slums, only 99 of which are authorized, housing a population of about 310,000, which accounts
for over a third of the total population of the city.

Health services in the city are managed by the state government’s Department of Health and
Family Welfare, the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) and the private sector, including
three private medical colleges. The Department of Health and Family Welfare runs 18 dispensaries
and the main referral hospital, Capital Hospital, along with 6 homeopathic and ayurvedic
dispensaries. The Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation manages 5 dispensaries and the BMC
hospital, along with 11 homeopathic dispensaries. Following national regulations, the three private
medical colleges manage urban health training centres that provide out-patient care. Reportedly,
there is little interaction between these centres and the government system. Going forward, the
state government is taking lead responsibility for primary health care services in Bhubaneswar.
Five posts have been created for the position of Additional Medical Officer-Public Health,
responsible for urban areas in the state (Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, Bharampur, Sambalpur and
Raokila). This official of the state Department of Health and Family Welfare (under the Khorda
district administration) leads a Program Management unit that is to coordinate with the Municipal
Corporation’s health services as well as the state Departments of Public Health Engineering and
Housing and Urban Development. The Additional Medical Officer-Public Health is a member and
convener of the City Health Society, chaired by the elected Mayor of Bhubaneswar. The Society
is to meet monthly to set direction on health issues and encourage coordination.

With regard to other sectors, the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation includes Slum Improvement
Officers responsible for monitoring conditions in slums, identifying needs and taking measures to
address them. The Corporation implements a number of national programs targeted to the urban
poor, such as the National Urban Livelihoods Scheme, and has established two night shelters for
homeless people that are managed by non-governmental organizations.

The Chief Medical Officer of the Municipal Corporation, with 250 sanitary officers, is responsible
for sanitation and environmental health, including waste collection and disposal, as well as
mosquito control. Waste collection and disposal in 57 wards is contracted to three private
organizations while in 10 wards it is handled by the Municipal Corporation.

Meerut

The population Meerut Municipal Corporation was 1.3 million in 2011. The city is located in the
district with the same name and the district’s population is almost evenly distributed between urban
and rural inhabitants. Meerut city accounts for 38 percent of the district’s inhabitants. More than
40 percent of households in Meerut city live in slum areas, which is the fifth highest proportion
among Indian cities with over a million population. In 2011, there were 185 slums in Meerut city
of which 43 percent were unregistered and thus less likely to have access to public services.

Meerut city is administered by a Municipal Corporation (Nagar Nigam), with an elected Mayor
and a Municipal Commissioner appointed from the civil service. The Municipal Corporation’s


                                                30
Public Health Department is responsible for birth and death registration, solid waste management,
and hygiene and sanitation regulation, It employs Food and Sanitation Inspectors to oversee
garbage collection and disposal and slaughter house maintenance and registration. Currently, there
are 11 inspectors for the city although 14 positions are sanctioned. Waste management in the city
is observed to be poor, especially within slums. The Municipal Corporation, the state government
and the Meerut Development Authority are involved in water supply and sanitation. Water supply
is mostly dependent on untreated groundwater from wells.

Most government health services in the city are managed by the Uttar Pradesh state government.
The state government operates two District Hospitals in the city (one general and one for women)
as well as 19 Urban Health Posts. The Cantonment General Hospital is meant for the military
inhabitants of the Cantonment and their families, but also provides care to the general public at
highly subsidized rates. Three dispensaries are operated by the Central Government Health
Services for government employees and their families. The Nagar Nigam operates 3 homeopathic
clinics. The Nagar Nigam’s public health department ran a communicable diseases hospital but
this was closed several years ago. The Nagar Nigam’s Chief Health Officer, the Nagar Swastha
Adhikari, is on deputation from the state Department of Health and Family Welfare. There is one
private medical college in the city with an associated urban health training center that provides
primary health care services.

Shillong

Meghalaya is one of the five least urbanized states in India (20 percent of the total population is
urban compared to the national of average of 31 percent). Shillong, its capital city, is located in
East Khasi Hills District which has a population of 825,922. Of the district population, 44 percent
is urban, mostly encompassed by Shillong. The Shillong urban agglomeration (also referred to as
Greater Shillong) consists of Shillong Municipality and Cantonment, as well as a number of towns.
As per the 2011 census, the population of the Shillong urban agglomeration was about 350,000.
About half of Shillong’s households reside in the Municipality and Cantonment, and the other half
in the neighboring towns.

There is an overlapping mix of local governance structures in Meghalaya. Areas now encompassed
by the state were designated as autonomous tribal areas under the 6th Schedule of the 1950
constitution, so that the 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments do not apply. The Autonomous
District Councils of Khasi, Jaintia and Garo, continued in existence after creation of the state in
1972. Under the constitution, the Autonomous District Councils have responsibilities in the areas
of land regulation and use, forest and water management, inheritance and marriage and other social
customs, as well as governance of villages and towns, although it is specified that state legislation
has precedence. Deriving from the authority of the Autonomous District Council of Khasi Hills,
the five towns encompassed in Greater Shillong are governed by traditional Durbars (Councils)
which handle local administrative and judicial issues. Autonomous District Councils and Durbars
are elected. In the Khasi tribal tradition, property is inherited via the youngest daughter or female
relative. However, although some women have been elected to Autonomous District Councils, the
requirements of the 73rd and 74th amendment for reserved seats do not apply, and there has been



                                                 31
controversy over the roles of women in the local Durbars since traditionally women have been
excluded from these bodies. Because central government programs are implemented through the
state government administrative apparatus, traditional local governance structures may not be
involved in implementation.

Shillong Municipality is administered by a Municipal Board, created by state legislation in 1973,
and the Cantonment by a Cantonment Board. The Municipal Council is administered by a civil
servant, and elections have not been held due to opposition related to the existence of the elected
Autonomous District Council. The municipality is also hampered by poor revenue-raising ability.
The fact that only 4 percent of the land in the state is owned by the state government is also notable
given the importance of land to development projects elsewhere in the country.

The 2011 census provides information on slums only for Shillong Municipality, reporting a slum
population of 14,500. However, anecdotal reports indicate that slum areas are widespread in
Greater Shillong, made up of migrant populations and marginalized groups. These areas lack
water, sanitation, health and other services.

The state government’s Public Health Engineering Department supplies water to 80 percent of the
city, with the rest obtaining water from springs and other sources. Within the Shillong
Municipality, water is provided to the Municipal Board, and for the rest of Greater Shillong it is
generally provided to the local Durbars. Water is then piped or provided from public taps to
households by the Municipal Board and Durbars. The Shillong Municipal Board is responsible for
sanitation and solid waste management within the municipality, while in the rest of Greater
Shillong liquid and solid waste disposal is organized in a variety of ways by the local Durbars.

Although responsibilities for water and sanitation are shared between different types and levels of
government, all government health services are managed by the state government.

In the absence of a highway bypass, traffic congestion is high in Shillong as all traffic for southern
Assam and Manipur, Tripura or Mizoram, has to enter the city. There are plans to establish New
Shillong Township to address some of the problems of congestion and infrastructure; currently,
the scheme is in the process of acquiring the planned 2,700 square hectares of land.

       3.3.2. Health programs and services

The Chennai Municipal Corporation operates a substantial network of primary health care services
and robust public health and disease control programs, with responsibilities divided between two
departments within Corporation. The Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation runs a more limited
network of health services while leadership on primary health care services in particular is being
ceded to the state government. There is recent experience with strengthening health care services
in slums in the city. In Meerut and Shillong, government health services are centered on hospital
services managed by the state government, and these confront a number of challenges, notably
relating to human resources. Plans for urban health service development through the National
Urban Health Mission have started with mapping and planning, as well as upgrading of existing
government facilities. Plans for each city involve substantial investment in primary health care



                                                 32
facility infrastructure, as well as the creation of community-level organizations. Contracting of
non-governmental organizations or private sector health care providers does not figure in plans as
yet.

Chennai

The Chennai Municipal Corporation operates 121 Urban Primary Health Centres, 12 Emergency
Obstetrics Centres, 1 communicable disease hospital, 6 diagnostic centers, 15 dental clinics and
another 28 homeless shelters, but also runs several geriatric centres, a de-addiction center, and
non-communicable disease clinics. Primary health care facilities are under-utilized while the
tertiary system is over-burdened. A weak referral system undermines integration. Public health
programs are robust, such as tuberculosis case finding and non-communicable disease screening.

The Corporation implements state government schemes such as the Muthulakshmi Reddy
Maternity Benefit Scheme, which credits Rs. 12,000 (US$ 182) in three installments to the bank
accounts of pregnant women, conditional on: (i) availing complete antenatal care services; (ii)
delivery in a government facility; and (iii) completion of the third dose of diphtheria, pertussis and
tetanus (DPT) immunization before the infant is 14 weeks old. In addition, the national conditional
cash transfer encouraging institutional delivery (Janani Suraksha Yojna) is implemented. In
Chennai, all babies born in Emergency Obstetric Centers are provided with a package including
blankets and an anti-mosquito net. These programs have contributed to growth in the use of
government facilities for maternal care. Delivery at government institutions increased from 49
percent in 2007-08 to 57 percent in 2012-13; similarly, utilization of government services for
antenatal care rose from 50 percent to 67 percent in the same period. (2007-08 and 2012-13 District
Level Household and Facility Surveys) Additional data on about 12,600 institutional deliveries in
2014 provided by the Corporation corroborates that while about 38 percent of women delivered in
the private sector, 42 percent were in government hospitals and 20 percent in Corporation
hospitals.

The Chennai Municipal Corporation has been in the vanguard of delivery of non-communicable
disease interventions through the primary health care system. In 2005, the Corporation began a
cervical and breast cancer screening program; by May 2014, over 500,000 women were screened.
At “Well Women Clinics,” the Corporation health services also screen women for anemia, diabetes
and sexually-transmitted infections.

Other state government programs implemented in Chennai are the Chief Minister’s Health
Insurance Scheme, which finances surgical procedures for the poor, and the Moovaloor
Ramamritham Ammaiyar Marriage Assistance Scheme, aimed at delaying girls’ marriage. The city
runs 203 canteens (Amma Unavagam), staffed by women’s self-help groups, that deliver 250,000
hot cooked meals daily at highly subsidized prices.

Under the National Urban Health Mission, the Corporation of Chennai plans to strengthen existing
facilities, including upgrading of Emergency Obstetrics Centres into Urban Community Health
Centres, and to create 20 new Urban Primary Health Centres in the city’s area of recent expansion.
The establishment of 15 secondary hospitals is also proposed. However, the administrative


                                                 33
structure within the Corporation will remain the same, so that Urban Primary Health Centres will
continue to be managed by the Department of Public Health and the upgraded Urban Community
Health Centres will be under the Department of Family Welfare. To galvanize community
involvement in health delivery under the National Urban Health Mission, it has been proposed that
15,000 Mahila Arogya Samitis be established – some of these will be adapted from already existing
self-help groups. Non-governmental organizations are currently active in a variety of areas and
would be effective partners, particularly for reaching populations in the expanded areas of
Chennai.

Bhubaneswar

Applying the National Urban Health Mission’s objectives for facilities to population ratios would
entail substantial expansion of the government health system in Bhubaneswar. Four Community
Health Centres (two new and two upgraded) as well as six new Primary Health Centres have been
proposed. Primary health services in Municipal Corporation facilities will shift to the responsibility
of the state government under the National Urban Health Mission, while the Corporation is
pursuing a public-private partnership to develop hospital services. The state government has
established a Medical Corporation to improve procurement capacity and processes in order to
implement the government’s plan to provide medicines free-of-charge to patients. The state
government has also conducted a mapping exercise of all slums and has developed ward-level
plans with inputs from communities. A vulnerability assessment of marginalized populations such
as rag pickers, street children, sex workers, the homeless, and those suffering from stigmatized
diseases, is planned. A budget of Rs 580 million (US$ 8.8 million) was proposed for activities
under the National Urban Health Mission in 2014-15 in the entire state, out of which Bhubaneswar
accounted for Rs 190 million (US$ 2.9 million), mostly aimed at infrastructure development.

Bhubaneswar benefits from active participation of civil society organizations and researchers in
shaping health policy development. Discussions with academics made it evident that research,
conducted by organizations such as the Indian Institute of Public Health, frequently influences
dialogue on key service delivery issues.

In 2010, an urban health project financed by USAID targeted 400 authorized and non-authorized
slums in Bhubaneswar, with 11 non-governmental organizations managing 11 health centres. Each
centre, serving a population of 25,000, provided out-patient and outreach services, and was
managed by one doctor, one staff nurse, two auxiliary nurse-midwives and one pharmacist. The
project established Mahila Arogya Samitis, or Women’s Health Committees, a strategy which has
been incorporated in the National Urban Health Mission guidelines. These committees were
responsible for generating awareness within their communities about positive health behaviors
such as immunization, antenatal checkups, and institutional deliveries. Committee members were
also given responsibility to engage in participatory research and generate health resource maps for
the communities to track pregnant mothers and newborn children.

During a visit to an unauthorized slum near BMC Hospital, we met with a 12-member Mahila
Arogya Samiti. Among their activities were water and sanitation awareness, hygiene, family
planning and preventive health education. The group covered 120 households totaling 480


                                                 34
individuals. The committee received Rs 5,000 (US$ 75) as untied funds for health-related
activities, although the group mentioned that it was not enough to effect long-lasting changes in
their communities. Among the most common ailments in their community were high blood
pressure, diabetes, joint pains and gastric problems among adults. Among children it was fever,
cough/cold, and diarrhea. When ill, most individuals go to the BMC Hospital because it neighbors
their slum. Almost all families possess a smartcard for RSBY; however, the group knew of only
one family that had availed the service (for a gallstone operation). Most were also unclear about
the RSBY enrolment renewal process. A number of challenges were expressed by the group,
including the problem of keeping track of families given ongoing migration in and out of the slum.
(The auxiliary nurse-midwife is responsible for outreach and for keeping track of a total population
of 6,500).

The slum centres run by non-governmental organizations were well-utilized, with an average of
50 out-patient cases per day. Contributing to this were evening opening hours convenient for daily
wage laborers and other informal sector workers. Many of the doctors employed by the non-
governmental organizations were retired from government service. With the end of the project, the
slum centers are no longer functional and it is unclear whether the strategy will be pursued by the
state government under the Urban Health Mission.

Meerut

There are two medical colleges in Meerut city (one private and one public) that provide subsidized
services at their hospitals and urban health training centers. The latter are located in slum areas
and provide primary care services to the poor. The two government District Hospitals in the city
are important providers of care to the poor of the city and the district as a whole. At least ten
deliveries take place daily at the women’s hospital while its out-patient department is visited by
300 women. Both hospitals suffer from staff shortages, especially for nurses and class IV
employees such as sweepers.

The state Department of Health and Family Welfare plans to establish new Urban Health Posts
and to strengthen infrastructure and staffing at existing facilities. Of the 19 health posts currently
run by the Department in the city, 8 were established in 1986 by the state government. The
remaining 11 are Reproductive and Child Health posts created in 2005 under the National Rural
Health Mission. The posts suffer from staff shortages: 4 do not have medical officers and 4 of the
40 positions sanctioned for staff nurses and Lady Health Volunteers are currently vacant. During
a visit to an Urban Health Post during operating hours, we found all staff (doctor, auxiliary nurse-
midwife, or Lady Health Volunteer) to be absent. Following population-based norms, the 2014-15
budget proposal submitted by the district Chief Medical Officer to the state administration of the
National Health Mission proposed ten new health posts for the city. The state approved five of
these and has allocated funds for renovating five existing facilities. Two more new health posts
are expected to be approved for the Cantonment area.

However, although the state Department of Health and Family Welfare has contracted a local non-
governmental organization to build the capacity of Village Health and Sanitation Committees in
twelve blocks of the district, no such collaboration is currently planned on urban health issues. The


                                                 35
proposed creation of Mahila Arogya Samitis and two Urban Health Coordinator posts for the
district is expected to encourage community involvement. In addition, the Department expects the
presence of ASHAs in urban areas to kindle demand for public health services. However, since the
proposed budget for the Urban health Mission does not mention plans for collaborating with civil
society organizations, it is unclear whether the latter’s experience and expertise will be used to
train and support the planned new Mahila Arogya Samitis and ASHAs.

In addition, the Urban Health Mission could face challenges relating to infrastructure. For example,
it is difficult for the Chief Medical Officer’s office to acquire space for health posts in the city
because state guidelines stipulate that space for urban health posts can only be rented. This poses
a challenge because private landowners are wary of taking their property off the market to rent to
government agencies who will occupy it for a considerable duration at rates that could fall below
market rates. Nor can the Chief Medical Officer purchase property from government authorities
like the Meerut Development Authority, even though it designates space for health facilities in the
authorized colonies it constructs.

Problems in the functioning of the current health system are likely to affect development of urban
health services. For instance, although the current year’s budget was approved in March, funding
from the state was yet to reach the district in August. It was reported that salaries for staff
contracted under the National Rural Health Mission are presently delayed by three months or
longer. Problems were also noted in the availability of drugs at government health facilities. For
example, stock-outs of anti-tuberculosis drugs, supplied by the central government, were
reportedly common over the past two years, while pediatric anti-tuberculosis drugs have not been
supplied.

Shillong

In Shillong, government primary health care services are comprised of 4 dispensaries, 13 Urban
Health Centres, 1 Primary Health Centre, and 1 Community Health Centre. In addition, there are
four hospitals under the responsibility of the state Department of Health and Family Welfare: Civil
Hospital, Ganesh Das Hospital, R.P. Chest Hospital and the Meghalaya Institute of Mental Health
& Neurological Science. A tertiary-level facility in Shillong, the North Eastern Indira Gandhi
Regional Institute of Health and Medical Sciences, is operated by the central government ’s
Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Lack of human resources, including medical specialists,
is an important constraint for these facilities.

With regard to the National Urban Health Mission, mapping and planning exercises are being done
to inform future investments. The state government has added resources to the central government
funding available for RSBY in order to expand eligibility to the entire state population.

       3.3.3. Private sector

In all four cities – even in Chennai which has the strongest government health system – the private
sector is the provider of a majority health services. There are large numbers and different levels of
private health care providers in each city, although in Shillong hospital services provided by faith-



                                                 36
based organizations are very important. Regulation of private sector providers is weak in each city,
like in India as a whole. In each of the four cities, government-financed insurance schemes for
inpatient hospital care are important examples of public-private engagement. In three cities, this is
linked to the national RSBY program, including in Shillong where the state government has
expanded eligibility to the entire population. Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation is pursuing a
substantial public-private partnership to develop hospital services linked to a network of primary
health care services.

Chennai

Among the four case studies, Chennai has the strongest government health services, and there is
evidence of a recent move towards the government system for maternal health care in particular.
Nonetheless, like elsewhere, the public largely relies on the private sector for out-patient services.
It is reported that 80 percent of the estimated 500,000 out-patient visits per day in the city are in
the private sector. There is a perception of higher quality in the private sector. Patients cite
dissatisfaction with public providers’ diagnoses because of the perceived lack of time and care
given to them from overburdened doctors during visits. A high volume of patients in public
facilities acts as a deterrent for other patients not only because of the long waiting times, but also
because they perceive this as a signal of poorer quality. (Ergler et al., 2011) A study examining
catastrophic payments for health care among households in urban Tamil Nadu found that of those
who fell ill, 67 percent and 78 percent of patients sought private sector treatment for inpatient and
outpatient services respectively. Those who sought care from private providers spent 29 percent
and 20 percent of their household consumption expenditure on inpatient and outpatient services
respectively. Moreover, of those households that used private services, 60 percent faced
catastrophic payments at the 10 percent threshold level. (Vaishnavi and Dash, 2009)

There are significant private sector tertiary hospital care services in the city, which attracts patients
from other states in India as well as from other countries. Regulation of private sector health care
providers is the responsibility of the state government in accordance with the Tamil Nadu Private
Clinical Establishments Act of 1997. The state has not adopted the 2010 national Clinical
Establishments Act.

The government health system has engaged the private sector for provision of specific services
(i.e. family planning and tuberculosis care), as well as ambulance and mortuary services. As
mentioned above, NGO services may potentially be used as part of the National Urban Health
Mission’s investments in improving urban health services, but this is not explicit in the city’s plans.
Implementation of the state government’s Chief Minister’s Insurance Scheme is supported by
private insurance companies and a significant proportion of the covered surgical services are
purchased from private hospitals, although in 2009-10, only two Chennai-based institutions
figured among the top 25 providers under the scheme. (La Forgia and Nagpal, 2012)

Bhubaneswar

According to officials, it is estimated that about 70 percent of health services are provided by the
private sector in Bhubaneswar and it is often the first point of contact for patients with the health


                                                   37
system, including the poor. In a private hospital visited, a low-income patient was asked about his
decision to visit the private provider as opposed to the public sector. The main reason given was
the lack of attention and poor interaction with patients by health staff in public facilities. A state
government ban on private practice by government doctors has been removed due to poor
enforcement. The state government, through the Khorda District Chief Medical Officer, is
responsible for regulation of private sector health care providers under the Odisha Clinical
Establishments (Control and Regulation) Act of 1990. The 2010 national legislation has not been
adopted by the state. Although the state Directorate of Medical Education and Training maintains
a list of private medical facilities, it is thought that the number of private providers operating in
the city is significantly higher than recorded.

The state government’s most significant engagement with the private health care sector is through
the national program RSBY, in which 4.3 million BPL households enrolled. In addition, the state
government has launched a similar scheme, named Biju Krushak Kalyan Yojna, that provides
coverage to poor farmers and their families for inpatient care, up to a maximum of Rs 100,000
(US$ 1,515) annually.

The Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation is taking a step further with the type of land-for-beds
arrangement that other cities in India have used to encourage hospital development by the private
sector. With advisory support from the World Bank Group’s International Finance Corporation
(IFC), Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation is currently in the process of selecting a private sector
partner to implement a large public-private partnership centered on development of a tertiary
hospital on Municipal Corporation land. The arrangement will also include development of the
existing Municipal Corporation dispensaries as a network of primary health care facilities
networked with the new hospital and operated by the private sector partner. Outpatient and family
planning services would be the responsibility of the Municipal Corporation, implemented by the
private sector partner, while preventive and outreach services (in the same facilities) would be
operated by the state government. As part of its contract with the Municipal Corporation, the
private sector partner will be required to guarantee that a proportion of services provided by the
tertiary care hospital and network of primary care services will be provided at highly-subsidized
rates to BPL patients. Outpatient services for BPL patients will be provided at 50 percent of the
rates fixed by the central government’s health insurance program for government employees, while
non-BPL patients will pay market rates. Inpatient care for BPL patients will be covered by RSBY
according to its rates, while other state government schemes will pay for expenses above the RSBY
annual limit of Rs 30,000 (US$ 455).

Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation has also engaged the private sector in solid waste
management. It is reported that almost 70 percent of slums (authorized and non-authorized) are
covered by door-to-door waste collection managed by private firms. According to the
Bhubaneswar Chief Medical Officer, although the private companies charge significant fees, waste
collection and management have improved.

Meerut

Most health services in Meerut are provided by the private sector. Apart from the private medical


                                                 38
college’s tertiary hospital and urban health training center, 2,353 private health providers are
registered with the District Chief Medical Officer. These include doctors working in 230 private
nursing homes. Most of these providers operate in Meerut city. There are no estimates of the
number of unqualified or traditional health care providers working in the city although they are a
significant presence, especially in slum areas. In addition, proximity to Delhi affords access to
private and government hospital services there. Overall, the activity of the private medical sector
in Meerut is consistent with the city’s economic activity in general. Meerut was ranked fifth among
200 Indian cities on an economic “vibrancy index,” reflecting investment level, infrastructure, job
opportunities and consumer services. (Morgan Stanley, 2011)

Private sector doctors informed us that they prefer not to collaborate with the public sector because
of ensuing bureaucratic problems. Nonetheless, the RSBY program is functioning in the district,
and there are 15 private institutions empaneled to provide care. About 14,000 families are enrolled,
compared to a target of 21,000. However, only 234 hospitalizations in the district were covered
during fiscal year 2014-15.20

Uttar Pradesh has adopted the national Clinical Establishments Act of 2010, but implementation
of regulation of the private sector is still limited to the requirement to register with the District
Chief Medical Officer. A District Anti-Quackery Cell was established by the Department of Health
and Family Welfare in 2005, and in the past 18 months has filed 32 cases against unqualified
healthcare providers in the district. Cases are investigated on the basis of complaints from the
public.

Shillong

The Megha Health Insurance Scheme is a state government program incorporating RSBY, with
state government resources added in order for the entire state population to be eligible for coverage.
The scheme has achieved an initial goal of 600,000 individuals enrolled, equivalent to 41 percent
of potentially eligible beneficiaries. ASHAs and auxiliary nurse-midwives are involved in
enrolling beneficiaries at the community level. The hospitalization rate of among those enrolled is
4.8 percent. In two years since its launch, the scheme reimbursed claims totaling Rs 130 million
(US$ 2 million). Private sector hospitals provide 80 percent of the inpatient services covered by
the Megha Health Insurance Scheme. Nazareth Hospital, operated by a faith-based organization,
provides 54 percent of total services. It is also a significant source of preventive and outpatient
care, partnering with government programs such as the tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS programs.

It is reported that many patients seek tertiary services outside the state – in Guwahati, Assam, or
even farther, such as the Christian Medical College in Vellore, Tamil Nadu.

Another public-private engagement by the state government is contracting of ambulance services
under the National Health Mission. Demand for ambulance services is very high and a large
proportion of calls are in Shillong. The service started in 2009 and has 47 ambulances.

4.   URBAN DEMOGRAPHICS AND EPIDEMIOLOGY

In this section we examine broad patterns in health at the national and state levels, and then drill
down to look at the stories that emerge from the states and cities visited. We begin with
understanding the demographic context of urbanizing India and then turn to the epidemiology of
urban India.

4.1. The demographic context
India’s total population in 2014 was 1.267 billion. (World Bank, 2015) Between 1991 and 2011,
the proportion of the population of India living in urban areas rose from 26 to 32 percent (about
380 million). However, these figures are based on an administrative definition for urban areas that
is more restrictive than other measures. An alternative measure, the agglomeration index, indicates
that 39 percent of India’s population lived in urban areas in 1991, rising to 52 percent, or around
630 million, by 2008.21 (World Bank, 2013; Uchida and Nelson, 2008) The latter estimates are
more consistent with historical experience and with India’s economic growth, which averaged 7.2
percent annually during 2000-2010.

Urban population growth during the 2001-2011 decade was 31.8 percent (2.8 percent annual
average), little changed from 31.5 percent in the previous decade. This compares to 12.2 percent
growth in the rural population between 2001 and 2011 (1.2 percent annual average), slower than
the 18.1 percent rural population growth during the previous decade. (Government of India, 2011)
Urban population growth was largely driven by natural population growth (44 percent) and
reclassification of rural settlements into urban areas (32 percent), with only 24 percent due to rural-
urban migration. (India Institute for Urban Settlements, 2011)

A significant proportion of new urban areas are not recognized as such administratively on the
ground. Applying the government’s more restrictive definition of urban areas,22 the 2011 census
found that 3,894 settlements (called “census towns”), accounting for 53 million people, are urban
but are governed as rural areas. Application of a less restrictive definition, such as the agglomeration
index, suggests that a considerably greater population, perhaps an additional 300 million, live in
places with urban characteristics but administered as part of rural areas. This is compared to 4,041
“statutory” urban areas, accounting for about 340 million, which are administered as urban areas.
The majority of the current urban population (70 percent of the urban population) live in cities with
a population of more than 100,000.

By 2050, India is projected to have 50 percent of its population living in urban areas (using the
government’s definitions), and to add about 400 million urban dwellers between 2014 and 2050,
making it the largest contributor to future urban populations globally. (United Nations, 2014) This
pace of urban growth is unprecedented and the country will have to consciously equip itself to

21
   The agglomeration index is based on population density (150 people per square kilometer), the minimum size of a
large urban center (50,000 inhabitants), and travel time to that urban center (60 minutes). (World Bank, 2013)
22
   A settlement is classified as urban if it has: (i) a population of at least 5,000; (ii) a population density of at least
400 persons per square kilometer, and (iii) at least 75 percent of its male workforce engaged in the non-farm sector.
(World Bank, 2013)


                                                            41
handle the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead (IIHS, 2012; McKinsey & Company, 2010;
World Bank, 2013). The pace of urbanization will increase, and it will be particularly high in the
southern and western regions, and in medium to small-sized towns while growth in large
metropolitans declines. (IIHS, 2012; Rob and Talukder, 2013)

Indian cities are very crowded at their centers and sprawling at the periphery. At present India’s top
ten cities that are home to 8 percent of its population occupy only 0.1 percent of land, and the
associated land density in metropolitan cities is extremely high. (World Bank, 2013). At the same
time, due to increasing proportions of built-up areas spreading outside administrative boundaries
and the associated urban sprawl, the density of built-up areas has actually decreased – this pattern
is similar across the 53 million-plus cities (IIHS, 2012) and is a phenomenon that is common to
other developing countries. This sprawl is related to manufacturing employment moving out of city
cores into peripheries, often driven by the congestion forces mentioned earlier, related to poor
infrastructure, economic stagnation, and policy constraints within the cities. (World Bank, 2013)
Thus, population growth in the four largest metropolitans has in fact slowed significantly (pre-
expansion Chennai to around 8 percent) over the decade 2001-2011. Typical of urban sprawl,
Chennai Municipal Corporation city expanded significantly, by about 2.5 times in geographic area
and 1.5 times in population, by absorbing its suburbs in October 2011 – the city grew because of
reclassification, not due to natural growth nor the movement of persons. The city now includes an
additional nine municipalities, eight town panchayats and 25 village panchayats. The newly
inducted regions are poorer and lack infrastructure.

Often the most congested parts of Indian cities are its slums –nearly one in every six urban residents
(14 million households) lives in a slum according to the census. More than a third of these
households are in the million-plus cities. By states, Orissa has one of the highest (23 percent) slum
to-total urban household proportions in the country, while Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh have the
third and fifth largest number of slum households (1.5 million and 1.1 million respectively) in India.
Among the cities, Meerut has a slum-tototal city population proportion of 40 percent, making it the
fifth highest in the country. (Census of India, 2011) In expanded Chennai, the slum population is
around 2.7 million, and the slum-total city population proportion is reported around 36-39 percent.
The number of slums has increased from 1,700 to more than 3,000, and only 751 are notified slums.
(Chennai Corporation data)

Cities vary in terms of the location of their poorest households, and it is essential to identify where
the most vulnerable reside so that they are not excluded from social programs. Slum definitions
vary and they are broadly classified as ‘notified’ and ‘non-notified’ depending on whether they
have been declared as such by authorities. Nationally about 59 percent of slums (37 percent of slum
households) are estimated to be non-notified, and these tend to be smaller and have weaker
infrastructure. (National Sample Survey Office, 2013) The census further divides the non-notified
category into ‘recognized’ and ‘identified’ if they are acknowledged by authorities or identified by
the Census depending on living conditions. Each of the three types represents about a third of the
all-India slum population (with the ‘recognized’ population slightly smaller). Slum populations
disproportionately comprise schedule castes, schedule tribes and illiterate persons compared with
the rest of the urban population (28 percent and 21 percent and 22 percent respectively). The


                                                  42
majority of slum inhabitants (78 percent) live in permanent structures (Census of India, 2011), but
residential crowding is high, about a third of slum households in both Meerut and Chennai have
more than 4 persons sleeping in a room (National Family Health Survey, 2009). On average,
perhaps surprisingly, on many dimensions slum populations are not very different from urban
populations, for example on household size, asset ownership. (Registrar General, 2011) However,
this depends on each city’s characteristics and, more broadly, also on the way slums are defined.
The census defines identified slums as those with a minimum of 60-70 households, as compared
with the National Sample Survey which uses a threshold of 20 households. Chennai is known to
have had about 48 percent of slums with below 50 households in 2001, and these smaller, less
organized clusters of households – which are not counted as slums – are often more vulnerable
since they can constitute populations that did not have the wherewithal to be part of resettlements
(Bhan and Jana, 2013) and have very limited collective bargaining powers.
Figure 4.1. Population age distribution, urban and rural India, 2011




Source: 2011 Census of India.

Migrants and ‘floating populations’ are also important constituents of Indian cities. Chennai
experiences a floating population of about 150,000 a day, and attracts substantial numbers who
come to access its tertiary health care institutions for ‘medical tourism’. On the other hand, the slum
population in Odisha surged in the 2000s due to the super cyclone along the coastal areas of Odisha,
causing migration from rural areas into urban epicenters. Many of these migrants were from rural
parts or Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Bihar, relocating for better employment opportunities – over
1991-2001 the population of Khordha district increased by about 25 percent (but so did Meerut
district and East Khasi Hill district grew by 23 percent).


                                                      43
In terms of the age distribution, the rural population in comparison with urban population has a
greater proportion in the most economically productive ages between 20 and 59 years. 23 (Figure
4.1) In urban areas, this age group accounts for about 56 percent of the population, compared to
about 48 percent in rural areas. The rural population has a significantly greater proportion at
younger ages (0-19 years), as well as to some extent at older ages (60-74 years). While India as a
whole is projected to experience in the near future a so-called demographic dividend, with a bulge
in the working-age population, this pattern is already in place for urban populations.

Similarly, all four cities represent youthful populations. The current dependency ratio (measuring
the proportion of children and elderly to the working-age 15-49 year population-group) is low
across the four cities. In 2011, almost one-thirds of the population in Bhubaneshwar and Meerut
was below 14 years, and persons above 65 years constitute just between 3 percent (in Shillong) and
6 percent (in Chennai) of the population. This older population group is expected to increase over
time, accounting for about 13 percent all-India by 2050. Importantly, this aging population will
change the disease profile towards non-communicable diseases.

While urban women have reached replacement levels of fertility, rural women still have an average
of 2.5 children. Following from this, the natural growth rate (birth rate minus death rate) of urban
areas is lower than rural areas – Figure 4.2 illustrates the range of fertility rates in the states
examined with all urban areas except Uttar Pradesh at below replacement rate.24 Fertility rates in
urban areas are lower in all age-categories. Fertility rates are associated with education levels, and
also with marital status – marital fertility rates in both areas are not as different. The mean household
size in urban India is 4.6, compared with 4.9 in rural India. Bhubaneshwar has an average household
size of 4.1, Chennai has 4, while Shillong has 4.6, and Meerut has 5.6 (Census of India, 2011).

   These and subsequent figures on health, nutrition, and population indicators are based on the government’s
definition of urban areas.

4.2. Epidemiology
If current mortality trends continue, males and females born in urban India today are expected to
live five years longer than their rural counterparts. Similarly, life expectancy in Tamil Nadu is six
years greater than in Uttar Pradesh. (Census of India, 2011)

                                   4.2.1. Is there an urban health advantage? National and state patterns of morbidity

Health outcomes and service utilization are generally better in urban areas, and they have improved
faster over time except for sex ratios. Yet patterns vary across states and cities and are characterized
by local peculiarities. While communicable diseases have reduced over time, they still continue to
contribute to a significant proportion of the disease burden. Also, with urbanization there is a
growing burden of non-communicable diseases that exists along with communicable diseases.

Average health, nutrition and population outcome indicators show that, overall, the urban health
advantage in India is considerable, and has remained large over time. (Error! Reference source
ot found.) In 2012, average under-five mortality in urban areas was 32.0 per 1,000, 45 percent
lower than the rate of 58.0 per 1,000 in rural areas. This is of similar magnitude, although somewhat
larger, than the 40 percent difference in 1992-93. Similarly, the average rate of malnutrition
(stunting) in 2013-14 was 32.0 percent (among under-five children) in urban areas, 23 percent lower
than the rate of 41.6 percent in rural areas. This difference is also close, although larger, than the
gap of 18 percent in 1992-93 (among under-three children). The total fertility rate among the urban
population in 2012 was 1.8, 31 percent lower than the rate of 2.6 in rural areas, again similar but
slightly larger than the 27 percent difference in 1992-93. These health, nutrition and population
outcomes have all steadily improved over the past several decades, in both urban and rural areas,
although improvements among urban populations have been slightly faster.

An important exception to the urban advantage in average outcomes is a consistently worse sex
ratio in urban areas. After falling sharply in the 1990s, since 2001 the ratio of girls to boys aged 0-
6 years in urban areas has been fairly stable at around 900 per 1,000, although the ratio in rural
areas has deteriorated. The lower sex ratio in urban areas is consistent with persistent cultural
preference for sons combined with lower fertility, growing household economic resources
providing greater access to ultrasound and abortion services, and greater availability of such
services in urban areas. (Jha et al., 2011)

Infectious diseases and their symptoms (fevers and gastrointestinal problems) continue to dominate
both cases of hospitalization and reports of acute illness in both urban and rural areas. Broadly,
among chronic diseases, cardiovascular along with respiratory diseases are the main symptoms and
cases of hospitalization.

Proportionately more persons report hospitalizations in urban areas for all diseases except for those
that are obstetrics-related. (2014 National Sample Survey). This urban bias in inpatient medical
care could be driven by higher awareness, greater reporting, better detection and health care access
in urban areas, or by an urban penalty (presence of more disease). Shown in Figure 4.4, about a
quarter of all cases are admitted for infectious diseases in both locations, and the remaining in-
patient care is for non-infectious disease, the majority of which are cardiovascular, gastro-intestinal
and injury-related. Urban residents report higher levels for all ailments except for obstetrics and
neonatal care.

According to the 2013 Global Burden of Disease estimates for India, high blood pressure, followed
by fasting plasma glucose, household air pollution, unsafe water and childhood malnutrition are the
leading risk factors in terms of attributable DALYs (disability- adjusted life-years)(GBD 2013 Risk
Factors Collaborators, 2015). Similarly, a large recent practice-based study (POSEIDON study) in
880 cities collected one-day point-prevalence of diseases on February 1, 2011 from primary health
care practitioners. The most common diagnoses were: hypertension (14.5 percent), obstructive
airways diseases (14.5 percent), upper respiratory tract infections (13 percent), anemia (10 percent)
and diabetes (8.85 percent). The most common symptoms reported were fever (35.5 percent), body


                                                  46
ache (19.5 percent), loss of appetite (10.2 percent) and accident/injury (3.1 percent). Related to
these, the main cause of visit was respiratory illness (50.6 percent), digestive (25 percent) and
circulatory (12.5 percent) problems (Salvi et al., 2015). The POSEIDON study is an improvement
on self-reports by patients, but it also has shortcomings as it does not examine some key patients
and providers: it is likely to underrepresent poorer households, who do not have access to or do not
visit formal doctors; women may also be underrepresented since gynecologists were not included;
similarly older patients may be disproportionately left out of practice-based data due to poor access.

District-level household data from 2012-13 (Figure 4.5) indicates a slight urban advantage exists in
prevalence of acute diseases (those suffered for a week) and for injuries (those experienced in the
last year) in both Tamil Nadu and Meghalaya (2012-13 District Level Household and Facility
Survey). These patterns are evident from all four states where injuries are more prevalent in rural
areas. Regarding gender, national data indicate that males are admitted disproportionately for cases
of injury (14 percent of male hospitalizations in urban areas are injury-related, as compared to 6
percent among urban females). It is also known that about three-fourth of all road traffic injuries
occur among individuals between 15-49 years, particularly males. (Patel et al., 2011)

Among acute diseases suffered by urban residents (Figure 4.6), diarrhea was the leading illness in
Meghalaya (23 percent of disease burden) and malaria in Tamil Nadu (10 percent of the burden).
However, in both states diarrhea and jaundice had a significantly higher urban than rural prevalence

of urban hygiene, sanitation and waterborne diseases.

For chronic illness (illness that lasted for more than a month) the pattern is less clear; about 4 and
2.7 percent of urban households in Tamil Nadu and Meghalaya respectively reported a member
suffering from these, which is only slightly different from in rural areas (3.8 percent and 3 percent
in rural Tamil Nadu and Meghalaya respectively). Prevalence of chronic disease in Chennai city

was, however, higher at 5.2 percent. By gender, no striking differences exist except that in
Meghalaya prevalence among females is slightly higher than males for all three, acute and chronic
disease and injury, while in Tamil Nadu differences by gender are even less prominent, except for
injuries where males report higher prevalence (5.4 as compared with 4.9 percent).

Within chronic diseases (Figure 4.7), the leading symptom reported was respiratory illness in Tamil
Nadu (13.2 percent in urban) and gastrointestinal problems, similar to reports of acute illnesses,
remained the main concern in Meghalaya (11.6 percent in urban). Respiratory illnesses were
reported by just 1.1 percent of urban households in Meghalaya.

In terms of diagnosis (Figure 4.8), in Tamil Nadu about 78 percent (67 percent in Meghalaya) of
those reporting chronic diseases were able to provide details about their diagnosis or treatment.
Both diagnosis and treatment was reported by much greater proportions of urban households in
both states and particularly in Meghalaya (86 and 61.6 percent in urban as compared with rural
Meghalaya, and 81 percent and 74.5 percent in urban and rural Tamil Nadu), pointing to a
combination of greater awareness among individuals and better access to health care. Among these
households that reported their diagnoses, in Tamil Nadu, diabetes accounted for 41 percent of the
urban diagnosed (and 28 percent rural) followed by hypertension by 18 percent urban (15 percent
rural) households. In Meghalaya, diabetes accounted for 15 percent of urban diagnosed disease and
hypertension 9 percent (4 percent and 6 percent in rural). Diabetes, hypertension and heart disease
were the top diagnosed diseases in both states.

National estimates of chronic disease burden disaggregated by residence or wealth are difficult to
come by, estimates based on the Global Burden of Disease 2004 are shown in Figure 4.9Figure
4.8. They indicate that on average there is a slight urban advantage in chronic disease prevalence,


                                                                                 49
while the poorest (across urban and rural) experience the largest burden of chronic disease. It is
estimated that 6 percent of the urban population suffer from 2 or more chronic diseases, while this
estimate is 8 percent in rural areas. (Patel et al., 2011) Both the National Sample Survey data and
POSEIDON study indicate that cardiovascular disease/ hypertension is the leading ailment among
urban Indians. Worryingly, the POSEIDON study also found that a fifth of patients with
hypertension were below 40 years, and asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was more
commonly diagnosed in smaller cities of less than 1 million.

In terms of risk factors, urbanites smoke less, about one-fifth of urban adults use tobacco daily as
compared to almost a third of adults in rural India. Adults in urban areas are also much more likely
to notice anti-tobacco information, and urban smokers are more likely in the past 12 months to have
been advised by a health care provider to quit (51 percent as compared to 45 percent). (2009-10
District Level Household and Facility Survey). However, these averages do not account for
differences in education and socioeconomic status – there is evidence that tobacco use decreases
with education and increases with age (2012-13 District Level Household and Facility Survey).
Also, urban adults tend to perform less physical activity. (Patel et al., 2011) Almost a quarter of
women between 15-49 years in urban India are overweight as compared with just 7 percent in rural
areas (2005-06 National Family Health Survey). The urban advantage in risk factors is thus mixed,
and depends on each disease and location.

       4.2.1. What is the urban health penalty: intra-district and other evidence

Intra-district evidence from Meerut and Khordha on the disease burden

Information on Meerut and Khordha districts allows a comparison of differences by urban-rural
locations within the same districts. (Table 4.1) The urban population – as defined by the census –
in Meerut and Khordha districts constitutes 51 percent and 48 percent respectively of their total
populations. (2011 Census) Both urban and rural areas within these districts have similar
characteristics on information collected by the census: in terms of levels of literacy, workforce
participation rates, caste makeup. Some differences exist, for example, in Meerut the rural
population has a larger schedule caste population (21 percent as compared with 16 percent in urban
parts) and a somewhat higher proportion of cultivators (10 percent as compared to 1 percent in
urban parts).

In terms of health-related characteristics, however, differences can be marked. Compared with the
national urban average, both urban Meerut and Khordha have worse indicators. Yet – as shown in
Table 4.1 – in comparison with rural parts of the same districts, residence in urban areas is
associated with more favorable infant and child mortality rates, crude birth and death rates.
Similarly, in both districts contraceptive use is higher and number of children born is lower,
immunization rates are, however, higher in rural Meerut and Khordha.

There is evidence of a gender penalty in urban areas, despite generally higher literacy (male and
female) and greater female participation in the workforce. On average, sex ratios in urban India are
lower than rural parts. For example, while Meerut has considerably better mortality rates than
Khordha, it has worse gender indicators. Meerut has higher fertility rates, lower contractive use in
urban parts, and most striking, urban Meerut has a sex ratio at birth of just 821 females to 1,000
males, which is lower than rural Meerut and urban and rural Khordha. Urban sex ratios are lower
than rural parts in a number of areas in the country. Yet variation exists – as shown by urban
Khordha where the sex ratio at birth is higher than rural parts.

illness in urban and rural Khorda and Meerut Districts. Urban populations report higher prevalence
of hypertension, diabetes, asthma and tuberculosis, though as mentioned earlier, not for asthma.

Intra-district evidence from Chennai and East Khasi Hills districts

Prevalence rates of non-communicable diseases are associated with socio-economic factors and
health care systems but also genetic proclivities, local lifestyles and cultural practices. Information
on the wide range of lifestyles and habits across Indian cities is conveyed by survey data for East
Khasi Hills and Chennai districts in the table below. While in Chennai just 8.5 percent men report
smoking, 68 percent do so in urban East Khasi and 90 percent of them use smokeless tobacco.
Biomarkers measuring hypertension and blood sugar levels were collected by the District-level
Health Surveys and indicate that outcomes in the two populations are not very different: between
15-20 percent of adults indicate high blood pressure and blood sugar. Compared with global data,
these are low rates, and are reflective of the young population age-structure of India.

Other studies from Chennai confirm a 15 percent prevalence of diabetes (14.3 percent age-
standardized), and also indicate that prevalence increased by 72 percent from 1989 to 2005 (Mohan
et al., 2006). In more recent research using the same dataset, there was increased risk of type 2
diabetes associated with higher socioeconomic status, with rates increasing from 12 percent to 22
percent from low to high social class (Skar et al., 2013).

In terms of child health, episodes of diarrhea among children below three years over the past three
weeks were reported at higher rates in urban areas (by 33 percent of urban households as compared
with 24 percent of rural households) in 2005-06. (2005-06 National Family Health Survey).

Practices such as exclusive breastfeeding within the first hour and then up to six months, and the
timing and nature of complementary foods are often shaped by cultural practices that are dynamic
in nature and can change according to residence (Raman, et al., 2014). Thus, within a state, wide
variation can exist, and urban residence does not always confer benefits. Exclusive breastfeeding
up to five months is slightly lower in urban than in rural parts of Meghalaya (56.5 percent in urban
and 60.4 percent in rural Meghalaya), and rates of child immunization are (marginally) lower in
urban Tamil Nadu.

Air pollution: a toxic urban and rural challenge

Air pollution is a leading risk factor for the health of both urban and rural Indians. Ambient
(outdoor) air pollution in the form of fine particulate matter (particularly particles that are less than
10 or even 2.5 microns in diameter, PM10 and PM 2.5 respectively), penetrates deep into the lungs
and is associated with cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, lung cancer and mortality. One study
estimates that 650,000 premature deaths in India each year are associated with air pollution.
(Lelieveld, Evans, Fnais, Giannadaki, & Pozzer, 2015) Concentrations of PM 2.5 tend to be higher
in larger and more densely populated cities. There is some evidence that this association is
especially strong in South Asian cities (due to a combination of features but particularly their lack
of public transportation). (Ellis and Roberts, 2016)

Data from 2012 from about 370 monitoring stations across India (rural and urban) indicates that
ambient PM10 levels were rated as critically high in 60 percent and high in 23 percent of locations
(Government of India, 2014d). National standards are, however, not very stringent. Pollution levels
for PM10 are classified as high if above 60 microns and critical if above 90 microns as compared
with the World Health Organization guideline of 20 microns, indicating potentially even greater
health risks exist than acknowledged. (Balakrishnan, Cohen, & Smith, 2014; Government of India,



                                                                                         54
2014d) For the more dangerous PM2.5, across India’s cities, Delhi had mean annual levels that were
almost 15 times higher than guidelines in 2013 along with Patna and Gwalior. Within the case cities,
Meerut had five times the recommended level of PM2.5 and six times the recommended PM10 while
the other cities were closer to guidelines (Figure 4.11). (World Health Organization, 2014).

Prevalence of respiratory diseases is high in India but urban-rural differences are neither clear nor
consistent. While the major source of urban air pollution is ambient pollution, for rural residents it
is considered to be household (indoor) air pollution that comes from solid cooking fuels and heating.
And indoor air pollution is more toxic. (Lelieveld, Evans, Fnais, Giannadaki, & Pozzer, 2015) In
Chennai almost 24 percent of households reported that a household member suffered from chronic
respiratory illness over the last year. But chronic respiratory disease and asthma was reported to be
higher in rural as compared with urban Meerut (and similar in Uttar Pradesh). Asthma was almost
44 percent higher in rural Khordha than urban Khordha. (Annual Health Survey, 2012-13) Acute
respiratory infections suffered by children tend to be associated with indoor cooking. In Khordha
district 46.9 percent of children suffered from ARI over the last 15 days in rural areas as compared
with areas 36 percent in urban areas. In Meerut 38 percent children reported ARIs in both urban
and rural. (Annual Health Survey, 2012-13)

The increasing burden of dengue

The viral infection dengue seems to be more prevalent in urban centers25 and incidence is linked to
urbanization, rainfall and temperature. It is transmitted by aedes aegypti mosquitoes which have
adapted to urban conditions and also carry chikungunya and zika viruses. While a large number of
dengue cases are asymptomatic, dengue is associated with symptoms ranging from mild fevers to
fatal dengue hemorrhagic fever or shock syndrome. Even as case-fatality rates have fallen over time
with better case-management, wide variations exist within India and across countries. (Guha-Sapir
& Schimmer, 2005) At present there is no vaccine, treatment is supportive and vector control efforts
have not been successful at stopping the disease. (Bhatt et al., 2013) Over time, dengue transmission
in rural areas has also increased, both within India and globally. The prevalence of the disease is
now global and includes more than 100 countries compared with nine reporting countries in the
1950s. It is the leading cause of child mortality in several Asian and South American countries
while there is also evidence of a shift in incidence of hemorrhagic fever towards older age-groups.
While wealthier households may be able to better protect themselves from the disease there is no
clear association between socioeconomic status and dengue transmission, in fact better nourished
individuals appear to be more susceptible. (Guha-Sapir & Schimmer, 2005)

India is estimated to contribute one-third (33 million infections in 2010) of the global burden of
apparent dengue infections. (Bhatt et al., 2013). A large additional number of cases are
asymptomatic and unreported. (Bhatt et al., 2013; Kakkar 2012) In 2015, the number of reported
dengue cases in Delhi was the highest in 20 years,26 and the city has the highest reported incidence
in the country. A recent study of dengue transmission within Delhi over 2008-2010 found that
dengue cases increased with population size and density of localities within the city and decreased

with distance from forests. The risk of transmission could not be predicted solely by socioeconomic
factors because of daily population mobility within the city (for example to work and school), and
also since both wealthy and poor areas can be densely populated. The study found that no permanent
geographical clusters of cases existed over the three years examined, indicating the challenge of
dengue control strategies and that they cannot be based only on surveillance information from
previous years; though areas that experienced early dengue cases within a season were the most
prone to higher incidence (Telle et al., 2016).

         4.2.2. City-level evidence on the disease burden

Further insight at the city-level on morbidity patterns and inpatient medical care is provided by data
on Shillong extracted from the Megha Health insurance scheme that is based on the national
Rashtrya Swasthya Bima Yojna (RSBY) program.27 (Figure 4.12) Similar to the national patterns

27
   We examined information drawn from Megha Health insurance scheme from the seven major hospitals located in
Shillong, representing information over May-Oct 2014. These constitute 12,794 cases, which is 94 percent of the
cases within the program’s purview in East Khasi district. Based on further information from the scheme, it is
estimated that these data represent about 1/4th of the total patient population in these hospitals – the remaining are not
covered by the program. This data thus has important drawbacks: (1) it excludes those who did not use the the
insurance scheme, and (2) records in some cases have problems of double-counting where a single patient is recorded
multiple time for each disease. Nevertheless, the information is instructive in terms of understanding broad patterns
regarding the disease burden and health seeking behaviors within Shillong’s major hospitals.

(and data from the National Sample Survey presented above), infectious and vector-borne diseases
such as gastric problems, diarrhea and vomiting, fever and malaria lead the disease symptoms
indicating that an epidemiological transition is yet to take place. The high number of cancer cases
(7 percent) in Shillong’s hospitals is, however, exceptional – the national rate is around 3 percent.
A number of health officials during our team’s visit also raised concern over unusually high
prevalence of cancer among their patients.

In terms of demographic characteristics, the mean age of patients seeking care in these hospitals in
Shillong (covered by the insurance scheme) is 32 years. It is not surprising that older patients seek
care for non-communicable diseases such as cataract, diabetes, pulmonary problems and cancer,
while younger patients seek care for infectious diseases such as meningitis, fever/malaria,
pneumonia and typhoid. Given the youthful demographic age-structure of Indian populations, the
latter contribute to significant losses in economic productivity.

Caution over interpreting reports of morbidity

Finally, better awareness of health status and access to health services is known to drive recall and
reporting of episodes of sickness. Reports of morbidity capture individuals’ social experiences, and
are shaped by what they perceive as ‘normal’ (Sen, 2002). It is borne out by the 2014 National
Sample Survey data (and also in previous rounds) that despite the urban health advantage reported
earlier, the proportions of ailing persons per thousand in rural India is reported as 89 per 1,000
while in urban India it is 118 per 1,000. (Figure 4.13) Previously, the 2004 National Sample Survey
reported these estimates as 88 in rural areas and 99 in urban areas, also suggesting that urban areas
have changed more rapidly over the last ten years.

The highest rate of self-reported illness is reported in the state of Tamil Nadu which has the best
health indicators among the states examined. Urban-rural patterns of reported morbidity are,
however, not consistent across these states – higher rates are reported in urban Tamil Nadu and


                                                                                               57
Uttar Pradesh, but not in urban Meghalaya or Odisha. It is striking that persons surveyed in
Meghalaya report considerably lower morbidity rates than the rest of the country including a state
like Uttar Pradesh – indicating perhaps very low expectations of good health and that caution is
required in interpreting self-reports of morbidity.

       4.2.3. Heterogeneity within cities - slum populations

Health and other indicators are often worse in slums. In Meerut, the infant mortality rate in 2005-
06 was 63 per 1000 live births in non-slum areas and 78 in slum areas of the city. (2005-06 National
Family Health Survey) A survey conducted in 45 slums of Meerut in 2007-08 found that more than
two-thirds of children below three years of age were stunted, with only about 12 percent having
been exclusively breastfed till six months of age. Only a quarter of these children received their
measles or DPT3 vaccine, and complete immunization between 12-23 months was around 12
percent. The incidence of diarrheal diseases and other water-borne illnesses was also high in the
city’s slums. About a quarter of the children below five years were reported to suffer from diarrhea
and 22 percent experienced signs of acute respiratory infection (ARI) in the 15 days prior to the
survey (Urban Health Resource Centre, 2009). In Shillong, there are reports of high incidence of
tuberculosis in these populations. The consumption of tobacco was highest among the poorest
quartile of the city – 6 percent among women and 58 percent among men. In addition, almost 1
percent of poor males in Meerut suffered from medically treated tuberculosis and prevalence was
higher in slum than non-slum areas (2005-06 National Family Health Survey) Nevertheless, in
Meerut city, the prevalence of diabetes was two to three times lower in slum areas and lowest among
the poor of the city.

These slum populations are often made of migrants and various disempowered groups. However,
not all households living in slums are poor. In 2005-06, while 43 percent of Meerut city’s
households lived in slums, only 16percent belonged to the city’s lowest wealth quintile. Also, in
Chennai, the child sex ratio in slums is better than other parts of the city, they have grown slower
than the average populations over 2001-2011 and household sizes are smaller.

Finally, more than a third of street children in India are reported to be dealing with substance abuse
and urban areas are home to 1.3 million child laborers. About 47 percent of the urban poor are
malnourished (Save the Children and PwC, 2015).

4.3. Summary
In summary, data on India as a whole show that the urban population is growing in both absolute
and relative terms, currently totaling 32 percent of the population, or around 380 million. These
figures reflect the official definition of urban areas, while alternative measures would lead to larger
estimates. Urban population growth is largely driven by natural growth as well as reclassification
of settlements as urban, although rural-urban migration accounts about a quarter of the growth.
About14 percent of the urban population, or 53 million, are below the official poverty line for urban
areas. Compared to the rural population, the urban population includes a greater proportion of
people in the most economically-productive age groups, and lower proportions of children and
elderly.


                                                  58
With regard to health, nutrition and population outcomes, overall averages show improving trends
in both urban and rural areas, with a considerable urban advantage that has not diminished over
time. An important exception is the ratio of females to males, which has remained consistently
lower in the urban population than in the rural population, despite deterioration over time in the
rural ratio. In terms of an urban penalty, urban populations in some ways experience a greater
‘double burden’ of disease, combining infectious diseases along with increasing prevalence of
chronic illnesses (like diabetes, hypertension and heart disease). They are also exposed to greater
ambient air pollution and diseases like dengue.

However, while diagnoses of these chronic diseases and inpatient use is greater in urban areas, self-
reports are often lower (if not similar) in urban than rural populations. This indicates that part of
the urban penalty arises from better identification of illnesses related with improved access to health
care. Also, in the case of air pollution, the health risks of indoor air pollution which is related to
cooking fuel in rural areas, is greater than ambient air pollution.

Given the size and diversity of the country, overall statistics on India mask considerable
heterogeneity. The dynamics of how urban health advantages and penalties play out differently in
different states or districts as illustrated by the case studies.

5.1. Service utilization
A significant urban advantage is evident with regard to service utilization indicators, although
urban-rural differences have narrowed considerably in recent years as coverage has improved
faster in rural areas. (Figure 5.1) In 2013-14, 89.2 percent of 1 year old children in urban areas had
received all basic vaccinations, compared to 79.6 percent in rural areas. The difference between
these figures (15 percent of the rural level) is significantly less than the urban-rural gap in 1992-
93 (64 percent of the rural level).

areas during the period. In 2013-14, 25.2 percent of pregnant women in urban areas received full

antenatal care, compared to 17.3 percent in rural areas. This urban-rural difference of 46 percent
(of the rural level), while still large, was lower than the gap of 102 percent (of the rural level) in
2002-04. Although antenatal care coverage increased a bit in rural areas during the period, the
2013-14 estimate for urban areas is essentially the same as the 2002-04 estimate. Trends in delivery
care are more similar to immunization coverage, as births in health facilities increased in both
urban and rural areas, but increased faster in rural areas. The urban-rural difference in delivery
care coverage dropped from 251 percent (of the rural level) in 1992-93 to just 12 percent in 2014,
when 89.2 percent of births among the urban population took place in health facilities, compared
to 79.6 percent of births among the rural population. Growth in coverage of modern contraceptives
was slower, but again faster in rural areas. In 2013-14, modern contraceptive use among married
women in the urban population was 53.0 percent, compared to 44.4 percent in the rural population.
The urban-rural difference of 19 percent (of the rural level) is lower than 36 percent gap in 1992.93.
Thus, overall, utilization of basic maternal, child, and reproductive health care services has been
increasing in both urban and rural areas, while improvement has been faster in rural areas.

Utilization of general outpatient health care services has remained fairly stable in urban areas,
while increasing somewhat in recent years in rural areas. (Figure 5.2) In 2014, in urban areas 88.1
percent of people who were ill in the previous 15 days received treatment, little different from 87.1
percent in rural areas. In contrast, utilization of inpatient hospital services has increased
significantly in both urban and rural areas, although the urban-rural gap remains large. In 2014, in
urban areas the hospitalization rate in the previous 1 year was 44 per 1,000 population, more than
double the rate of 20 per 1,000 in 1995-96. The hospitalization rate in rural areas similarly more
than doubled during the period, but the difference between the urban and rural rates remained
similar at 26% in 2014, compared to 33% in 1995-96.

In contrast, data on utilization of nutrition services show a decided urban penalty. In 2005-06, 18.5
percent of children aged 0 to 71 months in urban areas were beneficiaries of supplementary food
from the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), compared to 28.1 percent in rural areas.

(2005-06 National Family Health Survey) Coverage increased since then in both urban and rural
areas while remaining substantially higher in rural areas. In 2013-14, 36.7 percent of children aged
6 to 35 months in urban areas received supplementary nutrition, compared to 53.8 percent in rural
areas. In the 36 to 71 months age group, these proportions were 31.1 percent in urban areas and
48.7 percent in rural areas. (2013-14 Rapid Survey on Children)

5.2. Use of government and private-sector health care services
Error! Reference source not found. makes clear that the private sector is the most important
rovider of general outpatient and inpatient services in urban areas. The private sector has
consistently accounted for about 70 percent of outpatient care and 80 percent of inpatient care for
urban populations. Utilization of both private and government outpatient services in urban areas
has remained relatively stable over time, while utilization of both sources of inpatient services has

increased. The private sector is also important in rural areas, accounting for around 60 percent of
outpatient care and 70 percent of inpatient care in 2014.

Data on treatment of children with respiratory infections follow the pattern of general outpatient
services, as the provide sector provides most care in urban (as well as rural) areas, with little change
over time. (Figure 5.3) In 2009, 73.3 percent of children with symptoms of respiratory infection
received treatment from private providers, compared to 19.0 percent who were taken to
government health care services. However, the private sector is less important for other basic
maternal, child and reproductive health care. In 2014, in the urban population, 47.5 percent of
births were in private sector health facilities, compared to 41.7 percent in government facilities.
Since 2005-06, growth in institutional deliveries in urban areas was due to increased use of both
private and public facilities, although there was a greater increase in the use of government
facilities. The role of the private sector is less important, although still larger than in rural areas,
with regard to preventive services. In 2005-06, the proportion of currently-married women in urban
areas who obtained modern contraceptives from the private sector was 19.7 percent, compared to
31.7 percent from the public sector, although there was more growth over time in use of the private
sector. Similarly, in 2009 in urban areas, among children under-3 with any vaccination, 21.1
percent were vaccinated by a private sector health care provider, compared to 73.8 percent from a
government provider. Although this proportion is higher than in rural areas (where it is 5.8 percent
private and 84.1 percent public), it is evident that in urban areas government services are more
important for immunization than are private services.

5.3. Evidence from the cities and their states
As shown by national patterns, there has been convergence over time in maternal and child health


                                                                  63
     service utilization measures in urban and rural areas such that, as shown in Figure 5.4, the
     difference by residence is small in three out of the four states we examine. The difference between
     urban and rural coverage in proportions of women who used antenatal care services during their
     last pregnancy; who registered this birth; fully immunized their child and had an institutional
     delivery, was not very different by residence. These rates are very high for all four states (around
     90 percent), except for child immunization which is below 70 percent in all four states. Meghalaya
     is the exception where the urban advantage in service utilization is substantial. In urban Meghalaya
     83 percent of women reported institutional delivery, and this is 45 percentage points higher than
     reported by rural residents. In fact, on average, institutional deliveries were reported to have
     reduced in Meghalaya from about a third to a quarter between 1998-99 and 2007-08, before they
     picked up to 47 percent in 2012-13.

     In terms of location, public providers (which include hospitals, health sub-centers and primary
     health centers) are slightly favored for institutional delivery by urban residents of East Khasi Hills,
     Chennai and Khordha districts. However, in urban Meerut, only 21 percent of women deliver in

government care, and private care accounts for a little over a third of deliveries – institutional
deliveries account for 55.5 percent of births. (Figure 5.5)

Average expenditure on childbirth at a hospital in urban areas is about 9 times more at private
hospitals all-India. In Tamil Nadu, patients in private hospitals pay as much as 45 times more than
in the public sector. On the converse, the out of pocket expenditure in public hospitals in Tamil
Nadu is nominal at just Rs. 661 and it is considerably less than reported by women in the other
states. (Figure 5.6)

Similarly, in urban areas the amount spent on inpatient care per episode of hospitalization (this
includes medical and non-medical costs, but excludes cases of childbirth over the last year) is
considerably higher than in rural locations. On average, patients paid 1.5 times more in urban areas
than rural areas across India, with patients in urban Meghalaya paying about 5.3 times more than
in rural parts of the state. While the average total expenditure per hospitalization case was around
Rs 26,455 in urban parts of the country, a patient paid about 15 percent of this in rural Meghalaya
and 126 percent of it in urban Uttar Pradesh.

Further insight on hospitalization cases is provided by data extracted from the Megha Health
insurance scheme for poor families in Meghalaya. (Figure 5.7) Private hospitals provide 80 percent
of the care for these patients covered by the scheme. For diseases like cancer, however, with high
recurrent costs, public hospitals are sought more, and provide about three-fourths of the care.

Shillong attracts a high number of patients from surrounding areas who come to seek care due to
the lack of hospitals in neighboring regions, putting pressure on the city’s services, while also
providing an opportunity for coordination of care. The figures shows the proportion of cases that

in these seven major hospitals report being from East Khasi, the remaining come from outside the
city and district (14 percent from neighboring Ri Bhoi, 13 percent from Jaintia Hills, 10 percent
from West Khasi Hills, and the remaining from further afield). Patients from outside seek a variety
of care including for gastric problems, pregnancy and fever. An exceptional number from outside
the district seeks care for Typhoid (62 percent), Meningitis/encephalitis(59 percent), kidney
problems (56 percent) and Tuberculosis (54 percent), while the majority of cancer patients (68
percent) come from within East Khasi district. The age difference between patients coming from
within East Khasi and outside is not much (33 versus 31 years), indicating that patients of all age
come to Shillong’s hospitals from outside the district.

5.4. Summary
A significant urban advantage is also evident in terms of utilization of maternal, child and
reproductive health services, although urban-rural differences have narrowed in recent years as
coverage has improved faster in rural areas. Government nutrition services are an exception, as
coverage levels are higher in rural areas. Utilization of general outpatient services has remained
stable in urban areas, while increasing somewhat in rural areas so that there is now little urban-
rural difference. In contrast, while growing in both urban and rural areas, utilization of inpatient
hospital services is significantly higher in rural areas. In both urban and rural areas, the majority
of general outpatient and inpatient health services are provided by the private sector. Government
services are more important for delivery of maternal, child and reproductive health services,
although the role of the private sector remains significant and is greater in urban areas than in rural
areas



                                                      66
An urban penalty may be evident with regard to household out-of-pocket spending on health
services, as on average, consistent with its generally higher utilization and greater use of the private
sector, the urban population spends more on health care than the rural populations. On the other
hand, because average income is higher in urban areas, average household health spending as
proportion of total household expenditures is similar to rural areas. In addition, on average,
coverage of health insurance is higher among the urban population, which is also less likely to
need to resort to borrowing or selling assets in order to meet health care costs.

Analysis of socio-economic differences indicates that the urban poor have worse health, nutrition
and population outcomes and are less likely to use health services than the urban better-off, but
generally still benefit from an urban advantage in that they have better indicators than the rural
poor. However, in comparison with higher quintiles, the urban-rural gap is quite small at the
poorest quintile. Like the rural poor, the urban poor are more likely to use government services for
basic maternal, child and reproductive health care, but their use of private sector services is higher
than the rural poor. As household socio-economic status increases in both urban and rural areas,
use of private sector services increases, but the increases are much greater among urban
populations.

Overall averages indicate that the urban population as a whole spends more out-of-pocket on health
care in absolute terms compared to the rural population, but spends less as a proportion of total
consumption. However, when looking at the lower quintiles, and particularly the poorest quintile,
spending on health care by urban and rural households is similar both in rupee terms and as a
proportion of total consumption. At the same time, although the urban population a whole is more
likely to be covered by health insurance and less likely to need to resort to coping mechanisms to
meet health care costs, the poorest urban quintile is fairly similar in these respects to the poorest
rural quintile. The urban advantage is considerably more pronounced on these issues at higher
socio-economic levels.

In general, when looking at the poorest quintile, an urban health advantage is evident, but it is
considerably less significant than at the higher socio-economic levels. Urban populations benefit
from an overall health advantage, but this is clearly linked to socio-economic status.

Finally, considerable heterogeneity exists across states and cities in utilization of services by
residence and by the type of services used (public or private), even if for the same disease.

6.            DISPARITIES

This section examines different types of disparities in health, nutrition and population outcomes
and access to services involving urban populations. Although there are a number of different
cleavages that could be examined, such as inequalities in outcomes and access between genders,
migrants and non-migrants, castes, and ethnic or tribal groups, the chapter focuses on urban-rural
differences and disparities related to household economic status. (Differences in household
economic levels and distributions between the four states where our city case studies are located
are discussed in Box 6.1). Drawing on available data as well as our four case studies, the chapter
explores disparities in outcomes, service utilization, use of government and private sector services,
household health spending, and the situation of slum populations.

     Box 6.1. Economic levels and distributions

     The data presented in this and other sections indicate that health, nutrition and population indicators are generally
     better in Chennai, followed by Bhubaneswar and Shillong, and lastly Meerut. Among other factors, these
     differences are surely related to the level and distribution of economic wealth in these cities. Average per capita
     monthly consumption expenditure data can provide an indication of the relative economic level of the urban
     populations of the states in which the case study cities are located. In 2011-12, this estimate was Rs 2,622 (US$
     52) for the urban population of Tamil Nadu, Rs 2,436 (US$ 49) in urban Meghalaya, Rs 2,051 (US$ 41) in urban
     Uttar Pradesh, and Rs 1,941 (US$ 39) in urban Odisha. (2011-12 National Sample Survey, 68th Round) This
     suggests that health, nutrition and population conditions in urban Tamil Nadu are in line with its high average
     economic level in relation to the other states, but that urban Meghalaya and especially urban Uttar Pradesh are
     under-performing in relation to their economic levels, while urban Odisha may be doing better than its average
     economic level would indicate.

     In addition, the graph above provides an illustration of the distribution of consumption expenditure among the
     urban population in each state. The urban populations of Uttar Pradesh and Odisha are concentrated at the lower
     end of monthly consumption expenditure categories, consistent with poor health indicators in urban Uttar Pradesh
     while again indicating that Odisha may be over-performing. Urban Tamil Nadu and urban Meghalaya are
     concentrated at mid to high end of the scale, consistent with better health indicators in Tamil Nadu, but again
     suggesting that urban Meghalaya is under-performing.

India’s estimated per capita gross national income in 2014 was US$ 1,610. (World Bank, 2015)
Applying the government’s 2011-12 poverty line of Rs 12,000 per capita (US$ 250) in urban areas,
it estimated that 13.7 percent of the urban population, or 53 million, were below the poverty line.
This compares to 25.7 percent of the rural population, or 217 million, below the rural poverty line
of Rs 9,792 (US$ 204).28 (Government of India, 2013d) The urban poor do not all live in slums,

28
  Application of these poverty lines results in 22 percent of the total population below the poverty line, which can
compare to the estimate of 23.6 percent living on under US$ 1.25 per day in 2011. (World Bank, 2015)


                                                                   69
while slum inhabitants also include better-off households. For example, an analysis of 2005-06
household survey data in eight cities finds that the proportion of households living in areas defined
as slums is consistently higher than the proportion of households ranked in the bottom quartile of
a wealth index. (Gupta, Arnold and Lhungdim, 2009)

6.1. Disparities in outcomes
With the important exception of sex ratio, health and nutrition outcome indicators are better among
urban populations than among rural populations at every level of household economic status.
Figure 6.1 presents estimates from a 2005-06 household survey.29 Among the poorest 20 percent
of the population, under-five mortality was 45 per 1,000 among the urban population compared to
63.2 per 1,000 among the rural population. There was similarly a large urban-rural difference in
fertility at the poorest quintile, with total fertility rates of 2.8 and 3.8 in urban and rural areas
respectively, although this difference narrowed at higher economic levels. Child malnutrition
(stunting) among the poorest quintile was 53.6 percent in urban areas and 58.8 percent in rural
areas, with the difference widening at the higher quintiles.

With one exception, this pattern is also evident in data from the states in which our four city case
studies are located. (Figure 6.2) In 2005-06, in Odisha, Uttar Pradesh and Meghalaya, among the
poorest quintile, child malnutrition was lower in urban populations than in rural populations.
However, in Tamil Nadu, in the lowest quintile, the proportion of under-five children who were
stunted was 42.3 percent, compared to 35.6 percent in rural areas. This is an anomaly, given both
the overall pattern across the country and the generally better indicators in Tamil Nadu compared
to other states.

Going back to Figure 6.1, the graph also illustrates disparities between household economic levels
within both urban and rural populations in India. Under-five mortality in the poorest quintile in

    We estimated household economic status separately for urban and rural populations making use of data on
household assets and other characteristics. When referring to urban populations, a household in the poorest quintile
is thus ranked in the poorest 20 percent of all urban households (not all households in India). Because both
remuneration and the cost of living are higher in urban areas, the distribution of urban households by economic
status is to the right of the distribution of rural households.

The total fertility rate among the poorest quintile in urban areas was 2.8, compared to 1.6 among
the highest quintile. Similarly, the proportion of under-five children who are stunted among the
poorest urban population was 53.6 percent, more than double the figure of 18.4 percent among the
highest quintile.

Again, this pattern is replicated when looking at urban-rural differences in the four states where
the case studies are located. (Figure 6.3) In all four states, child malnutrition is higher among the
poorest than among the highest household economic quintile in urban populations. The differences
are very large in Tamil Nadu, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh, but not as extreme in Meghalaya.

The 2005-06 National Family Health Survey over-sampled eight cities which enabled estimation
of health indicators for their populations as a whole as well as sub-populations, including the poor
(measured by the poorest 25 percent of the population, or quartile) and slum dwellers. These
included our case study cities of Chennai and Meerut. (Gupta, Arnold and Lhungdim, 2009) Data
from this survey on under-five mortality, stunting and fertility in Chennai and Meerut cities show


                                                                                                                      71
disparities in health outcomes between the poor and the better off among urban populations.
(Figure 6.4) For example, in 2005-06, under-five mortality in Chennai among the poorest 25
percent of the population was 44.8 percent, almost 20 percentage points higher than the overall
average in the city. In Meerut, at much higher levels of child mortality, the difference was similarly
20 percentage points, but narrower in relative terms. It is again notable that child malnutrition
among the poorest in Chennai (55.7 percent) was very high, indeed high enough to exceed the
overall average in Meerut (43.8 percent). Also, child malnutrition among the poorest in Chennai
(Figure 6.4) exceeds the estimate for the poorest among urban populations in Tamil Nadu as a
whole (Figure 6.3). However, with regard to fertility, the total fertility rate among the poorest
quartile in Chennai, although higher than the overall average for the city, is still below the
replacement level (2.1). Fertility in Meerut is much higher and there is a greater gap between the
poorest and the overall average.

Data on adult nutritional status among the urban poor are also available for Chennai and Meerut.
(Figure 6.5) In both cities, an indicator of poor nutritional status among women (body mass index
less than 18.5) was higher in the poorest quartile compared to city averages. In Chennai, in 2005-
06, 26.2 percent of adult women in the poorest quartile had a low body mass index, while in Meerut
the proportion was 32.0 percent. Under-nutrition among adult women is more common in Meerut
than in Chennai for both the poor and on average.

Prevalence of over-nutrition among adults provide some indication of the burden of non-
communicable diseases among the urban poor. In both cities, adult women in the poorest quartile
are less likely to have a body mass index over 25.0 compared to the overall average. In Chennai,
this proportion is 26.5 percent in the poorest quartile, compared to 39.2 percent overall in the city.
In Meerut, these proportions are lower – 8.8 percent among the poor and 29.6 percent overall, a
significantly larger difference than in Chennai. It is notable that in Chennai, the prevalence of high
BMI among poor women (26.5 percent) is similar to the prevalence of low BMI among poor
women (26.2 percent), an indication that the urban poor suffer from a dual burden of disease.
Another signal of the importance of non-communicable diseases is tobacco use. (Figure 6.6) Use
of tobacco by adult men on average in both cities is quite high. However, tobacco use among the
poor in Chennai (61.2 percent) is significantly higher than the average (35.9 percent) and also
significantly higher than tobacco use by the poor in Meerut (41.8 percent). In contrast with
Chennai, tobacco use by poor adult men in Meerut is lower than the average for the city (58.1
percent). These patterns may be related to the overall higher economic level in Chennai.

The ratio of females to males is the major exception to the patterns described above: (i) it is worse
in urban populations compared to rural populations at all household economic levels; and (ii) it is
worse among higher quintiles compared to lower quintiles in both urban and rural areas. (Figure
6.7) For example, in 2005-06, in the poorest quintile in urban areas, the number of girls for every
1,000 boys was 910, lower than in the poorest quintile in rural areas, where it was 923, but
significantly higher than in the highest quintile in urban areas, where it was 820. Worse sex ratios

are thus associated with both urbanization and higher economic status.

The urban-rural difference in sex ratios is apparent in 2011 Census data for the districts where our
city case studies are located. (Table 6.1) Consistent with national patterns, the lowest ratios are in
Meerut District and the highest in Chennai and East Khasi Hills.


                                                                                           74
Worse ratios in urban areas compared to rural areas of these districts are observed in Khorda
District (which includes Bhubaneswar), Meerut District, and East Khasi Hills District (which
includes Shillong). Nonetheless, Chennai provides an exception to the general pattern, as the ratio
of 950 in urban Chennai is better than the rural average of 936 for the state.

6.2. Disparities in service utilization
Reproductive and child health service indicators show the familiar pattern of better results in urban
areas compared to rural – at all household economic levels – and better results at the higher
household economic quintiles compared to the poorest – both urban and rural areas. (Figure 6.8)
For example, in 2005-06, among the poorest quintile, 35.3 percent of one year old children were
fully vaccinated in urban areas, compared to 25.1 percent in rural areas.

At the same time, 71.2 percent of children in the highest household economic quintile in urban
areas were fully vaccinated. The same pattern is evident with coverage of full antenatal care and
modern contraceptive use.

The exception is the proportion of under-six children who have received supplementary nutrition
from an Anganwadi Centre as part of the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS). This
proportion is higher both in rural areas, compared to urban, and higher among the lower quintiles,
in both urban and rural areas.

In 2005-06, among the poorest quintile, 16.9 percent of children received supplementary nutrition
from this program, compared to 25.9 percent in rural areas. At the same time, just 1.3 percent of
children in the highest quintile in urban areas received supplementary nutrition from an Anganwadi
Centre. The contrast with other service utilization indicators is due to: (i) this indicator refers only
to government services (while vaccination, antenatal and contraceptive services are provided by
both the government and private sectors); (ii) the ICDS is not very present in urban areas; and (iii)
there is a self-targeting aspect to ICDS services in that, while the poor and better-off alike will
demand child and reproductive health services, the better-off are less likely than the poor to want
to avail of ICDS services.

These patterns are replicated in the states where our case studies are located (data not shown), with
the exception of vaccination in Tamil Nadu, where the poor in rural areas had higher coverage
(79.8 percent) than the poor in urban areas (70.2 percent).

Figure 6.9 provides 2005-06 data comparing service utilization indicators between the lowest and
highest quintiles in urban populations in the states where our case study cities are located. The
national pattern was evident of child and reproductive health services, but higher utilization of
government nutrition services, among the urban poor across these states. Urban populations in
Uttar Pradesh had the lowest utilization levels for vaccination and antenatal care, as well as the
greatest disparities between the poor and better-off, while contraceptive use was lowest in
Meghalaya among both the poor and better-off. Again, Tamil Nadu had the best service coverage
rates for both the lowest and highest quintiles. In Odisha, coverage rates for the highest urban
quintile approached those in Tamil Nadu and even exceeded it in the case of contraceptive use, but
rates for the poorest quintile in Odisha were far lower than in Tamil Nadu. Again, use of

government nutrition services was highest among the urban poor, with the highest coverage
observed in Tamil Nadu and the lowest in Meghalaya and Uttar Pradesh.

than urban populations as a whole. Vaccination coverage in Chennai is an exception, as children
in the poorest quartile of the population of the city were significantly more likely to be fully
vaccinated (90.3 percent) than the average for the city as a whole (77.7 percent). Vaccination
coverage of the poor in Chennai (Figure 3.9) is also higher than the average for the urban poor
statewide (Figure 3.10), but the poor in Chennai seem to have less access to antenatal care,
contraception and nutrition services than the urban poor in general in Tamil Nadu. In Meerut,
vaccination and contraception coverage among the poor is higher than the statewide averages for
the urban population, but similar with regard to antenatal care.

6.3. Differences in private sector health service utilization
More recent data on delivery care repeats the above-described patterns: higher utilization by urban
populations at all economic levels, and lower utilization by the poor compared to the better off in
both urban and rural areas. (Figure 6.11) In 2014, in the poorest quintile of the urban population,
85.2 percent of mothers delivered in health facilities, compared to 74.9 percent among the poorest

quintile of the rural population. In the highest quintile of the urban population, 95.9 percent of
mothers delivered in a health facility.

The data also provide information on the use of government and private sector facilities for
delivery. Utilization of private sector services was higher in urban areas at every economic level
and increased as household economic level increased. Among the poorest quintile in urban areas,
31.7 percent of all deliveries were in private institutions, compared to 16.9 percent in rural areas.
Greater use of private sector facilities explains the urban advantage in delivery care, since use of
government facilities is higher among the rural population at every economic level. Among the
poorest urban quintile, 53.5 percent of all deliveries are in government facilities, compared to 58.0
percent among the poorest quintile in rural areas. This drops to 18.9 percent at the highest urban
quintile, while still remaining high at 47.8 percent at the highest quintile in rural areas.

Data on general use of health services, which implies outpatient care, for Chennai and Meerut are
provided in Figure 6.12. The difference between the two cities is striking, representing two
extremes of the situation in urban India, where overall in 2014, 79 percent of outpatient care was
provided by the private sector. (2014 National Sample Survey, 74th Round). In Meerut, where use
of the private sector for outpatient care is on average 89.6 percent, the poorest quartile tend to use
the private sector slightly more, at 93 percent. In contrast, the poorest quartile in Chennai reports
using the private sector considerably less (36.6 percent) than the average for the city (65.2 percent).

Reasons provided by those households who report not using government services when a
household member is ill are provided in Table 6.2. Both the poor and the city population as a whole
in Meerut is much more likely to report that the lack of a government facility nearby is an important
reason for not using government services. The poorest quartile are somewhat more likely to
provide this reason (67.7 percent) than the average (58.4 percent). Poor quality of care is also
significantly more likely to be a reason for not using government services in Meerut, for both the
poorest (63.1 percent) and overall (65.1 percent). Conversely, inconvenient opening hours are cited


                                                                           79
as more important in Chennai than in Meerut. Nonetheless, the main reported reasons in both cities
are similar: lack of a facility nearby, inconvenient timing of services, long waiting time, and poor
quality. In both cities, differences between the poorest quartile and the overall average are not
large, except with regard to facility availability in Meerut. Interestingly, issues that were raised as
important by key informants during our research in the four cities – human resources and medicine
supply – were not reported as significant barriers.

6.4. Differences in household health expenditures
Urban populations spend more on health services than do rural populations. In 2011-12, average
monthly health expenditures by urban households totaled Rs 146 (US$ 2.90), compared to Rs 95
(US$ 1.89) by rural households. (2011-12 National Sample Survey, 68th Round) This is consistent


                                                                          80
with urban populations using more health services (Figure 1.3), using more private sector services
(Figure 1.4), as well as with the fact that urban households pay more for each case of illness or
hospitalization. In addition, this urban-rural difference held at each level of economic status,
although health spending by the poorest in both urban and rural areas was quite similar. (Figure
3.13) In 2011-12, among the poorest quintile in urban areas, monthly health spending averaged Rs
37 (US$ 0.74), compared to Rs 26 (US$ 0.52) among the poorest in rural areas. In both urban and
rural areas, health spending rose sharply with increasing economic status, so that it doubled from
the lowest to the second quintile and was almost ten times larger in the highest quintile.

However, because average urban income and consumption expenditure levels are higher, as a
proportion of total household expenditures, household health spending in urban areas is in fact
lower than in rural areas. On average, in 2011-12, spending on health care by urban households
represented 5.5 percent of their total consumption expenditures, compared to 6.7 percent for rural
households. Nonetheless, health expenditures as a proportion of total household expenditures are
similar for the majority of urban and rural populations who are situated in the first four quintiles.
The difference in urban and rural averages is largely driven by significantly higher health spending
as a proportion of total expenditures in the highest rural quintile. (Figure 6.13) The poorest
quintiles in both urban and rural areas spend similar amounts on health care (3.8 percent) as a
proportion of their total household expenditures.

In 2014, on average, urban households spent Rs 639 (US$ 10.51) on outpatient care per case of
illness, compared to Rs 509 (US$ 8.37) paid by rural households. The difference is much larger
for hospital services, as on average, urban households paid Rs 26,455 (US$ 435) per
hospitalization, compared by Rs 16,956 (US$ 279) paid by rural households. (2014 National
Sample Survey, 71st Round) These urban-rural differences in average unit costs for health care are
driven by differences at higher socio-economic levels, while the amounts paid by the poorest
quintiles in both urban and rural areas are similar. (Figure 6.14)



                                                                        81
In 2014, in the lowest quintile among the urban population, the average amount paid for outpatient
care per ill household member was Rs 472 (US$ 7.76), similar to the average of Rs 524 (US$ 8.62)
paid by the poorest quintile in rural areas. Similarly, on average, the poorest urban quintile paid
Rs 12,516 (US$ 206) per hospitalization, compared to Rs 11,805 (US$ 194) among the poorest
rural quintile. These amounts can compare to the range of monthly total per capita expenditure that
defines the poorest quintile in this analysis: Rs 0-1,182 (US$ 0-19) for the urban population and
Rs 0-800 (US$ 0-13) for the rural population.30 (Government of India, 2013a) In other words, the
average cost paid for a hospitalization by the poorest urban quintile is at least ten times greater
than total monthly per capita expenditures in this quintile, about equivalent to the maximum annual
per capita annual expenditures in this quintile. Like total household health spending, the unit costs
paid by households rise rapidly with increasing economic status (and rise more rapidly in urban
areas than in rural areas).

In addition, on average, urban households are more likely to be covered by some form of health
insurance; in 2014, 18.1 percent of urban households had coverage, compared to 14.1 percent of
rural households. This difference is largely driven by higher coverage of private health insurance
among the urban population (6.1 percent versus 1.0 percent among the rural population), while
coverage by government-supported health insurance programs is similar in urban areas (12.0
percent) compared to rural areas (13.1 percent). (2014 National Sample Survey, 71st Round)

However, health insurance coverage of the poorest quintile in urban areas is similar to the poorest
quintile in rural areas. (Figure 6.15) While 9.5 percent of individuals in the poorest urban quintile
were covered by some type of health insurance, this is less than the 11.8 percent in the poorest
rural quintile, a difference which is due to slightly higher coverage of government-supported
insurance. Disparities in insurance coverage are greater in urban areas, due to increasing coverage

of private health insurance at higher socio-economic levels. Nonetheless, coverage of private-
sector health insurance rises to a significant level, exceeding coverage of government-supported
insurance, only in the highest urban quintile (18.3 percent). Coverage of government-supported
insurance also increases with household economic level in urban areas, with the proportions
covered by quintile quite similar to rural areas. (Government-supported insurance includes
insurance for government employees as well as government programs targeting the poor).

On average, urban residents less likely to need to resort to borrowing, selling assets or seeking
contributions from friends or relatives in order to meet health care costs (as opposed to meeting
expenses from their own income and savings). In 2014, these were the primary sources of financing
for the health care costs of 25.1 percent of urban residents, compared to 32.2 percent of rural
residents. (2014 National Sample Survey, 71st Round) The proportions of households who
primarily rely on sources of financing other than their own income or savings are similar in the
poorest quintiles in urban (31.6 percent) and rural (34.4 percent) areas. The urban advantage on
this issue widens as household economic status increases and the better-off in urban areas are more
likely to be able to cover health costs from their own resources. (Figure 6.15)

6.5. Urban slums
Slums are the most visible manifestation of disparities in urban areas and a stated focus of public
policy, including the main national urban development program as well as the National Health
Mission, whose objective is “to improve the health status of the urban population particularly slum
dwellers and other vulnerable sections by facilitating their access to quality health care. ”
(Government of India, 2013a) The 2011 Census measured three types of slums: (i) “notified” slums
are those designated as such by national, state or local governments, in accordance with national
or state legislation; (ii) “recognized” slums that are not formally notified but nonetheless
designated as slums by government; and (iii) “identified” slums determined by census officials to


                                                                         83
be compact areas with at least 60-70 households with poorly-built and congested housing,
unhygienic conditions and poor water and sanitation facilities.

The census enumerated a total of 65.5 million people living in slums, divided about evenly into
the three types. This was 17.4 percent of the total urban population reported by the census. Uttar
Pradesh, with 9.5 percent of the total slum population, counted among the top five states with the
largest slum populations. Meerut, with 40 percent of its total population living in slums, was among
the cities with the largest proportions of their populations living in slums (the highest proportion
was in Mumbai, with 41 percent). In 2011, there were 185 slums in Meerut city of which 43 percent
were not notified or registered and thus less likely to have access to public services. Tamil Nadu,
where 8.9 percent of the country’s slum population lived in 2011, was similarly among the states
with the largest slum populations. Chennai, with 28.5 percent of its population living in slums in
2011, was also among the cities with the largest proportions of their populations living in slums.
After expansion of its administrative boundaries, Chennai’s slum population grew to over 36
percent of the city’s total population. The number of slums increased from 1,700 to more than
3,000, of which only 751 are notified. In addition, the Chennai Municipal Corporation estimates
that there is a population of about 15,000 homeless persons (who often have difficulty in accessing
social benefits for the poor due to lack of identification documents).

Odisha had a slum population of 1.6 million in 2011. In 2011, the census reported that 18.5 percent
of the population of Bhubaneswar lived in slums. Presently, it is reported that Bhubaneswar has
436 slums, only 99 of which are authorized. The slum population is reported to have surged due
to migration after a cyclone along the coastal areas of Odisha in 2000. Many migrants are also
from rural parts or Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Bihar, relocating for better employment
opportunities. (Population Foundation of India, 2013) In Meghalaya, the 2011 census reported a
slum population of only 57,000, of which about 15,000 were in Shillong.

The 2011 census found that 20.4 percent of the total slum population in India were from Scheduled
Castes, while 3.4 percent were from Scheduled Tribes, compared to 12.6 percent and 2.8 percent
respectively in the urban population as a whole.31 In Meerut, 24 percent of the slum population
was from Scheduled Castes, compared to 16 percent of the city’s population as a whole. In
Chennai, over 30 percent of the slum population was from Scheduled Castes in 2011, compared to
17 percent among the city’s overall population. About half of the Scheduled Caste population in
Chennai live in slums. In Shillong, non-tribal groups, such as economic migrants from other states,
are more likely to live in slums, as only 23 percent of the slum population is from Scheduled
Tribes, compared to 77.5 percent in the East Khasi District (containing Shillong).

Household survey data from eight cities in 2005-06 provide estimates for under-five mortality
among slum and non-slum populations, as well as among the poorest quartile of the populations
of each city. (Table 6.3) This indicates that slum populations experience worse health outcomes
than urban populations not living in slums. For example, in Chennai, under-five mortality was 46.3
per 1,000 among the slum population, compared to 31.5 among the non-slum populations.

  Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are historically disadvantaged groups recognized under the India’s
constitution.


                                                       84
Similarly, in Meerut, under-five mortality experienced by families living in slums was 86.1 per
1,000, compared to 69.4 among those living outside of slums. However, it is notable that under-
five mortality rates in slums in Kolkata, Mumbai and Hyderabad, were lower than for non-slum
populations, a reflection of the heterogeneity of slum populations. That is, these data, along with
other data on household economic status, indicate that slum populations do not necessarily
coincide with the poorest urban populations. In other words, better-off households often live in
slums, while poor households often live outside of slums. (Nolan, 2015) In four of the five cities
for which under-five mortality was estimated for the poorest quartile, rates were considerable
worse than for slum populations. In Chennai, under-five mortality among the poorest quartile was
69.9 per 1,000, compared to 46.3 among the slum population. In Meerut, under-five mortality
among the poor was 118.7 per 1,000, compared to 86.1 among the slum population.

The above-described typology of slums is a reflection of how legal status may differ for different
urban slums and neighborhoods in India, which in turn affects extension of government services
(along with other issues, notably property tenure and vulnerability to eviction). Eight different
types of legal status have been observed in Delhi, for example, including “designated slums,”
“unauthorized colonies,” “regularized unauthorized colonies” and “planned colonies.” (Bhan,
2013) While political and administrative structures tend to be responsive to the urban middle class,
poor and slum populations often struggle to influence local governments to make the necessary
investments in public infrastructure such as sanitation systems. (Chaplin, 2011) At the same time,
the urban poor may have access to politicians and administrators in order to receive services and
reduce vulnerability to eviction, often mediated through informal community leaders, particularly
in the case of poorer and more recent migrants. (Jha, Rao and Woolcock, 2007)

Resettlement colonies are often set up for households who are move from unauthorized slums
(voluntarily or involuntarily). For example, in Chennai, while resettlement colonies set up by the
municipality generally fare much better than slums in terms of sanitation, most resettlement
colonies are located on the periphery of the city, so that in contrast with more centrally-located
slums, employment is more difficult, commuting longer, and subsequently incomes of poor


                                                        85
households are reduced. (Coelho, Venkat and Chandrika, 2012)

In Chennai, government primary health care facilities are located in only 168 of the 751 notified
slums (out of over 3,000 slums). Poor access to health services is mirrored by health service
utilization indicators. Such indicators for slum populations are worse than for urban populations
not living in slums, but usually better than indicators for the poorest quartile of the urban
population. For example, in Meerut in 2005-06, 15.6 percent of pregnant women living in slums
received all recommended components of antenatal care, compared to 26.3 percent among the non-
slum population, but only 3.9 percent among the poorest quartile of the total population of the city.
Similarly, in Chennai, antenatal care coverage among the slum population was as high as 40.5
percent, lower than 52.1 percent among the non-slum population, but higher than 30.4 percent
among the poor.

Although overall access to health services is lower among slum populations, they are generally
more likely to use government services than non-slum populations. In 2005-06, this was the case
in seven of eight cities studied. In Chennai, 47.2 percent of slum households generally would go
to a government health care provider when a household member was ill, compared to 31.1 percent
of non-slum households. (2005-06 National Family Health Survey 3) Figure 6.16 illustrates data
on 12,600 institutional deliveries between January and May 2014 in Chennai. It indicates that use
of government services is highest in zones with the largest slum populations. In Roypuram zone,


                                                     86
which has the lowest proportion of its population living in slums (25 percent), 59 percent of women
chose the private sector for delivery care. In contrast, in Tondiarpet, which has the highest
proportion of its population living in slums (64 percent), only 19 percent used private health
services. Figure 3.16 also indicates that Tondiarpet makes most use of Tamil Nadu’s conditional
cash transfer program encouraging maternal health care provided by government services.

An exception to the pattern of greater use of government services by slum populations is Meerut,
where around 90 percent both slum and non-slum households would generally go to the private
sector if a household member were sick. Slum households were marginally less likely to use
government services (8.3 percent) than non-slum households (10.3 percent). Key informants in
Meerut indicated that poor residents favor local healers and private doctors over government health
services. Government providers are perceived as either being absent or providing poor quality care
and the poor only use the government system when they cannot afford private practitioners. A
2007-08 survey of over 15,000 mothers found that only about 60 percent of pregnant women living
in slums had registered with a health facility. Of these registered pregnancies, 40 percent accessed
private care, 25 percent used NGO services and the remaining 25 percent used government
facilities. Reasons reported for not using the government health system included “poor physical
accessibility, irregular supplies and absence of adequate staff including lady doctors” (UHRC,
2009).

In general, slum populations are also more likely to use government nutrition services. In Chennai,
in contrast with primary health care facilities, there are Anganwadi Centres in about half of the
over 3,000 slums in the city. Thus, in Chennai in 2005-06, 24.1 percent of under-six children living
in slums received supplementary food from an Anganwadi Centre, compared to 12.3 percent
among the non-slum population. This pattern is also seen in other cities. Even in Meerut, 5.6
percent of children living in slums received supplementary nutrition, compared to 0.0 percent of
children living outside of slums. (2005-06 National Family Health Survey 3)

                      Poor hygiene and sanitation lead to a number of diseases and the poor absorption of nutrients. This
                      section focuses on drinking water and sanitation in Indian cities and describes the challenges in
                      increasing coverage and improving quality of these services.

                      7.1. The state of urban water and toilets: coverage
                      Indian cities can be filthy, congested and polluted, and their poorest inhabitants often live without
                      basic water and sanitation services, in what is regularly described as squalor. The country has some
                      of the worst sanitation in the world – the majority of people who defecate in the open live in India.
                      In urban areas, one in five households does not have a latrine facility within their premises, and
                      the majority end up defecating in the open (Figure 7.1). Odisha, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh are
                      among the eight worst states in the country and report urban open defecation that is higher than
                      the national average (with 35 percent, 25 percent and 17 percent of urban households lacking toilets
                      respectively in each state). In contrast, 96 percent of urban households in Meghalaya have toilets
                      within their premises. (2011 Census)

                      The absence of a private space for sanitation, apart from depriving individuals of discretion, is
                      associated with challenges of venturing out in bad weather, in the night, encountering stalkers or
                      animals, and the risk of contracting infections. Urban women in particular (compared with rural
                      women) report high stress regarding rape and sexual assault and the challenge of crossing physical
                      barriers to find a place for sanitation, and they also acknowledge being stressed over concerns of
                      reputation. In addition, these women often rely on public sources for water which can be
                      unpredictable and sporadic, making hygiene and sanitation an unpleasant – and most likely
                      unhealthy – experience. (Hulland et al., 2015)

                      India is also one of the most unequal countries in terms of urban sanitation. Nationally, one in two
                      of the poorest urban households did not have a toilet in 2005-06. (Figure 7.2) In Odisha, 84 percent
                      of these most vulnerable urban households were without toilets, and even in a more


                                                                                                             88
developmentally advanced state like Tamil Nadu 61 percent of urban households in the poorest
quintile did not have toilets (2005-06 National Family Health Survey 3). As household wealth
increases, access to toilets increases but there is a large gap between the richest and poorest
quintiles in use of improved sanitation. As a result, India ranks with a country like Namibia in
terms of inequality (UNICEF and World Health Organization, 2015). This inequality across wealth
quintiles is also generally larger in urban than in rural areas. In urban areas, for households with
improved toilet facilities, there is a difference of 79 percentage points between the poorest and
richest quintiles nationally, and it is as high as 94 percentage points in Odisha, although also just
15 percentage points in Meghalaya.32 (2005-06 National Family Health Survey 3)

Drinking water is more accessible with 71 percent of urban residents in India having access within
their premises. (Figure 7.3) However, in Meghalaya, Odisha and Tamil Nadu, just a little more
than half of urban households access water within their premises, and the rest use shared sources
(in Odisha about 18 percent of households’ water sources are “away” from their premises, as
compared to “within” or “near”). A little more than 60 percent of urban Indians have access to
piped and treated water, with only 42 percent having this luxury in Odisha. More than a third of
urban residents in Odisha get their drinking water from a well (tubewell, covered or uncovered
well), and 37 percent in Uttar Pradesh use a hand pump.

Urban households can draw some solace that they tend to have better drinking water and sanitation
services than in rural areas – but this is also largely because of very poor sanitation in rural India.
The urban advantage exists: In rural parts 70 percent of households are without a latrine facility
and 97 percent of these households defecate in the open. As mentioned above, in urban India about
20 percent of households do not have toilets, and 68 percent of these residents defecate in the open
(another 32 percent use public toilets). (2011 Census)

The urban advantage in sanitation, in terms of access to improved toilet facilities, is large and it

32
   An improved toilet facility is one that is not shared; it includes flush/pour flush to a piped sewer system, a septic
tank, or pit latrines.


                                                                                               89
                      existed across the household economic distribution in 2005-06 (with a 57 percentage point gap
                      nationally between urban and rural residents). (Figure 7.4) However, poorer households benefit
                      from a smaller urban advantage than do better-off households. The urban advantage is largest for
                      households in the middle of the wealth distribution – this broad pattern holds nationally and in the
                      states examined except for Meghalaya. In Meghalaya, the largest advantage of being an urban
                      resident is for the poorest and the smallest is for the wealthiest. As shown in the figure, the average
                      urban resident tends to have the largest urban advantage in a poorer state like Uttar Pradesh, but
                      even in a state like Tamil Nadu the advantage in sanitation is large.

                      For drinking water, residents have a smaller urban advantage (11 percentage point difference
                      nationally). (Figure 7.5) The difference is also slightly progressive as the urban-rural difference
                      among poor households is larger than the urban-rural difference among all households. Meghalaya
                      stands out with a large (38 percentage points) advantage for urban residents, and particularly for
                      poorest households (53 percentage point gap in access between the urban and rural poor).

                      Within slums, about 65 percent of households have access to tapped water from a treated source
                      (similar to the overall average for the urban population). Yet the water source is located within
                      household premises for only 42 percent of slum residents (as compared with 71 percent among the
                      urban population as a whole), implying that public or shared sources of water are being used by
                      the majority of slum households. Thus, for 11 percent the source of water is ‘away’ from their
                      premises (2011 Census).

                      However, the most striking difference between slum and non-slum populations is their access to
                      toilets: about a third of slum households have no latrine on their premises (compared with less than
                      a fifth of the urban population as a whole). (Figure 7.6) Almost one in five slum households
                      defecates in the open. Half of slum residents in Odisha 39 percent in Tamil Nadu do not have
                      latrines. The poorest, however, do not necessarily live in slums – particularly since the Census

defines slums as areas with at least 60-70 households. Smaller clusters of households are excluded,
and these households are often more vulnerable, poor and mobile and are less likely to have access
to basic services (Bhan and Jana, 2013). Within the non-slum population 11 percent of households
defecate in the open, indicating that poverty and poor access to services are also concerns outside
of slums. (2011 Census)

Public toilets are used by about 4 percent of non-slum households but by 15 percent of slum
households in India. They are essential particularly for persons in slums and for floating
populations such as the homeless, street vendors, taxi and auto drivers, and other workers in
informal markets. Mapping by a non-governmental organization in Chennai finds that public
toilets are too few (against a norm of 1 seat for 60 persons there exists 1 seat for every 1,050
persons), their spatial location is not well planned, they are poorly maintained and monitored, and
that the Corporation of Chennai needs to creatively manage these challenges, given constraints of
capacity, land and poor coordination (for example, private contractors may not have the incentive
to maintain public sanitation).33

Finally, a great deal of variation in service provision exists within cities. For example, access to
water and sanitation in Chennai may be superior to other parts of Tamil Nadu and India, but there
is heterogeneity within the city. As shown in Figure 7.7, 79 percent of households in Chennai
access tap water from a treated source as their main source of drinking water (as compared with
66 percent in urban Tamil Nadu). About 76 percent also report that this water source is within their
premises. Yet, access to drinking water ranges from 46 percent in ward 110 (in zone 9) to 94
percent in ward 15 (in zone 2), and this water supply is often sporadic and not round-the-clock

                      Similarly, while in urban Tamil Nadu one in four households report not having latrine facilities
                      within their premises, in Chennai it is only 4 percent. Nevertheless, within Chennai, 57 percent of
                      households in ward 80 and 41 percent in ward 110 (in zone 9) do not have latrines on their
                      premises. (Figure 7.8) Related to this, open defecation continues to be a problem for the city,

                      In Greater Shillong, the majority of households receive water within their premises. Yet, there are

of this water is sourced from springs. (Figure 7.9) Springs are the main source of water in
Meghalaya and given the prevalence of open defecation in these streams, they can be a disease
vector.

7.2. The importance of public sanitation
The disappearance of the urban health penalty in developed countries is strongly associated with
improvements in hygiene and sanitation. For example, the use of clean water technologies
(chlorination and filtration) in the major cities of the United States is estimated to have accounted
for a large proportion of reductions in infant and child mortality. Public health innovations in
sanitation, waste management, food quality control, along with improved living standards,
nutritional practices, better private hygiene and health-behaviors, have made major contributions
to longer and better lives around the world (Cutler and Miller, 2005).

In India, poor sanitation and hygiene lead to the spread of a number of fecal-transmitted and other
infectious diseases including diarrhea, typhoid, malaria and dengue, which account for a large
proportion of infant and child deaths and disease. Diarrhea, along with pneumonia, is the leading
cause of death among Indian children below five years of age (Million Death Study Collaborators,
2010). The incidence of diarrhea among children is similar in urban and rural India. (2005-06
National Family Health Survey 3)

Poor neighborhood sanitation has been linked to high levels of child stunting in India (Chambers
and Medeazza, 2013; Hammer and Spears, 2013; Ngure et al., 2014; Rah et al., 2015; Spears,
Ghosh and Cumming, 2013), and also to large geographic variations in infant mortality (Geruso
and Spears, 2015). There is also growing awareness regarding subclinical conditions such as
enteropathy, that are often undiagnosed, untreated and comorbid due to their asymptomatic nature
but prevent the proper absorption of nutrients. This may be a factor behind the exceptionally high
levels of child stunting in India – and related consequences such as poor cognitive outcomes and
school attendance (Chambers and Medeazza, 2013).

Cultural factors, along with economic status and other household characteristics, affect the use of
toilets and these are being appreciated more in understanding how to improve hygiene. For
example, despite worse socioeconomic indicators, India’s minority Muslim population is more
likely to use toilets than Hindus. Traditional concepts of pollution and purity have been central in
Hindu society and the use of latrines in close proximity to living quarters has been considered
polluting – this explains the reticence in some cases regarding use of toilets even when access is
provided (Coffey et al., 2015). A recent study found that the paradoxical lower infant mortality
rate among Muslims may be influenced by higher latrine use by Muslims and their neighbors
(Geruso and Spears, 2015).

7.3. Increasing coverage and improving quality of services: the challenges
Coverage of sanitation services is not keeping up with urban growth. India has made moderate
progress since 1990. (UNICEF and World Health Organization, 2015) In 2014 the government
announced the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Mission) which by 2019 aims to end open
defecation, eradicate manual scavenging and bring about behavior change in sanitation practices


                                                 94
(among other things) in rural and urban India. With the involvement of celebrities and the private
sector, and operated in ‘campaign mode’, this intervention aims to build over ten million household
toilets/latrines and 500,000 public toilets in urban India.34 The program follows in the tradition of
earlier interventions to address drinking water and sanitation, such as the Accelerated Rural Water
Supply Program in 1972-73, the Rajiv Gandhi National Drinking Water Mission in 1991, the
Swajaldhara program in 2002 and the Nirmal Bharat Abhiyaan (Total Sanitation Campaign) from
2012. Previous interventions have encountered limited success (Patil et al., 2014), and the current
intervention is similarly described as over-ambitious also given the financial resources that have
been subsequently allocated. (Ali, 2015; Coffey et al., 2014; Government of India, 2014a)

A number of problems exist in increasing coverage and maintaining quality of urban water and
sanitation services – these include poor planning, lack of skilled manpower, poor political will, but
also corruption and that services tend to be geared towards better-off neighborhoods and more
articulate citizens. The provision of basic services such as water and sanitation declines as one
moves away from the city core, it is inversely proportional to the size of the city, and worst in rural
areas (World Bank, 2013). There is some evidence of political capture of sanitary services such as
cleaning or paving of roads for the gain of local politicians. (Ban et al., 2009) Regulation of liquid
waste management is lacking. For example, officials in Shillong mentioned that there is no Water
Act in place in the state, nor clear governance systems, nor legislation to protect rivers.

No major city in India provides continuous water supply to its population (as compared with 90
percent in Jakarta, 88 percent in Manila and 60 percent in Colombo) and this is often not associated
with the quantity of water available for distribution – since large amounts go unaccounted in the
absence of metering (World Bank, 2012; World Bank, 2013). Lack of continuous supply (24 hours
a day) of water reduces the quality of the water in pipes, and increases the risk of waterborne
diseases (as water that has leaked out of faulty joints or holes is sucked back in when the pressure
drops). (Satapathy, 2014) Thiruvananthapuram provides the highest duration at 18 hours. The
average duration of water supply in 18 Indian cities was found to be 3.3 hours/day, (Satapathy,
2014) and this supply is often unreliable so that alternative sources are regularly used despite being
expensive. In Shillong, the average hours of water supply range from 1 to 6 hours a day, while in
Bhubaneshwar it is two hours. In Chennai, a sizeable proportion of the population buys water from
informal water markets and incurs significant costs, with lower-income households incurring
higher costs. (Venkatachalam, 2014)

Drinking water is defined as water from an improved source, which includes piped water, public
taps, hand pumps and bottled water. (2011 Census) Assessments of the quality of drinking water
in India have found that this water can have high levels of contamination in both urban and rural
areas. (Johri et al., 2014) In terms of water quality at source and point-of-use, Bhubaneswar fares
more poorly than cities like Pune or Jaipur (but is similar to Delhi). Contamination was found to
be as high as 43 percent percent at source and 65 percent at point-of-use – highlighting the need
for better water treatment, storage and handling. (Satapathy, 2014)

Slum populations do not have access to basic services such as piped water within their premises
also because agencies responsible for providing water require valid house ownership certificates.
(Satapathy, 2014)

Sanitation behaviors rely on access to water and on cultural preferences. Yet water and sanitation
services are often organized separately and the focus of current sanitation campaigns has been on
building toilet infrastructure (Hulland et al., 2015). Hand-washing with soap after defecation and
before eating is actively being promoted. However, this can be redundant if water is not accessible
when needed. Moreover, a significant proportion of (male, older, and rural) Indians are noted to
have a preference for defecating in the open even if their household has a toilet, indicating that
constructing toilets does not solve the problem of open defecation (Coffey et al., 2014).

Solid waste management in India’s cities is also a major challenge for public health. In Chennai,
like most Indian cities, residents of even affluent areas complain of poor waste management
services, with street dumpsters regularly overflowing. A study by a local non-governmental
organization found that in Ward 173 where this service has been privatized, only 20 percent of
households reported that door-to-door collection of waste was in place, and only one slum area in
eight is provided some services. In the absence of such basic services, households resort to
dumping waste on the streets and in waterways. Interlinked with these challenges are also concerns
about the training and capacity building of street cleaners, and engaging informal waste workers
in a sustainable manner.

Problems of management and coordination appear to be the main challenge for service provision
as compared with concerns around willingness to pay or affordability (World Bank, 2012; World
Bank, 2013). Coordination across agencies is a challenge for public health purposes since the
mandate cuts across so many agencies, while citizens are often not organized in making demands
on these issues. Similarly, politicians may not appreciate the health benefits of sanitation and the
associated negative externalities of poor sanitation (Ban, Gupta and Rao, 2010). A number of
agencies including municipal boards, public health engineering departments, and directorates of
health and family welfare, may conduct tests of water quality. However, their findings and
procedures are seldom shared with the public and they are often reticent about sharing data.
(Satapathy, 2014) Similarly, local government officials in Chennai cite instances where it has been
difficult to coordinate with Chennai Metrowater on permissions for road repair, and suggest that
most coordination happens informally between ward level engineers of the different agencies.

Raising revenue is a challenge. A study of 23 cities found that none met their revenue potential
and many failed to cover up to 80 percent of their operational costs particularly because of
inefficient operational practices, but also since tariffs in Indian cities tend to be far lower than
operational costs let alone capital costs. (Gupta, 2011) Consumption subsidies are common but
they generally benefit households who consume more water, and do not confer any benefit on poor
households with shared connections. In Chennai, a city that has been considerably innovative on
the supply-side with desalination plants, 35 only about 5 percent of domestic connections were

The Public Health Engineering Department provides water for 80 percent of Greater Shillong.
Within the Shillong municipal area, water is provided to the Municipal Board, and for the rest of
Shillong it is generally provided to the local durbars, and these durbars generally charge
households for services (water is then piped or provided from public taps). The Shillong Municipal
Board has a liability of Rs 380 million (US$ 5.8 million) to the Public Health Engineering
Department but plans to meter the water supply to all users by 2016 in order to improve revenue.
The local Durbars generally charge households for water supplies.
