    	SUMMARY



       This report is an assessment of the overall effects of infoDev’s mobile application labs
       (mLabs). mLabs are specialized mobile business incubation and acceleration facilities
       offering physical workspace, mentoring and coaching, devices for mobile application
       testing, training, and startup competitions. mLabs were designed as pilot projects
       under the Creating Sustainable Businesses in the Knowledge Economy (CSBKE)1
       program and have since become part of infoDev’s Mobile Innovation Program.2

       13 · In order to address the questions: What difference did mLabs make? and What would have happened if the mLab had not been in place?, it was attempted to
       compare reports from client entrepreneurs with those from entrepreneurs that did not use mLab services. In other words, the assessment made a “best effort”
       to incorporate a counterfactual, even if only qualitatively, to be able to grasp the difference between overall effects and the unique effects of mLab interventions.
       However, the researchers were not able to construct a large enough, comparable counterfactual group to make claims about mLab’s effects on startup creation
       and development. Instead, the interviews from the counterfactual group were used to corroborate findings on mLabs’ effects on entrepreneurial ecosystems.
       Therefore, the assessment overall mainly draws on qualitative statements made by client entrepreneurs and other stakeholders (summarizing their judgments
       whether mLabs made a difference), and the counter-factual will not be referred to explicitly in the assessment.

       The three mLabs covered in this assessment interact with idiosyncratic
       local entrepreneurial ecosystems, with consequences for a given mLab’s
       strategy, business model, and results. This chapter outlines the local
       specificities of entrepreneurial ecosystems and outlines each mLab’s
       positioning within them. In this way, the chapter constitutes the analytical
       backdrop for the ensuing analysis in chapter 515. In this section, a brief
       paragraph will outline the ecosystem of each country, followed by a
       snapshot of the respective mLab’s role in it.

In this endeavor, mLab ECA has benefited from the support
and contact brokerage of its mother organization, Enterprise
Incubator Foundation (EIF). It has also connected and
complemented existing ICT developer training facilities,
reached out to the few established startups, and started to
support the local innovator community through events and
competitions (see figure 2 and table 4).

        creation of an increasing number of new startups                                       graduated from mLab East Africa were also active

                 18 · This statement refers only to the incubated startups and not to all the startups created with support of mLab services. “Active” is defined as
                 at least one founder still refining the startup’s business model and working toward the commercialization or expansion of the startup’s mobile
                 application product. In Kenya, the startups graduated from the incubation program (all of them active) were 10 out of the 50 shown in the graph.
                 19 · Startup creation figures are derived primarily from reporting by mLab managers. Managers were instructed to only count businesses that
                 have formally registered. It should be noted that the burdens of registering a business vary substantially across the three countries analyzed, which
                 makes benchmarking difficult. In internal reporting, infoDev also used the measure of “solid startup teams” to account for stable startup projects
                 that avoid registering as a business. See the Business Model Evaluation for high-level results for each mLab, available at http://www.infodev.org/

                 20 · The fact they are all active is not an ultimate indicator of success as it is still quite early to judge whether they are sustainable/growing businesses.

    The figure for startup creation for mLab East Africa
    was much higher during the third year of operation
    as it includes not only startups participating in the
    incubation program18 but also startups that were
    created during the Pivot East competition. Conversely,
    mLab ECA and mLab Southern Africa figures include
    startups participating in the incubation program only.

     High quality job22 creation has been increasing among startups
     supported by the three mLabs as well. Albeit absolute numbers
     of direct jobs created by mLab-supported startups should not
     be expected to go into the hundreds, this significant growth
     hints at a considerable potential that mLabs can stimulate the
     creation of numerous high quality jobs. Future studies could
     also examine indirect job creation, for instance, in sectors that
     startups draw on, such as business consulting, accounting,
     design, various parts of the creative industry, or industries

                             impacts from the usage of the mobile applications and software developed by
                             entrepreneurs at mLabs?”23




     Key Findings
     	
     • Nearly 10 percent (29) of a total 292 mobile applications were identified to have actual or potential development
       impact. (This sample includes applications not yet launched to market.)

     • The percentage is relatively low for three reasons: (1) the criteria for inclusion of applications in the sample were
       based on a narrow definition of development impact, focusing on a contribution to MDGs, BoP users, or
       transformative potential; (2) the generation of social and environmental impact is not a precondition to access mLab
       support; (3) at least in the short-term, startups prioritize revenue generation over development impact.

     • Two factors limited the depth of observed development impact: (1) some applications were operational but had not
       yet been launched to the market; (2) even when applications had already been launched, the time span elapsed since
      launch was mostly very short.

     • The identified applications addressed relevant national challenges and offered practical solutions in the areas of
       education, health, financial inclusion, agriculture, employment, environment, mobility, and information technology.

     • Developers and entrepreneurs supported by mLab East Africa generated the largest number of applications in
      comparison to the other mLabs. This mainly resulted from to the expansive strategy adopted by the mLab in promoting
      startup creation. Services such as training programs or competitions (in addition to incubation) tend to generate much
      larger numbers of mobile applications and prototypes, even if this does not speak to the quality and sustainability of
      these products.

     • Within the identified applications with actual or potential development impact, there were a few significant success
      stories, several companies with satisfactory effects, and a majority of applications still in the pilot stages (that is, they
      are undergoing testing and readjustments previous to a fully fledged launch). The latter group of applications has not
       yet succeeded in the market but have potential for development impact in months and years to come.

     • Overall, prospects for wider impact are promising given the high relevance of the problems that the identified mobile
       applications intend to address as well as the high appropriateness of the proposed solutions.




              23 · The answer to the question has taken into account not only mobile applications developed by mLab incubatees but also applications created

FACTS
600,000 people use the app in the Western Cape Metrorail.
450,000 app downloads with a monthly growth rate of 10-15 percent.
90 percent of users reported using the service at least once a week, pointing to the popularity of the app.
The number of GoMetro users after only the first 30 days was 19,159.



EVIDENCE OF IMPACT
To date the application has collected more than 10,000 customer complaints and suggestions
(about 800 complaints per month), which has helped Metrorail to improve its operations.
According to GoMetro, Metrorail responded to each of these complaints and sought to resolve
them. GoMetro has also received 1,150 crime tipoffs through its CrimeLine service.



ESTIMATES OF IMPACT
Before the rollout of GoMetro, Metrorail services were characterized by cancellations and
schedule fluctuations combined with the lack of real-time, consumer-facing information, leaving
consumers with uncertainty and strongly affecting their daily activities. Metrorail was perceived
as an organization with an indifferent attitude to customers, a problem exacerbated by insufficient
communication and misinformation, not allowing users to make alternative arrangements to get
to work, school, and home on time.

Since the launch of GoMetro, the situation has improved significantly. According to GoMetro,
information gaps have been limited substantially: Metrorail keeps users informed through the
app, making the commuter experience less of a hassle. GoMetro aims to give commuters a voice
through a built-in feedback service, creating a feedback loop that improves the quality of service.

The application has helped close the information gap between public service providers and
the consumer in emerging markets—a major problem, especially in the transportation sector.
GoMetro provides commuters with accurate information to plan their daily activities, which makes
Metrorail a more convenient means to commute and results in improved time management for
users. No clear estimates are available on the economic benefit generated through time saved
for users, but given the depth of the problem before the app launched and GoMetro’s large user
base, the impact is likely to be substantial.

              EVIDENCE OF IMPACT43
               Students using ENEZA have increased their exam scores more than the average student in nearly
               every subject, by an average of 5 percent overall.
               80 percent of students in schools were found to study more when using ENEZA.
               67 percent of ENEZA students were found to study more than four hours after school per day
               compared to 55 percent of students who are not on ENEZA.
               Schools using ENEZA feature a 15 percent increase of the Kenya Certificate of Primary School
               scores of schools with high use of ENEZA.



              ESTIMATES OF IMPACT
               33,000 students are likely to increase their grades in all subjects and 700 schools are likely to
               increase their Kenya Certificate of Primary School scores by 15 percent on average.

               700 schools and 33,000 students equal coverage of 2.68 percent of schools and 0.35 percent of
               students in the country, which is significant for a single mobile application.

               ENEZA users are not evenly spread around the country; they are concentrated in slum schools,
               Daadab Refugee camps, and in primary schools of rural areas in Northeastern region of Kenya—
               areas where the poverty incidence is particularly high—for instance, in the Northeastern region,
               55 percent of poor girls and 43 percent of poor boys have never been to school. Therefore, the
               likely impact on poverty alleviation is even higher.

               Enrolment, retention, completion, and progression rates are a major challenge and a concern
               of the MDG on education for Kenya. The percentage of repeaters in primary school stands at a 6
               percent and 65 percent of students abandon after primary school. In this context, ENEZA offers
               a tool that prompts students to study more and could help reduce the incidence of drop-outs and
               repeaters in cases where these are due to insufficient studying.

     Mobile money is seen as transformational for financial inclusion, which gains in importance
     given that exclusion from the formal financial system has been identified as a major barrier
     to a world without poverty.50. Large segments of the population in developing countries have
     traditionally been excluded from basic financial services, such as depositing, withdrawing,
     and transferring money easily, because they simply did not have a bank account. In Kenya,
     several applications supported by the mLab have focused on financial inclusion for both people
     and businesses.



     48 · In Kenya, two-thirds of the population depends on the crops they grow and the animals they keep for their livelihoods and survival.
     49 · For the estimate, it was assumed that the travel costs of a farmer coming from a village three to five hours from Nairobi would be between KSh600 to KSh1000 Kenyan
     Shillings (return ticket), in a context where smallholder farmers earn a daily income of KSh200 to KSh400. With mKulimaBima, farmers pay KSh10 to send the SMS and
     save the time and cost of travel. Assuming that one farmer processes one claim per year and that the process takes her/him three days (in which her/his opportunity
     cost is KSh1,200), and the travel cost is KSh800, she/he could save an average of KSh2,000, which is the equivalent to between 5 and 10 income days (7.5 on average).

58 · One lamp is sold at KSh600 at a 10 percent commission for the microworker, for a gain of KSh60. Each microworker can have 100 lamps to sell in one region, which
means a gain of KSh6,000 (half of the minimum monthly income wage). The average cost for households spending on kerosene for lightning purposes is KSh500 per month.
Alternatively, buying a solar lamp costs KSh600. Solar lamps are long-lasting items and therefore this entails substantial cost-savings.                                51

                             This section answers the third research question: “What have been the effects
                             of mLabs on the entrepreneurial ecosystem?” While this type of effect was not

                             revealed that mLabs contribute to a range of effects on entrepreneurial ecosystems.

                  Key Findings
                  	
                  • mLabs have supported local talent pools and early- and very early- stage innovators. This has increased
                      possibilities for young developers and entrepreneurs to initiate startups and to grow them into successful
                      companies.

                  • Three main factors are at the heart of this contribution: the broadening of the pool of startup teams and
                    early stage startups; the strengthening of the human resource base of the ecosystem; and multiplier
                    effects in the transfer of knowledge.




     One of the most tangible outcome contributions
     of mLabs in all three countries is that they have
     helped talent development and early stage
     innovators that otherwise would not be served by
     the ecosystem. They have done so by providing
     entry channels and capacity to young developers
     and entrepreneurs, thereby increasing the
     likelihood of startup creation in the mid- to
     long-term: more people entering the ecosystem,
     with more capacity and with incentives to create
     and develop startups. All in all, this means
     that the possibilities for young developers and
     entrepreneurs to initiate startups and to grow
     them into successful companies have been
     enhanced.

     There are three factors that are at the heart of
     the contribution of mLabs to their enhancement
     of local talent pools and support of early stage
     innovators:
     1) mLabs have broadened the pool of startup
     teams and early stage startups.
     2) mLabs have strengthened the human resource
     base of entrepreneurial ecosystems through
     training, workshops, and event-based skill-
     building.
     3) mLabs have generated multiplier effects in
     the transfer of knowledge from incubatees and
     other supported entrepreneurs to other early-
     stage innovators.

                   BOX 4: CREATING INCENTIVES AND CHANNELS FOR STARTUP
                   CREATION AND DEVELOPMENT THROUGH EVENTS AND COMPETITIONS

           Events and competitions by mLabs have been a channel for developers to get interested in
           entrepreneurship and move into startups. The immediate objective for the majority of events and
           competitions is not startup creation, but rather to spur mobile product innovation and engage
           participants in competitive exposure. Yet, even if startup creation was more of a long-term rather than
           an immediate goal, it occurred in several cases.

           The five teams generating revenues within mLab ECA at the time of this assessment were all formed
           at hackathons and competitions. Such events have not only contributed to the creation of startups but
           also to their evolution. For example, the idea of the Gardener Application (Nako Games) was generated
           in a hackathon before a revenue model was developed in the mLab. The startup Nako Games was then
           incorporated and incubated at the mLab and is today on the path toward becoming a promising game
           application development company.

           In Kenya, a large number of young innovators are already seeing technology, including mobile and web
           based applications, as a way to make a living. 88mph, a well-known accelerator in Nairobi, received
           around 400 applications during their last program round in 2012, a number that would have been
           unthinkable a few years ago. As a reason for this change, mLab East Africa’s Pivot East competition
           is widely considered to be a major driving force, complementing universities’ efforts and the buzz
           prompted by the iHub. Data from a recent evaluation conducted by the University of Nairobi revealed
           that a number of Pivot East winners continued and grew their startup with the help of the mLab’s
           incubation program, and also 80 percent of interviewed past participants who did not join the incubation
           program were still in business (as of June 2013), with the great majority of them (90 percent) feeling
           that their business was growing.

           For mLab Southern Africa, there is anecdotal evidence that competitions have led to the creation of
           startups. An example is the case of MFactory. The founder joined the mLab based on his participation
           in a hackathon and has now created a successful service company. The same is true for GoMetro and
           Aftarobot, which joined the mLab having been selected as winning teams of the Gauteng Innovation
           Challenge 2012 (see section 5.2 for more information).
                                                                                                                      57

        2. Strengthening the Human Resource Base in the Ecosystem

         mLabs have particularly focused on providing skills,       such as workshops, mentorship, working spaces, and
         meaning they have strengthened the human resource          testing facilities, assisting developers to evolve into
         base in the ecosystem, making it larger, more inclusive,   startups and helping early stage startups to further

         Moreover, core incubation services have offered assets     and entrepreneurs.

3. Generating Multiplier Effects in the Transfer of Knowledge

The mLab pilot experiences have revealed that mLabs are also able to generate multiplicative knowledge
flows where expertise acquired by startups and entrepreneurs during mLab support programs feeds back
into the startup ecosystem at large.

Community building initiatives have been a core

              Community building, including competitions and events, has been referred to several times
              throughout the report. The reason is that hackathons, competitions, and innovation challenges are
              a main factor contributing to more than one outcome. Community building has been mentioned as:

              1) A mechanism that creates incentives and channels for startup creation and development
              2) A means to strengthen the ecosystem’s human resource base
              3) As a core element enabling mLabs to promote innovation within the ecosystem, and in particular,
              as a factor that increases the profile of innovation in the ecosystem and generates inspirational effects
              that lead to further innovation.

     East Africa is much larger than for mLab ECA
     and mLab Southern Africa. This appears to be the
     result of the expansive strategy adopted by mLab
     East Africa, promoting startup creation and growth
     largely via training programs and competitions
     (in addition to the incubation program), which
     have many participants and lead to application
     development as immediate outcomes.

     Among the 29 applications analyzed, there were a
     few significant success stories, several companies
     generated satisfactory effects, and a majority of
     applications were still in pilot stages. The latter
     were found to not yet have succeeded in the market
     but to feature some potential for development
     impact. The fact that applications have not yet been
     launched in some cases, and the short time span
     elapsed since the applications were developed and
     launched in other cases, has led to limited depth of
     development impact observed to date.

     In Kenya, direct development impact could be
     observed for some mLab-supported mobile
     applications that, for instance, improved users’
     access to fundamental services, such as health,
     education, and financial services. In South Africa,
     three applications are generating positive impact
     on mobility and employment opportunities, and
     another two are raising awareness on crucial
     problems, such as gender violence and child abuse.
     In Armenia, applications are at a more incipient
     stage and only potential impact could be considered.

     Second, mLabs have shown ability to foster the
     generation of mobile applications that in themselves
     have development impact; however, this ability has
     not yet materialized to its full extent as the lion’s
     share of relevant applications are still in the pilot and
     testing stages. Moreover, through such activities
     as innovation competitions, hackathons, and
     training programs, mLabs support the generation
     of applications only at initial development stages
     (except for applications developed in the context
     of longer-running incubation programs). Only
     once these applications surpass testing and are
     launched to a wider marketplace can they generate
     more substantial impact. Yet, neither mLabs nor
     infoDev are providing substantial support for most
     applications in that critical transitional phase, which
     is ultimately a precondition to further increase the
     commercialization rate of applications that have
     the potential for significant development impact—
     one of the original objectives not yet achieved in
     full. Targeted commercialization support to socially
     and environmentally beneficial applications would
     offer infoDev the possibility of reaching further
     beyond its original goals.
