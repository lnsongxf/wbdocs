Government leadership
The assessment of the Infrastructure and Social Services (IS) component has been conducted
under the leadership of the GoU. At the central level, the Ministry of Regional Development, Con-
struction, Housing and Communal Services, and the Ministry of Infrastructure have been the pri-
mary counterparts for this component of the RPA. In addition, designated sector focal points from
other ministries assisted in the provision of damage- and needs-related data. The Ministry of
Regional Development, Construction, Housing and Communal Services also facilitated data col-
lection through oblast and raion administrations. All of these government agencies have played a
critical role in providing damage data and contributing perspectives on the associated recovery
strategies and needs.

This report must not be seen as a definitive end to the process of damage and needs assessment,
but more as the beginning of a “continuous process and mode of assessment.” Some sectors—such
as housing, transport,2 and environment in particular—require more work due to the present
unavailability of full damage data, particularly in areas under active conflict. Given the unpredict-
ability and uncertainty of the situation in some parts of the crisis-affected region, this assessment
will need updating as conditions evolve. This may require incorporating the data template and
analysis methodology employed for this assessment into the government’s preexisting systems.
Such institutionalization of this data collection and recovery planning approach will help cre-
ate a temporal, sectoral, and geographical “damage and needs database” comprised of actionable
and comparable information. This will contribute toward more systematized and “time-sliced”
recovery planning to meet the unprecedented challenges and requirements posed by an ongoing
conflict. RPA partners aim to continue providing active technical support to the government in
this effort.

Significance and role of IS delivery toward crisis recovery
Component objectives: The key objectives of the IS component are to: (i) characterize and esti-
mate the impact of the crisis on the physical infrastructure and associated social services of the
affected regions; and (ii) propose preliminary strategic options and scenarios for the restoration
and recovery of infrastructure and service delivery. Within the framework of these strategic op-
tions and the guiding policies laid out by the government, IS subsector teams have also attempted
to identify, quantify, and cost the corresponding transitional recovery needs. While this chapter
summarizes the crisis impact and recovery needs in all IS subsectors, more detailed analysis and
tabular data may be found in the respective sector annexes.

Ukraine Recovery and Peacebuilding Assessment
Analysis of Crisis Impacts and Needs in Eastern Ukraine         6
Contribution toward RPA goals: The sustainable restoration and improvement of IS holds the key
to societal normalization and stabilization in the crisis-affected areas, as well as to creating condi-
tions for eventual IDP returns. Efficient and effective recovery of infrastructure and service deliv-
ery will not only help ameliorate the suffering of the affected populations, but substantively cata-
lyze the restoration of citizen trust in the state. Hence paying immediate attention to addressing
critical service delivery disruptions and shortcomings caused by the conflict is not a choice but an
imperative. For example, immediate energy sector recovery is necessary to avoid the potentially
devastating impacts of inaction on the affected population during winter.3 Similarly, the loss of
tertiary health-care facilities puts the populations in government-controlled areas of Donetsk and
Luhansk at severe risk.4

In addition to the “brick-and-mortar” damage to infrastructure, the loss of equipment, the exodus
of employees, and a drop in staff capacity in the directly affected regions are other challenges that
need to be addressed. Ensuring satisfactory provision of social services in indirectly affected ar-
eas is further complicated by the influx of displaced populations. For example, preschools are fast
approaching enrollment capacity, the road network is suffering from increased usage, and sewage
systems need to handle increased loads due to a steady influx of IDPs in various raions.

Relationship with other RPA components
Linkages with social cohesion and economic recovery components: IS encompasses a broad
swath of public life. A reliable energy supply powers public, private, and government operations,
helps educational institutions function, frees caretakers (mostly women) to seek employment,
and allows transport networks to become the arteries of a healthy economy. As such, this com-
ponent has multiple linkages with the social cohesion and economic recovery components of the
RPA. For example, the rehabilitation and reconstruction of damaged infrastructure will provide
opportunities to introduce labor-intensive construction technologies. This could link well with
Component 2 priorities for jump-starting local employment, particularly in the case of subdistrict
and community infrastructure. Similarly, the equitable, consistent, and harmonious provision of
basic services across host and IDP populations will improve social cohesion and protection of
vulnerable groups (Component 3). Inclusive recovery planning based on a culture of consensual
decision making, within and across host and IDP communities, will further help restore citizen
trust in the state and thus contribute to longer-term peacebuilding objectives.

Assessment methodology and outputs
Use of improvised, locally adapted, and context-specific methodology: The methodology devel-
oped for this assessment brings together a blend of post-conflict and postdisaster needs assess-
ment tools and builds upon local knowledge and national systems for damage characterization,
classification, and quantification. Key outputs for each IS subsector include: (i) quantitative es-
timate of physical damages; (ii) characterization and quantification of impacts of the crisis on
associated service delivery; (iii) subsector strategy for transitional recovery; (iv) quantification
and costing of the corresponding recovery needs, including for returnees and IDP inflows; and (v)
proposed institutional and performance management arrangements for recovery.

                                                                   7                                           FULL COMPONENT REPORTS
Damage and impact classification: The impact of the conflict on each subsector has been evaluat-
ed in terms of direct damage and recovery costs. Direct damage refers to the monetary value of re-
placing completely or partially destroyed assets and movable assets like goods, furniture, machin-
eries, and inventories. Indirect losses have not been the emphasis of this assessment. However in
specific instances where private sector losses were particularly relevant, such as in the electricity
and transport sectors, these have also been factored in for needs assessment but not reported
separately. Importantly though, impact analysis has factored in the decline in service delivery in
the directly affected areas and taken stock of the additional burden on services in areas hosting
IDPs. It must also be noted that facilities lost to separatist control are currently not included or
quantified in the damage estimates. However, the determination of needs includes those arising
out of the unavailability of these facilities to people residing in government-controlled areas. A
primary example of this is the tertiary health-care network that fell into separatist-held areas and
for which the health sector assessment proposes providing alternative arrangements over the
next two years.

Classification and quantification of recovery needs: Recovery needs are the costs of recommend-
ed interventions that include the reconstruction and rehabilitation of damaged and destroyed
infrastructure and equipment. These costs have been calculated using the replacement value of
assets and infrastructure, plus additional differentials for the process known as Building Back
Better and Smarter (BBBS). Recovery needs also include capacity building and operational costs
that are necessary for the implementation of interventions over the next two years to bring stabil-
ity to affected areas.

Data collection and validation: The key source of information for damage and needs estimation
has been data compiled by the Ministry of Regional Development, Construction, Housing and
Communal Services. This data, last updated on November 10–11, 2014, accounts for the bulk of
damages to infrastructure and equipment. This was supplemented by independent secondary

data collection by the RPA team. To this end, customized templates were developed for each sec-
tor and distributed through the Ministry of Regional Development, Construction, Housing and
Communal Services to oblast and raion administrations. In the case of the electricity and trans-
port sectors, data was also collected by contacting private sector service providers. Data valida-
tion techniques included field inspection visits, interviews with relevant stakeholders such as
civil society, and desk reviews. Further validation of data was performed using process verifica-
tion techniques, empirical plausibility checks, and other analytical tools. Due to time constraints
and lack of gender-disaggregated data in infrastructure sector prior to conflict, data in the report
are mostly not segregated by gender. But when collecting new data, it is highly encouraged to seg-
regate them by age and gender.

Key assumptions, constraints, and limitations
Sectoral scope of assessment: As agreed between the government and RPA partners, the current
scope of the IS component is limited to the following subsectors: energy, transport, water and
sanitation, health, education, social welfare, environment, and housing, municipal services, and
general public buildings.

Geographic scope: The assessment primarily focuses on the directly conflict-affected raions of
the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts that are under government control. In addition and where pos-
sible, the other raions under government control in the Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts, termed as
indirectly affected areas, have been included on a more selective, sector-to-sector basis. Finally,


                                                                                              Volume II:
                                                   9                             FULL COMPONENT REPORTS
some adjoining oblasts that are hosting IDPs and have as a result experienced additional strain on
service provision and livelihood opportunities have also been included where possible.

Administrative and temporal scope: The assessment primarily focuses on crisis impacts and re-
covery related to public sector assets, with the exception of some sectors such as energy, where
private sector-run public services have also been included. Since the private sector is providing
vital public services like electricity, heating, and gas supply, the government may want to subse-
quently consider private-sector facilitation measures based on practices adopted for crisis recov-
ery in other parts of the world.

Where possible, the analysis of damages and needs is disaggregated at a raion level and collated at
the oblast level. The assessment takes stock of damages and impacts created by the crisis since it
began in spring 2014, with a cutoff date of the end of November 2014, for analytic purposes. This
is notwithstanding should the conflict continue to evolve and the associated damages and needs
continue to accrue. Hence there would be a need to take a “ring-binder” approach to periodically
update the damage and needs analysis at agreed intervals, or on a needs basis.

      2. OVERVIEW OF PRECRISIS CONDITIONS
          OF IS IN THE AFFECTED REGIONS

Introduction: This section provides a consolidated overview of subsector characteristics and con-
ditions prevalent in the affected regions prior to the crisis. This is important in order to con-
textualize and frame sector damages and needs relative to precrisis sector conditions. For each
subsector, such baseline conditions include: (i) a brief profile of the subsector; (ii) an inventory of
infrastructure assets; (iii) status of service delivery; (iv) costs of service delivery, and; (v) sector
developmental challenges.

Education: The state is the main provider of education services, and with changing demographics
and fiscal scenarios, the education sector is in acute need of quality and service delivery reform.
Meanwhile, the correlation of poverty with childbearing puts particular pressure on the educa-
tion sector, as households with children tend to be poorer than those without, and are most in
need of accessible provision of education. The groups most at risk of poverty in Ukraine are fami-
lies with three or more children, and those with children under the age of three, persons with
disabilities, newly displaced persons, households comprised of retired persons, and single-parent
households (most of which are led by women). Thus it is expected that a disruption to educational
services will have a particularly negative impact on poorer households and marginalized groups.

Health: Ukraine inherited its health system from the Soviet Union era and no major reforms have
been undertaken in this sector since independence in 1991.The system is generally regarded as
in need of major improvement, by virtue of being fragmented and input based, with an excessive
focus on infrastructure. This has resulted in health outcomes that are among the lowest in the
European region. Inefficient precrisis health services delivery infrastructure (polyclinics, hospi-
tals, and so on), including human resources, accounted for a major share of all public resources
allocated to the health sector. This left little or no funds for improvement in the quality of services,
and the implementation of modern models of care. As a result, even the current number of 2,000
health-care facilities does not necessarily correspond with health-care capacity commensurate
with existing and emerging needs.

Health services are delivered through primary, secondary, tertiary, and highly specialized health-
care facilities. Most health facilities are under the direct supervision of the Ministry of Health
(MoH). Highly specialized and tertiary care services are mostly if not always placed at the central
oblast level, while secondary and primary levels of services are concentrated in cities. This has
resulted in low, uneven, and inequitable geographical coverage of health services in rural areas,
particularly so in more remote settlements and villages.

Energy: Major strategic shifts are currently being contemplated for the country’s energy sector,
including heat supply, in alignment with Ukraine’s international commitments. A new draft En-
ergy Strategy of Ukraine provides (i) short-term interventions to deal with the crisis, (ii) mid-
term interventions targeting some energy sectors, and (iii) long-term strategies that will take into
consideration world trends. A draft National Action Plan until 2020 focuses on an effective use of
biofuel for heat production, among other goals. The draft National Emergency Plan in the energy
sector for Autumn–Winter 2014–2015 has been developed to deal with the current crisis. The
plan identified major threats to heat production facilities (boiler houses and thermal plants) that

provide heat and hot water to socially important facilities and the general population.

•	 Electricity: Donetsk region is the largest industrial region of Ukraine, accounting for about
   18 percent of both its industrial production and national exports. The Luhansk oblast also
   has significant economic potential and is among the five largest industrial and economic re-
   gions of Ukraine. Its share in the total national gross added value was 4.5 percent. The Donbas
   power sector was built to meet the needs of this industrial community along with some of the
   largest concentrations of domestic consumers in Ukraine. The main power generators in the
   Donbas regional system are thermal power stations with total installed capacity of 10,977
   MW.
•	 District heating: The Ukrainian heat supply sector is characterized by many problems, includ-
   ing the current tariff-setting policy; monopoly of the suppliers; lack of proper metering, ac-
   counting, and market mechanisms for communal services provision; lack of penalties for non-
   payment of bills by consumers; and the high depreciation of facilities and energy-generating
   equipment. The sector suffers from low efficiency. Major reasons for this include: (i) high
   levels of energy wastage; (ii) a deficient system of accounting for heat energy; (iii) lack of
   incentives to support energy efficiency; (iv) the current steam heating system’s inability to
   regulate final consumption; and (v) absence of market mechanisms.
•	 Oil and gas sector: This sector is characterized by a low level of energy security due to the
   sheer lack of its own resources in Ukraine, high levels of imports, and the absence of source
   diversification for such imports. The government has carried out work to diversify imports of
   natural gas from Slovakia, Hungary, and Poland. The sector has a number of systemic prob-
   lems, including high debt, low rate of sector reform (including reformation of the National
   Joint Stock Company), as well as problems of natural gas consumption inherent in the munici-
   pal sector.

Environment: Donbas is considered to be one of the most polluted regions in Ukraine and the
former Soviet Union. Significant environmental liabilities have accumulated from an almost 200-
year history of intensive coal mining, combined with a substantial industrial fleet of metallurgical,
chemical, power, and heavy engineering industries. As the industrial heartland of Ukraine, Donbas
is estimated to host about 900 large industrial plants, including 140 collieries, 40 metallurgical
plants, 7 thermal power stations, and 177 chemically dangerous operations, including 113 opera-
tions that use radioactive materials. Environmentally, the most harmful industry is mining, which
comprises 248 mines, many of which are run-down and nonfunctioning. In addition, the region is
also traversed by 1,230 kilometers of oil, gas, and ammonia pipelines. By 2002, an estimated 10
billion tons of industrial waste had accumulated in Donbas, equivalent to a total of 320,000 tons
per square kilometer.

Donbas also possesses significant natural assets—including open steppe grasslands, forests, and
secluded streams—which are prized areas of recreation and leisure for the local population living
in a highly stressed environment. The state environmental protection departments under Donetsk
and Luhansk oblast administrations are responsible for overseeing the region’s environment and
the rational use of its natural resources. Their duties include issuing permits for the emission of
harmful substances into the atmosphere, special use of natural resources, waste disposal, and
land allocation approvals. They are also mandated to report on the state of the environment and
to carry out environmental education and awareness campaigns.

Housing: Housing and the country’s communal economy have not been significantly altered by
post-Soviet market reforms. These continue to operate based on inefficient institutional models

and economic relations developed during the Soviet era. Adopted five years ago, the National
Program of Reforming and Development of Housing and Communal Economy in 2009–2014 and
other interventions have failed to improve the situation, especially in multi-apartment housing.

Critical issues facing the housing sector include: (i) lack of clarity among residents on “effective
ownership” in multi-apartment housing; (ii) lack of a market for good quality housing services;
(iii) the need for capital repairs and modernization of deteriorated multi-apartment residential
housing;5 (iv) the need for increased energy efficiency in multi-apartment houses; (v) poor access
to credit resources; and (vi) inadequate legal documentation and norms to regulate transactions
between house owners, service providers, public sector, and business and financial institutions.

Transport

•	 Road network: This sector is of key importance to the Ukrainian economy and has a share of
   more than 11 percent of the GDP. While transport in the country continues to rely strongly
   on rail and pipeline for heavy freight and long haulage, road transport demand has grown
   steadily for the past several decades and is expected to continue to rise in the coming years.
   Insufficient budget allocation to maintain and develop roads for the past decade has resulted
   in significant deterioration of the network,6 affecting average speeds and increasing transport
   costs. Besides chronic underfunding of the road network, the road sector faces organizational
   and governance issues that affect its ability to deliver and manage a high quality road net-
   work.		
•	 Rail network: Rail transport is a leading industry of the country’s transport sector, accounting
   for 82 percent of the overall freight and almost 50 percent of passenger traffic. Donetsk Rail-
   ways7 serves a population of approximately 8.5 million people and is the largest in Ukraine
   in terms of freight transportation. It is the main form of transportation for more than 3,000
   industries in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions including coal mines, iron and steel, engineer-
   ing and machine tool factories, processing plants and chemical companies, and more.
•	 Air transport: The Donetsk and Luhansk airports are the two major airports in the Donbas re-
   gion, each under the administrative control of its respective oblast. The Donetsk International
   Airport was the most modern and one of the three largest airports in Ukraine. With a 1-meter
   thick concrete runway that is 4,000 meters long and 60 meters wide, and with state-of-the-art
   equipment, it could accept all types of aircraft with almost zero visibility under any weather.
   The Luhansk International Airport underwent capacity improvements in 2005–2006 and is
   also now able to receive various types of modern planes.

Social Welfare

•	 Pensions: Donetsk oblast, being the largest region of Ukraine, had the highest number (1.4 mil-
   lion) of pensioners before the outbreak of conflict. In Luhansk region, there were more than
   730,000 pensioners. In total, at the start of 2014, 2.1 million pensioners resided in these two
   regions. Both the Luhansk and Donetsk regions recorded around 320 pensioners per 1,000
   population, compared to a national average of about 300. The average pension in 2014 was
   1,793 UAH and 1,739 UAH in Donetsk and Luhansk respectively; only Kyiv provided higher

      pensions.
•	 The pension system in Donbas has several peculiarities, including: (i) mostly urban settle-
   ments and industrial employment; (ii) relatively high levels of formal employment and higher
   wages, particularly in the form of wage labor at large enterprises; (iii) prevalence of employ-
   ment doing hazardous and heavy work, in recognition of which workers in the region are
   entitled to relatively early retirement;8 and (iv) the highest level of industrial accidents and
   occupational diseases and disabilities in Ukraine. Very importantly, there is an increased risk
   of female pensioners and single households falling into poverty; while women constitute over
   70 percent of overall pensioners, female pension rates are 40 percent less than those of men.
•	 Employment: Key labor market indicators within Donbas have varied little from the national
   average. Slightly higher labor force participation rates (such as employment and unemploy-
   ment) were characteristic of the Donetsk region, and slightly lower labor force participation
   rates were characteristic of the Luhansk region. However, due to deterioration in the business
   and political environment, unemployment rates for the working-age population reached 9.9
   percent in the Donetsk region and 9.3 percent in the Luhansk region between January and
   June 2014. IDPs face daunting challenges in finding employment in host communities given
   existing levels of unemployment combined with the high prevalence of female-headed house-
   holds and pensioners within the IDP population.

Water and sanitation: A significant portion of the precrisis water supply and sewerage systems in
the crisis-affected regions were outdated and maintained at minimal operational levels. Decades
of underinvestment and poor maintenance resulted in an asset base that was in dire need of re-
placement and upgrading. Therefore, the system already needed major rehabilitation and mod-
ernization to combat high water losses and sewer infiltration and exfiltration due to increased
leakage of the piping network; this has further added to the deterioration of the system. In many
areas, water supply is intermittent because service providers have inadequately maintained in-
frastructure due to cash flow issues. This has created a vicious cycle whereby financial constraints
limit investments needed to rehabilitate the sector. This in turn causes losses and inefficiencies
within the system that continue to adversely affect the financial situation of water and sanitation
utilities.

                      AND FINDINGS

Introduction and summary of damages and loss
This section provides a summary of the direct and indirect impacts of the conflict in the various
subsectors assessed. Impact on physical infrastructure and associated ability to provide social
services can be divided into three broad categories: (i) damages caused by intensive fighting and
artillery usage around key facilities; (ii) the loss of facilities to antigovernment armed groups; and
(iii) damages to service provision and supply infrastructure that prevents services from reaching
the affected population.

Sector damage summaries
Education (US$4.86 million): Intensive shelling and fighting caused significant infrastructure
damages and prolonged periods of disruption in educational service delivery. Data from the Min-
istry of Education and Science indicates that a total of 126 facilities in areas currently under gov-
ernment control have been impacted. Damages have been sustained primarily in the Donetsk
oblast where all 36 impacted preschools are located; 57 primary and secondary schools, 8 vo-
cational schools, 12 higher education facilities, and 15 other educational institutions have been
affected across Luhansk and Donetsk. Many schools have damage to windows, a debilitating issue

high school. Another 5,538 are continu-
ing university studies at new schools. As a result, schools are rapidly reaching enrollment capac-
ity, and with a further influx of IDPs expected, matriculation numbers will need to be increased.
This is particularly true of preschools. In some locations, schools have already resorted to double
sessions and longer hours to accommodate increased numbers of school children in primary and
middle school.9 No significant differences are observed in terms of enrollment of boys and girls in
preschools and schools.

Health (US$6.530 million): The conflict has caused damage to 20 health-care facilities in Donetsk
and Luhansk oblasts under government control. Heavy artillery usage has broken windows and
doors, damaged roofs and walls, and incapacitated utility systems. Three-quarters of these 20
facilities are in the most affected areas of the two oblasts. The most significant of these facilities
is the Donetsk Psychiatric Hospital, which accounts for 80 percent of the damages recorded in
the two oblasts. There has also been loss of infrastructure due to takeover by separatist groups.
Damages to epidemiological control apparatus are estimated at US$0.948 million. In addition, as
of November 2014, all tertiary-level facilities are now located in separatist-controlled areas, leav-
ing the population under government control with no infrastructure for high-level care. Although
this figure is not included in the reported cost of damage, it is reflected in the needs estimate, in
the form of replacement tertiary-level facilities.

The conflict has also impacted health service delivery; state target programs for chronic and acute
diseases are only partially provided. Human resources for health services in the most affected
regions of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts have also been affected; approximately 5 percent of ca-
pacity has been lost. Further strain is expected to be put on service delivery and associated in-
frastructure as the lack of health services in areas outside of government control is expected to
create mass movement to government-controlled territory. Capacities to procure and store medi-
cation have also been impacted; public procurement enterprises in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts
have had to relocate their warehouses elsewhere. Finally, in addition to lost services and infra-
structure, the conflict has also exacerbated the immunization problem that Ukraine was already
facing, with rates plummeting to 30.5 percent for parts of Luhansk.



9  While scientific research institutions have also suffered damages, these have not yet been accounted for in the totals due to lack of
available data at the time of the assessment.

Another prospective issue appears to be a possible rise in gender-based violence due to the con-
flict. Although no data is currently available to the team on physical and sexual violence in the
conflict-affected regions of eastern Ukraine, evidence from other parts of the world suggests that
gender-based violence almost invariably increases in conflict environments. This is a priority is-
sue that is treated extensively in Component 3 of the RPA. Another problem to be further explored
is rates of alcohol and drug abuse in affected areas, especially among male IDPs and ex-combat-
ants.10 Preventative programs and appropriate support and treatment mechanisms are discussed
in Component 3 of the RPA.

Energy (US$52.72 million): The energy sector is critical for the health and well-being of the af-
fected population over this winter and beyond. Primary crisis impacts in this sector include de-
creased production and disruptions in supply in the areas of electricity, coal production, district
heating services, and the oil and gas sector.

Electricity (US$48.01 million in damages)

•	 Power generation: Given its position at the front line of the conflict, Luhansk has absorbed se-
   vere damage to its power generation infrastructure. The Luhansk Thermal Power Plant (TPP)
   is only partially operational as a result of heavy shelling, with damage to the facility totaling
   US$3.82 million. Of the four power generation facilities that service government-controlled
   areas of Donetsk, the Slovyanska TPP suffered the most severe damage. Damages include de-
   struction of all of its overhead transmission lines and main unit transformer, building dam-
   ages, and heavy spillage and combustion of crude oil. Damages to the Slovyanska facility are
   estimated at US$21.74 million.
•	 Power transmission and distribution: The Donetsk oblast is served by three power distribution
   companies, all of which suffered severe infrastructure damage, with substantial lengths of
   power lines partially damaged or fully destroyed. Damages to the Donetsk distribution sys-
   tem and infrastructure are estimated at US$10.38 million. The power distribution company
   in Luhansk suffered similar infrastructure damage totaling US$0.611 million. Damage to trans-
   mission infrastructure in Donetsk is estimated at US$6.4 million, while transmission damages
   in Luhansk are estimated at US$4.6 million. The conflict has caused financial losses to all of
   the power companies in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. Interruption in operation, losses
   due to changes in electricity supply routes, and additional social obligations have decreased
   revenues and increased operating costs. Losses have been heavier in the Luhansk oblast, to-
   taling to US$21.78 million, with a majority of them concentrated in the Luhansk TPP. In Do-
   netsk, losses are estimated at US$2.5 million.
Coal (US$1.27 million in damages): While the conflict has had substantial impact on coal industry
infrastructure, the most prominent result of the hostilities in the Donetsk basin has been the take-
over of coal production facilities and mines by antigovernment armed groups. Only 55.5 percent
of the Donetsk oblast and 3.5 percent of the Luhansk oblast coal 2013 production remains under
government control. Moreover, of the 93 mines (about 60 percent of all the mines) not under
government control, 60 of them are in “life support” mode (mainly pumping water and/or venti-
lation), and 7 mines are completely destroyed. This sharp decline in coal production, along with

disruptions in rail transport that impeded the import of coal has caused an acute fuel shortage.

Within government-controlled areas, the conflict has affected two coal mining companies: SE
Dzerzhynskvugillya in Donetsk oblast and SE Lisichanskvugillya in the Luhansk oblast. SE Lisi-
chanskvugillya sustained the vast majority of the damages, and US$1.15 million has been spent
in emergency repairs and construction. This amount has been included in the damage estimate
for the sector. The conflict has caused financial losses to all the coal production companies in the
Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, including operational interruptions, losses due to disruption of rail
transport, and increased operating costs. Losses have been heavier in Donetsk oblast, totaling
US$18.37 million, with a majority of them resulting from the impeded railway system. In Luhansk,
losses are estimated at US$7.055 million.

District heating (US$1.11 million in damages): In the Donetsk oblast, damages to the heat supply
infrastructure are limited to the cities of Kramatorsk and Slovyansk, totaling US$0.061 million
and US$0.025 million respectively. Slovyansk has seen additional damage to boiler houses and
associated infrastructure of US$0.963 million. In the Luhansk oblast, the infrastructure damage
has been limited to Stanytsya Luhanska and totals US$0.033 million. In Stanytsya Luhanska, other
damages to assets and buildings (including roofs and windows) total US$0.026 million.

Oil and gas sector: (US$2.34 million in damages): The

lines in Luhansk oblast are estimated at US$0.062 million. Furthermore, in the Donetsk oblast,
damages to oil sector infrastructure including main pipelines amounts to US$0.009 million.

Environment: The conflict has exacerbated existing pollution in the Donbas region and caused
further environmental damage and loss.

•	 Environment pollution hotspots: Military action has damaged several environmentally haz-
   ardous sites, posing both immediate concerns and future risks to public health, ecosystems,
   and people’s livelihoods. While the hostilities have hampered accurate data collection, it is
   expected that a relatively large but unknown number of industrial installations and mining
   sites are likely to have been damaged by military operations. This would have created land,
   water, and soil contamination and difficulties for hazardous waste management. It is expected
   that 10–20 mines in the region have been flooded, potentially causing massive environmental
   damage in the region. Other public and industrial hotspots not covered in this phase of the as-
   sessment may have incurred similar impacts. Some hazardous industries located in areas that
   are not under government control may also pose risks to Ukraine-controlled areas.
•	 Environmental services infrastructure: Military operations have also impacted environmental
   infrastructure that provide waste disposal and pollution control services. In addition to infra-
   structure, military action has also caused a decrease in service provision due to lack of staff,
   material inputs, and/or basic operation and maintenance services. In addition to the solid



Ukraine Recovery and Peacebuilding Assessment
Analysis of Crisis Impacts and Needs in Eastern Ukraine   18
   waste collection systems, dedicated waste management facilities are needed for debris waste
   generated from damage to buildings. Evidence also indicates that damage to critical environ-
   mental services infrastructure is concentrated in specific regions. In Donetsk, for example, it
   is reported that waste disposal at the municipal landfill is often interrupted by roadblocks
   that prevent the evacuation of waste. Similarly, the collapse of the sewage system in Slovy-
   ansk is, according to the city’s mayor, causing the release of untreated sewage into the Sukhyi
   Torets river.
•	 Natural resource assets: There has been extensive damage to natural resources, namely for-
   ests and protected areas, steppe grasslands, and cultivated fields, both directly from military
   activity and indirectly from an inability to execute environmental management interventions.
   A satellite-based study estimates that around 2,970 square kilometers equivalent to around
   17 percent of the vegetation cover in the conflict-affected zone is impacted by fire outbreaks.
   In effect, over 3,000 forest fires were reported in the conflict zone in 2014, which is 15 times
   more than those detected during the same period in 2013. Four main causes are cited for
   the increase in fire incidence, namely: (i) shelling and ammunition explosions; (ii) weakened
   capacity of fireguards to detect and suppress the spread of fires; (iii) build-up of dead vegeta-
   tion in forests, which fuels more intense fires due to inadequate forest management interven-
   tions; and (iv) intentional arson. In addition to fire damage, the movement and maneuver-
   ing of heavy military equipment—particularly tanks, bomb craters, building of fortifications,
   excavation of dugouts and tunnels, and laying of landmines—has also damaged important
   landscapes, including within protected areas.
•	 Environmental governance: The rapid erosion of environmental governance is one of the sin-
   gular consequences of the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Most of the government agencies in
   charge of enforcing environmental regulations and managing natural resources, as well as
   environmental data collection and monitoring systems, are now largely dysfunctional and ar-
   chived information has been lost. The State Environmental Inspectorate has suspended its
   legal inspections of enterprises. Both Luhansk and Donetsk environmental and forestry au-
   thorities had to move to other locations and relocate staff, causing significant losses in staff
   and expertise. Work is additionally hampered by damages to office premises, vehicles, and
   equipment of the local environmental government administration. This depreciation of gov-
   ernance capacity is causing a rise in unlawful and environmentally damaging activities, such
   as illegal logging and unprecedented looting of existing timber stocks by armed groups. Un-
   authorized coal mining is also expanding to the larger quarries and turning into a large or-
   ganized business that is known to have connections to criminal networks. Another growing
   issue of concern is that the loss of state control over Ukraine’s eastern borders may lead to
   a proliferation in illegal trafficking of hazardous waste, banned or unregistered pesticides,
   counterfeit chemicals, and ozone-depleting substances. There is an established precedent in
   the region for smuggling hazardous goods, and while there are no statistics on the volume of
   this illicit trade, multiple sources are reporting increased observation of foreign-registered
   chemical products.
Public buildings and housing (US$21.64 million): There are reports that the conflict has damaged
and destroyed many houses and apartments in rural, periurban, and urban areas in the most
affected raions of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. However this damage information has not
been centrally and systematically collected at any level of government. The RPA housing team
was, however, able to collect information limited to the following raions and municipalities: No-
voaidarsky and Slovyansky raions, and municipalities of Severodonetsk, Mariupol, Kramatorsk,
Slovyansk, and Lysychansk (including the adjoining settlements of Novodruzhesk and Pryvillia).



                                                                                              Volume II:
                                                19                               FULL COMPONENT REPORTS
For these areas, 7 multi-apartment residential houses and 266 single-family houses were com-
pletely destroyed and are now uninhabitable. In additional, the structural elements (roofs, walls,
windows) of 429 multi-apartment residential houses and 2,129 single-family houses sustained
damages of various degrees and require urgent repairs. For the purposes of this analysis, overall
housing sector damage is estimated at 15–20 percent of the present replacement value of the
damaged housing and public building stock, while also taking asset depreciation into account.
In addition to the impact already caused by the conflict, the structural elements of the damaged
apartments and houses are deteriorating rapidly, which increases the costs of recovery. In addi-
tion to the structural damage, damage to walls, roofs, and windows is also contributing to heat
loss and is making homes uninhabitable during the winter.

Many families have lost their real estate and currently lack permanent residence. As of November
2014, damage to residential facilities has affected roughly 251 families in Donetsk oblast and
121 families in Luhansk oblast, and 848 individuals in Donetsk oblast and 291 in Luhansk oblast.
This is expected to increase significantly as the conflict continues. Moreover, internally displaced
people (IDPs) cite physical insecurity and the loss of accommodation as the two biggest reasons
they have left their home areas, and suggest that increased security and restoration of homes
constitute basic requirements for their return.

Social welfare (US$2.87 million): A total of 26 facilities in government-controlled territory have
been affected. Of these, 19 are in Donetsk oblast and have an estimated reconstruction cost of
US$0.88 million; 7 are in Luhansk oblast and have an estimated reconstruction cost of US$1.987
million. Damaged facilities include residential and nonresidential care and rehabilitation facilities
for people with disabilities, children, the elderly, and the homeless. These also include adminis-
tration buildings of the pension fund, and social welfare and employment centers.

Transport (US$ 352 million in damages): Damages in the transport sector involve various catego-
ries of roads, railways, bridges, and airport infrastructure. The most extensive and fiscally signifi-
cant of these has been damage to the roads network. In the road sector, damages are the result not
only of intense shelling and other explosives, but also of the use of roads by heavyweight armored
vehicles: 1,100 km of state roads—including 10 bridges, and 235 km of municipal roads—have
been affected. This has resulted in a cumulative US$284 million worth of damages to the roads
network in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. The team has validated the damage reported by the
government using various sources and supporting data12 analyzed by the team. Damages to the
rail network have been caused by shelling and other explosives, many of which have already been
repaired using the railway administration’s own resources. Two substations and two bridges, all
located in Luhansk, however, remain to be repaired. These damages are estimated at US$12.2
million.

Both major airports in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts have been the site of intense conflict and
have sustained severe infrastructure impact. Luhansk airport is not currently under government
control, and consequently, damages have been assessed only for the Donetsk airport. These are
estimated at US$55.4 million.13 The influx of IDPs into Luhansk, Donetsk, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia,



12  Including photographic evidence, analytical reports, and cost details produced by government.
13  For the current assessment, it has not been possible to assess damages to the terminal and runway due to armed ongoing conflict
at the airport premises. Therefore the current estimate of airport subsector damages included in this report pertains only to air traffic
control facilities and radar complexes.

and Dnipropetrovsk has also raised the road network’s maintenance and operating costs. The
increased traffic, coupled with the deterioration of the network’s infrastructure integrity, has
also caused congestion, extending travel time for passenger and freight traffic. This is particularly
acute in places where bridges and major arteries have been affected. The resultant losses in the
roads sector are estimated at US$192.3 million. Infrastructure damages in the railroad network
have forced rail vehicles to take alternative routes, increasing operating and maintenance costs
and transport time. This loss has been exacerbated by a decline in revenues that have resulted
from a reduction in passenger and freight traffic. Total losses in the railways are estimated at
US$269.2 million. A similar reduction in traffic has cased substantial losses in the air transport
sector, totaling US$50 million.

Water and sanitation (US$22.4 million): Armed conflict in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts has se-
riously damaged water, sanitation, and power supply infrastructure, affecting about 4.5 million
people who live in these areas. The total value of damaged infrastructure in Donetsk is estimated
at US$16.77 million, while damages in Luhansk are estimated at US$5.59 million. The water sup-
ply sector has sustained damages to its electrical equipment; pumping equipment; chlorination
systems; piping, water mains, and water tanks; utility bridges, which have collapsed and blocked
flow in main water supply channels; water treatment and filtration plants; disinfectants; chemi-
cals; laboratory equipment and reagents; utility vehicles, and water intake systems. Damage has
been sustained to the Siverskyi Donets–Donbas canal, which cuts across the Donetsk and Luhansk
oblasts and accounts for a majority of the impact. Damages to the water supply system are esti-
mated at US$12.2 million across the two oblasts.

Damages to the sewage systems also include impacted piping and plumbing; treatment plants and
pumping stations; laboratory equipment, reagents, and chemicals; utility vehicles; and sludge dis-
posal sites. Damages to the sewage system are estimated at US$4.5 million across the two oblasts.
The effects of the reduced infrastructure capacity are made worse by the influx of IDPs, since
this places additional strain on drinking water provision, sewage treatment, and sludge disposal
facilities. This is particularly true for raions closest to the current line of confrontation, where
the concentration of IDPs is the highest and damage from earlier rounds of fighting the most pro-
nounced. The inadequacy of sanitation facilities disproportionately impacts vulnerable groups,
including women and girls and poor families.

 RECOVERY OBJECTIVES, OUTCOMES, AND NEEDS

Strategic options and scenarios for recovery
This section provides an overview of costed strategic options and scenarios for transitional re-
covery and reconstruction strategy for the subsector. This includes a qualitative assessment of
infrastructure, service delivery, capacity and human development needs, as well as quantification
of resources required to reconstruct needed infrastructure and restore social services.

Total recovery needs for the IS component are estimated at US$1.258 billion. Needs are greatest
in the transport, health, and energy sectors, at US$558 million, US$184 million, and US$79 million
respectively. Needs estimates build upon the damages reported to infrastructure to additionally
(i) reconstruct impacted infrastructure to improved standards; (ii) restore service delivery to in-
dividuals residing in Donetsk and Luhansk, and replace facilities; and (iii) provide social services
to IDPs. These also include other capacity and human development resources required to recon-
struct needed infrastructure and restore social services.

Key Features of the Emerging Transitional Recovery Strategy

•	 The interventions recommended by individual sectors are aligned with the GoU’s broad vision
   for recovery. As such, while the measures proposed for each sector are designed as short-term
   measures to stabilize living conditions in the affected communities, they contribute toward
   the government’s 2015–2017 reform agenda.
•	 Costed options have been provided relating to the impact and needs for recovery in each
   sector that supply the government several options to choose from when enacting recovery.
   These relate to: (i) reconstructing impacted infrastructure; (ii) restoring service delivery to
   individuals residing in Donetsk and Luhansk, and; (iii) providing social services to individu-

    als displaced as a result of the conflict who now reside mostly in Donetsk, Luhansk, Kharkiv,
    Dnipropetrovsk, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts.
•	 Stabilizing living conditions in affected areas may require reconstructing and rehabilitating
   infrastructure and service delivery to at least precrisis conditions,14 but preferably to im-
   proved standards. This is the case, for example, in the education sector, where it is proposed
   to increase enrollment capacity in preschools to offer all children educational spots—while
   potentially also offering their caretakers the possibility to earn a living as well. It is similar-
   ly true of the reconstruction of impacted bridges, health-care infrastructure, and water and
   sanitation systems that may have to service large numbers of the long-term displaced for an
   indefinite period of time.
•	 The BBBS principle has been applied differentially and selectively in calculating recovery costs
   across and within subsectors. This is to ensure cost-optimized reconstruction and recovery
   programs that are sensitive to the needs of vulnerable populations, and those displaced by
   the conflict. BBBS recommendations in this component focus on recovery that improves upon
   precrisis conditions. For example, needs in the transport sector include the costs of construct-
   ing footpaths and sheltered bus stops to better serve women and youth. Similarly, to deal
   with the loss of all tertiary care facilities in Donetsk and Luhansk to antigovernment armed
   groups, the health sector recommends the purchase of new equipment better suited to meet-
   ing the needs of the population. The education sector similarly recommends training children
   to identify unexploded ordnances (UXOs) to address the demining of schools, common areas,
   and other public property (this is addressed under Component 3 of the RPA).
•	 The implementation of recovery—particularly including elements of BBBS—will require de-
   veloping the capacity of the respective government agencies. Accordingly, subsector needs
   estimates incorporate the costs and modalities of undertaking such capacity development
   programs.
•	 All needs have been prioritized by urgency of implementation and magnitude of impact for
   beneficiaries, with the needs of vulnerable groups particularly considered. Additionally, fi-
   nancial needs and implementation plans have been presented across a time span of two years
   (select interventions extend beyond that period). Needs have also been reconciled across sec-
   tors to avoid overlaps and identify gaps, including through preliminary discussions with the
   government. Coordination has been maintained across different sectors to ensure consisten-
   cy in various cost calculation factors.
•	 While most of the sectors covered in this assessment also require significant reform and im-
   provements in governance, these have not been specifically identified in this phase of the RPA.
   An exception to this is the environment sector, where pressing improvements in governance
   are necessary even to launch immediate recovery interventions over the next two years.

Addressing key transversal issues
Sector needs have been formulated and costed to also address the specific requirements of IDPs,
the rights of vulnerable populations, gender sensitivity, youth inclusion, and human rights. To
ensure this, needs assessments have been developed in consultation with experts on these issues.

Incorporation of Gender Concerns and Needs: A gender checklist was compiled, circulated, and

discussed with sector teams to make sure that women’s, men’s, and youth needs and capacities
are taken into account in the assessment of IS–related needs, and are reflected in recovery strate-
gies and properly costed. In terms of needs assessment, the following issues were considered: (i)
safety and security of access to public infrastructure for men, women, children, and the elderly,
and making sure that public places (transport, hospitals, schools, markets, and so on) are free of
violence and abuse of rights. These needs could be met by improving illumination, longer hours of
operation, locating critical infrastructure assets closer to residential areas, and by housing male
and female IDPs from different families in different premises; (ii) ensuring comfortable access to
infrastructure for people with mobility impairment, people who use wheelchairs, and other vul-
nerable groups; and (iii) maximizing affordability of access, as many IDPs and other people in the
conflict-affected areas lack steady sources of income, a particularly acute issue for female-headed
households.

Applying the gender lens is also helpful for designing BBBS strategies. Gender-sensitive planning
of recovery efforts is essential to ensure that the renewed infrastructure will equitably improve
the well-being of women, men, girls, and boys. The provision of needs-based infrastructure that
takes into account changes in the demographic mix caused by the conflict (such as changes in
population size, age, and gender composition) has been reflected in the recovery strategies and
needs quantification of various IS subsectors.

Treatment and Incorporation of IDPs’ Needs: The key objective of ensuring the equitable delivery
of IS to IDPs and their hosts in conflict-affected areas has been incorporated in various subsector
needs assessments. Further recommendations to mainstream IDP issues into the recovery agenda
include: (i) ensuring that schools, health-care facilities, water and sanitation systems, and other
infrastructure are rebuilt to accommodate new demand associated with the presence of IDPs; (ii)
ensuring that IDP and host populations have equal and adequate access to rehabilitated services,
so as to avoid engendering conflict between IDPs and hosts in areas with high concentrations of
IDPs; (iii) involving both IDPs and hosts in the process of identifying rehabilitation priorities in
communities from the beginning of the recovery process; (iv) surveying return intentions, trig-
gers, and needs of IDPs to prioritize the rehabilitation of IS that will enable and sustain return;
and (v) creating opportunities to use IDPs’ skills—such as in public works, electrical engineering,
and hydrological engineering—during the recovery process.

Identifying and quantifying subsector recovery needs
Introduction and Summary of Needs: Total recovery needs for the IS component are estimated
at US$1.258 billion. Needs are greatest in the transport, health, and social welfare sectors, at
US$558 million, US$184 million, and US$329 million respectively.

Education (US$9.71 million): Recovery interventions have been costed with the principles of
BBBS and protection of vulnerable communities in mind. The key short-term recovery objectives
are: (i) reconstructing infrastructure; (ii) restoring service delivery (in conflict-affected and IDP-
receiving regions); (iii) developing the capacity of the education authorities for crisis-sensitive
planning and preparedness; and (iv) mitigating risks related to the crisis, such as protecting chil-
dren and youth from violence, landmines, and UXOs.

Recovery should be used as an opportunity to improve access to higher-quality education through
better design of learning spaces; teacher development; and to strengthen the capacity of educa-
tion authorities at all levels to plan and implement the education system’s recovery. With a view to
BBBS, recommended rehabilitation interventions include: ensuring accessibility for children with

Health15 (US$184.2 million): To maximize the long-term impact of health sector interventions,
the proposed recovery strategy prioritizes the adequate provision of health services over infra-
structure reconstruction needs. The bulk of recovery spending is allocated toward strengthening
the health system to be able to address both the urgent health needs of IDPs and to support host
communities (US$86.8 million). A similarly large portion of spending is dedicated to guarantee-
ing access to pharmaceuticals for affected communities, including IDPs and host populations,

such as the need to reestablish tertiary care facilities that have been lost to rebel-held parts of Luhansk and Donetsk.

the electricity sector, since major energy generation plants have been affected. However, needs in
the coal and district heating sectors also require urgent attention. Acute fuel shortages and winter
heating needs require priority interventions.

decline. Recognizing this, the National Commission for State Energy and Public Utilities Regula-
tion has already taken measures to alleviate the burden. These include the provision of US$50
million to replenish the severely depleted fuel reserves of the power generation facilities.

Facilitating private sector recovery in the power sector: As previously highlighted, it is also recom-
mended that the government facilitate private-sector recovery in the power sector. This will be
essential for restoring a vital public service, the absence of which can severely jeopardize the lives
and living standards of resident and IDP populations.

Electricity provision to IDPs: The IDP influx has been significant in Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, and
Zaporizhzhia oblasts. Fortunately, power generation capacity in Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia
is estimated to sufficiently meet the increased demand. Power needs in the Kharkiv oblast war-
rant additional evaluation if the IDP population continues to rise.

Coal (US$1.296 million): Infrastructure damage to facilities in government-controlled areas is rel-
atively minor. However, two service providers—SE Dzerzhynskvugillya in Donetsk oblast and SE
Lisichanskvugillya in Luhansk oblast—have incurred substantial losses. Since both of these are
state enterprises, their losses will eventually be underwritten through state budgets. However, it
is necessary to make funding available in the short term to enable a return to full-scale production
at the facilities, and to prevent further losses. This is proposed only as a short-term emergency
measure and is not an endorsement of retaining these unprofitable enterprises in the long term,
for which government subsidies should preferably be discontinued at the earliest opportunity.

District heating (US$24.986 million): Damages to infrastructure are heavily concentrated in Do-
netsk, which accounts for 97 percent of the recovery needs. The vast majority of Donetsk’s recov-
ery needs (also 97 percent) are required to reconstruct infrastructure responsible for supplying
heat to consumers. Of this, 92 percent of the funds are required to reconstruct heat generation
facilities such as boiler rooms. Considering the harsh winter, it is critical that this financing be
made available in a timely manner. This is particularly important since interrupted heat supply in
the winter is likely to cause massive use of electrical appliances (such as heaters) at the household
level, which sharply increases the load on the electric power networks and may affect electric-
ity supply. Such a scenario could risk the consumer losing access to electricity along with heat-

over the next 24 months. Priority re-
covery needs in the environmental
sector include: (i) a post-conflict envi-
ronmental assessment that focuses on
contaminated sites (US$3 million); (ii) a strategic environmental assessment of the DRP (US$1.5
million); (iii) reestablishing an environmental monitoring program (US$2.5 million); (iv) refor-
esting and rehabilitating protected areas (US$17.5 million); v) removing and disposing of debris
(US$5 million); (vi) strengthening environmental emergency preparedness and response capac-
ity (US$200,000); and (vii) reinforcing national capacity to combat illegal natural resource exploi-
tation and environmental crime (US$300,000). It must be noted that estimates for physical works
are notional at this stage and based on standard global yardsticks; they will need verification
in subsequent phases of the assessment. The needs estimate for reforesting and rehabilitating
protected areas is based on the assumption that around 30 percent of the total estimated burned
forest area may be so severely damaged that it will require priority rehabilitation, which is then
multiplied by a global unit cost for this activity.17 Similarly, costs for debris removal are derived
from a broad-based lump sum estimate based on the assessment team’s operational experiences
elsewhere to jump-start a cleanup process. The estimated cost of the post-conflict environmental
assessment is based on a detailed evaluation of the 20 priority contaminated sites, including tech-
nical advice on emergency containment measures.

Public Buildings and Housing (US$27.21 million): Housing recovery needs have been calculated
for rebuilding damaged and destroyed multi-apartment and single-family housing, at the average
unit cost of housing estimated by local authorities in various cities and raions of Donetsk and Lu-
hansk regions. This is based on the assumption that the government, in line with its past practic-

per square meter rate. This is the preferred scenario for this needs estimate using a compensa-
tion and contractor-based reconstruction model. It must be noted that these estimates are only
limited to the raions and municipalities of the

a compensation-based one.
At 13.65 square meters per person, and an extra 10 meters per family, the cost of such payments
for all impacted individuals is estimated at US$5.95 million.

Finally, the recovery needs estimates for general public buildings include reconstructing or repair-
ing damaged assets and providing equipment for service delivery restoration. These are based on
estimates provided by local authorities in various cities and raions of the Donetsk and Luhansk
oblasts visited during the assessment.

Social Welfare (US$329.4 million): The social welfare needs assessment mainly focuses on the ad-
ditional funds needed to extend benefits and services to IDPs. The estimate also includes the cost
of repairing damages to the physical infrastructure associated with the delivery and distribution
of social welfare benefits. It is expected that IDPs would become recipients of the regular social
assistance programs that are operated in Ukraine, and that the number of beneficiaries of the
Guaranteed Minimum Income Program would increase, along with those who receive disability
benefits. This increase would be expected to be offset by the amount of benefits no longer paid
in Crimea. Additionally, active labor market policies to promote employment among IDPs would
cost around US$6.5 million. The social welfare system in five oblasts would also need additional
social workers to be able to arrange uptake and case management for the increased number of
applicants and clients. It is estimated that an additional 500 social workers would be needed in
five oblasts. The cost related to their wages and trainings is estimated at US$3.5 million for 2015.
In summary, interventions proposed for the social welfare sector encompass the following ele-
ments:

Aid to IDPs (US$301.3 million): Per the decision by the Cabinet of Ministers, registered IDPs
holding a bank account are to receive a six-month allowance of up to UAH 2,400 per family per
month to cover living payments. IDP aid expenditure through January 2016 has been estimated at
US$301.3 million based on the lower estimate of IDPs as forecast by the World Bank.

Unemployment benefits (US$15.2 million): Unemployment benefits have been calculated for the
two-year period based on the current number of IDPs. Payments for 2015 are higher in Donetsk

overall needs. However, while
additional resources are not re-
quired for this, adjustments for
redistribution of resources between oblasts are urgently required.

Hiring additional social workers (US$3.5 million): To address the greater processing load of all
types of benefits due to increased population in areas receiving IDPs, it is estimated that 478 new
staff will be required across the five oblasts. This will cost around US$3.5 million in 2015, and
complements other measures to improve access to social protection services identified in Com-
ponent 3 of the RPA.

Infrastructure reconstruction (US$2.867 million): A total of 26 facilities in government-controlled
territory have been affected. Of these, 19 are in the Donetsk oblast with an estimated reconstruc-
tion cost of US$0.88 million, and 7 are in the Luhansk oblast with an estimated reconstruction
cost of US$1.987 million. Damaged facilities include residential and nonresidential care and reha-
bilitation facilities for people with disabilities, children, the elderly, and the homeless, as well as
administration buildings and employment centers.

able groups, including the elderly, orphans, and disabled persons. Financing these institutions
is estimated at US$10 million. However, these needs are not additional for Ukraine, but require
funds to be reallocated between oblasts.

Transport (US$558.15 million): The cost to reconstruct impacted transport infrastructure has
been calculated with a view toward BBBS and gender-sensitive construction. In the roads sec-
tor, this means prioritizing the reconstruction of both state and municipal roads to international
standards of road safety. It will also mean constructing infrastructure to facilitate nonvehicular
transport, particularly illuminated and accessible sidewalks, sheltered bus stops, and pedestrian
crossings and bridges. Road sector costs also include increased costs of maintaining the network
due to the additional traffic load created by the influx of IDPs. These interventions have been esti-
mated to add 30 percent to reconstruction costs in the roads sector, for a total of US$357 million.
BBBS needs are also estimated to raise reconstruction costs by 20 percent in the railways and air
transport sectors, for respective totals of US$14.7 million and US$66.7 million.

Water and sanitation (US$40.1 million): Water and sanitation sector recovery needs entail: (i) re-
covering water supply and sewage infrastructure; (ii) increasing the capacity of water supply and
sewage systems; (iii) engaging additional personnel and hardware needed for appropriate water
and sanitation services; and (iv) engaging in scientific research and design development to diver-
sify sources of water and modernizing sewage treatment plants. Intermittent water supply, along
with the irregular provision of electricity and heating, is expected to worsen the conditions and
vulnerability of people residing in or seeking to return to the conflict-affected areas. A severe win-
ter will cause water pipes to burst and make it extremely difficult to maintain a centralized water
supply system in conflict-affected areas. This highlights an urgent need to constantly monitor wa-
ter supply disruptions and their impact on sanitation, and the overall hygiene and health condi-

and remedial measures for the urgent restoration of these services in the directly affected parts

5. TRANSITIONAL IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY AND
  INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR RECOVERY

Strategic results framework (SRF) for Component 1
Considerations for Developing the RF: Component 1 Results Framework provides a consolidated
RF for Component 1, which combines individual sector frameworks into a cohesive whole. This
provides the baseline conditions, performance indicators, and implementation sequencing of var-
ious subsectors at the level of individual interventions. This could prove a useful intra- and inter-
sectoral tool to prioritize and sequence recovery needs in the future, as well to monitor, evaluate,
and make subsequent readjustments and course corrections to the recovery program.

The Component 1 SRF provides actions that will be more visible to the public and can generate
modest but tangible “quick wins” that deepen or broaden national ownership over and support
for the recovery and peacebuilding process. Along with these visible results, it also outlines less
visible but equally important actions in the areas of institutional capacity building and reform,
transparency, and governance of natural resources. These are critical to underpinning future
governance, state capacity, and accountability, without which ownership of the process risks be-
comes nominal, rather than national, and can lead to reversals at a later date.

Proposed institutional arrangements for recovery
Overall Institutional Arrangements for Cohesive and Programmatic Recovery: Hybrid institution-
al arrangements—which are a mix of dedicated central agencies and existing institutions—may
best suit the peculiarly challenging circumstances faced during efficient and effective recovery
of the conflict-affected parts of eastern Ukraine. The central agencies identified throughout this
analysis may assume a central role toward policy setting, implementation oversight, and perfor-
mance management at a core programmatic level. Actual implementation will likely be carried
out by various sector, oblast, and raion–level line agencies and departments. However, making
such a hybrid arrangement work will require clarifying from the outset the operational mandates
of key recovery actors and mechanisms for policy development, coordination, monitoring and
evaluation (M&E), and reporting. Special mechanisms for resource allocation, financial manage-
ment procurement, capacity development and staffing, quality assurance, transparency, commu-
nications, grievance redress, data collection, and monitoring will also need to be established.

Sector-by-Sector Arrangements and Considerations for Recovery Implementation: This section
provides a summary of the sector-by-sector arrangements and requirements for efficient and ef-
fective crisis recovery.

•	 Education sector: The government has already made some headway toward normalizing the
   delivery of education services. While the State Emergency Service (SES) will be responsible
   for carving out the broader contours of an education sector recovery policy, various tiers of
   government will need to play a key role in planning and implementing such recovery. Small
   towns and villages will be in charge of preschools; raions and cities will be responsible for
   primary and secondary education; oblasts and cities of special status will be in charge of tech-
   nical and vocational schools; and the central government will be responsible for higher educa-



                                                                                               Volume II:
                                                 35                               FULL COMPONENT REPORTS
      tion. However, the capacity of education authorities at all levels for crisis-sensitive planning,
      budgeting, and implementation will need to be strengthened. This will include enhancing the
      capacity for operationalizing recovery at the ministry, regional, raion, municipal, and school
      levels.
•	 Health sector: Local health authorities confirmed their commitment to take the lead on all
   recovery efforts. Though the Cabinet of Ministers, MoH should request full support from oth-
   er industries and ministries (infrastructure, finance, and so on) by simplifying tenders and
   procurement procedures to obtain reconstruction services, as well as medicines and medical
   supplies. At the same time, local health administrations may benefit from receiving techni-
   cal assistance from international experts and learning lessons from international experiences
   with bolstering health systems, especially regarding health services delivery, pharmaceuti-
   cals, and health sector financing systems. In addition, civil society organizations (CSOs) can
   provide some services, such as social support for IDPs.
•	 Energy sector: Effective energy sector recovery is expected to constitute a complex mix of
   public sector–led implementation and regulation and facilitation of private sector recovery
   interventions. The government structure responsible for coordinating recovery efforts in the
   Donbas region will need to significantly reinforce its staff, skills, and capacity to coordinate
   across public and private sector recovery. It will also have to work in close cooperation with
   the National Commission for State Energy and Public Utilities Regulation, which is responsi-
   ble for tariff policy, and other sector state bodies including ministries, the tax administration,
   and oblast administrations.
•	 Transport sector: In cooperation with the Ministry of Regional Development, Construction,
   Housing and Communal Services, the Ministry of Infrastructure will be responsible for re-
   covery measures regarding the national transport and communications networks. However,
   the process of full transport sector reconstruction will not be quick, and each area of damage
   will need to be prioritized. Major roads should be dealt with first, with local roads to follow.
   Any towns or villages that are cut off should have temporary access constructed for them.
   Pedestrian bridges and crossings and protected bus stops should also be a priority since they
   mostly serve more vulnerable populations.
•	 Housing sector: Local self-government institutions could be made responsible for coordinat-
   ing the housing sector recovery, although in a way that puts the lowest possible burden and
   administrative costs on these already undercapacitated local bodies. It is therefore proposed
   that in each municipality, specific plans and schedules of housing recovery and possible com-
   pensation depend on which scenario/scheme the municipality will approve, taking into ac-
   count provisions of the legislation, availability of funds, and the local situation. In each raion
   and municipality, where necessary, local bodies of self-government shall form temporary
   grievance and need assessment commissions to perform the following functions: (i) develop
   standardized local policy and “one-stop shop” procedures for processing claims, verifying eli-
   gibility for compensation and paying these out (as addressed in Component 3 of the RPA); (ii)
   identify and register all owners of damaged and destroyed single-family houses and apart-
   ments in multi-apartment houses; and (iv) distribute and transmit funds to claimants and
   monitor receipt of compensations. However, such commissions will need to be provided with
   training and resources for arranging office space and utilities, equipment, staff salaries, com-
   munication, and other administrative costs.
•	 Water and sanitation sector: The GoU, along with its agencies (especially those in affected
   oblasts and raions) and other partners, is already directly or indirectly involved in water and

   sanitation sector repairs. However, central oversight by the Ministry of Regional Develop-
   ment, Construction, Housing and Communal Services will be needed to coordinate recovery
   in this sector, as well as to further strengthen and reinforce regulatory controls. There are few
   other options to arrange fuller and longer-term recovery in this sector. While the GoU should
   take the lead for such recovery, other organizations and donors would be expected to play key
   roles in providing advisory, technical, and financing assistance.
•	 Environment sector: Environmental sector recovery implementation will need to be coordi-
   nated at three levels: the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources at the central level;
   the government structure responsible for coordinating Donbas recovery efforts at the region-
   al level; and the state (oblast) environmental protection administration and CSOs at the local
   level. Technical administrations at the oblast level, such as the State Environment Inspector-
   ate or State Forestry Committee, have highly qualified experts with the technical skills and ex-
   perience to lead implementation of the proposed projects. It will be necessary to involve and
   capitalize on the professional skills of environmental NGOs that have played a critical role in
   monitoring and reporting on the conflict-related environmental damages. To promote owner-
   ship and active involvement, it is important that local communities be involved in discussions
   and decision making on key issues, and be provided with job opportunities through envi-
   ronmental rehabilitation work to the extent possible (such as reforestation projects, waste
   cleanup operations, and so on). Finally, it will be important to collaborate with international
   organizations that could provide specialized technical assistance and quality assurance over-
   sight, and share experiences and lessons from relevant initiatives. In addition, international
   partners could provide project management support, especially given the reduced operation-
   al capacity of national institutions in the immediate post-conflict phase.

        bjectives, geographic focus, and target groups. The economic recovery component of the
        RPA aims to estimate the impact of the crisis on the affected regions’ economy, identify
        priorities for effective and sustainable economic recovery, and quantify their costs. The
geographic focus is on Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts that are currently under the Ukrainian gov-
ernment’s control. Given wider impacts, recovery needs in adjacent oblasts of Kharkiv, Zapor-
izhzhia, and Dnipropetrovsk are also considered. The main target groups for employment consid-
erations are the IDPs displaced in Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Luhansk, Kharkiv, and Zaporizhzhia
oblasts, and the pre-conflict existing population in all five oblasts concerned who have similar
needs and problems.	

The methodology used to assess the conflict’s economic consequences brought together a blend
of post-conflict needs assessment (PCNA) tools and built on local knowledge and national sys-
tems. Both qualitative and quantitative research methods were used. The process included a desk
review of available primary and secondary official data; field visits in affected areas; interviews
with informants in affected regions and at the central level; and focus group discussions with
stakeholders in affected regions. Key outputs include description and quantification (where pos-
sible) of what impact the crisis has had on economic activity; subsector strategies for transitional
recovery; cost estimates of recovery strategies and related monitoring/impact assessment activi-
ties; and institutional and performance measuring arrangements.

This analysis has limitations, but preliminary conclusions can be drawn to form the basis for rapid
response measures. Even though a few quantitative indicators were updated where possible in
early February 2015, in other cases, data are not reliable as they are out of date, incomplete, or
missing altogether. In these cases, analysts used proxy indicators or drew inferences from more
reliable data. For this reason, the findings and recommendations on priority interventions were
further discussed and developed with the government during the RPA reviews in January/Febru-
ary 2015. Notwithstanding the “fragility” of data, this needs assessment serves as a foundation
and evidentiary base for an elaboration of rapid response measures that could contribute to eco-
nomic recovery in the concerned territories. In turn, the set of suggested measures and activities
provide a basis for a provisional estimate of the required financial resources.

It must, however, be emphasized that recovery prospects in the East are closely linked to, and in
turn affect, Ukraine’s broader economic challenges. Recovery efforts in the East need to be viewed
through the prism of the unprecedented economic crisis in Ukraine, and additional security prob-
lems in these regions further undermine investor and consumer confidence. More specifically, it is
imperative to restore macroeconomic and banking sector stability; address wider structural chal-
lenges, including by making the overall environment friendlier for investors; curb widespread
corruption so public services can be delivered to citizens efficiently and cost-effectively; and deal
with problems in the gas sector. These steps are preconditions for recovery in the East. Of course,
this is challenging given that problems in the East and overall economic problems are closely
linked—with links running both ways. However, without macroeconomic stabilization and struc-
tural reforms, it will be difficult to talk about recovery in the East in isolation. In other words, if
the rest of the country does not grow and create jobs, it will be difficult to employ people dis-

The recommendations in Component 2 will be executed in two phases: priority measures during
Phase 1 that will be enacted within the next 24 months, and medium/long-term measures that
will be enacted during a provisional Phase 2. Thus the recommendations are outlined in a sequen-
tial manner that prioritizes critical and practical interventions. Considering the rapidly changing
situation in the East, as well as various time frames required for allocating funds, not all suggested
measures foreseen for Phase 1 can be undertaken immediately; a more flexible approach is need-
ed. Nevertheless, it is useful to formulate a list of priority projects so they are “ready for launch”
when conditions permit. Depending on the situation in conflict areas as well as lessons learned
from Phase 1 interventions, topics and objectives for medium/long-term projects will need to be
evaluated. In addition to new targets, the most effective projects from the Phase 1 would be ex-
tended and expanded during Phase 2.

M&E and impact assessment will be executed on a regular basis in compliance with donors’ poli-
cies. Efficient communication among all stakeholders and transparent decision-making processes
would contribute to the fine-tuning of the recovery efforts in terms of focus, approach, and hu-
man and financial resources. Moreover, all lessons learned and efficient approaches related to
economic recovery will be collected and widely disseminated.

U
         kraine’s unprecedented economic challenges in 2014 came on the heels of two years of
         economic stagnation, with GDP growth averaging 0 percent in 2012–2013. For years pre-
         ceding the current crisis, Ukraine’s economy was underperforming. Characterized by sys-
temic weakness and inefficiencies, the economy did not recover from the 2008 global economic
crisis.19 Weak macroeconomic policies and delayed structural reforms led to widening internal
and external imbalances. The government embarked on much-needed macroeconomic adjust-
ment in early 2014 and began steps to ease structural constraints to growth, but its efforts were
stymied by conflict in the East, which is the industrial heart of Ukraine.

Donetsk and Luhansk regions are economically important to Ukraine, accounting for 15.7 per-
cent of Ukraine’s GDP in the pre-conflict period and 12.5 percent of the population. Coal min-
ing, steel, petrochemicals, and the fertilizer industry are the main sectors in these two regions.
Around one-fourth of Ukraine’s industrial activity and an equal share of its exports came from
these regions in 2013. Of the regional exports, metals exports were high at around 60 per-
cent. In the first 11 months of 2014, exports from Donetsk region dropped by almost 30 per-
cent and by 43 percent from Luhansk oblast, compared to the same period of previous year.20
Given the geographical location of Donetsk and Luhansk at the eastern border, they have close
economic relations with Russia. During January–September 2014, export of metals to Russia de-
clined by 28 percent y/y, with the share to Russia declining to 10 percent of total metal exports
from 14 percent in 2013. As a consequence of direct and indirect impacts, SMEs lowered their
economic activities by 80–90 percent, leading to a similar percentage of jobs lost.

This component of the report first considers the macroeconomic situation. Cross-cutting issues

                  INGS

Macroeconomic impact
Ukraine is in the midst of a severe macroeconomic crisis—a deepening recession, soaring infla-
tion, acute balance of payment pressures, and a fragile banking system. Faced with large accu-
mulated fiscal and external imbalances, the authorities embarked on a major macroeconomic
adjustment in early 2014—supported by an IMF Stand-By Arrangement (SBA). Sharp currency
devaluation—after the fixed exchange rate was abandoned in March—combined with fiscal con-
solidation triggered significant decline in consumption and investment. The contractionary im-
pact of the adjustment was compounded by an escalating military conflict that led to serious eco-
nomic disruptions in the industrialized East and undermined investor and consumer confidence.
After a 3.9 percent decline over the first three quarters, real GDP fell by 15.2 percent y/y in the
fourth quarter, bringing the full year decline to around 6.8 percent in 2014. Meanwhile, sharp de-
valuation and increase in gas and utility tariffs has led to inflationary pressures, with CPI reaching
24.9 percent y/y in December. The banking system remains under severe stress due to macroeco-
nomic instability and deep-seated structural weaknesses. External financing needs and balance
of payment pressures remain acute, compounded by capital flight, low foreign direct investment
(FDI), and delays in official financing. Foreign reserves declined to US$7.5 billion (1.4 months
of import cover) at year’s end and dropped further to US$6.0 billion at end of January. The IMF
reached staff-level agreement on February 13, 2015, to replace the existing SBA with an Extended

nomic policies, thereby laying the foundation for stabilization and recovery.

The conflict-affected regions are economically important. They are major industrial producers
(including mining and energy production) with strong value chain links to the rest of Ukraine.
They account for 15.7 percent of GDP and almost one-fourth of industrial production and mer-
chandise exports (see Table 13). The areas outside government control alone—which are only
part of the two administrative regions of Luhansk and Donetsk—are estimated to directly account
for about 6 percent of GDP (see Table 14). All of Ukraine’s coal production comes from these two
regions—an important input for the steel industry and electricity generation. Fiscally, Donetsk
and Luhansk contribute nearly 22 percent of general government revenue, although they have
traditionally been net recipients of fiscal transfers.

The conflict is contributing significantly to macroeconomic challenges. It is estimated that direct
and indirect impacts of the conflict accounted for about 2–3 percentage points of the overall GDP
decline in 2014. Economic activity is severely disrupted by the conflict. Production facilities and
economic infrastructure have been destroyed or severely damaged (see Table 15). Large outmi-
gration is dislocating labor. Weak revenue collection and security-related expenditures add to the
fiscal burden. Uncertainty is further eroding confidence beyond the directly affected areas, with
negative impacts on investment and consumer spending, (which are already battered by the on-
going macroeconomic crisis).

•	 Real sector impact: Industrial production in Luhansk and Donetsk declined by an estimated
   42.0 percent and 31.5 percent in 2014 respectively, compared to an average decline of 10.1
   percent for Ukraine. About 78 percent of industrial capacity (share in 2013 industrial produc-
   tion in the Donetsk region) is currently in areas controlled by separatists, with 66 percent of
   employees (share of employees in the region in 2013). In Luhansk region about 84 percent
   of industrial capacity is currently in areas not under government control, with 81 percent of
   employees. Given the regional economic structure, coal, chemical, and engineering industries
   were most affected, dropping by 30 percent, 14.7 percent, and 21.3 percent in 2014 respec-

     tively, compared to 2013.22
•	 Labor impact: The virtual collapse of production and output resulted in significant job loss-
   es. Preliminary figures show that reduction in net employment in Donetsk from December
   2013 to December 2014 was around 40 percent, and 70 percent in Luhansk. These reductions
   amount to a total of about 800,000 jobs in the Donbas region alone.

•	 Trade impact: Exports from the two regions declined by a staggering 37 percent, compared
   to a 13.5 percent overall decline. Given the region’s close trade links with Russia, it has been
   most affected by the periodic trade restrictions by Russia.

•	 Fiscal impact: Donetsk and Luhansk regions contribute nearly 22 percent of general govern-
   ment revenues; however, they were traditionally net recipients from the state budget due to
   subsidies and transfers. Budget revenues (excluding pension funds) in Luhansk and Donetsk
   regions declined about 53 percent and 35 percent y/y in 2014 respectively, putting pressure
   on the overall budget performance. Meanwhile, expenditures in two regions were executed
   as planned until November, when the Cabinet adopted a decree to suspend spending in areas
   outside government control (in effect since December). At the same time, security spending
   almost doubled in 2014 and reached nearly 2 percent of GDP in 2014, adding to the overall
   deficit. In addition, there are rising spending needs to provide for the increasing number of
   IDPs.

•	 Uncertainty: Uncertainty generated by the conflict weighs on business and consumer con-
   fidence throughout the country, and also on investors’ perceptions of country risk. Uncer-
   tainty is particularly harmful given the already fragile macroeconomic and weak banking en-
   vironment. While it is very likely that the conflict aggravated capital flight (including deposit
   outflows from the banking sector), deterred foreign and domestic investment, and affected
   consumer spending, these indirect impacts of conflict-induced uncertainty cannot be fully
   quantified. Credit default spreads, which are commonly used to gauge risk sentiment, have
   been extraordinarily volatile over the past year.

Going forward, the conflict—unless credibly resolved—will complicate macroeconomic stabiliza-
tion and hamper economic recovery. Ukraine’s macroeconomic challenges are not entirely caused
by the conflict, but the conflict makes it much more difficult to overcome these challenges, ad-
dress instability, and return to a sustainable growth path. In 2014, the most severe impacts of the
conflict only materialized in the second half of the year when the conflict started to escalate. In
2015, the loss of control of economically significant regions on output, fiscal balances, and trade
may have a more severe impact. Moreover, while markets may have already priced in uncertainty,
investment—which is expected to be a critical driver of economic recovery—will remain subdued
until confidence in a politically stable Ukraine is restored. If and when stability is restored, pro-
ductive capacity and infrastructure will need to be rebuilt, which will require time and financing
before these regions will recover economically.

T
      he banking sector in conflict-affected areas suffers from many of the same stresses and
      structural weaknesses as the entire Ukrainian banking system,23 with large numbers of in-
      solvent banks, a falling deposit base, and increasing volumes of nonperforming loans. Banks
in the East have additional operating problems due to security related issues. Of specific con-
cern are banking services’ needs for IDPs. In addition, physical damage, territorial threats, and
diminished rule of law have taken a toll on the risk appetite of both entrepreneurs and banks in
conflict-affected areas. Security risks in the formerly rebel-held areas make access to credit us-
ing market mechanisms unlikely. Stabilizing the banking sector in areas returned to government
control requires two crucial factors: overcoming Ukraine’s general banking crisis and reducing
the perception of security threats.

The main areas assessed here are: (i) access to basic financial services, banks, branches, and cash
machines (primary impact); (ii) the impact of the conflict on banks’ balance sheets (secondary
impact); and (iii) liquidity conditions in the overall banking system in Ukraine (secondary im-
pact).

Primary impacts
In areas returned to Ukrainian control, financial services were temporarily interrupted but have
since been restored. No banks are headquartered on the territories that were returned to Ukrai-
nian authorities’ control. The cities that were temporarily out of Ukrainian control faced inter-
ruptions in financial services but these have since been restored (although some uncertainty re-
mains). When this area was out of control of Ukrainian authorities, rebels blocked the normal
functioning of almost all (with some exceptions) bank branches, seized assets, and captured ar-
mored vehicles. In areas retaken by Ukrainian authorities, financial service operations at branch-
es, ATMs, and point of sale (POS) terminals have resumed. Banks report that the overall crime
rate, acts of vandalism, and attacks on branches and ATMs has markedly decreased since the ex-
pulsion of the rebels. Bankomats are reportedly operating normally (except there is still high de-
mand for cash, so they are refilled frequently). Some of this increased demand is also coming from
residents of territories presently out of Ukrainian authorities’ control, where banking services at
branches and ATMs have ceased and only POS terminals continue to accept deposits. Discussions
with bankers revealed similar situations in Kramatorsk, Slovyansk, Dobropolye, and Mariupol.
Social payments and salary payments are reportedly received normally in territories returned to
Ukrainian authorities’ control, and these are transferred automatically and without interruption
by the State Pension Fund. The decision to stop social transfers to areas not under government
control is putting pressure on bordering areas because affected residents have to register in the
retaken regions to receive payments; however, banking institutions seem to be ready to serve this
additional client base.

                                                            59                                       FULL COMPONENT REPORTS
Other areas bordering territories not under government control are also experiencing increased
demand for banking services. For example, in Mariupol in December, observers described increas-
ing pressure on banks. Although bankers indicate that branches and ATMs operate normally, the
city witnesses “cash tourism”—people coming from areas controlled by separatists territories to
withdraw cash from ATMs. There is a liquidity squeeze caused in part by the constant cash with-
drawals of displaced people. The payments infrastructure in these areas appears to be function-
ing effectively, with minor interruptions. Although hard to quantify, there is anecdotal evidence
that households and enterprises in these bordering areas are hoarding cash, jewelry, and other
valuables.

Areas outside the conflict’s perimeter are also seeing increased nervousness among depositors,
unlike that which is being experienced in the rest of Ukraine. In Kharkiv, for example, the banking
infrastructure was never under siege, but is being strained by the increased demands caused by
internal migration and nervous depositors. The numerous banks and ATMs in Kharkiv are report-
edly operating normally, however the perception of criminal risk is high. Bankers are observing
above normal demand for cash in Kharkiv, driven mainly by people from areas not under govern-
ment control.

Banks headquartered in areas not under government control face an uncertain future, and the
clients of these banks are in limbo. Most of the banks headquartered in Donetsk regions have
either been declared insolvent or moved their headquarters to Kyiv since the beginning of the
conflict. According to the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) database, four licensed banks remain to
be registered in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. UkrSWIFT, the payments operator in Ukraine that
utilizes SWIFT technology, reports that it cannot contact the member banks in areas not under
government control by phone and has no other connection to them. When the conflict escalated in
the summer, the NBU attempted to destroy vaults of cash in the conflict zones to prevent stealing.
As of now, banks with nationwide networks have suspended operations of their outlets, ATMs,
and POS terminals in the portions of Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts not under government control.

There are no reports of people having problems accessing their bank accounts anywhere in
Ukraine, even if they were opened in branches in areas currently outside of Ukrainian control.
This relates to healthy large modern banks that upgraded their IT and business structure to a
“single balance sheet.” One banker said that for most people, accessing their account takes a few
minutes. However, more advanced banking services—like opening new accounts and obtaining
loans or credit cards—would require registering a person in a region under government control,
which could be problematic.

Legal entities relocating away from the conflict zone report different experiences with accessing
their accounts. Clients of large banks with advanced IT infrastructure can access their accounts
via web-based or electronic banking services, while resuming other bank and payment services
may require reregistering with another branch of the client’s bank. The difficulty of this process
seems to vary from case to case; for small banks without unified accounting (“single balance
sheet”), it may be much more complicated. In such banks, even for legal entities to access current
accounts, the owner may need to provide substantial documentation of business accounts. Some
report that they were asked to provide permissions from their previous home branch, which is
almost impossible for IDPs. Banks have seen a number of enterprises unable to produce docu-
mentation that may have been lost or destroyed. Accessing banking credit lines would normally
require reregistering a business in a nonconflict zone.

Secondary impacts
Uncertainty has gripped businesses and banks alike in much of Ukraine, especially in the East. A
sizable portion of banking assets and deposits are located in the Luhansk (1 percent of total assets
and 2 percent of retail deposits) and Donetsk oblasts (5 percent of total assets and 8 percent of
retail deposits) and the conflict has had a damaging impact on the depositing and lending sides
of banks’ balance sheets in both affected and neighboring oblasts. However, it appears as though
general depositor confidence continues to fall in the East but is recovering in the center and West.

The conflict is unfolding against the background of the country’s general banking crisis, as 42
banks have been sent into resolution since the beginning of 2014. Private individual hryvnia de-
posits fell by 2.3 percent month-on-month in January, whereas private foreign exchange deposits
witnessed a 3.8 percent month-on-month outflow (in US$ equivalent). Cross-currency weighted
average retail deposit outflow from the banking system reached 31 percent in 2014 and has been
continuing in all months since January, except for June. At the same time, the active phase of mili-
tary operations seems to be the primary factor driving deposits outflow, given the huge difference
in deposit outflows between regions. The closer the area is to the conflict, the faster the deposits
are leaving the banks; the deposit outflow in Donetsk and Luhansk oblast during 2014 was 62
percent and 69 percent respectively, while it was under 20 percent in Kyiv city and Kyiv oblast,
and near or slightly above 20 percent in central and western oblasts that do not border the con-
flict area.

The deposit outflow situation in areas returned to government control has currently stabilized,
but problems remain. For example, bankers in Kramatorsk and Kharkiv report deposit outflows
in these cities on par with the rest of Ukraine. In Mariupol, by contrast, deposit withdrawals are
described as more panicked. However, the conflict is not the only culprit; observers note that limi-
tations on deposit withdrawal undermine depositor confidence in the system. Internal migration
and loss of livelihoods also explain the increased withdrawals.

Lending has stalled as credit to private enterprises has been reduced and frozen across the coun-
try, but is worse in the East. Banks’ corporate hryvnia loan portfolio declined 7.7 percent during
2014, whereas foreign exchange corporate portfolio dropped 21.5 percent during the last year.
Private individual local currency loan volumes has fallen 12 percent, whereas retail foreign ex-
change loan portfolio plummeted 24.2 percent. However, collected evidence suggests that the
situation regarding access to credit is even worse in the conflict-affected areas.

While there are no regulatory obstacles or limitations for banks to lend in areas returned to gov-
ernment control or areas bordering the conflict zone, overall uncertainty and risk aversion is mir-
rored in the banks’ approaches to lending in the East. In the absence of official detailed regional
credit statistics, anecdotal evidence suggests that many banks have decided not to lend in these
territories due to the uncertainty and risk. Old credit lines and overdrafts are honored until matu-
rity but are not being extended. Evidence suggests that banks are reluctant to accept the collateral
property or assets located in conflict zones; in particular, banks do not accept future crops from
farmers as collateral (a long-standing practice in Ukraine), which may seriously hinder farming
in 2015. Discussions with the head of SMEs lending from a midsize bank in Mariupol indicated
a reluctance to make new loans, as the risks and cost of capital cannot be properly estimated in
order to price the loan. Representatives of business associations from conflict-affected zones also
report de facto zero possibility of getting a new bank loan in those areas.


                                                                                              Volume II:
                                                61                               FULL COMPONENT REPORTS
There is no statistic currently available to estimate the potential damage to bank collateral from
military actions in the conflict zones. However, the share of these potential losses should be neg-
ligible compared to the asset damage suffered in the areas not under government control and
the general asset quality problems of banks in Ukraine (with broad-definition nonperforming
loans estimated at the level of above 35 percent). At the moment there is anecdotal evidence that
banks have no control over the loan collateral situated in the separatist-controlled areas, plus
preliminary estimates suggest that from 10 percent to 20 percent of total residential property
stock might have been damaged there. The NBU has issued special rules of accounting the assets
write-off in the East in the regulatory capital, giving the banks, which fully provision such assets,
a temporary capital relief.

The crisis has also affected banking sector soundness. The economic and security crisis has led
to a deposit outflow and an increasing number of bank insolvencies. Ukraine’s banking system
recorded a net loss of UAH53 billion for 2014, according to NBU data. Since the beginning of 2014,
42 banks have been declared insolvent and are being resolved. Some banks continue to face ex-
treme liquidity pressures and rely on NBU refinancing.

Hryvnia volatility has increased, and reflects, in part, lack of consumer confidence in the currency
and banking system. Foreign exchange demand remained high in the face of economic uncertainty
and the security threat, and exporters are reportedly hoarding foreign exchange proceeds. Anec-
dotally, banks in territories returned to Ukrainian control and areas bordering the conflict zone
report that households are withdrawing their small UAH savings accounts to convert them to
foreign exchange, and more households and enterprises are reportedly hoarding cash.

                                          5. EMPLOYMENT


Introduction to the employment situation in the
conflict-affected region
The numbers of IDPs from this region are large and growing. In February 2015, Ukraine’s MSP
estimated there were 980,000 registered IDPs,24 from which 219,042 are work-able (not chil-
dren, pensioners, or ill) and potentially seeking employment. This figure may rise as newly up-
rooted people become registered.25 In addition, some 600,000 Ukrainians sought asylum or other
forms of legal stay in neighboring countries, particularly the Russian Federation, as well as Be-
larus, Moldova, Poland, Hungary, and Romania since February 2014. In Ukraine, IDPs are mainly
concentrated in the Donbas region (in districts away from the fighting), which includes Donetsk
(334,618), and Luhansk (111,977) oblasts under government control, and the rest of the IDPs are
distributed in the nearby regions of Kharkiv (122,027), Zaporizhzhia (69,240), and Dnipropetro-
vsk (62,433).26 There are also a substantial number of IDPs in Kyiv and Kyiv region (101,622).

Luhansk and Donetsk—also referred to as the Donbas region or conflict-affected region—are sub-
stantial sources of employment. Manufacturing, mining, and quarrying employ 15.7 percent of all
of Ukraine’s working population, which equals 3.2 million people.27 The importance of the mining
and manufacturing sectors in terms of employment in the Donbas region cannot be overstated.
Almost all of the country’s coal production is concentrated there, and much of the metals are
mined and power produced in the conflict-affected region. These sectors account for 31.3 percent
of the working population in the Donbas, equivalent to almost 1 million people. Municipal and
district-level data on industrial production, numbers of industrial enterprises, and production
indicate that more than three-quarters of (pre-conflict) industrial production originated in areas
that are no longer under government control. As a result, many people have left the conflict-affect-
ed districts, and many of the remaining inhabitants in government-controlled areas have to rely
on agriculture and services provided by the state, as well as social transfers for their livelihoods.

The employment subsection is broken down as follows: the first part profiles the labor market in
the Donbas region and adjacent regions prior to the conflict. The second part sheds light on the
employment situation, focusing on the Donbas and adjacent regions where large shares of IDPs
are concentrated, with estimates of the magnitude of employment loss. The third section provides
an overview of the occupational and skill levels of the working-age population in the Donbas re-
gion compared to adjacent areas and other parts of Ukraine, which provides a clearer picture of
their potential to be absorbed in other regions. The fourth part sets out short- and medium-term
recommendations to help people become economically active via access to distinct types of eco-

Labor market profile in eastern Ukraine
Labor force participation, employment and unemployment

An overview of the Ukrainian labor markets helps contextualize and understand how the conflict-
affected area compares to the rest of the country, where IDPs are likely to seek temporary shelter
and work. The labor force participation rates (LFPRs) of people 15 years and older was around
65 percent in 2013, which is similar to the world average and to other countries in Europe and
Central Asia. In the Donbas region, the LFPR is similar to the national average, but it is higher (68
percent) in the three regions surrounding the conflict region (see Table 16).
Prior to the conflict, the near-conflict oblasts were more economically active—higher labor force
participation, higher employment rates, and lower unemployment—than the Donbas region.
Ukraine’s employment-to-population ratio28 was 62.8 percent, excluding the Donbas and the near
conflict-affected oblasts. A similar estimate is found in the Donbas region and higher in the near
conflict-affected oblasts (65 percent), where a large number of IDPs are currently situated. Unem-
ployment rates in 2013 were also similar in the rest of Ukraine and the Donbas region—around
7.3 percent. Estimates were lower (6.5 percent) in the conflict-affected oblasts. The three indi-
cators—labor force participation rate, employment ratio, and unemployment rate—provide an
indirect indication of the labor market’s economic activity level.
The Donbas region had comparable levels of economic activity, especially in metallurgy and en-
ergy, and is intertwined with international markets (especially through exporting to the Russian
Federation). According to the most recent State Statistics Service data (for January through Sep-
tember 2014), the unemployment rate for the 15–70 population was 10.2 and 10.4 percent for
men and women respectively. However, given the difficulty collecting information in parts of the
Donbas region, these figures will likely be revised (upwards).
From the employment perspective, and in the short term, having economically active neighboring
oblasts and other economically active regions (such as Kyiv city) has served to buffer some of the
unemployment pressures and difficulties in labor market integration. But based on the analysis
presented below, it is unlikely that the skills of many potential IDPs are aligned with the needs of
employers in the nearby oblasts or other parts of Ukraine. The willingness of employers to offer
work to potentially temporary workers is also unclear, especially in a generally stagnant economy.
Another important factor is whether IDPs are interested in or are able to seek new employment.
By early February 2015, the number of IDPs who expressed a need to access employment was
around 85,487 persons.29 This estimate is low given that official figures of work-able IDPs living
across Ukraine were around 219,042 in late January 2015. Map 1 shows that work-able IDPs have



28  The employment-to-population ratio is calculated as the total number of employed divided by the total number of workers in the
working-age range, which can be from 15 years of age or older, or the official working age, or the internationally comparable working
age range (15–64). In this note, some estimates are made for the 15+ working population, and not for the 15–64 range. Many Ukraini-
ans work past the official retirement age, and some work well above the age of 64.
29  At the start of the assessment, in October 2014, only 21,741 IDPs had approached the State Employment Service seeking various
types of assistance. Of those individuals, around 40 percent were still officially listed as employed at their previous firm, and approxi-
mately 10 percent did not have any documentation. While 10,445 of the overall number declared that they were unemployed, only
4,829 were formally registered to receive unemployment insurance benefits.

regions such as Poltava or Sumy, or even Donetsk itself, we can posit that it may be more difficult
for IDPs locating there to find employment. As more IDPs seek refuge in those regions (and dis-
tricts in Donetsk), higher unemployment rates are likely.
It is also important to note that the average inactivity rates (defined as all people within the work-
ing age but not actively seeking employment) for men and women in Ukraine is around 32 per-
cent, with similar estimates in the Donbas region and lower (30 percent) in the near-conflict
oblasts. The inactive population is heterogeneous; it includes people currently studying or train-
ing, people doing household work, pensioners, and disabled. The inactivity rate of women be-
tween the ages of 15 and 64 is around 37 percent in the conflict and near-conflict areas. Many of
these women are work-able and could potentially enter the labor market when they complete or
interrupt their studies, or if they lose their main income source (as may have happened as a result
of the conflict). In other words, about 40 percent of the inactive are work-able and not receiving
pensions, and may become active job seekers.
Economic sector of work

Conflict has adversely affected the industrial sector. Across Ukraine, the agricultural sector em-
ployed over 4 million workers (or 20 percent), and the wholesale and retail trade and manufac-
turing sectors employed around 3.5 million (or 17 percent) and 2.5 million (13 percent) of work-
ers respectively.30 The performance of the wholesale and retail trade and manufacturing sectors
has been severely affected by the conflict in the Donbas. Figure 13 shows that overall industrial
production (including mining and processing) and retail turnover decreased in Ukraine (compar-
ing the performance of 2014 to the same period in 2013).

and 31 percent lower in Donetsk. Even though much of industry encompasses larger firms, there
is some light industry in the region and many smaller firms provide downstream or upstream
goods and services. It is estimated that about 78 percent of the industrial capacity in Donetsk is

outside of the government-controlled areas, and the estimate is higher in Luhansk (84 percent);
these territories are the epicenter of the war, and the firms located there have endured the most
damage. Thus, it is probable that much of the observed decreases in other sectors, namely the
retail trade sector, are a result of the drastic industrial slowdown. In addition, many small and
medium firms, and self-employed people, are likely to continue seeing their revenues decrease as
the conflict limits economic activity.

The declines in economic activity in conflict-affected areas will have significant impacts on em-
ployment. The importance of the industrial sector (including mining and processing) and retail
sectors, and the challenge posed by firm closures and overall slowdown of these sectors, is il-
lustrated in Figure 14. The economic sectors are shown in descending order in terms of the em-
ployment share in the conflict area. Before the conflict, the manufacturing sector was the main
employment sector in the Donbas region; it employed more than 550,000 workers. Wholesale
and retail sectors employed around half a million people, while extractive activities such as min-
ing and quarrying employed 380,000 (or 13 percent). Agriculture is fourth in importance, it em-
ployed around 310,000 workers (or 10 percent of) workers. Regions near the conflict-affected
region have a large manufacturing sector, comparable to the Donbas in terms of the share (18.6
percent) of workers employed, which translates to almost 700,000 workers. Mining and quarry-
ing outside the Donbas on the other hand is smaller in terms of workforce size.

Evidence suggests that it may be difficult to integrate workers from Donbas into other regions
because manufacturing and mining sectors contain distinct subsectors. For instance, mining in
the Donbas region is largely focused on coal and lignite, whereas mining in the nearby regions is
largely focused on metal ores (see Figure A1 in the annex). Manufacturing in the Donbas is large-



                                                                                                                    Volume II:

ly focused on manufacturing basic metals and employs around 360,000 people, whereas basic
metal manufacturing is less common in other parts of Ukraine. In terms of employment, the larg-
er manufacturing subsectors in other parts of Ukraine are food products, clothing and apparel,
wood products, and machinery and equipment. Distinctions stem partly from the requirements
for these sectors to exist; for instance, natural resource endowments, proximity to supply and
export markets, and the level of sophistication and specialization required, among other factors.
Such differences, accompanied by the economic viability of the sector to absorb more workers,
limits the ease of integrating manufacturing or mining workers from the Donbas region into these
sectors in other parts of Ukraine, at least in the short term and without intensive training.

The public–private and gender dimensions of employment reveal interesting patterns. More than
one-third of all economically active workers in the Donbas region worked in state-owned enter-
prises (SOEs) and public sector, and almost half work in private enterprises.31 The remainder
work in the private sector. When broken down by gender, about 42 percent of women in the
Donbas region are employed in the public sector, and 42 percent in the private sector. In the
public sector, they are largely concentrated in education (31 percent), health care (23 percent),
public administration (12 percent), and transport/postal service (10 percent). Around 8 percent
of women work in the extractive mining sector. One-third of men work in public sector or state-
funded enterprises; and a substantial share holds posts in the extractive mining sector (38 per-
cent), with public administration and defense account also significant (14 percent), with an equal
share in transport/storage and postal services. Women and men working in SOEs and public
sector jobs have distinct education levels—women have substantially higher levels of education
than men. About 75 percent of women have tertiary education or higher, while only 46 percent
of men do.

A notable characteristic of the Donbas region is the large magnitude of workers that depend on
state employment. In the short term this may be a favorable characteristic, because many of these
workers will have access to unemployment and other benefits that can help them cope with the
unemployment period. However, in the recovery phase, workers previously employed by the state
are potentially more likely to have reemployment expectations.

As mentioned previously, half of all workers in the Donbas are employed in the private sector (see
Table A1 in the annex). The processing and manufacturing sector is by far the most important
private sector employer of women (37 percent) and men (41 percent) in the Donbas region. One-
fourth of women are employed in wholesale and retail while 18 percent of men work in privately-
held mining and extractive firms. Similar to the public sector, women employed in the private sec-
tor have higher levels of education than men; approximately 61 percent of women (compared to
46 percent for men) have tertiary education or higher. As reported by official government sources,
a large share of registered IDPs are women, and the vast majority of IDPs seeking employment
(as of October 2014) have completed some form of vocational training, secondary education, or
tertiary education. Only a few of the registered IDPs had lower levels of education, had worked in
unskilled occupations, or had no professional skills at all.32



31  Private enterprises as presented here include two distinct types of firms: (i) joint stock; limited partnership, with full, partial,
or additional responsibility; association, corporation, concern, consortium; cooperative, collective enterprise; and (ii) private, rented,
family enterprise, private company (institution, establishment), farm, registered as legal entity. These are clearly distinct types of
firms; the first type employs about 40 percent of all workers while the second only 15 percent.

Another interesting feature of the Donbas region is the high concentration (60 percent) of work-
ers employed in relatively larger (50+ employee) firms. This is true for both men and women in
their prime working age. For instance, 40 percent of all workers in the region are 25–49 years of
age and work in larger firms (see Figure A2 in the annex). About 95 and 87 percent of workers
in mining and quarrying, and manufacturing, respectively, work in larger firms. Only workers in
the wholesale retail and construction sectors are in predominantly smaller firms. Some (largely
anecdotal) evidence suggests that, despite several subsectors (and firms) having reduced their
production as a result of the conflict, many workers remain attached to their employment, and
some continue to receive salaries. This may be explained by the fact that large numbers of people
are employed in relatively larger firms in the manufacturing and mining (private) sectors, which
rely on specialized labor and prefer to retain experienced workers so that production can resume
as soon as the conflict ends.

Nearly 40 percent of IDPs registered in October of 2014 were still officially employed. It is esti-
mated that a considerable number of IDPs continue to be formally employed in the non-govern-
ment-controlled areas. In addition, even though they do not receive salaries and have no access
to their old employment, their official status is employed. Specific data on this group do not exist,
but data on those that have recently registered for the housing allowance via the MSP show that
out of the 642,861 who have registered as IDPs, 85,487 have said that they are “in need of work”
despite their official employment status. For those who continue to be attached and receive sala-
ries, it is unclear how long their employers will be able to retain these workers and pay salaries
if full production does not resume. Therefore, many workers who may now be displaced but not
actively searching for employment are likely to begin searching for jobs in the near future if the
conflict persists, as their employers can no longer fulfill their payroll responsibilities, and as their
savings/assets become depleted.

Employment situation: Reduction in labor demand
Employment patterns in Ukraine have been unfavorable for a few years, but there has recently
been a sharp drop in formal employment stocks. Figure 15 shows the stock of formal employment
in Ukraine as reported by employers to the State Statistical Agency. There is one consideration for
the sudden drop in April 2014 (orange line); it marks the exclusion of employment stocks from
Crimea and Sevastopol City. The dotted black line marks the peak of the conflict when no reliable
data was collected from the East; data began to be collected again in September 2014 (mainly
from the area controlled by Ukrainian authorities), and the sudden decrease since then is a reflec-
tion of the employment stock in Ukraine.33

It is clear from the available data that apart from human losses, the conflict has directly affected
the ability of the Dongas region labor market to sustain existing jobs and create new ones (Figure
16). The harmful effect of the conflict, coupled by other macroeconomic factors, has also had de-
teriorated the ability of the broader economy to create new jobs. As expected, the contraction is
most striking in the conflict-affected regions. Preliminary figures show that a reduction in net em-
ployment from December 2013 to December 2014 has been around 40 percent in Donetsk and 70
percent in Luhansk (the right hand axis shows the percentage change). These reductions amount
to a total of about 800,000 jobs in the Donbas region alone (the green line refers to the left axis,

Ukraine Recovery and Peacebuilding Assessment
Analysis of Crisis Impacts and Needs in Eastern Ukraine                                                                                                                    70
plus extraction of peat—an industry that is almost fully located in the Donbas region—saw a 52
percent decrease in jobs (136,000 of them). Such findings are not surprising since it is estimated
that of the 93 coal mines in the Donbas region, 12 are destroyed and 55 are not functioning; as
a result, the average daily production of coal dropped by nearly 60 percent. The manufacturing
of basic metals, food products, machinery and equipment, and chemicals—among the larger in-
dustrial employers, outside of mining—have seen substantial decreases in net employment, of
about 172,000 jobs altogether. There are reports that the machine-building production facilities
of Luhansk Teplovoz (the large producer of locomotives) have been destroyed, that two metal
production plants in Donetsk have stopped production, and that a metalwork plant in Alchevskiy
is not operational.

The plant and firm closures reported in this section account for large numbers of employees work-
ing in larger formal firms; however, the total number of workers affected is not known. Accurate
estimates are difficult to calculate because many workers are not employed in large plants and
are only indirectly affected by the reductions in production. In developed countries it is estimated
that for every job in the tradable (industrial) sector, between three and five jobs are created in
the nontradable sector (these are jobs in wholesale and retail, public and private services) to pro-
vide services to the workers in that sector and for themselves. There are no similar estimates for
Ukraine, and one approximation in the Donbas region is 3.5, which is the ratio of industrial jobs
to nonindustrial jobs in the region. However, using a much more conservative estimate of two,
one can try to estimate potential job losses as a result of the conflict. There were over 930,000
workers employed in industry—mining and manufacturing—in the Donbas region in 2013. Most
of these industries have substantially reduced their production.34 Assuming that on average in-
dustry is operating at 40 percent (so 60 percent is temporarily or permanently shut down35), then
about 560,000 jobs in the tradable sector would be temporarily or permanently lost. If for every
one of those jobs two are lost in the nontradable sector, then the total job loss would be estimated
at 1.68 million. This significant share amounts to 56 percent of the employed (only) population
in the Donbas region; however, that estimate excludes the people who were already unemployed
(231,000). Assuming these people continue to be unemployed then the total rises to 1.91 million,
or 59 percent of the economically active (employed and unemployed) workforce.36

It is important to note that it is very likely that many of the workers who potentially lost their job
have work experience and skills that are in demand in other parts of Ukraine or abroad. It is es-
timated that some people emigrated to the Russian Federation or to other neighboring countries
such as Belarus, Moldova, Poland, Hungary, and Romania, while others may have stayed in the
region and joined the fighting. Others may have gone to other parts of Ukraine and found employ-
ment. In fact, official data shows that only a minor fraction of those potentially unemployed and
displaced have registered with the State Employment Service as of February 2015. Anecdotal
evidence obtained from interviews with IDPs show that there are some opportunities to find em-
ployment in their new localities, but the jobs are usually at levels not commensurate with IDPs’



34  An estimated 80 percent of the Donbas economy’s formal sector is not operational. Q4 2014 figures show year-on-year declines
in industrial production of 60 percent in Donetsk and 85 percent in Luhansk. It has been reported that 19 out of 23 major enterprises
in Luhansk oblast have closed, while half of the enterprises in Donetsk oblast are experiencing job cuts and partial employment.
35  The 60 percent estimate used to calculate job losses is derived from the estimate for the Donetsk oblast. The estimated produc-
tion losses for Luhansk are much higher, but its workforce amounts to a smaller share (one-third) of the total workforce in the Donbas
region. The estimate is a conservative one and represents a lower-bound estimate.
36  Using the 15+ age range, there were approximately 2.9 million employed people in the Donbas region in 2013, and 231,000
unemployed people in the same year. The total is 3.2 million economically active people.

Occupations and skills of the economically active
population in eastern Ukraine
Immediate (potential) job displacement in the conflict-affected region has been obtained by ana-
lyzing the economic sectors in which workers were employed prior to the conflict and by taking
into account the damage that has been inflicted on those sectors and the jobs they offer. Previous
sections attempted to quantify the potential job losses and identify the sectors that have been
most negatively affected by the losses. This section focuses on understanding the profiles of peo-
ple who may have lost their job as a result of the conflict, and those who were unemployed and
who may be unable to access a job in the current situation.

The employment center in Zaporizhzhia city conducted a brief survey of IDPs registering there
and reported on the job opportunities that exist. The figures are disaggregated by major profes-
sional groups, and while they may not be sufficient by quantity and quality, they are at least suit-
able as trend indicators. There are two major trends that can be reliably observed: (i) the number
of job seekers per vacancy has at least doubled in recent months; and (ii) salary levels of open
vacancies have dropped to half of the average salary of employed persons in that region in nomi-
nal terms. Trends in Zaporizhzhia highlight the fact that many of the IDPs may be entering labor
markets that were already strained, and their presence—and competition for jobs and downward
pressure on wages—likely exacerbate potential tensions with local communities. According to
the survey, jobs in the agriculture sector have recently been on the rise (though it is unclear how
demand will change in the winter), and there seems to also be demand for unskilled workers.

Work occupations and wages
Given the predominance of industry and mining in the conflict-affected region, a large share (30
percent) of workers in the region held operational (blue-collar) occupations in industry, mining,
and construction. These occupations include metal, machinery and related jobs, extraction and
building trade jobs, miners, construction workers, and plant workers and operators in factories
of machines and transport equipment, among others. Another significant share (20 percent) of
workers in the region who are likely to have been negatively affected are salespersons, service
workers, and clerks in shops and offices. The professional occupational category is the most var-
ied, as it contains many distinct professions and accounts for 19 percent of workers. The profes-
sional category includes teachers and professors, physical and mathematical professionals, engi-
neers, and life science and health professionals. In the managerial category, workers classified as
directors and chief executives, corporate managers, and managers of small enterprises amount
to 7 percent (Figure 18). Occupations in the figure are shown in descending order in terms of
employment in the conflict-affected area.

The estimate for white-collar occupations (including salespeople and clerks) in the conflict-af-
fected region is in line with the estimates in nearby regions, as well as the rest of Ukraine. This
comparison does not mean that white-collar workers from the Donbas will be easily absorbed
into other areas if they seek employment, but it indicates that their occupation is commonplace
in other parts of Ukraine, thus making it easier for them to seek similar work, even if it is in a dif-
ferent sector. On the other hand, blue-collar occupations (about 30 percent) common in the Don-
bas region are less common in the nearby oblasts, where only 23 percent of jobs are classified as
blue collar, and much less so in the rest of Ukraine (18 percent). One implication of such distinct
occupational differences is that blue-collar workers from the Donbas region may find it difficult
(more so than white-collar workers) to find similar work in other parts of Ukraine; as a result
they may be more vulnerable to unemployment, and seek similar work in other countries where
labor demand for mining and manufacturing workers is higher. Most blue-collar workers that stay
in Ukraine will likely require retraining and retooling to access employment. And even when the
conflict ends, the sectors where they were active prior to the conflict—namely mining—may not
sufficiently recover to reemploy them.

In 2014, a new survey collected information from employers throughout Ukraine (except in
Crimea, Sevastopol, and the Donbas region) in four growing sectors: agribusiness growers, agri-
business food processors, information technology, and renewable energy.37 These companies
were asked for their most recent hiring patterns and about their desire to hire new people. Figure
A3 in the annex shows that in Kyiv oblast and Kyiv city, most of the new hires were profession-
als and technical staff in the information and communication technology (ICT) sector. Few blue-
collar jobs were in demand.

By contrast, blue-collar occupations have been in highest demand near conflict-affected areas—
in Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, and Dnipropetrovsk. Elementary workers, plant and machine operators,
and trade workers were all in high demand by the agribusiness and food production manufactur-
ing sectors. This gives some indication that IDPs with experience working blue-collar jobs in the



37  Using labor force survey data we estimate that about 165,000 people worked in these subsectors in the Donbas region prior to

ties in the neighboring areas. On the other hand, only a fraction of skilled professionals, especially
in the ICT sector, were hired in the neighboring regions, contrary to the hiring patterns observed
in Kyiv city and oblast. If displaced workers seek to stay outside the Donbas region, it will be

demand; this can be done by empowering them with access to labor demand–related information
and providing financial assistance to those that cannot afford to move but would benefit from do-
ing so.

prices, and communal service tariffs. Conflict-affected regions prominently feature wage cuts and
wage arrears, especially as employers are not producing. Cash shortages due to unpaid salaries
and transfers, as well as breakdowns in the Donbas banking and financial systems, have limited

being blamed for pushing up prices, rents, and unemployment. Grievances with the authorities’
failure to protect local residents from these economic burdens were commonly expressed to the
RPA teams. Figure 19 shows that real wages in Ukraine declined in 2014; as expected, the most
drastic decline is in Luhansk and Donetsk.

Micro-small enterprises and entrepreneurial activity
Considering the large concentration of big industries in the Donbas region, most of the micro,
small, and medium enterprises (or MSMEs which are defined here as firms employing 1 to 49
workers) in the Donbas area were founded to engage in downstream or upstream linkages with
the major industrial enterprises. Proximity to agricultural lands led to the opening of a mod-
est number of agricultural processing enterprises and light industry. The vast majority of these
smaller firms provide services and engage in trade-related activities. About 41 percent of work-
ers report being employed in a firm with fewer than 50 employees (see Figure A2 in the annex);
but this estimate includes people in public sector services such as schools and hospitals, and
branches of larger firms.

Large enterprises were affected first in the spring by deteriorating relations with the Russian Fed-
eration—the main export market—and then by military action in the East. Many MSMEs are likely
to have also experienced a decline in their activity in the conflict-affected areas, given that their
economic activity is likely to be directly linked to the shrinking activity of large enterprises. The
military conflict has amplified the negative trends, including through partial or complete physi-
cal damage. As a consequence of the above direct and indirect impacts, MSMEs are expected to
have also lowered their economic activities by similar estimates as the larger firms. These smaller
firms will likely necessitate a set of interventions that focus on providing access to capital to re-
open, restock, and rehire workers, and perhaps even reconstruct their establishments.



                                                                                                                                   Volume II:
                                                                       75                                             FULL COMPONENT REPORTS
Apart from small businesses, there were also entrepreneurs in the Donbas region. These are often
classified as self-employed or employers in the nationally representative data. This section ex-
cludes people who are self-employed (and informal) because they have lower levels of education
and have limited wage employment choices. The analysis here includes only people who are self-
employed and have higher education levels, and those who employ others. Figure A5 in the annex
shows that a substantial amount of people (56,000) are engaged in entrepreneurial activity in
the wholesale and retail, and repair sectors. The remaining breakdown of work is in professional
services of various types (22,000), construction (7,000), and construction and manufacturing to
a lesser extent.

Much like MSMEs, entrepreneurs who were registered and have ceased operations likely need
support to temporarily (or permanently) shut down their businesses so that they do not continue
to accrue costs (such as taxes). From April–November 2014, he Chamber of Commerce and In-
dustry issued 1,200 Force Majeure certificates for medium-sized companies, but many small en-
terprises and individual entrepreneurs did not request them. They simply left the regions—with
some of them suffering a complete loss of all business assets.

Those entrepreneurs and micro-small businesses that wish to continue operating are unable to
do so largely due to credit constraints and the absence of reliable suppliers. Anecdotal evidence
shows that suppliers demand an up-front payment of 100 percent of the price of supplied goods,
compared to 15 percent in the pre-conflict period. In addition, there are few suppliers in the area,
and many of their old suppliers are no longer operating. Like MSMEs, entrepreneurs looking to
return to the conflict-affected region will need help to reengage in their previous economic activ-
ity and to grow their businesses.

Productive capacities and livelihoods
Understanding sector trends, strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities is in general very impor-
tant for development programming. However, in conflict and post-conflict circumstances, critical
human needs take precedence. The priority is on livelihoods programming—the timely imple-
mentation of measures to improve the welfare of those adversely affected by the crisis, both in

terms of addressing their immediate needs and promoting more permanent solutions.

Productive capacities were affected by both the conflict and the macroeconomic problems. The
ceasefire that took effect in late summer 2014 left the vast majority of the Donbas’s industrial
capacity in the hands of the separatists. Donbas inhabitants who remained in government-con-
trolled areas are therefore more likely to rely on agriculture and services (especially those pro-
vided by the state), as well as social transfers, for their livelihoods. Productive capacities in the
conflict-affected regions have also been hit by the macroeconomic problems affecting the rest
of Ukraine, including exchange rate instability, growing inflation, declining employment, a grid-
locked banking system, and disruption in supply and demand chains (on both domestic markets
and abroad).

These hardships have affected virtually all population groups in the Donbas region. Conflict-af-
fected areas have also experienced sharp increases in rents, food prices, and communal service
tariffs, as well as wage cuts. Income-generating opportunities as well as access to water, food,
medicine, shelter, and other basic goods and services have been severely limited. Precrisis figures
indicate that cash transfers (such as pensions, stipends, and social assistance) accounted for 33
percent of household incomes in both Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. However, cash shortages
due to unpaid salaries and transfers, as well as to breakdowns in Donbas’s banking and financial
systems, have limited households’ abilities to purchase those supplies that are available. Reliance
on remittances and subsistence agriculture—which in the Donbas’s urban setting can be quite
problematic—is increasing. In some communities, IDPs have been blamed for pushing up prices,
rents, and unemployment. Anger at the authorities for failing to protect local residents from these
economic burdens was commonly expressed to the RPA teams.

Primary impacts
The negative trend before the onset of the conflict is to be noted. Enterprises in these regions suf-
fer from the same problems as those in the rest of Ukraine and are now challenged by additional
conflict-related troubles—insecurity, disruption in supply and market chains, difficulties in trans-
porting goods through areas not under government control or insecure areas, difficulties in ac-
cessing finance, and a decline in exports to Russia due to a slowdown within Russia and periodic
border disruptions.

Continuing displacement, winter, and weakened economic resilience among people in conflict
areas, IDPs, and host communities are worsening the humanitarian situation. A government de-
cree from early November 2014 has closed all government offices in non-government-controlled
areas, and halted funding of pensions, hospitals, schools, benefits, and other government services.
In addition, inflation and the negative impact on the national economy, as well as energy short-
ages, are affecting livelihoods.

Rural livelihoods are negatively affected by similar factors. The migration level among rural popu-
lations is estimated to be lower compared to the amount of IDPs from urban areas, which to some
extent is explained by the ownership of land plots, livestock, and lower mobility caused by age.
Like elsewhere in Ukraine, prior to the conflict rural areas of Donbas suffered from limited em-
ployment opportunities and unsatisfactory conditions for independent farming, which provided
little incentive to the young and middle-aged to envisage a future in their villages. The rural labor
force was in continuous decline, following outmigration, aging, and low fertility. In January 2014
the rural population of Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts accounted for 13 percent and 9 percent of
the total population, respectively. Support to rural livelihoods is of particular importance in this
respect.38

Secondary impacts
Given the region’s location at Ukraine’s eastern border, close economic relations with Russia have
long been important, and recent deteriorations in relations have had a crucial impact on exports.
The conflict has added to the already weak performance in the industrial sector. Decline in in-
dustrial production caused by ongoing military operations affects the employment situation and
income-generating opportunities of both men and women in the region. There is not only a lack
of employment opportunities, but also a mismatch between jobs offered on the labor market and
IDPs’ skills (for example, low-qualified jobs for highly qualified IDPs, or jobs in the agricultural
sector for factory and mine workers). Psychological factors further impact IDPs’ employment sit-
uation. For example work “on land” is commonly perceived with contempt among miners. Accord-
ing to the anecdotal evidence, young educated IDPs have the fewest problems with employment
and integration into host communities.

F
       ocusing on strengthening the links between the technical and social dimensions of local eco-
       nomic planning in the post-conflict context reflects the belief that, under present circum-
       stances, bringing together local resources to address the impacts of the crisis in the Donbas
is critical and must be supported. Local responses to the crisis have been critical in helping those
in need, and the country owes a great debt to the citizens of the communities who have received
the displaced as well as to local government officials for their selfless and prompt response to
their countrymen’s suffering. Their action, however, has been ad hoc and depends entirely on local
initiative and capacity. From a systemic perspective, the impact of the conflict on local planning
concerns the extent to which they accelerate, promote, support, or retard the processes by which
municipalities and communities can be mobilized to address post-conflict reconstruction and de-
velopment challenges.

Primary impacts
The primary impact of the crisis on this sector has actually been positive—local governments,
civic organizations, and people have mobilized, organized, and taken action to address their com-
munities’ immediate needs. However, their capacities are limited and over several months, the
resilience of many of communities has been exhausted. Moreover, forward economic planning has
been difficult to implement in an environment of budgetary uncertainty, ambiguity over the future
of the conflict, and uncertainty over the ultimate number of IDPs that continue to flow from con-
flict areas in the East. Even if effective forward planning were possible now, no efficient mecha-
nisms exist to include these displaced into local economic planning processes.

Local governments lack the political mandate, legal authority, institutional capacity, and resources
needed to autonomously discharge local development planning responsibilities. There are also
no established partnerships with local CSOs or informal IDP representatives that could usefully
aggregate and articulate grassroots needs and priorities. Local initiatives are stressed and can no
longer be counted on to provide additional recovery assistance without external support.

Secondary impacts
The conflict itself has been accompanied by increases in local social and political activism. This
grassroots activity also includes reconciliation efforts and thus offers a certain hope in terms of
prospects for mobilizing local communities around social projects for reconciliation and recovery.
However, while the developments of 2013–2014 have built certain “bonding/bridging social capi-
tal” within certain groups, they have also heightened divisions among a number of political, ethnic,
and regional cleavages.39 This has weakened the social capital and tolerance ultimately needed for
peacebuilding, reconciliation, and recovery. This bodes less well for prospects to mobilize local
communities around social projects for reconciliation and recovery.



39  These cleavages include, among other things, differences along: (i) ethnic lines (such as the Russian/Ukrainian divide); (ii)
regional lines (Donbas versus the rest of Ukraine); and (iii) political lines, concerning such issues as the desired extent and pace of
decentralization. These three cleavages have nuances that would need to be unpacked to fully understand their significance for post-
conflict recovery prospects.

                           7. PRIVATE SECTOR AND SMES

Apart from the labor impacts described above, various constraints and barriers prohibit the de-
velopment of a strong SME sector in Ukraine. These have been detailed many times in different
reports; however, it is still useful to reiterate some of the main ones here in line with this back-
ground:
•	 Widespread corruption and the arbitrary and fragmented application of the law, which makes
   the business environment unpredictable
•	 Confusion and duplication in the roles and responsibilities of government institutions and
   agencies, whose remit is to support business development and investment
•	 Lack of a coordinated and rationalized business support organization network that can pro-
   vide high quality and relevant business support services to SMEs
•	 A system of vocational education that fails to assess the real demand and equip workers with
   the skills needed in the private sector

Primary impacts
The conflict has severely affected the large enterprises, many of which are in areas outside of
government control, and this has led to a decline of SME activity in Donetsk and Luhansk. Dete-
riorating relations with Russia and then military action in the East affected large enterprises. As a
consequence SMEs have reduced the majority of their economic activity and reduced jobs.
Most SMEs have not taken any steps toward revitalizing businesses in post-conflict areas given
the security situation. Rather than requesting Force Majeure certificates, many small enterprises
and individual entrepreneurs simply left the region—with some of them completely losing all
business assets. For those that stayed, credit has dried up. Retail companies report suppliers de-
mand total payment for supplied goods upfront, compared to 15 percent prior to the conflict. In
addition, they face the frequent need to identify new suppliers because the old ones are gone, and
thus the costs of doing business rise steadily.

Secondary impacts
The reduction in private-sector activity means a significant reduction in national and local rev-
enue from taxes and fees. Recovery is threatened due to problems throughout the entire life cycle
of a company from business registration through operations and into voluntary liquidation. In
the near term, this negative impact on firms’ legal standing and access to credit threatens their
survival, and in the medium and long term complicates the resumption of business operations.
Business start-up and reregistration for those coming from areas outside government control is
extremely difficult. The lack of documentation required as per the Law on State Registration of
Legal Entities and Individual Entrepreneurs cannot be fulfilled because these confirmative docu-
ments in many cases have been lost. Operations are also threatened by a lack of necessary docu-
mentation for obtaining permissive acts, licenses, authorizations, certificates, and so on, and the
limited capacity to fulfil tax and reporting obligations as requirements of relevant laws are ap-
plied with no exemption despite the region’s post-conflict situation. Also, voluntary liquidation
of companies falls under standard norms of the tax code, civil code regulations, and so on. This
prevents SMEs that are willing to move from doing so, and directly hampers recovery.

  8. OVERVIEW OF SHORT-TERM (24-MONTH)
 RECOVERY OBJECTIVES, OUTCOMES, AND NEEDS


T
      he following sections set out recommendations for each subsector, including interventions
      targeted at particular segments of the population as well as those with a broader applica-
      tion. All people feel the economic impact regardless of demographic descriptors, gender,
age, or income aspects, but it is important to recognize that the conflict affects different groups
and individuals differently, and the elderly, women, children, and persons with disabilities might
in some cases be particularly vulnerable in terms of employment, livelihoods, and income gen-
eration. Vulnerable groups are also likely to be less able to protect the real value of their assets,
especially if inflation remains high or rises further.

Based on extensive field research by three separate economic assessment teams building on les-
sons learned and best practices identified in economic recovery efforts in conflict areas around
the world, this section highlights suggestions for prioritized recovery interventions. These will be
crucial to address critical needs and support the country’s transition toward full economic recov-
ery, with the understanding that the feasibility of some proposed interventions depends on im-
provements in the security environment and a resolution of the crisis. All interventions serve as
quick response measures and are envisioned to have an implementation time frame of 24 months.
Most of the proposed interventions are based on documented, communicated, and clearly defined
needs. Some are of a more complicated nature and will require additional information and discus-
sion with the government as part of the ongoing review and assessment process.

Employment: Recommendations and costs
Objectives and key needs

Employment has deteriorated throughout Ukraine in the last year, largely as a result of the con-
flict; the deterioration has been substantial in the Donbas region. Even though production has
halted or slowed down substantially in large and smaller firms, and entrepreneurs have shut
down their businesses, only a subset of firms—shops, factories, mines, among others—have been
damaged or destroyed (see infrastructure damage assessment section). Much of the damage has
been to the supply of energy and infrastructure (electricity, water, and transport), rather than
physical damage to the plants. The magnitude of the damage varies by district, and by whether
the area is (or was) under rebel control.

In areas that were previously taken by rebels but retaken by the Ukrainian government, some of
the infrastructure damage has begun to be (or has already been) repaired. In some cases, pro-
duction has resumed and economic activity revived. The following six concerns continue to af-
fect economic activity in the region: (i) security-related concerns; (ii) disruption in supply-and-
demand chains; (iii) difficulties transporting goods through the conflict zone; (iv) difficulties in
accessing finances; (v) very high risk perception and adverse investor sentiment; and (vi) decline
in demand for exports to Russia due to a slowdown there as well as periodic stoppages of exports

Addressing the aforementioned concerns now and in the postrecovery stage will be central to
reviving economic activity in the Donbas region. Also important will be measures to support
Ukraine’s overall economic recovery—by stabilizing the economy and undertaking structural re-



                                                                                               Volume II:
                                                 81                               FULL COMPONENT REPORTS
forms. It is important to view the recovery of conflict-affected regions within the broader context
of Ukraine’s recovery. In the longer term, mechanisms for increasing the full recovery of the Don-
bas region should be put in place to allow people who have left and those who remain to have
access to economic opportunities and be able to prosper. The recommendations that follow focus
on addressing the short-term needs through a proposed set of initiatives to help IDPs and people
in communities that have hosted large numbers of IDPs.
Solutions

Many IDPs in need of work have employed some coping strategy either by themselves, through
nonstate employment organizations, or with assistance from their personal social network. But
many IDPs are in urgent need of income (and employment), which requires a more comprehen-
sive approach, mainly from the state employment services, and financial assistance from the cen-
tral government and the donor community. Given the magnitude of the need stemming not only
from the influx of IDPs but also from host communities facing increasing unemployment rates,
it is sensible to recommend that the state employment services be enlarged and revamped. The
needs are especially high in the localities that host most work-able IDPs (see Map 1 for the ratio
of work-able individuals to the working population).

Sustained job creation and labor market recovery can be achieved only through employment poli-
cies that are well informed by lessons of what has worked in similar situations, and customizing
them to the Ukrainian context. Appropriate customization can only be achieved by using reliable
data sources and extensive local-level knowledge. The recommendations proposed here draw
from lessons learned from other countries (South Africa, South Korea, Latvia, Argentina, and El
Salvador), while also taking into account the local context.

In the short term, while many people continue to be displaced and/or unemployed, the focus
should be to help them successfully integrate into their current location or reintegrate them into
their own community when it becomes safe. A lesson from international experience is that suc-
cessful integration (and reintegration) depends largely on people being self-reliant through em-
ployment. Therefore, the focus of short-term assistance should be on identifying strategies to
enhance access to employment for IDPs. A second lesson learned from international experience
is to include host communities in programs established to help IDPs. An inclusive approach will
be critical for people most affected by the growing competition for jobs, namely the current un-
employed and underemployed, to avoid the deterioration of IDP–host relations. Table 17 outlines
the six overarching objectives and proposed short-term activities recommended to facilitate labor
market integration.

Short-term recommendations revolve around two actions: (i) addressing legal and informational
barriers to employment; and (ii) reforming existing active labor market programs (managed by
the state employment services) so that it can become a crisis response work program that effec-
tively and efficiently helps IDPs and the unemployed in host communities.

Legal and informational barriers
IDPs face various legal barriers that hinder them from accessing services by the State Employ-
ment Service, make them liable to the tax authorities, or hinder them from starting a new busi-
ness in the new locality. One of the most common barriers is having the wrong legal employment
status. Anecdotal evidence suggests that some workers remain registered as employed in their
former workplace, despite having left the job due to the conflict. This not only limits these people
from accessing unemployment benefits but also hinders them from finding a new job. Another
constraint is having insufficient documentation to prove work experience, education or certifica-
tions, or even identity.

Displaced individuals who have relocated to a new labor market with few social and professional
networks face significant employment-related information barriers. To address this, job search
support should be enhanced by growing the labor market information system. This requires
strengthening the capacities of the State Employment Service (and establishing partnerships with
other legal entities engaged in employment services provision in the regions) to improve their
information collection and dissemination. This revamped system should be set up first based on
existing information, with the quality of the content improved over time. This not only includes
revamping the information system so that it provides up-to-date job-related information for all
skill levels, but also to establish proactive mechanisms to incentivize employers (through tax
breaks and financial and other incentives) to post all vacancies in their revamped labor market
information system. All registered IDPs and active job seekers will be channelled to the portal
and IDPs will be guided through the search process to get them acquainted with the local labor
market’s needs, and the needs in other labor markets where their skills may be in more demand.

Another informational constraint stems from the limited ability of the state employment services
to collect regular labor market data and to conduct analysis that will improve the agency’s ser-
vices and overall effectiveness. In the short term, assistance should be provided to the state em-
ployment services to collect information on IDPs and workforce in communities that host IDPs
so it can better monitor the crisis situation and so it can plan its services more effectively. Such
data can also be used to improve the local employment offices and change the content of courses
offered to be more responsive to employer needs. In the medium term, a data collection system
should be put in place so the state employment services can better respond to future crises.

Crisis Response Works Program
Evidence from other countries suggests that public works and temporary works programs can
be effective crisis response measures because they address short- and medium-term economic
hardships, as well as promote longer-term employment. These programs are social protection
instruments used in response to a variety of circumstances and create temporary jobs. The out-
put of public works programs has a double benefit, with temporary jobs providing wage income
to participations, and the creation of public goods. Public works are typically financed and/or
implemented by a national or regional government, or by a donor agency. Private employers carry
out temporary works, and the public employment services assist in the provision of workers (and
offer other forms of help; see below).

Ukraine’s State Employment Service has two schemes—public works and temporary works. They
currently serve as a channel for employment, albeit mostly temporary and low skill in nature. The
current objective of these programs is to provide short-term employment to unemployed per-

sons. However, the current program has several limitations that will need to be addressed to work
effectively as a crisis response measure. One of the limitations is that the law requires local gov-
ernments to cofinance the program. Such a cofinancing measure has at least two drawbacks; first,
it dissuades some local governments from using public works or temporary works at all, while
others use it for very short-term projects that limit the duration of the public works employment
to an average of one to two weeks. Second, cofinancing constrains poorer localities, those with
fewer resources to do public works and which are most vulnerable to shocks, from using public
works. The current system thereby limits the use of public works as a tool to help vulnerable
people when it is most needed.

The proposed reforms aim to bolster the capacity of the state employment services to respond to
the needs of all job seeking IDPs and members of the host communities, and to encourage employ-
ers to hire workers from the state employment services for temporary work schemes. The Crisis
Response Works Program (CRWP) consists of several mutually reinforcing components. It aims
to have a wide target of beneficiaries, from all skill levels. These include IDPs, the unemployed,
and underemployed and individuals working in the informal economy in host communities. The
short-term action will fall into two main categories: (i) policy reforms and initiatives to improve
government efficiency and effectiveness, as well as reforms that will encourage employer hiring;
and (ii) public works and temporary works programs that also integrate different services such as
job training, psychological counseling, and mobility and placement assistance.

The CRWP will begin by revamping the two existing works’ schemes in the state employment
services by addressing the limitations mentioned. For instance, the legislation will need to be
changed so that local governments are not limited by the cofinancing obligations and can freely
offer public works and temporary works schemes to IDPs and the local unemployed for a longer
period of time (up to 180 days, which is the legal limit) in places where IDPs are most present
and where labor market pressures abound. As highlighted previously, and based on countless
international evidence on the displaced and refugees, the success of the integration of displaced
people and improvements in social cohesion—between IDPs and host communities—can only
be possible if all local inhabitants who may benefit from the CRWP are eligible for participation.

To improve the ability of the state employment services to cope with large numbers of service
seekers, it will be important to convert the existing registration system—which already collects
data on job seekers—into a more functional profiling system so that service seekers are properly
“triaged” using the data already collected, and before they are assigned to a particular set of ser-
vices. As stated, such a system relies on registration data that is currently being collected, and the
process will only need to be reformatted so that the information collected can be better used to
determine the best match for reemployment for each individual. If reforming the registration sys-
tem is not feasible in the immediate term, it should be implemented in the short-to-medium term
so that the state employment services can continue to increase its coverage of beneficiaries, and
to increase the number of people assigned to the labor activation path and decrease the number
on social assistance.

To incentivize employers to hire workers from the state employment services for temporary
works, we recommend extending social security tax exemptions. Such exemptions would be eli-
gible for all workers—displaced as well as from the host community—hired for two weeks or lon-
ger. But as learned through consultations with the state employment services, there are localities
where employers do not respond fully to tax exemption incentives to hire IDPs or unemployed
workers to perform temporary work. This poses a potential risk to increasing employment of


                                                                                                Volume II:
                                                 85                                FULL COMPONENT REPORTS
IDPs and people in localities facing increasing labor market pressure. Such risk can be addressed
by providing additional incentives to employers in localities where IDPs are most present and la-
bor opportunities for locals are limited. Additional incentives could be partial wage compensation
(percentage should be determined using various data inputs) for workers in the most vulnerable
situations; such workers can include IDPs, new entrants to the labor market and long-term unem-
ployed in host communities. Given the potential financial burden of this aspect of the program, it
will be critical to establish clear eligibility criteria—vulnerable individuals from specific localities
should be eligible for the incentive. It will also be important to map out clear criteria for when
the wage incentive scheme will end, so it is clear it is a crisis response measure that should not be
expected to remain in place perennially.

As for the public works scheme, the goal is to convert it into an active crisis response tool that can
help work-able individuals with livelihood support (income), while simultaneously improving
public goods and increasing individuals’ labor market readiness. The program will also provide
training opportunities beyond the skills acquired on the job to prepare participants for possible
longer-term employment, self-employment, or further education and/or training. For example,
youth employed as manual laborers on a labor-intensive road project may be offered training in
building skills such as bricklaying, which will be very likely in demand in the Donbas region dur-
ing the reconstruction phase. Training activity may result in some form of accredited certification
that can be used to find longer-term employment elsewhere.

Keeping in mind that Ukrainians, like many of the registered IDPs, have relatively high levels of
education, it will be important to offer public works activities that cover all skill levels. In fact,
the current program has not been attractive to many semi-skilled or skilled workers because the
activities were mostly limited to low-skilled work. Therefore, it is very important to learn from
developed countries with similar schemes in times of crisis. Using triage mechanisms, individuals
will be steered toward activities based on their employment and educational backgrounds. The
system can also help the local employment service offices prioritize the groups that need the most
help. Given that local governments are in charge of planning the public works projects, and that
preparation requires drafting a detailed activity plan, it will be important to factor in (in terms of
time for preparation and costs) capacity training for local governments to enhance their capacity
to offer a menu of activities. This part of the process will need to be tackled in the immediate term
to ensure that the list of activities targets people from multiple skills levels and backgrounds.

It will be important to take into account measures for women to be able to work. This is of special
importance given that many of the unemployed IDPs registering are women. Measures such as
day care support for children can be incorporated into the public works program, or extension
of child care services in the new localities can be negotiated so that working mothers can access
services.

Lastly, the state employment services should not only facilitate access to labor market informa-
tion across the country for all job seekers, but also incentivize people—especially IDPs—to move
to labor markets where demand is higher by providing financial assistance for active mobility. To
promote mobility to labor markets that are more suitable for IDPs (given the cost of this incen-
tive, this part of the program may only be offered to IDPs and long-term unemployed) financial
incentives to move should be considered. Such financial support measures will be largely aimed
at avoiding clusters of unemployed people in localities where employment prospects are limited.
This may be undertaken using mobility vouchers, thus providing financial incentives for those
willing and able to move to an area that offers more long-term employment opportunities. They
may also be matched to training opportunities in the new locality so that people have more op-

portunities to become familiar with the local labor market context and needs.

Some of the activities discussed in these recommendations, such as subsidized temporary em-
ployment, are temporary measures to help people access income during the crisis period. They
have the dual benefit of enabling those people most affected by the crisis to be economically active
and earn income and also accrue work experience in new labor markets. The downside is that
they are not necessarily avenues for permanent employment or long-term labor market integra-
tion. The same is true for public works jobs; they are most helpful for getting cash to those most
vulnerable to long-term unemployment, while helping to (re)construct damaged infrastructure
and property, but they have a time limit and cannot be perennially offered to the same people. As
a result, the short-term approach also emphasizes investments in activities that have more lasting
effects, such as better data collection, mobility, and retraining vouchers, and measures that aim to
improve government service delivery effectiveness.
Estimated costs for the proposed short-term recommendations

Activities proposed in the previous section are estimated to cost between US$40 and 60 million.
The main difference between the three scenarios developed is the number of people to be offered
services. The first, second, and third scenarios are estimated to cost US$40, 50, and 60 million, re-
spectively. Other factors that will affect the actual costs of the employment subcomponent include
(i) the intensity of the treatment in terms of number of services to be provided and the length of
time benefits will be paid; (ii) the number of localities in which the program will be offered; (iii)
the amounts allocated to each benefit (for example, mobility vouchers, training vouchers, wage
support, type of public works supported); and (iv) the amount of resources that will be spent on
capacity training to the local governments and staff in the state employment services. Table 18
presents estimated costs for the three scenarios. The first scenario assumes that assistance will
be provided to 1.4 million job seekers; the second assumes 1.6 million, and the third assumes 1.8
million. All three scenarios include IDPs and job seekers from the host communities.

We used a three-step approach to estimate the number of people that may benefit from each sce-
nario. First, sum the total number of unemployed in the conflict-affected area, the near-conflict-af-
fected area, Kyiv oblast, and Kyiv city prior to the conflict. Sixty percent of previously unemployed
job seekers are expected to request services from the public employment services. This usage
estimate is higher than what the state employment services has seen in the recent past; however,
as the conflict continues, the economy continues to deteriorate, and services are improved, more
users are likely to request assistance. A 60 percent usage rate from the total unemployed in the
aforesaid regions translates to 366,000 people.

Second, as estimated in a previous section of this note, about 1.6 million previously employed
people from the Donbas region are deemed to be at risk of losing their jobs. The first scenario as-
sumes that 30 percent of these people will seek services from the public employment office. The
second and third scenarios assume 40 and 50 percent, respectively.

Third, given the deteriorating labor market conditions in the whole country, and the amount of
pressure that IDPs may be putting on host communities, there are likely to be segments of the
host population—new labor market entrants and less experienced people, low-skilled workers,
older workers, and women with young children—that are more vulnerable to job losses. Accord-
ingly, we assume that 10 percent of previously employed people will face unemployment and seek
services; we add this number to the total potential number of IDPs and unemployed to get the
total potential service seekers and CRWP participants.

We conclude by noting that not all state employment services participants and CRWP participants
will require the same intensity of treatment. For instance, some job seekers that are more easily
employable may only need a minimal set of services, such as training and access to job searches,
or a mobility voucher. On the other hand, a person that has been unemployed for a long period
of time may need a broader set of services. To increase the likelihood of success for each service
seeker, IDP, or host community member, and the financial viability of the program, a triage mecha-
nism will be put in place to ensure that each person is allocated an adequate set of services.

Productive capacities and livelihoods
Objective: To support the productive capacities’ development and help target groups meet their
immediate needs via livelihoods programs.

In this context, “livelihoods” involve improving the well-being of those adversely affected by the
crisis by providing them with opportunities to engage in productive economic activities. These
activities would need to address their most urgent needs and enable more permanent solutions.
Key Needs

As a result of the conflict, salaries are no longer paid, and many people cannot find stable jobs. The
specific primary impact is a very substantial number of people (among both IDPs and the local
population) without a living wage. While existing data do not allow us to specify a number, it is
clear that this amount is large and growing by the day.

In addition, the worsening economy has affected all layers of the population and has directly im-

pacted different aspects of life and well-being, including access to potable water, food, fodder
for livestock, basic services (such as medical treatment and education), shelter, and other basic
needs. As unemployment in the regions has increased significantly, it is extremely hard to find any
job, much less gainful employment at a previous level of remuneration that corresponds to job
seekers’ professional background and work experience, as the excess labor has depressed wages
and the types of jobs available are skewed toward lower-level positions.

Solutions
•	 Offer skills training in income-generating activities, including off-farm businesses and sup-
   port for micro and group businesses, including fostering service and consumer cooperatives,
   rural credit unions, and so on.
•	 Create or develop the existing networks of rural extension services that would benefit both
   IDPs resettled to rural areas and local rural residents. This would provide a wide range of
   advisory and training services to support people as they open and operate micro and small
   businesses to take advantage of a very broad range of market opportunities. According to the
   survey conducted in the framework of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
   CBA: Community Based Approach to Local Development project in rural area of Konstantyniv-
   ka raion (Donetsk oblast), backyard farming is the only source of livelihood for 50 percent
   of its residents. Rural populations lack the skills, inputs, and financial resources to optimize
   agricultural production.40 Basic training in business skills and financial literacy, supported by
   access to micro loans, would be of particular value to women and the less educated and to the
   larger rural population.
•	 Given the increasing number of children, elderly, and disabled people in the affected oblasts,
   provision of child care, elderly care, medical care, education, and psychological assistance
   services could be a possible income-generating opportunity.
•	 Elderly people should be integrated into the recovery and peacebuilding process whenever
   possible. This will help them cope with psychological trauma caused by the conflict and ease
   pressure on social services delivery. For example, cases of elderly women registering as IDPs,
   being issued humanitarian aid packages, and so on—even on a volunteer basis—were ob-

   they are also one of the most “abandoned” population groups. Special assistance programs for
   elderly people (including IDPs) are needed.
•	 Foster added value in agriculture through small- to medium-scale processing, improved sup-
   ply chains, marketing, and sales. A new agribusiness service center in Luhansk region (based
   out of Luhansk National Agricultural University) could offer business consulting services to
   agriculture-related businesses to maximize their chances of success in the difficult environ-
   ment while fostering growth.

Response Plan for eastern Ukraine (UNOCHA Ukraine, January 2015), the uncosted agricultural recovery needs for the Donbas region
over 24 months are farm machinery, agricultural inputs for IDPs, fruit seedlings, improved technology for larger farms, access to agri-
cultural insurance, and disaster risk reduction initiatives (FAO and Ukraine Ministry of Agrarian Policy, 2015).

      the transformation in thinking that helps develop the temperament needed to lead a posi-
      tive and productive life under very difficult circumstances. All people, irrespective of age and
      gender, who require assistance in training provision and skills development should be of-
      fered the opportunity. The 544 IDPs in a German-funded IDP settlement in Zaporizhzhia offer
      proof of this.

Local economic planning
Objective: to assist in mobilizing local resources for recovery in a productive and inclusive
manner.

This should be achieved through the design and implementation of local governance initiatives
that can meet communities’ immediate needs using existing in situ resources and improved local
development planning processes.
Key Needs

The Ukrainian government’s ability to address local governance issues in the regions concerned,
and to support the rapid emergence of more effective and accountable state institutions, is essen-
tial to the goal of achieving durable peace. The voices of all citizens must be represented in deci-
sion making. An inclusive planning process with the participation of all interested stakeholder
groups will address the critical needs in the affected areas in an efficient, flexible, cost-effective,
and rapid manner.

The participants of the consultation process highlighted a number of obstacles and challenges in
this respect.41 On the part of community groups and NGOs there is a need for better expertise in
working with authorities (regarding disclosure requests, advocacy, lobbying, public relations),
while local governments need to be better prepared to lead intensive and inclusive planning ini-
tiatives. At present, both lack the required knowledge and skills, in particular regarding public–
private partnership, strategic and operational planning, project-based approaches, and so on.

It is important to ensure that more women are directly involved in budget management and eco-
nomic planning at the raion, city administration, and village council level. It would be recom-
mended that local women’s NGOs be mainstreamed into the economic planning process, as eco-
nomic issues are not usually the focus of their activity.

Local governments need more legal authority so they can efficiently manage budgets and better
response to socioeconomic needs. For example, there is anecdotal evidence of effective allocation
of local budget funds in response to the IDPs’ inflow problems. However, since no respective legal
provisions for financial resource management were issued and no additional decision-making
power was delegated to local governments, local authorities took the initiative in helping IDPs at
their own risk.

Inflow of IDPs into the oblasts considered in the RPA has increased pressure on social services
delivery, increased the workload of civil servants employed in medical and social care, education,
employment centers, and so on (usually female-dominated occupations), and put pressure on the

allocation of local budgets. The problem should be addressed by implementing gender budgeting
principles at the state, oblast, and raion levels in order to better address the needs of different
population groups.
Solutions

The short-term solution involves introducing efficient and democratic forms, methods, and prin-
ciples into the local economic planning processes in the communities and administrative units of
the concerned regions. These will yield specific, actionable activities that address the wide range
of critical needs in the conflict-affected areas. This approach also establishes the following pro-
cesses as permanent assets for Ukraine.

•	 Build the capacity for local government, NGOs, and other stakeholders in practical application
   of modern economic planning methods and tools.
•	 Establish a small grant facility to (i) help initiate action to address the priorities as agreed by
   the community; and, very importantly, (ii) validate the process and support the work of the
   local planning team.
•	 Identify “economic localities.” Economic activity rarely aligns with administrative boundaries.
   In Ukraine, economic areas often cross raion borders while falling far short of being oblast-
   wide issues. Intermunicipal cooperation could be considered as one of the approaches.
•	 Form a working group for each economic locality from the trained staff at municipal or raion
   administration offices that will lead the community through a strategic planning process. The
   working group will establish a mission, identify information needs, set priorities, and produce
   a viable and validated plan for local economic recovery. Communities will apply for supple-
   mental grant funds to fund priority actions/activities upon which they have reached agree-
   ment.
•	 Implement gender-responsive planning and budgeting at oblast and raion levels: conduct
   gender-sensitive analysis of public expenditure at oblast and raion levels; provide trainings
   on gender budgeting (concepts, analysis, and implementation) for local government and civil
   society activists.

Private sector and SMEs
Objective: To create a business-enabling environment to ensure income generation, job creation,
and the foundation of new businesses and the growth of existing ones.
Key Needs

Solutions

•	 Reenergize local enterprises. The proposed near-term solution recognizes that outside in-
   vestment in the conflict-affected areas is highly unlikely, so economic recovery must be led
   by enterprises already in the area. For longer-term growth, the strategy transitions into a
   dynamic local economic development one to grow the overall economy.
•	 Implement a highly targeted and flexible recovery strategy to support existing enterprises in
   the affected area. Enterprises that already deal with risk and rapidly react to changing condi-
   tions are the only likely engines of recovery and growth; these firms will preserve and create
   the great majority of productive employment opportunities in the conflict areas for years to
   come. They must be provided with targeted support specific to their needs in supply chain, lo-
   gistical, infrastructure, human capital, market access, and a wide range of similar operational
   challenges.
•	 Enact an emergency set of favorable tax regimes and additional regulatory relief. This is vital
   to enabling SMEs to operate effectively in the nearly chaotic commercial environment of the
   conflict-affected areas of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and contiguous oblasts. It is neces-
   sary to apply derogations, based on business needs, from the companies’ life cycle regulations
   along with strong enabling legislation to allow local authorities to properly implement the
   changes. A sunset clause can end this period as conflict decreases.
•	 Facilitate further development of business support infrastructure for provision of advisory
   and training services for business start-ups and growth, with special focus on export promo-
   tion, energy efficiency, innovations, and women in business. Various loan programs should be
   developed to encourage the foundation of new businesses and development of those already
   established.
•	 Use this period to gather and analyze policy-relevant data to inform discussions of broader
   improvements to the business-enabling environment.
The Association Agreement (AA) with the EU could provide an important anchor for reforms.
Implementation of the AA, together with the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA)
Agreement, could offer substantial benefits for Ukraine that could among others, foster SME sec-
tor development. EU accession had a positive effect on the new EU members in central and east-
ern Europe, which took advantage of engagement with the EU to increase exports, attract FDI, and
enhance competitiveness. The entrance of the EU agreements into full force could create similar
opportunities for Ukraine to better support private sector and SME development.

Financial services
Objective: To help ensure access to basic financial services, introduce SME loans programs, and
offer support to opening savings cooperatives and credit.

This should be viewed as a remedial action for stabilizing financial services provision and sup-
porting SME development.
Key Needs

The banking sector in the affected areas suffers from many of the same stresses and structural
weaknesses as the entire Ukrainian banking system, with a large number of insolvent banks, a
falling deposit base, and an increasing volume of nonperforming loans. These issues need to be
resolved. In addition, physical damage, territorial threats, and the diminished rule of law have



Ukraine Recovery and Peacebuilding Assessment
Analysis of Crisis Impacts and Needs in Eastern Ukraine   92
taken a toll both on the economic infrastructure and on the risk appetite of entrepreneurs and
banks alike. In the presence of security risks, enhancing access to credit in the areas returned
to government control seems to be unlikely using market forces only, and may require creative
donor-supported solutions. Of more specific concern are the needs for banking services among
the new niche market of IDPs and the long-term cost of recovery and reconstruction.
Solutions

The challenges in this sector are deeper and more systemic than in other subsectors, so solutions
will require coordinated action at the highest level. These are not the sort of activities that can be
packaged into discrete projects typical of most internationally funded development efforts.

•	 Stabilize the financial sector in the areas under government control. This requires two crucial
   factors—overcoming Ukraine’s general banking crisis and reducing the perception of security
   threats. Support from international financial institutions such as the World Bank Group or the
   European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) guarantees (using grants from
   bilateral donors that are put at first loss to mitigate risks) could help spur post-conflict lend-
   ing by sharing risks with banks that operate in the conflict-affected areas.

Transitional implementation strategy
Economic recovery depends on the delivery of essential social, administrative, and communal
services; building social cohesion and promoting peace and reconciliation at the community level;
and including all citizens in decision making. As evident throughout this document, economic
recovery and improving the lives of those affected by conflict is best, most immediately, and most
sustainably achieved through targeted local solutions that add up to a coherent whole. Support
for improved local governance is implicit throughout and specific in many proposed solutions.
Institutional Arrangements, Governance, and Implementation Capacity

Both the National Employment Centre and the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade have
been instrumental in preparing this report, along with important contributions from oblast offi-
cials in Luhansk and Donetsk. Their capacity to respond is evident, though the scale of this crisis
and the ongoing challenge of moving the country forward are daunting. In addition to the specific
capacity building recommendations throughout the proposed solutions, it is of primary impor-
tance that the institutional arrangements and governance regarding the state’s relationship to the
economy and to economic actors improve significantly, including through temporary regulations.

Capacity building will address implementation issues and the projects proposed here will be com-
pleted as planned. However, genuine improvement can come only from leadership committed to
change and willing to decentralize to a very substantial extent, while also being open to working
with the subnational levels. This openness needs to result in an agreement on and implementa-
tion of an effective and efficient division of labor, reflected in the allocation of fiscal mandates and
commensurate funding.

 a In the event that a political settlement is reached within the two-year time period envisaged in the RPA, a comprehensive

 to be implemented as part of an overall Security Sector Reform process.
 b This total does not include US$329.4 million for the social protection of conflict-affected communities (unconditional cash
 transfers for housing and unemployment benefits), which has been costed under Component 1. However, it is important to
 recognize the importance of social protection service delivery as a major element of rebuilding social cohesion. Restoring
 basic social services and support for livelihood opportunities not only meets the fundamental needs of the conflict-affected
 populations, but also serves a critical conflict mitigation function by defusing competition over scarce resources. It also
 facilitates a range of peacebuilding processes, such as dialogue and reconciliation.

                                                          1. OVERVIEW



T
      he social resilience, peacebuilding, and community security component of this RPA con-
      siders issues related to restoring the social fabric, which is a critical foundation for any
      effective and sustainable recovery process. This includes supporting the early recovery
of conflict-affected populations, including the displaced, host, and other resident communities,
volunteers and ex-combatants, and victims of conflict by providing livelihoods support and pro-
tection; and promoting reconciliation, peacebuilding, and access to justice. Crosscutting issues
of gender equality, human rights, and, where appropriate, capacity development are integrated
throughout the assessment, and are reflected in the recommendations specific to this component.

The objective of this component is to identify the impacts of the crisis on conflict-affected popula-
tions around core aspects of social cohesion, peacebuilding, and community security. The assess-
ment makes recommendations to promote recovery through reintegration support for displaced
populations and ex-combatants, strengthening host communities, investments in reconciliation
activities, and strengthening justice and citizen security systems.

These are fundamental to sustainable recovery and peacebuilding—they lay the foundation for
the effective implementation of other aspects of recovery, such as infrastructure rehabilitation,
restoring social services, and revitalizing economic activity. Of particular importance is the notion
of trust building and reconciliation; bringing various groups together to overcome differences
and grievances through dialogue. This is a difficult and sensitive process, but the first steps need
to be taken immediately. Without reconciliation—between different members of the community,
between different communities, and between citizens and authorities—lasting peace and recov-
ery are unlikely to be achieved.

As social cohesion continues to erode and deteriorating socioeconomic conditions cause fur-
ther tensions, it is crucial that reconciliation and conflict mitigation activities commence as soon
as possible, irrespective of the cessation or continuation of armed conflict. While more explicit
peacebuilding activities such as large-scale reintegration processes must await the end of overt
conflict, there is no time to waste in preventing further erosion of social cohesion. Effective re-
sponses must situate social cohesion and reconciliation interventions within practical and tan-
gible local recovery efforts, including both restoring services and community infrastructure (as
detailed in Component 1) and economic recovery, including livelihoods and income generation
(as detailed in Component 2).

Geographic Scope. There is substantial overlap in the needs of various conflict-affected groups
(host/resident communities, returnees, IDPs, ex-combatants). Given this, it is important that na-
tional-level policies and reforms support and facilitate specific and local initiatives. Therefore,
while this component primarily focuses on the recovery of government-controlled areas of the
Donbas region and surrounding oblasts, to be effective and sustainable the proposed activities
will need to be designed and implemented within a wider national framework of dialogue and
governance reform. For instance, some interventions recommended in this report will need to be
supported by a countrywide information and strategic communication campaign to convey the
government’s intentions and vision to the wider population, to give “voice” to minority communi-

ties, and to create space for grassroots and higher-level dialogue on issues of critical importance
to the country’s future.

Temporal Scope. Recognizing that planning for resettlement or return, integration, reintegration,
and reconciliation is particularly challenging in the absence of a political settlement, the recom-
mended activities are presented in a manner that prioritizes the most critical and practical in-
terventions. It is important to recognize, however, that even where activities cannot be launched
immediately, their planning and design should commence as soon as possible to ensure effective
implementation as and when conditions permit. Although this assessment looks at the short term
(24 months), reconciliation and peacebuilding processes require a longer-term implementation
period if they are to be meaningful and sustainable. Therefore, recommended interventions here-
in are a starting point and will need to be continued and expanded beyond the 24-month horizon.
That said, dialogue and reconciliation activities must be initiated as soon as possible to prevent
further deterioration in social cohesion and lay the basis for more systemic peacebuilding pro-
grams when conditions permit.

Methodology. The assessment methodology for this component comprised a desk review of ex-
isting primary and secondary data, and semistructured interviews and focus groups with key
informants in affected oblasts in eastern Ukraine and in Kyiv, and with counterparts within the
central government, including the MSP, the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ), and
the Ombudsperson’s Office (OO). Field teams visited municipalities in Donetsk, Luhansk, Kharkiv,
Zaporizhzhia, and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts. During these visits, they met formally and informally
with a wide range of affected people and groups, including oblast officials, local authorities, local
services and departments (including personnel from SES, social protection, pension, migration,
employment, education, health, planning, capital construction, justice, public prosecutors, and
the police), military commanders, IDPs, IDP center staff, CSOs, volunteer groups, and host/resi-
dent community members. The recommendations provided in this component are based both on
the data gathered from this qualitative research as well as on lessons learned from international
experience. In particular, this chapter has drawn extensively on lessons from similar conflict and
crisis contexts, which have highlighted the importance of rapidly addressing issues of reconcilia-
tion, peace, and tolerance building, access to justice, citizen security, and psychosocial recovery as
fundamental elements of a sustainable recovery process.

Limitations. One key finding is that there is a notable lack of baseline data available on indicators
of social resilience. Due to the rapid nature of this assessment and the more extensive time frame
required to gather representative data on social dynamics, sufficient quantitative data (on issues
such as social cohesion, justice, respect of rights, and security) could not be gathered during this
first phase of the assessment. Nonetheless, such data will be crucial to ensuring the relevance and
appropriateness of recommended recovery programming over time, as well as to measuring the
relative effectiveness of different interventions. Further work will need to include a robust system
for both qualitative and quantitative data gathering on issues of social cohesion, reconciliation,
peacebuilding, and community security. It is also important to note that many issues addressed
in this report—and the recommended initiatives—are relatively new for Ukraine, and therefore
relevant data had not been systematically collected precrisis. In this regard, new systems may
need to be established to collect and analyze relevant data in order to inform and adjust programs

disaggregated to permit better analysis and therefore improved targeting of interventions.

                              AND FINDINGS


T
      he ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine has had a direct and highly negative impact on so-
      cial cohesion, resilience, livelihoods, community security, and the rule of law. Displacement,
      fear, and diminishing levels of trust are acute social problems, and conflict-related distress
is widespread. While social fragmentation, prejudices, regional divides, and low levels of trust
in local authorities and institutions existed prior to the crisis, these have been exacerbated as a
result of the conflict, in particular in the Donbas region.42 In many ways, the conflict and resulting
displacement from Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts has magnified Ukraine’s pre-conflict fragility.
As the numbers and the duration of stay for the displaced increase, pressure on local resources,
service delivery, livelihoods, and governance builds.

Affected populations
Affected populations comprise all residents of conflict-affected areas, including displaced per-
sons; host and other resident communities; communities in oblasts adjoining the conflict-affected
areas that have experienced economic losses due to conflict; members of the armed forces, volun-
teer battalions, and their families; civil society volunteers; and to varying degrees, all Ukrainian
citizens. Notwithstanding the impact of the crisis on the population as a whole, the conflict has
had various impacts on different groups, and on men, women, and children. Displaced persons
who are elderly, women (when sole caregivers or pregnant), children (particularly those not in the
care of their parents or lawful guardians), and persons with disabilities are particularly vulner-
able in terms of access to social services, jobs, and livelihoods. Adults and children in institutional
care in affected areas are at risk of a disruption to their care. Men of fighting age are vulnerable to
recruitment into armed groups or forced labor, and male IDPs are at high risk of social exclusion
and stigma as collaborators or sympathizers; their access to services and support can be seriously
constrained by these stereotypes and associated risks, and makes many men reluctant to register
for support as IDPs for these reasons. Females are at evident risk of trafficking and forced pros-
titution. Finally, the economic situation of many vulnerable families in eastern Ukraine has been
further weakened, forcing many deeper into poverty and creating conditions for increased social
tensions. While the tremendous spirit of civic activism and volunteerism on the part of local com-
munities (and indeed Ukrainian society) is to be commended—including in supporting and car-
ing for the numerous waves of IDPs in the absence of a well-organized and large-scale response by
the authorities—without urgent support this positive dynamic may wither in the face of growing
fatigue and increasing resentment.

There are currently some 1 million IDPs in Ukraine (of whom two-thirds are women and children,
and including 19,400 from Crimea). In addition, there are an estimated 650,000 refugees outside
Ukraine. The majority of IDPs (75 percent) are located in the five eastern oblasts of Dnipropetro-



42  An opinion poll conducted by the NGO Democratic Initiatives Foundation in December 2014 (within the framework of USAID’s
UCBI project) found that 47 percent of respondents in Slovyansk and 52 percent of respondents in Kramatorsk had a negative opinion
of both local and national authorities.

to be particularly vulnerable and will require more urgent and/or additional assistance.

Perspectives from Affected People
“The displaced need immediate help as soon as they arrive. They need to be registered, find tem-
porary shelter, get medical assistance, psychological help, and assistance finding jobs. But the
state systems are not ready to provide that quickly. In most cases all the work is done by volun-
teers. But we cannot replace the government. We can only add to what should be done by the
state.”

Social resilience impacts are especially acute in the five oblasts mentioned above. As the IDP dis-
tribution map suggests (see Map 2), IDP concentrations are greatest within raions in these oblasts.
However, local needs can be as great in the indirectly affected areas that are hosting significant
IDP communities, including in parts of the country geographically distant from the conflict’s epi-
center. Because the presence of IDPs and the origin of armed forces and volunteer security per-

sonnel are, to varying degrees, a factor nationwide, the stresses of conflict on social cohesion are
present throughout the country.

Social cohesion
It is apparent that the conflict has contributed to increased tensions and violent crimes outside
the area of active conflict. Identity-driven violent crime constitutes a growing share of overall
crime. Reversing this trend will require a complex mixture of tools that can build back tolerance
of, and respect for, diversity and a plurality of views. In the Ukrainian context this is particularly
centered on differences relating to language, religion, cultural references, regional identity, and
political views. In the current context, self-identity and perceptions of identity have become a di-
vider—whether between residents of various parts of the Donbas or between citizens throughout
Ukraine who hold different sociopolitical viewpoints. Intercommunal trust is fragile not just in
the areas directly impacted by the conflict, but also in other areas with a high level of heterogene-
ity. The result has been a lack of a sense of belonging and a disinclination for civic participation—
conditions that are exacerbated both by economic and political crises. Interactions are becom-
ing increasingly bitter and confrontational, particularly toward men from the East who may be
suspected of antigovernment sympathies. The undercurrents of “East versus West” and “us and
them” are spreading in both scope and intensity, particularly in cities like Kharkiv and Dniprop-
etrovsk, and it is not uncommon to hear in major host cities, including Kyiv, that “people from the
East have different values,” “are not Ukrainian in their thinking,” or “have a different mentality.”44

Perspectives from Affected People
“I went to Karlivka when Ukraine took it under control, and there Ukraine tells me to come and
fight for the motherland. But I am not for them and not for the others, I do not want to fight, I do
not understand this war. And when I went back to where the DPR is they forced me to fight on
their side.”

In sum, there are increasing tensions between IDPs and host communities, including with respect
to increasingly limited access to income-generating opportunities and basic services. The com-
bined impact of armed conflict and national economic distress has generated additional tensions
within communities, creating potential for increased hostilities as host community resources be-
come exhausted. As new waves of IDPs arrive, living conditions in some apartment blocks and
neighborhoods have deteriorated for residents and the displaced alike. Greater demand for rental
accommodation has led to increased brokerage fees and rents, which were immediately passed
on to local residents, including those who hold existing leases. The presence of IDPs has also
contributed to increases in food prices (especially on meat, fruit, wheat, and wheat flour). While
such price increases are attributable to economic circumstances generally as much as to the ef-
fects of forced displacement, many local residents attribute the economic distortions to the influx

of IDPs and “separatist sympathizers.” The presence of IDPs has also placed downward pressure
on wages and employment opportunities, which causes further resentment in host communities,
combined with a loss of trust in authorities for failing to protect local residents from these eco-
nomic burdens. At the same time, many IDPs have faced discrimination in the housing, rental, and
job markets, and have been the target of fraudulent transactions.

Perspectives from Affected People
“People who were in Novoazovsk, Pershotravneve moved out and sought to rent apartments, but
they did not have enough money to pay rent. People were initially renting out for 50 UAH per day
and now it is 200 UAH.”
                               ~ Focus group of young women returnees to Slovyansk, October 2014

Male IDPs are at particularly high risk of social exclusion and stigma as collaborators or sympa-
thizers; their access to services and support can be seriously constrained by these stereotypes
and associated risks. This has made many men reluctant to register for support as IDPs. Addition-
ally, as loss of life increasingly affects host communities, resentment of IDPs is also likely to extend
to women (two-thirds of the IDP population). Social and economic stresses are compounded by
the nexus between these three elements—perceptions of an inherently threatening “other” iden-
tity, opposing political views, and increased competition for diminishing resources.

Perspectives from Affected People
“There are people who did not register. There are some who do not want to register because of the
fear. One family came to register because they have a newborn child but they were very careful;
please do not write this, please do not put down that, where did you register my kids… They are
afraid that their men will be conscripted to ATO (that is, government forces).”

“We do accept IDPs, but it is not fine with us to accept men. Our boys go there to fight and their
men come here to hide…”

The most effective approach to IDP integration and socialization is to treat IDPs as equal partners
alongside the local population by drawing on their skills and other available resources to solve
common problems. IDPs include a diverse group of professionals, including academics, engineers,
and skilled workers, farmers, managers, teachers, doctors, and numerous other professionals.
Many IDPs are potential partners and important contributors to the local economy, and creative
community development projects may be a good starting point for matching needs with skills and
resources of both the permanent and temporary residents.

Gender-inclusive livelihood stabilization and local economic recovery efforts are, therefore, im-
portant elements for rebuilding social cohesion, as they: (i) alleviate immediate tensions over
access to employment between affected communities, host community individuals, and displaced
individuals; (ii) help IDPs cover their increased living costs; (iii) provide immediate, visible com-
munity benefits via the rehabilitation of socioeconomic community infrastructure; (iv) boost the
purchasing power and revive the local markets in the host communities, increasing the overall
economic absorption capacity and resilience of host communities to support IDP inflows; and (v)
support more diversified livelihoods opportunities, enterprise recovery, and skills development
for communities; most vulnerable groups.

Perspectives from Affected People
“I was trying to get my child benefit here but they said that they are waiting for a response from
Luhansk. I asked them couldn’t they just check with Kyiv that the banking system is not function-
ing in Luhansk and it is impossible to receive there, so that I do not have to wait for four months?
I was talking to them in the welfare office, explaining that I count on this one thousand very much,
that I need this money badly. I understand that she is just a clerk. She sits and tells me she can not
do anything.”

 “Besides IDPs we have plenty of other categories of clients. We start kind of forgetting about
them, but they also need assistance. They are not less needy. We were essentially not paying at-
tention to them recently.”
                                                          ~ Focus group of social workers, Lviv, October 2014

While trends such as regional divisions and low levels of trust in authorities and institutions ex-
isted prior to the crisis, many of these have sharpened as a result of it. In communities affected by
conflict, law enforcement agencies, security services, and justice institutions are ill equipped to
ensure respect for rights and rule of law, to mitigate disputes and tensions, and to address crime
and violence. Current hostilities, related community-level violence, and misinformation contrib-
ute to prejudice, polarization, and deepening divisions. Recovery challenges become more pro-
nounced as this fragility and divisiveness intensifies.

Impacts are especially acute in areas with a high percentage of IDPs compared to the host commu-
nities, such as the Konstantinyvka and Marinskyi raions of Donetsk oblast, the Borivskyi raion of
Kharkiv oblast, and the Berdianskyi and Zaporizhkyi raions of Zaporizhzhia oblast. These areas,
as well as those likely to experience significant returns of ex-combatants and/or displaced per-
sons in a post-conflict period, should serve as priority areas for targeting peacebuilding and re-
covery support. Needs in indirectly affected areas that are hosting significant IDP communities—
including those geographically distant from the conflict’s front line—should also be addressed,
targeting both IDPs and poor and vulnerable host community members alike.

Perspectives from Affected People
“Displaced women are often subject to gender-based violence. There are many cases of insults
and rape. Quite often they are afraid to file official complaints because of the negative attitude
toward the displaced.”

Of particular concern is sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV). While this assessment was
unable to access data on the impact of the crisis on such violence in eastern Ukraine, anecdotal
evidence and international experience suggest that the current context of conflict, combined with
widespread social and economic stresses, can trigger an increase in domestic violence. The lack
of SGBV data is likely due to a combination of the following factors: (i) victims often do not report
violence for fear of being stigmatized or prosecuted, or see reporting as pointless; (ii) there is

lack of adequate or safe reporting systems;45 and (iii) according to Ukrainian legislation, forensic
examiners can report on SGBV only after the victim files a formal complaint with law enforcement
structures, which is not possible in areas outside of government control under current circum-
stances.46 Considering that prior to the conflict, 75 percent of SGBV victims never sought help or
reported cases of violence,47 it is reasonable to assume that SGBV cases are heavily underreported
now. Numbers are also likely to increase upon the return of ex-combatants to their home com-
munities if they are not properly supported with specialized psychological care and reintegration
assistance.

In conflict-affected areas, local authorities’ and civil society’s capacities have severely degraded.
In addition, given the heightened risk of SGBV, mainstreaming gender in recovery and peacebuild-
ing activities at the local level is important but has become more difficult due to the destruction or
closure of many women’s centers or organizations in the conflict areas. Only 4 percent of senior
officials in local authorities are female, so particular efforts will be needed to promote the partici-
pation of women in all aspects of the recovery initiatives recommended in this component (c.f. the
UN Secretary-General’s Seven-Point Plan on Gender Responsive Peacebuilding).48, 49

Psychosocial issues
Exposure to conflict-related violence among IDPs, populations in conflict-impacted areas, and
combatants has resulted in widespread conflict and crisis-induced mental health problems, in-
cluding grief, distress, trauma, and PTSD. While the scope of the problem cannot be estimated
with precision, WHO methodology50 suggests that up to 4 percent of the total conflict-affected
adult population has developed severe mental health conditions directly related to the crisis and
is in need of immediate care. An additional 15 percent to 20 percent are estimated to be suf-
fering from mild mental health disorders also requiring specialized care, including PTSD. The
MSP has identified significant needs in terms of developing an overall program and system of
rehabilitation and adaptation, including new facilities, the introduction of modern methodologies
and health rehabilitation practices, specialist training, and significant additional needs related to
prosthetics and orthotics.51

 “Psychological assistance is extremely important for both militaries and IDPs. People are going
through a real turmoil and they have trouble coming back to normal life. There are only volunteer
psychologists who work in hospitals and IDP centers. We need a well-organized system and insti-
tutions supported by the government to deal with that.”
                                                    ~ Round table discussion with NGO representatives, Kharkiv, 2015

As psychosocial needs rapidly increase, the formal mental health system is not well-equipped to
meet increased demand for services, particularly around trauma. The mental health–care system
relies predominantly on the state’s highly medicalized psychiatric care system, as well as on pri-
vate counselors and privately operated clinics unregulated by the legal and health-care systems.
Currently, the bulk of the increased psychosocial support needs are being met by volunteers and
community-based organizations. However, the majority of volunteer counselors are either un-
trained or trained in different curricula, and often lack the specialized capacity required to deal
with trauma, including PTSD. Many are overwhelmed by the high number of people who need
support. In this situation, secondary trauma among counselors and support personnel (that is,
trauma related to processing patients’ war-related experiences) and burnout is already evident.52
Furthermore, there is an increasingly high rate of burnout and PTSD among volunteers who sup-
port IDPs and combatants owing to frequent travel to the conflict zone, chronic fatigue due to
shortages of resources and personnel, and the neglect of personal needs due to the psychologi-
cal focus on serving others. This makes volunteers a high-risk group with regard to psychosocial
problems. The situation is also aggravated by the fact that in early 2014, funding for social work-
ers was transferred from the Ministry of Social Services to local administrations, which reduced
the number of social workers by more than 12,000, and thus reduced the capacity of the state to
respond effectively to psychosocial needs, particularly among vulnerable populations.

Community security
The conflict has resulted in a high level of personal insecurity and citizen exposure to violence
in eastern Ukraine. As a result of widespread mobilization and TV images, civilians throughout
Ukraine are also exposed. The increased circulation and availability of weapons and ammuni-
tion have resulted in citizens becoming armed outside security structures and beyond the geo-
graphic scope of the conflict-affected areas. This poses a concern not only for the security of the
civilian population in areas affected by the conflict, but also has potentially serious long-term
implications for violence, crime, and the rule of law in the rest of the country. In the short term,
the establishment of community-based reference groups or networks—supported by innovative
technological solutions—could serve as important early warning and tracking mechanisms, and
would also allow community-driven identification of priority concerns and needs. Such systems
have been successfully implemented in similar post-conflict contexts (for example, in Georgia,

Cyprus, and Kenya), and have contributed to enhancing community security from the outset by
improving communication both within the affected communities and between communities and
security providers. In the longer term, these mechanisms offer a vehicle for tracking and generat-
ing analytical data for social cohesion and community security indicators.53

Other sources of community insecurity, such as UXOs, the availability of illegal weapons, and DDR
of ex-combatants, will remain after the end of the armed conflict and will require a time horizon
beyond that envisaged in this assessment. It is important to ensure that adequate and early at-
tention is given to initial planning for these challenges. The needed initiatives are flagged but not
fully costed in this assessment (with the exception of specific interventions appropriate to the
current context, such as the demobilization of the first cohort of armed forces combatants an-
nounced for April 2015). It is possible, however, to begin preliminary planning of these medium-
term interventions, and some modest funding is included to that end.

           RECOMMENDED INITIATIVES


B
       ased on the above assessment of crisis impacts and needs, this section identifies program-
       matic responses that can lay a foundation for strengthening social resilience and com-
       munity trust, which are essential in order to transition from crisis to recovery. As noted
above, due to the rapid nature of this assessment and the lack of quantitative data, this report
cannot provide detailed location-specific analysis or recommendations. Recommendations are
made generally for conflict-affected communities and, in some cases, on a national level, but with
a priority focus on the five eastern oblasts that are closest to the line of separation and that host
the largest concentrations of IDPs. This initial set of recommendations can be complemented by
a more detailed and targeted set of interventions designed on the basis of further and deeper
analysis (including quantitative analysis). Targeting is appropriate both geographically and by
population groups.
The objectives of these recommendations is to strengthen the resilience of all conflict-affected
communities, and in the first instance to displaced populations and their host communities; better
protect conflict-affected populations; promote reconciliation and social cohesion; and strengthen
community safety and access to justice where conditions allow.
The social cohesion approach is premised on the principle that the needs of vulnerable popula-
tions, IDPs, and members of impacted communities alike must be central to any recovery effort.
All such assistance must be perceived to promote collaboration and mutual understanding in the
target communities in contexts where social, economic, and political divisions have hardened.
Specific measures that facilitate confidence and trust building can be directly linked to commu-
nity involvement in recovery measures, as presented in Components 1 and 2 of this assessment.
The sequentially overlapping phases of humanitarian, early recovery, and development assistance
need to incorporate these principles.
This report identifies a number of priority interventions that should begin in 2015 and 2016.
Recommendations also reflect international experience, which demonstrates that there cannot
be any meaningful or lasting peace or recovery without addressing and resolving grievances and
root causes of conflict via a process that involves all affected groups,. In addition, this cannot hap-
pen without a national policy framework that underpins regional and local interventions.
Recommendations are presented as distinct sets of issues but are closely interrelated in terms of
both priority needs and timelines. Flexibility in implementation is important, both in response
to changing circumstances and to the scale of the challenge. While deeper analysis is needed to
develop a disaggregated and targeted program, this should not diminish the urgency of the re-
sponse: Such analysis should be the first step of implementation.

Better understand vulnerability, risk, and social cohesion
Objective: Establish a baseline to better understand vulnerability, risk, and social
cohesion.
Doing so will allow good targeting of activities and justify flexibility as circumstances change. Put-

ting in place a number of indices and tools can provide a clearer and more dynamic understanding
of needs. Social cohesion and resilience are notoriously challenging to measure, and a significant
investment needs to be made in tools (polling, focus groups) that can track a number of indicators
essential for measuring whether communities and societies are getting more or less cohesive. This
type of data tracking and analysis will inform and support the prioritization of investments across
the recovery spectrum, including reconstruction and service delivery, and livelihoods. It can also
identify trends, opportunities, potential areas for community-driven initiatives, and existing and
emerging conflict triggers. This will help inform the timing, location, and types of social cohesion
efforts that would be most appropriate. Setting up such systems is recommended as a high prior-
ity. A rigorous research design and methodology will need to be carefully developed to take into
account context-specific variables; for example, the impact fluid population groups (such as IDPs
wishing to settle or resettle in search of employment opportunities or a safer environment, or for
fear of being conscripted) have on data analysis as well as the reluctance of individuals or groups
to respond for fear of persecution due to their views or opinions.

Key indicators would need to include degrees of social and political participation; continued de-
mographic movements; equity in access to education, training, housing, social services, and liveli-
hoods; the incidence of identity-based crime or discrimination; national policies that reflect re-
spect for cultural diversity; trust between the public and security services; and a sense of identity
and belonging in both target communities and on a national level. In addition, surveys can reflect
opinions and attitudes of the general population with regard to access to income-generating op-
portunities, and access to public services, which can be compared to results in conflict-affected
communities. Measuring such indicators needs to be linked to national-level efforts that convey
advocacy messages at a higher level.
Activities

•	 Vulnerability and Social Cohesion Assessment/Index: To monitor and track levels of social
   cohesion and conflict resurgence risks.
•	 Perception surveys: Perception survey/risk assessments to monitor the dynamics of social
   and economic vulnerability and political fragility. These will reflect behavior, opinions, and at-
   titudes of the Ukrainian population with regard to access to income-generating opportunities,
   family expenditure data, access to public services, and other indicators. Enhanced analyti-
   cal capacities of local community-based organizations and think tanks to monitor the situa-
   tion and provide recommendations for decision making both on national and regional levels
   should be linked to this initiative.
•	 Introduce gender-disaggregated data collection and analysis in government systems, initially
   where most relevant to indicators that are important to conflict and peacebuilding.

Promote social cohesion and build back trust
Objective: To promote the building and rebuilding of relationships and trust in
communities directly impacted by the conflict (IDPs, hosts and resident populations,
communities with high levels of ex-combatants) and indirectly impacted by the conflict
(areas where there have been supply chain disruption or government service provision
deficits).
Significant social tensions are likely to exist among resident populations that have been exposed
to the polarizing effects of violence, civil unrest, and polarizing media content. Both intra- and
intercommunity reconciliation need to be supported, including by national-level interventions.

Building the capacity of front-line actors—including CSOs, local authorities, service providers,
and community volunteers—around reconciliation programming will also be important.
Activities

•	 Develop national conflict–sensitive information and communication campaigns in collabora-
   tion with local and regional authorities and civil society actors. Campaigns would reinforce
   efforts to communicate positively regarding tolerance, reconciliation, and recovery, and to fa-
   cilitate broad-based participation in national and community-level dialogue and consultation
   processes. Various formats—notably new social media in addition to newspapers, radio, tele-
   vision, and other means—need to be strategically employed to reach and engage the popula-
   tion at large, as well as specific groups such as IDPs, with targeted messages.
•	 Support economic development projects in affected communities to provide new livelihood
   options for the displaced, hosts, and residents of conflict-affected areas. This recommenda-
   tion draws on international research that highlights that economic stresses—including pov-
   erty, unemployment and income inequality—are drivers of conflict,54 and that conflict and
   violence are associated with lagging poverty reduction. These economic projects should be
   identified through the consultative processes described above and adapted to specific local
   needs and opportunities, and verified by expert/external assessments as part of the activities
   indicated under the section titled “Better understand vulnerability, risk, and social cohesion.”
   Special targeting strategies to reach IDPs should be envisioned and implemented in ways that
   do not isolate them or engender rivalries with host populations. Specific recommendations on
   livelihoods are found in Component 2.
•	 Identify and support measures to promote tolerance through community-led projects (reha-
   bilitating social, economic, and cultural infrastructure) and events (cultural, sporting, learn-
   ing, and so on) of benefit to conflict-affected communities in eastern Ukraine. Such projects
   should be identified through participatory and inclusive consultative processes that help to
   rebuild both infrastructure and social cohesion. Mobilized with the assistance of local author-
   ities and CSOs, and facilitated by civic groups and trained dialogue facilitators, such projects
   would help to create short-term employment and highlight the contributions of IDPs or re-
   turnees. The specific activities should be decided by communities in response to agreed upon
   local needs, and with the full participation of women, youth, and any minority groups. The
   most vulnerable communities, including those with the highest proportion of IDPs, should
   be initially prioritized. Specific recommendations on facility rehabilitation needs are found in
   Component 1.
•	 Support community and national-level dialogues on peace and develop a shared, national vi-
   sion, beginning with support for the design and implementation of productive and genuine
   dialogue processes—that is, dialogues where participants speak with each other rather than
   at each other. Sufficient time and resources must be allocated to dialogue process design,
   drawing on technical expertise and international good practices, and should involve diverse
   stakeholders and voices prior to implementation. This could include:
      ˏˏ    Training for respected facilitators regarding how to design and facilitate effective dia-
            logues (teachers, journalists, religious leaders, local officials, magistrates, youth leaders),
            with a particular focus on women and women’s groups (women’s CSOs provide an invalu-
            able source of motivated and skilled people for these roles)

   ˏˏ   Design and implementation support for facilitated community dialogue processes on tol-
        erance and social cohesion, with particular attention to ensuring “safe spaces.”
•	 Promote trust between state and conflict-affected communities by enhancing participatory,
   inclusive, and accountable governance processes. Supporting local authorities and CSOs with
   guidance and financial support to strengthen participatory governance measures, such as
   public councils (attached to local councils and already defined by law but poorly implement-
   ed), can provide a forum for long-term social engagement into recovery planning and imple-
   mentation. These forums should have representatives from IDPs as well as host communities.
   Since trust-building between the state and society highly depends on incentives for the for-
   mer to become more accountable to the latter, pilot social accountability initiatives on service
   delivery and on the use funds allocated to the recovery should be supported.
•	 The restoration of governance functions in the conflict-affected areas is likely to occur in a
   context of complex transformations in the entire public administration system’s structures
   and functions, both at central and local levels, and possibly involve comprehensive decentral-
   ization reform. The latter involves particularly profound changes in the territorial, adminis-
   trative, budgetary, tax, and local government areas. It is essential, therefore, that local authori-
   ties, civil society, and private sector actors are duly consulted to ensure that conflict-sensitive
   safeguards are applied to these processes.

Promote a culture of tolerance through dialogue and civic
participation
Objective: Foster support for balanced, objective, and impartial dialogue and civic
engagement.
Given the polarization that characterizes much public debate in Ukraine, there is a clear need for
a more balanced, objective, and impartial dialogue and civic engagement if public life is to move
beyond a narrative of blame. Inclusive dialogue will support greater recognition of diversity and
tolerance within Ukrainian society and help reduce intercommunal tensions in the Donbas and
throughout Ukraine. Encouraging and supporting politically neutral public discourse on issues of
common interest—including citizenship, the economy, even a common vision for the future—will
also help to address the growing trust deficit between the citizens and public institutions, in par-
ticular in conflict-affected areas.
Activities

•	 Design and support a program of national dialogues on common concerns around the coun-
   try—such as stereotyping, ineffective governance, endemic corruption, the weak economy,
   and poor social service delivery—to build bridges between all parts of the country and re-
   duce national divides as citizens come together to deliberate and identify feasible solutions
   to shared problems.
•	 Support universities and CSOs to promote structured dialogues between intellectuals, youth,
   women’s groups, and professional associations that encourage tolerance.
•	 Support youth and women’s groups to have exchanges within Ukraine and beyond to break
   down unhealthy stereotyping. Initiatives should consider using champions and positive role
   models (such as sports figures or music idols) and have a strong social media component.
   Youth exchange visits should be supported.
•	 Aim media training on conflict sensitivity at improving standards among key groups of jour-

      nalists from affected regions, so that their professional skills match the demand of working
      in conflict areas. A credible third party should undertake the task of monitoring hate speech.
•	 Promote youth and women’s civic engagement through programming that promotes their
   roles as peace builders—including support for youth leadership skills development, civic ed-
   ucation, human rights training, and development of peace and tolerance curricula for schools
   and universities.

Ensure social protection for conflict-affected populations
Objective: To enhance the government’s capacity to deliver social protection benefits to
conflict-affected communities and ensure a consistent supply of benefits to vulnerable
community members in conflict-affected areas.55
A significant proportion of IDPs are expected to become recipients of the regular social assistance
programs that operate in Ukraine, and the total number of beneficiaries of the Guaranteed Mini-
mum Income Program and of disability benefits is thus expected to increase.56 In addition to social
benefits, a rise in demand for housing for displaced persons must also be anticipated.
Activities

•	 Improve information and communication on social payments to conflict-affected communi-
   ties, initially to IDPs and their host communities:
      ˏˏ    establish a web portal on recovery-oriented information and assistance programs
      ˏˏ    establish telephone hotlines at the central level and in the most affected regions
      ˏˏ    produce and distribute, at the local level, bulletins/manuals on IDP registration proce-
            dures and social payments mechanisms, for IDPs, local authorities, and service providers
            to use
      ˏˏ    establish administrative one-stop shops to provide support and referrals for conflict-af-
            fected populations. Initially, both volunteer centers and local administrations can fill this
            role, but both need capacity strengthening
•	 Improve procedures for delivering basic social services and benefits to conflict-affected popu-
   lations, initially to IDPs, specifically with regard to:
       •	 housing costs, for example to better inform IDPs of the decision by the Cabinet of Min-
          isters that provides for registered IDPs holding a bank account to receive a six-month
          unconditional cash transfer to cover living payments up to a maximum of UAH 2,400 per
          family per month
       •	 unemployment benefits, particularly in areas that are hosting a large number of IDPs
          (Donetsk, Luhansk, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts)
       •	 pensions, to address the large movement of pensioners from Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts
          to Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts, which now account for 26.5 per-
          cent, 24.4 percent and 15 percent of all new pension applications received respectively.



55  The needs and estimated costs for the repair of damages to the physical infrastructure associated with the delivery and distribu-
tion of social welfare benefits are included under Component 1. Public transfers (pension, stipend, and social assistance) accounted for
33 percent of monetary household incomes in the Donbas oblasts prior to the crisis (Rapid Economic Assessment UNDP, forthcoming).
56  This increase is expected to be offset by the amount of funds allocated to benefits that are no longer paid in Crimea.

          Pension applications have also been transferred within Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. Ad-
          justments to redistribute resources between oblasts are urgently required, as is capacity
          to support transfers and reregistrations.

Promote access to justice
Objective: To expand and strengthen citizens’ access to justice by increasing the
capacity, legitimacy, and accountability of law enforcement and justice institutions.
Expected outcomes include improved citizen security and access to justice, and strengthened ca-
pacity, legitimacy, and accountability of law enforcement and justice institutions to respond to
conflict-related grievances.
Activities

•	 Develop safe and effective mechanisms for citizens to formally report conflict-related crime/
   violence, including SGBV, and to receive legal aid for such reporting. This includes improving
   incentives for law enforcement agencies to record and investigate crimes and related griev-
   ances in conflict zones. Arrangements to ensure the safety of security and justice personnel
   pursuing investigations in hazardous areas will need to be developed. Capacity building of
   law enforcement agencies and security forces (including relevant personnel within the MoJ,
   Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the Military Prosecutor’s Office) to
   ensure compliance with international humanitarian law (IHL) and human rights obligations
   in responding to conflict-related crime and violence. Focus areas include greater investigative
   capacity; skills for handling cases of sexual assault, domestic violence, and cases involving
   children; and training on new patterns of crime and violence exacerbated by the conflict, such
   as arms trafficking and interpersonal violence.
•	 Establish a clear and transparent system for investigating allegations of violence and human
   rights violations of civilians by armed forces and groups. Systems must have clear mandates
   and sufficient financial and technical resources to undertake timely investigation and pros-
   ecution.
•	 Support domestic and SGBV prevention and monitoring in conflict-affected areas and nation-
   wide, with particular attention to likely increased family stress.
•	 Continuously monitor all detention centers in the conflict-affected regions under government
   control using the National Preventive Mechanism (NPM).57
•	 Expand the availability of free primary legal assistance, both through the MoJ and through
   citizen support bureaus, and “one-stop shops” in local administrations.
•	 Expand the network of representatives of the OO and build their capacity to help redress citi-
   zen grievances.
•	 Support partnerships between the representatives of the OO and civil society and community
   organizations.




57  The NPM is the national component of the preventive system established by the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention Against
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment and Punishment (OPCAT). The NPM is mandated to conduct regular visits
to all places where persons are deprived of liberty to ensure their protection.

Provide legal assistance
Objective: To ensure that conflict-affected populations have access to legal support and
administrative assistance.
The range of priority needs for legal advice and support among IDPs includes restoring legal doc-
uments, accessing social services and employment, establishing and enforcing property rights,
receiving support for ongoing legal proceedings and financial obligations such as loans and mort-
gages in their home areas, attaining compensation (such as registering claims for property loss or
damage), as well as other civil and administrative matters. The MoJ is responsible for the system
of free secondary legal assistance when required.
Activities

•	 Establish a legal aid program for victims of conflict-related crime.
•	 Raise awareness to encourage victims to report crimes and seek redress.
•	 Support the resolution of title, property, and access disputes when formal judicial procedures
   are involved.
•	 Mobilize additional legal expertise at the local level as well as train for legal and judicial spe-
   cialists on specific conflict-related legal issues.

Provide psychosocial support for conflict-affected
populations
Objective: To meet the psychosocial and mental health needs of conflict-affected
groups such as combatants and civilian conflict victims, children, victims of SGBV, IDPs,
returnees, and service providers and emergency services personnel.
At present, there is insufficient capacity to meet the large and growing needs of these affected
groups.58 A high priority is to hire and train additional social workers and psychologists to pro-
vide specialized support for trauma and PTSD patients. Many practicing psychologists need addi-
tional training on treating trauma. To address the increased case load, it is estimated that at least
500 new staff need to be hired for just the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, and Za-
porizhzhia oblasts.59 Additional trained personnel will also be required in other oblasts or cities
that host large IDP communities and/or provide health care to wounded combatants, especially
Odesa and Kyiv.
Activities

•	 Psychosocial support:
      ˏˏ    Develop community-based psychosocial support and referral networks through identifi-
            cation, mobilization, training, and oversight of local psychosocial assistance for affected
            populations, including social workers and community-based groups, particularly in iso-
            lated and small communities

        in collaboration with local mental health and medical specialists, and community-based
        psychosocial care providers
•	 Encourage women’s NGOs to establish referral and support systems for victims of SGBV and
   other conflict-related crimes

Restore community security
Objective: To address risks to community security, including physical hazards such as
static landmines, UXOs, and the proliferation of illegal weapons—and to address high
levels of distrust resulting from physical insecurity.
Many community security interventions, such as demining in the Donbas, are a necessary precur-
sor to activities recommended in Components 1 and 2 concerning reconstructing infrastructure,
restoring services, and reviving the economy. To support the restoration of local safety and secu-
rity, there is a need for inclusive security interventions with strong governmental and community
buy-in. At the community level, this needs to be accompanied by a large number of “Safer Commu-
nity Plans” that are supported through facilitated forums that draw together concerned citizens
and officials to take decisive, local action on safety concerns ranging from removing land mines to
improving street lighting. These needs should be established through a series of baseline assess-
ments, with local citizens’ participation.


                                                                                              Volume II:

Activities

•	 Develop community-embedded early warning mechanisms,60 which can also be used to ana-
   lyze social cohesion trends. Ideally, these would combine a network of local community ref-
   erence groups trained in a common methodology and user-friendly, low-cost technological
   information management platforms. Such innovative solutions have been successfully used
   in similar post-conflict settings, such as in Cyprus, Georgia, and Kenya, as noted above (see
   “Community security”).
•	 Establish local advisory panels on community security to strengthen the relationship be-
   tween local authorities and their communities. These formally engage and involve community
   members in local decision-making processes, promoting collaboration to solve local security
   problems. Advisory panels would include representatives of all members of the community,
   including women’s groups, IDPs, youth, and other marginalized or vulnerable groups.
•	 Remove static mines and UXOs, conducted according to established international standards
   (IMAS).61 It should include capacity building for local experts and could be pursued in con-
   junction with area-based development work. Clearance of corridors and routes that will be
   used by IDPs to exit or return to home areas should be prioritized.

Prepare for DDR of returning ex-combatants
Objectives: (i) to support the government in developing a national DDR framework
and plan; and (ii) to support the reintegration of ex-combatants in light of the
government’s announcement that the first cohort may be demobilized as early as April
2015.
In preparation for an eventual return of volunteer and other military units to their communities, a
number of interventions are proposed as precursors to a national DDR program that will support

ex-combatants’ effective socioeconomic reintegration into civilian society.62 It is recommended
that initial planning be launched immediately so that a community-based reintegration program
with broad stakeholder support, clear institutional and legislative frameworks, appropriate im-
plementation arrangements, and adequate financial and technical resources can be launched as
soon as the situation allows. The cost of implementation is not included, as it is not yet known
when a full DDR program could begin.
Activities

•	 Provide technical support to government counterparts for the development of a national DDR
   strategy. The development of a national DDR framework will be required to prepare for an
   eventual larger-scale demobilization and reintegration process. Many combatants in Ukraine
   are volunteers, while other units fall under the oversight of different ministries or entities,
   including the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the National Guard.

62  As combatants (including those from volunteer battalions) were recruited from various parts of the country, it is recommended
to start profiling them and assessing their needs during demobilization, as this will become more complicated once combatants have
returned to their respective communities.

    Robust estimates of combatant numbers, including volunteer forces, will need to be devel-
    oped. Clear administrative oversight for DDR support will also need to be established under a
    national framework. Clearly delineated and broadly comparable reintegration opportunities
    for all combatants should be promoted so as not to create tensions between different groups;
    consistency should also be sought regarding benefits for veterans of other conflicts.
•	 Support socioeconomic opportunity mapping. International lessons on reintegration pro-
   gramming highlight the value of an assessment of potential economic and social opportuni-
   ties and resources for ex-combatants, as well as profiling their skills and civilian experience.
   This will serve to identify job opportunities and alternative livelihood opportunities.
•	 Identify community-based, socioeconomic reintegration support and identify priority sup-
   port options for ex-combatants to support their peaceful return to their communities. This in-
   cludes support with respect to social reintegration, including family reunification, counseling,
   as well as medical care for conflict-associated health needs, including prosthetics and spe-
   cialized longer-term care. Also included are livelihood opportunities and income-generating
   skills tailored to individual capacities and needs, such as retraining programs, job placement
   and referral programs, support to self-employment opportunities through small grants for
   micro and small enterprises, business skills training, and life skills training. Support options
   will need to take into account specialized assistance to meet the needs of female combatants
   and children associated with military forces, as well as any other vulnerable subgroups of ex-
   combatants.
•	 Develop programs and needs assessments for ex-combatants’ psychosocial support. Many
   former combatants have suffered from various forms of conflict-associated trauma, includ-
   ing anxiety, chronic depression, sleep disorders, anger management, and substance abuse.
   Screening of ex-combatants for PTSD and provision of appropriate services should begin dur-
   ing the demobilization process and continue to be available for all veterans of the conflict after
   they return home, as many symptoms and related problems may only become apparent later.
   Preparations will need to be made to ensure that: (i) needs are identified (including the spe-

                             STRATEGY


M
           eaningful and sustainable social resilience and peacebuilding must have a dual focus:
           (i) on activities related specifically to conflict-affected areas; and (ii) activities that si-
           multaneously target the national (countrywide) level. Although activities targeting con-
flict-affected communities would be prioritized, the messages and approaches in both must be
consistent. Themes such as reintegrating the displaced, social cohesion, building tolerance and
confidence, and access to justice and security must be featured at both the regional and national
levels. For example, while community-level social and economic projects to promote social co-
hesion will prioritize directly affected areas where IDPs and host communities are under great
strain, recommendations related to legal aid for conflict-related crimes and violations of rights
should be developed and implemented across the country as a whole, as should forums for lo-
cal dialogue, exchanges between populations, and development of a DDR program. Genuine and
meaningful reconciliation, both within and between the various communities, groups, and au-
thorities can prevent the reemergence of conflict triggers that could undermine recovery efforts
and erode the critical foundation for sustainable and peaceful development.

Recommendations are an integrated package and should be implemented in parallel as resources
allow and local needs dictate. All need to be initiated soon; many will continue beyond 2016.
Some recommendations may be immediately enacted, such as legal assistance facilities, peace
and tolerance campaigns, and community-level reconciliation activities—especially those con-
nected to urgent rehabilitation works. Others, such as recommendations that require training
and capacity building to deploy new specialists or develop new legal or institutional frameworks,
may require 6–12 months of preparatory activities. The implementation time frame for many
activities—such as community-level reconciliation projects, economic development investments,
and conflict monitoring—is likely to be 3–5 years or more. Priority should be given to the eastern
raions most affected by population movements and conflict-related damage.

Activities can be adapted and phased to address changes in the country’s security context. Some
medium-term activities should be conceptualized and planned in the short term. Similarly, while
some activities will sit clearly within the recognized mandate of a single government entity, oth-
ers will require clarity on institutional frameworks between a number of entities at both national
and local levels before they can be enacted. Ideally, overall leadership and coordination should be
housed at an appropriately senior political level, such as the Office of the Prime Minister.

There may be significant returns of both IDPs and refugees over the next 24 months if current
levels of violence decline or if political agreements convincingly resolve the conflict. Returns are
based on individual judgments that balance independent rational decision making about their
own and their family’s future along with the values, experiences, and opportunities acquired dur-
ing displacement. Iterative movements may be made to large cities where livelihood options or
accommodations are better or to areas near homes of origin. Or, decisions may be made to stay in
place until the displaced feel prepared to return. These decisions depend on more than security
operations or peace building alone. The calculus and the sustainability of returns include devel-
opment considerations such as livelihoods, reconstruction assistance, governance, and access to
justice and adjudication mechanisms. Return is not an event. It is the beginning of a process in

which the displaced continually weigh and assess the viability of their circumstances—and may
well choose to be displaced again if conditions in home areas are unsuitable. Activities that ad-
dress host–IDP tensions may also be necessary when IDPs return to their home communities,
such as livelihood, public service, grievance resolution, and psychosocial support. Two areas of
particular importance to returnees are housing rehabilitation assistance and legal assistance in
instances where property access disputes arises. Accordingly, should significant returns begin to
occur, new return areas should be prioritized for recovery and peacebuilding assistance to sustain
returns in the same way that conflict-affected raions with large concentrations of IDPs should be
prioritized at present.

The recommendations made in this component offer considerable flexibility to the government
and its partners. There are a range of implementation methods, from direct service delivery at lo-
cal levels through public service providers, to civil society–led or donor-supported initiatives, to
information and communication activities deployed through national media. Implementing this
package of recommendations requires close collaboration among national, regional, and local
level actors as well as strongly community-driven processes led by affected peoples.

      5. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS,
 GOVERNANCE, AND IMPLEMENTATION CAPACITY


T
      he social resilience, peacebuilding, and community security strategies will need to be close-
      ly coordinated at the central level of government. However, ownership for local-level activi-
      ties must lie with the oblast and local councils and administrations, including in identifying
priority activities, implementation modalities, monitoring arrangements, and openings for civic
engagement, all in close consultation with CSOs and target communities. Specifically, a strate-
gic communication plan will need to be developed by the central authorities and provided to
local government, raion, and hromada councils to ensure a common and consistent vision and
approach. This will require additional implementation capacity, including staff and budget at the
oblast and raion level. Such arrangements will need to work as a two-way channel, however, with
the oblast and local-level staff members channeling information on priority issues and needs to
the central level, and serving as an early warning mechanism on emerging issues or triggers that
threaten to reignite conflict and/or undermine recovery efforts.

More specific institutional recommendations of relevance to social resilience, peacebuilding, and
community security activities include:

•	 At the national level, authorities will need to create an enabling environment, including by
   supporting and promoting peace and reconciliation messages in public statements and in the
   national media. At the same time, local authorities and other actors—such as civil society and
   community-based organizations—will need to be empowered to implement targeted activi-
   ties on the ground. This may require new and/or amended policy and/or legislative frame-
   works, as well as dedicated financial and human resources.
•	 Given the crosscutting nature of the social resilience and peacebuilding strategy, it is impor-
   tant to ensure close coordination between numerous line ministries (the Ministry of Social
   Policy, SES, the MoJ, the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and so on), as well
   as between these ministries and senior levels of the executive and legislature. External tech-
   nical expertise (international best practice) may be required to address specific issues. The
   OO has a particularly important role to play in supporting social resilience. With its unique
   mandate, the office is well placed to ensure that conflict-affected populations benefit from the
   services they need by providing a mechanism for people with grievances to receive redress.
   The Office in Zaporizhzhia should be reinforced and additional offices created throughout the
   conflict-affected and adjoining areas.
•	 At the regional and local level, strong leadership will be required to ensure the strategy is
   implemented consistently. The financial situation of decentralized levels of government will
   need to be addressed as a matter of urgency—many local budgets have experienced increased
   expenditures to support restoration of local infrastructure and services to IDPs, while local
   revenues have declined due to the conflict. Fatigue among host communities, CSOs, and vol-
   unteer service providers combined with resource depletion has also meant that civil society’s
   capacity to fill the gaps of struggling local administrations is weakening. Special attention will
   need to be paid to local councils. As directly elected officials, local councils are perceived to be
   particularly accountable to, and representative of, the local populations. Their involvement in
   the design, implementation, promotion, and oversight of activities is very important. Indeed,



Ukraine Recovery and Peacebuilding Assessment

   building ownership over recovery activities by oblast and local councils and administrations
   is a priority. This includes empowering them to lead participatory and inclusive processes to
   identify priority activities, implementation modalities, and monitoring arrangements. Dedi-
   cated capacity for reconciliation and peacebuilding activities within local and oblast admin-
   istrations is needed to enable them to monitor social cohesion dynamics and to collaborate
   effectively with community leaders and local civil society actors.
•	 Civil society and individual volunteers have played a central role in responding to the crisis,
   and their continued, strong involvement is essential. They are well placed to implement im-
   portant activities such as IDP orientation and information sharing, reintegration programs,
   grievance redress, information flows to the displaced and resident populations, peacebuild-
   ing and tolerance promotion activities for children and youth, and legal referral services. They
   can also play a supportive role by leading local community consultations and developing
   mechanisms for participative processes, monitoring the provision of state services to ensure
   equity and responsiveness to the needs of local populations, provide advocacy on behalf of
   vulnerable groups, and gather data on social cohesion and peacebuilding.
•	 Communities are the ultimate beneficiaries of these processes, and it is essential that they are
   involved in the design, implementation, and evaluation of all activities. Direct participation,
   including by vulnerable groups, will also help increase public confidence in state institutions
   and further strengthen the overall recovery effort by creating synergies at the local level and
   between the reconstruction of infrastructure and service delivery on the one hand, and by
   strengthening the social fabric on the other.
•	 To ensure that analysis and design of peacebuilding interventions is targeted and more re-
   sponsive to context-specific needs, all data collected and analyzed should also be disaggre-
   gated by gender. This will improve monitoring and cross-reference with gender indicators
   across the range of envisaged activities.
