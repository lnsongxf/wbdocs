                                                Foreword
     Provision of safe drinking water is a basic necessity and has been a major topic for key political discourses in the
     country over the last decade. The Government of India has been focusing on safe drinking water since 1972-73
     when it introduced the Accelerated Rural Water Supply Programme (ARWSP) to assist States/Union Territories
     to accelerate the coverage of drinking water in the country. Despite increased outlays since then, access to safe
     drinking water in India remains a challenge. Apart from access, water quality and sustainability of resources
     (water points and infrastructure developed) are issues of major concern.

     The National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP), which is supplementing the efforts of the State
     Governments by providing technical and financial assistance, is looking at rural drinking water from a holistic
     viewpoint. The Ministry has shifted its focus from hand pumps to piped water supply systems with the aim of
     providing monitored clean water and is focusing on those States which have low levels of piped water supply.

     The Water and Sanitation Program has compiled an excellent collection of success stories and best practices
     from the States of Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Punjab and Uttarakhand which address
     these key constraints. Some of these success stories, such as the Asoga village intervention in Karnataka which
     showcases a unique demand driven approach to facilitate participatory decision making leading to community
     ownership, the Bidholi piped water supply scheme in Uttarakhand which manages and recovers 100 per cent
     operation and maintenance costs from the community, the Shikayat Nivaran Kendra experiment in Punjab
     which uses information technology for online web enabled centralised complaint redressal and the Water and
     Sanitation Management Organisation experiment in Gujarat where the registered body acts as a facilitator in
     developing water and sanitation facilities owned and managed by communities, are all outstanding examples of
     how to address various challenges and shortcomings the programme is facing.

     I am sure that this compendium of best practices can play a major role in educating the State Governments and
     translating some of the learnings from these success stories to their State models to give a fillip to the NRDWP
     interventions in the country.

Sustainable Operation and
Maintenance
Asoga Village, Belgaum District, Karnataka
Taking on New Challenges | A Compendium of Good Practices in Rural Water Supply Schemes

               Asoga village in Karnataka has used a unique
               demand-driven approach to facilitate participatory
               decision making at all levels, leading to the
               community’s ownership of the scheme and its
               willingness to pay the water tariff promptly.

requirement for a 300 metre (m) x 200 m site to
house WTP components including the slow sand
filter. As Asoga is a small village, surrounded by
forests, such a large area of land was not available
nearby. Therefore, the technical team decided to test
the applicability of a bed micron sand filter in place of
the conventional slow sand filter for water treatment.
The bed micron sand filter was found to be compact,

A meeting of the VWSC was held in mid-2011
in which the members agreed that resource
mobilisation through collection of water tariff and
legalisation of unregistered connections were critical
for operationalising the scheme. Mr. Bhagat held
discussions with the officers of the Drinking Water
and Sanitation Department (DWSD), Government
of Jharkhand (GoJ), and agreed with the officers’
assessment that the scheme had a troubled history
(see Boxes 2.1 and 2.2) and its revival would require
resources to repair technical faults and ensure timely
and adequate water supply. He also acknowledged
the crucial role that community members needed to
play to ensure the scheme’s success. However, he was
confident that, once services improved, consumers
would agree to pay the outstanding tariff, and
resources for future operations would be generated.

In 2002, GoK issued orders stipulating that the
GPs should recover full O&M costs from users and
that development grants should not be diverted to
cover O&M expenses. An important measure that
the GPs initiated to recover full O&M costs was
to move towards metered house connections. The
VWSC of the Kinnigoli GP first introduced 100 per
cent volumetric metering. Its efficient management
of the water scheme resulting from 100 per cent
metering made headlines in the local media. The
media attention attracted visitors from other GPs to
study the system which involved practices adopted for
household connections, regular meter reading, repair
of meters and tariff setting to recover O&M costs
fully. Thereafter, a number of GPs in the

   Box 6.1: Case Study of the Charadih GP Multi-Village Scheme, Koderma District, Jharkhand

   A groundwater based Charadih Grameen Pipe Jalapurthi Yojana was implemented in Charadih GP to cover four
   villages. Three villages, Charadih, Kanyavan and Putto, are located in the Charadih GP while Khanoongaon Bhiga
   is located in Jhumri Panchayat. At present, the multi-village water supply scheme (MVWSS) delivers water to three
   villages in the Charadih GP while the distribution network is being laid in Khanoongaon Bhiga village. The MVWSS
   consists of two bore wells that are located near the river and are fitted with a 5 HP submersible pump which delivers
   water to a 25,000 gallon capacity overhead tank located about 1,500 m from the bore well. Once the infrastructure
   to cover the three villages was in place, the project was handed over to a committee comprising members of all
   the three villages. The Jal Upbhokta Samiti (JUS) has been carrying out O&M of the project since 1 January 2011.
   At present, 213 private household connections have been provided at a payment of `310 each. To encourage all
   residents to take private connections, stand posts have been discontinued. A monthly tariff of `100 per household
   is levied. The connection fee and tariff are deposited in a separate bank account in the name of the JUS. At present,
   the JUS bank account has a balance of `2,49,780. Water supply is provided for 45 minutes every day in all the three
   villages. JUS holds monthly meetings to discuss issues pertaining to water supply and carries out remedial measures
   to ensure supply to all villages every day. Community participation in the scheme has been of a high order as
   reflected by the fact that one of the Samiti members provided private land for constructing the overhead tank.

   In a departure from the usual norm in villages, male members of families were involved in fetching drinking water
   prior to this project. Now the project has enabled them to find regular job opportunities. Health benefits of the
   scheme are indicated by lower incidences of diarrhoea. Realising the economic and health benefits of the scheme,
   the community makes tariff payments promptly. The success of the project for the last two years has enabled JUS
   members to gain confidence to start planning the construction of an additional overhead tank to cover the water
   demand of all households and installation of solar pumps to reduce electricity charges. Thus, the transfer of the
   O&M of the water supply to JUS enabled the villagers to not only realise its benefits but also led to their developing
   a sense of ownership with a willingness to invest in its success.

Transferring the responsibility for O&M of the water
supply scheme to the VWSC was, by no means, the
end of the process of providing efficient water services.
In fact, the existing situation in Jharkhand – of the
long-term absence of PRIs and presence of left-wing
extremism – called for a far-sighted approach and
adoption of innovative processes to ensure people’s
participation in providing efficient water services to
rural households. The State Water and Sanitation

Financial Incentives for VWSCs
Ongoing and efficient O&M was an important
issue in ensuring the long-term sustainability of the
benefits of RWSSs. The SWSM understands that
typically successful projects are those in which the
rural populace regularly pays tariffs and which are run
by financially self-sustaining water supply institutions.               Water User Committee members at Charadih Gram
