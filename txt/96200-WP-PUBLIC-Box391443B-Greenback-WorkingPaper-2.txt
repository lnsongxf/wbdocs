    ABSTRACT


    M    igration experiences are often associated with some sort of transnational economic
         activity which connects the past and the present of migrants abroad, and specifi-
    cally with remittances. Motivations to send money at origin have been deeply inves-
    tigated at the micro as well as at the macro level, as remittances can affect recipient
    households’ well-being, investment and consumption levels in the receiving countries
    and play an insurance role against external shocks.

    This paper contributes to the literature on migrants’ remittances providing evidence
    for migrants from Morocco, Peru and Romania, three traditional labor-exporting coun-
    tries with a medium level of economic development, from three different geographical
    areas and with different migration patterns to Italy. Exploiting a relatively rich, albeit
    small-scale, dataset we analyze the spatial distribution of migrants’ nuclear families
    and households and we build three different migratory profiles—Loners, Pioneers and
    Followers—characterized by the timing and sequence of the migration event with
    respect to the rest of the nuclear family. Then we test a negative binomial model to
    describe the variation in the variable “remittances amount”. Beyond cross-country varia-
    tions and after controlling for the most commonly used individual demographic and
    economic characteristics, our analysis consistently clusters migrants according to their
    family and household structure in Italy and abroad to explain the total amount of remit-
    tances sent to the origin country.
