T    his technical note implements a firm-level productivity diagnostic using the census of
     manufacturing firms and a large services survey in Kenya. By using a number of stylized
productivity indicators, we aim to identify the ability of Kenyan firms to grow. The information
presented in this diagnostic will help to conduct evidence-based policy-making. Specifically,
implementing firm-level productivity diagnostics provide the necessary information for (i)
improving the targeting of economic policies, (ii) enhancing their effectiveness, (iii) making
more accurate predictions of the effects of industry shocks and policy reforms on the
economy, and (iv) understanding the behavior of macroeconomic variables by tracking the
evolution of variables at the firm-level. This note shows that there is a lot of heterogeneity
in firms’ attributes and performance,and this can potentially be attributed to the presence
of economic distortions that affect the efficient allocation of resources across firms, with the
manufacturing sector showing a lackluster performance compared to the services sector.
Overall, the findings highlight the importance of locating productivity at the center of the
competitiveness agenda as a key instrument for employment creation and poverty reduction.

   The 2010 Census of Industrial Production

   The 2010 Census of Industrial Production is a survey jointly realized by KNBS and the Ministry of
   Industrialization. Reporting information for 2,252 firms (1,814 firms responded and information
   for 438 others have been imputed on other regular surveys), this survey gathered information
   relating to the calendar year 2009, although some information is available for 2010. Targeted

   gas, steam and air conditioning supply) and E (Water supply, sewerage, waste management and
   remediation activities).

    The authors show that in the absence of distortions in product prices (e.g., taxes) and factor prices
    (e.g., labor market regulations, subsidized credit), that is, in the absence of heterogeneous policy
    treatment of firms in the same industry, optimal input choices and marginal product of capital
    and labor should equalize across firms. This is true if and only if the production function displays
    constant returns to scale, consumers are assumed to prefer and love varieties (a la Dixit-Stiglitz),
    and product mark-ups are constant. Needless to say, the latter are two strong assumptions. In this
    case, more capital and labor is allocated to firms with high physical TFP (TFPQ). The reallocation
    of inputs occurs until factor and product markets are in equilibrium (e.g., demand equals supply).
    By contrast, sizable gaps in marginal products of labor and capital across firms within narrowly
    defined industries are key signs of misallocation of resources under the identifying assumptions
    made by the authors.


    Hsieh and Klenow also show that when A (TFPQ) and TFPR are jointly log-normally distributed (a
    specific assumption about the distribution of TFPQ and TFPR and its linear combination), there is
    a simple closed-form expression for aggregate TFP,4 showing that the variance or dispersion in
    revenue TFP (TFPR) has a negative impact on aggregate sectoral productivity. In other words, if
    both TFPQ and TFPR fulfill the statistical assumption used by HK (jointly log-normally distributed),
    then the extent of misallocation is worse when there is greater dispersion of marginal products.


    However, it is worth mentioning that dispersion of physical TFP is not necessarily a measure of
    misallocation, as this variation can be explained by the randomness of the technological process,
    which can generate differences in innovation outputs and outcomes across firms, even when
    optimal input choices in terms of factors of production and R&D are identical across firms.

	 The OP measure decomposes an index of industry-level productivity, defined as the weighted average of firm-level (log)
5

  productivity, into a moment of the firm productivity distribution, such as the unweighted firm-level average, and a moment of
  the joint distribution of productivity and employment share or market share, such as the covariance between both variables.
  A high and positive value of the covariance term is associated with high allocative efficiency.

    	 This is an assumption that needs to be made in order to calculate the efficiency gains. In the analytical framework used by HK,
      there is a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) between goods, which comes from consumers’ preferences, and it’s reflected
      in the demand for each good. The CES assumption for consumers’ preferences means that the utility function has a constant
      percentage change in goods proportions (e.g., x and y) due to a percentage change in marginal rate of substitution.
