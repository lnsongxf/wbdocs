THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business
2016: starting a business, dealing with construction
permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in this year’s economy
profile.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2015 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

        August 2012), only 3-storey (or more) residential or office
        buildings would need such a report, it would also be needed for

      * Obtain a certified true copy (CTC) of the survey plan and
      CTC of the land ownership title

      A certified true copy of the survey plan must be obtained from
      the Land Registry to show the plot and its coordinates. Proof of
      ownership must also be obtained; otherwise the permit
      application will not be accepted. The sworn affidavit obtained
      previously must be presented to obtain the documents.

      master plan of Lagos. The black copy will be for BuildCo, the red
      copy will be registered with the Land Registry and a third copy
      will be kept at the Surveyor General Office. The cost of survey by
      a private surveyor can range from NGN 50,000 to NGN 100,000.

      Obtain development permit from the Lagos State Physical
      Planning Permit Authority (LASPPPA)

      The development permit authorizes construction and is valid for
      2 years. To obtain this permit, a building development plan
      portraying the intended uses and the proposed development on
      the site and the effect on adjacent developments and
      neighborhood must be prepared by a professional.

      Legally, a pre-approval inspection is required to verify that the
      land is located where the owner has stated it is and to verify that
      construction has not already started. BuildCo does not have to
      be present during the visit. An assessment of the amount to be
      paid will be written after that visit. All the necessary banking
5     accounts where each payment for each tax must be made must            42 days    NGN 7,100,616
      be listed on this letter of assessment.

      For construction involving a structure of more than two floors,
      the developer or owner must submit a general contractors all-
      risk insurance policy certificate to the Building Control Agency
      along with the application to commence building work.

      The Lagos State Physical Planning Authority charges a
      contribution levy (10% of the building permit cost) for the
      preparation and production of development plans, such as local,
      district, subject, and action plans; development guides; office
      maintenance; procurement and maintenance of vehicles; office
      equipment; and similar issues.

      Hire a private engineer to conduct inspections

      A private engineer must be hired to conduct the inspections
      during construction phase. According to the Doing Business
      methodology, BuildCo has an engineer that prepares all the
6     plans. However, this engineer cannot conduct the inspections as           1 day      NGN 122,011
      well, so an external engineer must be hired.

      Obtain certificate of structural stability (first pouring of
      concrete)

      The concrete crushing test is done as follows:
      1. A sample from a block of concrete is taken and brought back
      to the laboratory for testing. At this stage BuildCo pays for the
      entire testing. The testing is done at several stages:
      2. 7 days after the sample is taken, the first result is obtained.
7     3. 14 days after the sample is taken, the second result is obtained       7 days      NGN 35,000
      (7 days after the first result).
      4. 21 days after the sample is taken, the third result is obtained (7
      days after the second result is delivered).
      5. 28 days later the last and final result is obtained, as well as the
      final report.
      Normally the longer the concrete is kept, the harder it will
      become and therefore it will have a better resistance to the
      crushing test.

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March (for 11 economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city). As noted, the
warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff schedules may apply if a time-of-
use tariff is available.

PAYING TAXES
Economies around the world have made paying taxes                 and exemptions. Many have lowered tax rates. Changes
faster, easier and less costly for businesses—such as by          have brought concrete results. Some economies
consolidating payments and filings of taxes, offering             simplifying tax payment and reducing rates have seen
electronic systems for filing and payment, establishing           tax revenue rise. What tax reforms has Doing Business

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

                                               The liquidation proceeding converted from foreclosure attempt will
                                               take approximate 2 years in total. After BizBank's application for
                                               foreclosure, the court will grant an order which would last for 6
                                               months within which period Mirage may redeem its equity of

                                               parties, hold hearing and have a liquidation order issued. The court will
                                               appoint a liquidator who will finalize creditors' claims usually within 6
                                               months. Then the preparation and execution of the sale will take an

                                               The costs associated with the case would amount to approximately

would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in

economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 in the Doing Business 2016 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
