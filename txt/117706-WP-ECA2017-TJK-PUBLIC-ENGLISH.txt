Overview
Tajikistan’s          Despite continuing external challenges, economic output rose strongly in
economic growth       2016 according to official estimates. Driven mainly by foreign-financed public
accelerated in        and private investment, real GDP expanded by a robust 6.9 percent. At the
2016, driving down    same time, a protracted decline in real remittances and exchange rate
poverty rates.        depreciation in the context of an improving but still complex external
                      environment led to a significant adjustment in the current account balance.
                      Depressed trade activity resulted in a fiscal revenue shortfall, while the
                      exchange rate depreciation contributed to a surge in non-performing loans
                      (NPLs), reversing previous fiscal consolidation efforts and causing
                      substantial disruption to the performance of the financial sector. On the
                      upside, strong growth pushed down the poverty rate from 32 percent in 2015
                      to an estimated 30.3 percent by the third quarter of 2016, primarily driven
                      by an increase in wage incomes. The expansion of the Targeted Social
                      Assistance (TSA) program helped to reduce extreme poverty.

External              The authorities pursued expansionary fiscal policies in 2016, including
headwinds were        through a considerable increase in foreign-financed capital investment in the
countered by fiscal   energy sector, road infrastructure and projects related to the country’s 25th
stimulus and an       anniversary of independence. The government also stimulated domestic
accommodative         demand by raising public sector wages and social transfers. The exchange
monetary policy       rate, although depreciating, stabilized throughout the year following the
stance.               introduction of administrative measures in February 2016. Monetary policy
                      was accommodative, supporting a heightened demand for local currency as
                      the exchange rate stabilized and wholesale transactions that were previously
                      conducted in foreign currency switched to local currency. Domestic
                      purchases of monetary gold and the introduction of a surrender requirement
                      on ruble-denominated transfers drove an increase in international reserves.
                      However, materialized risk in the financial sector and the subsequent bailout
                      of Tajikistan’s two largest banks at end-2016 resulted in a deterioration of
                      fiscal and debt sustainability indicators.

Domestic              Although the external environment is expected to recover, risks to growth are
vulnerabilities put   weighted to the downside owing to rising domestic vulnerabilities. Lingering
the positive growth   challenges in the financial sector, high state-owned enterprise (SOE)
outlook at risk.      contingent liability risk and an unconducive business climate weigh on
                      economic growth prospects. Ongoing bank asset quality reviews may reveal
                      additional capitalization needs while contradictory objectives and
                      inefficiencies in the tax administration may potentially erode the tax base and
                      deter new investments. A weaker-than-expected recovery in regional
                      economies or delays in the expansion of the TSA program could derail
                      poverty reduction efforts. Continuing challenges in accessing credit by pro-
                      poor sectors of the economy will diminish the pace of both poverty reduction
                      and job creation in low-skilled sectors like construction and agriculture.

A. Recent Socio-Economic Developments
Recent Political Events
The president’s        As is customary, following the annual address of the president, Emomali
annual address         Rahmon, the cabinet and other key entities were reshuffled in the beginning

cabinet reshuffle.     including finance, transport and health and social protection—and the State
                       Committee for State Property Management, among others, were all
                       realigned.

The speech focused     In his annual address, President Rahmon emphasized the need to support
on challenges in       domestic private sector development and entrepreneurship, especially given
the private and        ongoing external economic challenges. He called on the National Bank of
banking sectors.       Tajikistan (NBT, the central bank) and the finance ministry to strengthen
                       banking sector oversight and to undertake urgent measures to protect
                       depositors’ rights.

A new diplomatic       The government is re-engaging with Uzbekistan following 25 years of
relationship with      diplomatic and economic tension. Uzbekistan's foreign affairs minister met
Uzbekistan is          with President Rahmon in Dushanbe in September 2016 and conveyed his
anticipated.           country's willingness to "reset" relations with Tajikistan, including by
                       boosting trade and restoring direct flights between the two countries. As a
                       result, the first direct flight since 1992 between Tajikistan and Uzbekistan
                       took place on February 10, 2017.

The Russian            The president of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, visited Dushanbe
president’s visit to   on February 27-28, 2017, on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the
Tajikistan             establishment of diplomatic relations between Russia and Tajikistan. A
reaffirmed strong      number of cooperation documents were signed, including an agreement on
bilateral ties.        the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and a revision of a ban on
                       travel to Russia by Tajik citizens accused of violating migration regulations.
                       As many as 200,000 Tajik laborers have been affected by the travel ban;
                       under the revision, waivers may be granted to those who committed minor
                       violations. During the visit, Russian officials also expressed their readiness
                       to support increased agricultural exports from Tajikistan to Russia, including
                       through subsidizing the railway transportation of goods.

Low growth in                    On the supply side, economic growth was driven by the construction and
the services                     industry sectors, which recorded annual growth rates of 20.3 percent and
sector was more                  16.0 percent, respectively. Donor-supported public investment in the
than offset by                   rehabilitation of hydropower plants and road infrastructure drove firm
strong                           growth in the construction sector, while industrial output was supported by
construction and                 strong foreign direct investment (FDI) in coal and gold mining and processing
industrial                       as well as the food and textile industries. The economic contribution of
output.                          agriculture to GDP was modest in 2016, with annual growth of 5.2 percent
                                 (Figure 2), largely reflecting enhanced efficiency gains and favorable weather
                                 conditions. Conversely, growth in the services sector slowed to 1.1 percent
                                 (from 2.4 percent in 2015) owing to weak foreign trade activity as imports
                                 contracted.

External Sector
 The exchange       Tajikistan’s external position improved in 2016 largely as a result of
 rate adjustment    contraction of consumer imports. The current-account deficit narrowed to 3.8
 drove a            percent of GDP from 6.4 percent in 2015 (Figure 4). With consumer
                    purchasing power restrained by lower remittance inflows and currency
 reduction in the
                    depreciation, import spending on goods fell by 8.9 percent year on year in
 in the external    2016 (Figure 5). Conversely, export earnings rose by 20.8 percent year on year
 deficit.           as domestic prices became more competitive, supported by new production
                    capacity gains, largely in the minerals sector. However, earnings from key
                    export commodities such as primary aluminum and cotton fiber declined by 4
                    percent and 15.1 percent, respectively—the former due to price effect and the

                     market pressures. The economy created almost 59,000 jobs in 2016, more than
                     half of which were classified as permanent. The share of temporary and
                     seasonal jobs was relatively stable, hovering between 22 and 23.5 percent.
                     When the pre- and post-Russian recession periods are compared, a significant
                     shift is observed regarding wage employment, with jobs in agriculture falling
                     by 3.1 percentage points in 2016 compared with 2014. Conversely, the share
                     of wage employment in education and the health sector (including other social
                     services) rose by 1.8 percentage points and 1.1 percentage points, respectively,
                     in 2016. Agriculture continues to dominate the labor market but remains the
                     lowest-paid sector (Figure 8). In contrast, the highest-paid industries are
                     financial services and construction.

                        student and pensioner benefits. These factors helped to drive down the
                        national poverty rate from 32 percent in 2014 to 30.3 percent in the third
                        quarter of 2016, with the rate of extreme poverty falling to 14 percent. The
                        L2TJK survey also monitors the share of migrants returning to Tajikistan. This
                        ratio has remained relatively stable since the launch of the survey in May 2015
                        at about 2 percent; the periods with the lowest share of returning migrants

                                 Republican Subordination (RRP) persistently show poverty rates above the
                                 national average. In 2015-2016, the average poverty rate in rural areas was
                                 almost ten percentage points higher than that of urban areas. Although the
                                 seasonal nature of poverty is well known, it is important to note that the
                                 churning of poverty is unusually high in Tajikistan. In particular, it is striking
                                 that 48 percent of the population was poor during only some quarters of 2015;
                                 only 13 percent of the population was poor during the entire year.

B. Macroeconomic Policies and Structural Reforms
Assessment of Fiscal and Debt Policies
Overly-ambitious        Tajikistan’s fiscal standing deteriorated due to lower-than-expected
budget assumptions      revenue, insufficient mid-year adjustments to expenditure and an increase
set the stage for a     in foreign-financed public investment programs (PIPs). Despite various
widening fiscal         efforts by the government to contain the deficit—including spending cuts
deficit.                and increased scrutiny of low-priority current and capital outlays and an
                        increase in non-tax collections—the fiscal deficit more than doubled in
                        2016, to 4 percent of GDP (from 1.9 percent in 2015). When the cost of the
                        financial sector bailout is included, the deficit rises to 10.1 percent of GDP.

 Revenue                Overall revenue significantly underperformed across all major categories
 underperformed         in 2016, reflecting weak foreign trade flows and depressed domestic
 while expenditure      business activity. Gross tax collections undershot the budget target by 7.3
 was driven by          percent with significant shortfalls in external value-added tax (VAT),
 foreign-financed       income/profit taxes and social contributions. The shortfall was partially
 public investments.    offset by strong collections of non-tax revenue, which over-performed by
                        43.4 percent as a result of higher collections of fines and penalties on
                        retroactive cameral audits. Higher PIP grants—which rose by 31.4 percent
                        year on year—also helped to contain the budget deficit. Expenditure was
                        largely driven by foreign-financed PIPs (in the energy, transport and social
                        sectors), outlays related to projects commemorating the 25th anniversary
                        of Tajikistan’s independence and increase in the minimum wage, public
                        sector wages, pensions and other social transfers. Core social and strategic
                        capital spending (including for the Rogun hydropower plant) was ring-
                        fenced. The government also honored its commitment to expand the TSA

                           (IFIs) represent around one-third of external debt. In line with the
                           Medium-Term Debt Strategy 2015-2017, in 2016 the government
                           contracted loans with a 35 percent grant element while keeping total
                           external debt below 40 percent of GDP.

Weak compliance             With the exception of a US$20 million credit tranche from the Eurasian
limited access to IFI       Development Bank, Tajikistan did not receive budgetary support from IFIs
budgetary support.          in 2016. The World Bank, Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the
                            European Union (EU) all suspended budgetary support disbursements to
                            Tajikistan after policy milestones were missed and issues in the financial
                            sector were deemed to have not been adequately resolved. The fiscal deficit
                            was financed through a combination of new debt, monetization, the
                            privatization of state assets and a drawdown of government deposits.

Assessment of Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
 Monetary policy                 The money supply grew rapidly in 2016 (Figure 12) owing to the
 kept inflation in               introduction of surrender requirements on ruble remittances, domestic
 single digits.                  gold purchases, emergency liquidity support and a drawdown of
                                 government deposits. However, inflationary pressures were contained as a
                                 result of the de-dollarization of wholesale transactions formerly conducted
                                 in foreign exchange. Private sector credit continued to contract owing to
                                 banking sector instability and reduced business activity. Throughout 2016
                                 and into 2017, the NBT tightened monetary policy by steadily raising the
                                 refinancing rate from 8 percent to 16 percent, reserve requirement rates for
                                 somoni and foreign exchange deposits from 1.5 percent and 7 percent to 3
                                 percent and 9 percent, respectively, while also sharply stepping up
                                 sterilization. The liquidity support rate for emergency needs was also
                                 increased above the interbank rate by 200 basis points.

  Exchange rates                The protracted decline in remittances, coupled with weak export earnings at
  stabilized after              the beginning of 2016, put significant pressure on exchange rates (Figure 13).
  the introduction              The authorities responded in early 2016 by introducing several
  of administrative             administrative measures including the closure of foreign exchange kiosks, the
  measures early                introduction of a 50 percent surrender requirement and the mandatory
  in the year.                  conversion of ruble remittances into somoni. These measures helped
                                exchange rates to stabilize and converge for different market segments. The
                                authorities shored up this framework by strengthening legal penalties for the
                                illicit use of foreign exchange and increasing prosecutions with the help of
                                law enforcement agencies. In 2016 the somoni depreciated by 11.2 percent
                                vis-à-vis the US dollar, resulting in a cumulative depreciation of 35 percent in
                                2015-2016. This effectively reversed the real appreciation of the somoni from
                                earlier periods, led by a policy change that favored a greater exchange rate
                                flexibility. According to NBT estimates, the somoni was undervalued in real
                                terms by around 3 percent at end-2016. However, in response to liquidity
                                injections associated with the financial sector bailout, exchange rate
                                pressures rebounded at the beginning of 2017.

                                However, the IMF’s 2016 Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and
                                Exchange Restrictions (AREAER), classified the de-facto exchange rate

                     electronic filing of documents to obtain permits. In July 2016 the government
                     introduced a new Inspection Law with a risk-based approach for business
                     inspections to ensure compliance (in contrast to a previous focus on revealing
                     inconsistencies and imposing fines). To ensure a unified approach and to
                     coordinate the activities of the various inspection bodies, the government
                     established a Coordination Council on Inspection. Moreover, the government

C. Economic Outlook and Risks
Baseline Scenario
Domestic            Tajikistan’s real GDP growth rate is projected to decelerate in 2017 before

economic growth     vulnerabilities in SOEs and an unconducive business climate will weigh on
prospects.          the economy’s growth prospects. Conversely, a gradual recovery in regional
                    economies, the projected rebound of remittances and the restoration of
                    bank lending, subject to comprehensive reforms, are expected to boost
                    consumption and services growth over the medium term. A prudent
                    monetary policy stance and improved policy transmission mechanisms will
                    support the objective of keeping inflation in single digits.

The external        With FDI and debt inflows more than offsetting the current-account deficit,

exogenous           moderate price improvements for the country’s principal export
shocks.             commodities—namely cotton and aluminum—should result in a slight
                    reduction in the current-account deficit and boost fiscal revenue. To the
                    extent that the macroeconomic management framework is enhanced to
                    ensure prudence—and structural reforms to improve the business climate
                    are sustained and accelerated—higher public and private inflows are
                    expected to materialize. Foreign reserves are forecast to rise to above the
                    benchmark minimum of three months of import cover.

Fiscal adjustment   The public sector outlook envisages that gradual fiscal consolidation efforts
will ensure         will help to ensure fiscal and debt sustainability. Driven by lower capital
sustainability.     spending and a modest expansion of the tax base, the fiscal deficit is forecast
                    to narrow gradually. Core social spending—including transfers to the most
                    vulnerable—are expected to be safeguarded. However, public debt is
                    projected to rise as a result of the costs associated with the financial sector
                    bailout and new PIP-related external borrowing.

 in 2017 (4 percent of GDP) and 2018 (3.5 percent of GDP). Materialization of fiscal risks due to contingent liabilities of
 SOEs could increase these figures by an additional 8 percent of GDP over the medium term, but this is excluded from

D. Focus Section: The Financial Sector Crisis
Financial Sector Overview
    Tajikistan’s small     With an asset to GDP ratio of only 39 percent,5 Tajikistan’s financial sector
    financial sector is    is relatively small compared to those of other regional economies. The
    undercapitalized       banking industry represents almost 90 percent of total financial sector
    and heavily            assets and comprises 16 commercial banks, including one fully state-
    concentrated.          owned bank, two majority state-owned banks and six majority foreign-
                           owned banks. The largest four banks account for more than 80 percent of
                           total bank assets. The micro-finance sector is the second largest industry,
                           represented by 34 micro-deposit organizations and 46 micro-lending
                           organizations and funds. The size of the insurance and leasing sectors is
                           small, while the capital market is limited to 91-day treasury bills and
                           advisory services are virtually non-existent.6

                           deposit and lending rates stood at 16 percent and 25 percent, respectively,
                           in local currency terms at end-2016. The interest rate margin was high (at
                           over 9 percent), indicating low efficiency, limited competition and severe
                           funding constraints.

Developments
    Banking sector         The banking sector in Tajikistan has a long history of weak performance,
    issues were            including a major collapse after independence, a largest bank resolution in
    evident even           2004 and its bailout in 2012. The first signs of the 2016 financial sector
    before the             crisis were evident in 2013, when the NPL ratio suddenly doubled to 15.9
    Russian crisis.        percent, up from an average of 8 percent in 2010-2012. Risks related to
                           poor lending practices, including directed lending and inadequate risk
                           management were further magnified by shortcomings in corporate
                           governance and low capitalization levels in key banks. The onset of
                           recession in Russia in 2014-16 worsened the situation. A simultaneous fall
                           in remittances depressed private consumption and squeezed profit
                           margins in the domestic market. As a result, asset quality indicators
                           deteriorated rapidly, with NPLs rising from 25 percent in 2014 to 54
                           percent by the end of 2016.7 The banking sector portfolio, characterized
                           by high levels of unhedged foreign-exchange borrowers, suffered even
                           more due to a sharp depreciation of the somoni (totaling more than 39
                           percent in 2014-2016).

                           temporary administrators were extended several times as decisions were
                           made in late 2016 and early 2017 as to whether the banks would be
                           recapitalized or liquidated.8 Following the recapitalization of two banks
                           (Agroinvestbank and Tajiksodirotbank)—in the amount of 6.1 percent of
                           GDP9—and with NBT’s new regulatory mandate to supplement reserves,
                           the capital adequacy ratio rose sharply, to 15 percent at end-2016 (from 6
                           percent in September 2016). Although the liquidity injection from the
                           bailout propped up liquidity indicators, its distribution across the system

being assigned.
9 At the end of 2016, the Ministry of Finance issued bonds totaling TJS 3.3 billion with a five-year maturity and

a 2 percent yield. Bonds were issued against posted collateral and equity acquisition in recapitalized banks.

                             remains uneven due to weaknesses in the interbank market. Two smaller
                             banks, Tajprombank and Fononbank, were ordered into liquidation
                             procedures in February 2017. The Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF)
                             announced sufficient funds to cover state-guaranteed deposits (equivalent
                             to TJS 17,5000 per individual). Although major IFIs had warned for years
                             about the key weaknesses and risks that precipitated the crisis, a weak
                             supervisory framework and political sensitivities prevented the timely
                             provision of corrective actions.


Reforms at the National Bank of Tajikistan
 The NBT is                  Since May 2015 the NBT introduced a number of reforms to strengthen its
 strengthening its           supervisory response and build new mechanisms for macro-prudential
 regulatory                  policy, financial stability, bank resolution and consumer protection. A new
 framework.                  management team is in place, and new staff members have been hired. The
                             financial stability, risk management and consumer protection units have
                             been established and the IMF, World Bank and EBRD are actively providing
                             assistance to the authorities.

World Bank Group Activities in the Financial Sector
                           Ongoing support by the World Bank Group (WBG) to the financial sector in
                           Tajikistan includes a wide array of subjects that fall into seven main
                           categories:

                             •    Financial Stability. In line with the recommendations of the Financial
                                  System Stability Assessment (FSSA),10 in 2015 the NBT established a
                                  Financial Stability Department, and in 2016 it was strengthened by an
                                  internal Financial Stability Committee. In March 2016, the first
                                  Financial Stability Monitoring Report (FSMR) was issued; quarterly
                                  reports were prepared throughout the year. In March 2017, the first
                                  annual Financial Stability Report (FSR) was approved by NBT Board.
                                  The authorities have decided to establish an inter-ministerial
                                  committee on the financial stability to include the NBT, the DIF, the
                                  Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Development and
                                  Trade

                             •    Bank Resolution Framework. Draft legislation that introduces new
                                  instruments for crisis preparedness and rapid response is slated for
                                  government approval in the third quarter of 2017.
                             •    NPL Action Plan and Bank Stress-Tests. Regulations were revised for
                                  more transparent reporting and the establishment of funds for loan


10   The FSSA is a joint product of the IMF and World Bank. The most recent report was prepared in May 2015.


                                                                                                          |19
            loss provisioning. Stress tests were conducted for all 16 banks in
            2016.
        •   Bank Resolution Plans. A model template was developed for
            contingency planning, but financing assistance may be needed from
            donors for further action.
        •   Consumer Protection. A consumer protection strategy was finalized
            for expedited adoption in March 2017 and relevant department has
            become fully operational within the NBT structure.
        •   Payment Systems. The new RTGS payment system is expected to be
            upgraded with new hardware and software in 2018.
        •   Insurance Sector. A new insurance law was approved in July 2016 and
            supervision over the sector was sifted to the NBT to be operational
            since January 2018.
      Moreover, the International Finance Corporation (of the World Bank Group)
      has been implementing a series of projects in collaboration with other
      donors, particularly in:

        •   Strengthening the credit reporting system;
        •   Introducing a modern secured transaction system and on-line
            moveable collateral registry;
        •   Developing responsible microfinance practices and drafting of a
            microfinance strategy;
        •   Developing digital financial services and cashless operations;
        •   Strengthening advisory services for agriculture sector access to
            finance.
      Despite significant progress, much remains to be done particularly with
      regards to the sustainability and regulatory measures discussed above.
      Based on ongoing consultations with the authorities, the WBG has identified
      five areas for further improvement: financial stability, supervision,
      consumer protection, insurance industry and deposit insurance fund.

Notes: An ellipsis (…) indicates that data are not available. 1/ Calculations include the cost of the financial sector
bailout in 2016 (6 percent of GDP) and projected additional recapitalization in 2017 (4 percent of GDP) and 2018 (3.5
percent of GDP). Fiscal risks stemming from SOE contingent liabilities may result in an additional 8 percent of GDP
increase over the medium term (this is excluded from current calculations).
