                          ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
This public expenditure review would not have been possible without the extraordinary degree of cooperation
from His Excellency Minister U Win Shein, Director-General (Budget) Dr. Maung Maung Win, and Deputy
Director-General (Budget) Daw Nwe Nwe Win in the Ministry of Finance; Lieutenant Ko Ko in the Ministry of
Home Affairs; Her Excellency Minister Dr. Khin San Yee and His Excellency Minister Dr. Mya Aye (Retired) in the
Ministry of Education; and His Excellency Minister Dr. Than Aung, His Excellency Minister Dr. Pe Thet Khin
(Resigned) in the Ministry of Health. Their help is deeply appreciated. They are not, however, responsible for
any of the conclusions in this report. Any errors are the responsibility of the authors. Special thanks are
extended to the staff of the Budget Bureau in the Ministry of Finance who helped establish a comprehensive
database for this review.
The report was prepared by a multi-donor team led by Khwima Nthara and Douglas Addison with financial
assistance from the Australian Department for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Editorial assistance was provided by
Eric Palladini. The work was conducted under the guidance of Ulrich Zachau, Satu Kähkönen, Mathew Verghis,
Shabih Mohib, Luis Benveniste, Toomas Palu, and Rob Taliercio. The team is grateful for their ongoing support
and guidance provided.
Chapter 2 on the sustainability of aggregate fiscal policy was led by Khwima Nthara and Habib Rab. The team
included Valentina Flamini (IMF), Sarah Somoudi (DfID), and Douglas Addison. Useful comments were received
from May Thet Zin, Lars Sondergaard, Kenichiro Kashiwase (IMF), Kelly Eckhold (IMF), and Declan Magee (DfID).
Chapter 3 on rebalancing the composition of the Union Budget was led by Douglas Addison. Valuable assistance
in data preparation was received from the Budget Bureau in the Ministry of Finance. Useful comments were
provided by May Thet Zin, Lars Sondergaard and Declan Magee (DfID).
Chapter 4 on improving coverage, quality and equity of education was led by Lars Sondergaard. The team
included Victor Levin, Serif Sayin, Emiko Naka, Dilaka Lathapipat, Ei Kalya Moore. Nilar Tun prepared additional
material. The report draws on work carried out as part of World Bank project preparations for “Decentralized
Funding to Schools Project” and a “Rapid Assessment of the Financing to Education.” The rapid assessment
was carried out as part of phase 1 of the Comprehensive Education Sector Review process. This rapid
assessment was prepared jointly by Yee Yee Cho (Ministry of Education), Lars Sondergaard, Tsuyoshi Fukao,
Dilaka Lathapipat, Victor Levine, Ei Moore, Vachraras Pasuksuwan, Emiko Naka (DFAT), and James Stevens.

                        The PER aims to identify short to medium-term options for strengthening
                        macro-fiscal institutions to monitor and respond to the challenge of sustainably
                        ramping up spending on the back of limited fiscal space.

                                                    x
                        The size of general government in Myanmar is small compared to other
                        countries. This reflects its historically narrow revenue base (6.3 percent of GDP
                        in 2009) and a limited role in public service delivery (general government
                        spending 7.2 percent of GDP in 2009).
                        Between 2009 and 2014, general government revenue went from 6 to 11
                        percent of GDP thanks to one-off measures (exchange rate devaluation,
                        telecom license sales) and a widened tax base. General government
                        expenditure nearly doubled to 13 percent of GDP.

Public debt is within   The overall level of public debt in Myanmar has declined from 77 percent of

more closely at the
debt portfolio.         Part of this vulnerability stems from the composition of Myanmar’s public debt
                        portfolio, which includes high shares of short-term domestic financing and non-
                        concessional external loans. This calls for greater attention to the composition
                        of deficit financing.

                        Myanmar’s medium-term fiscal outlook is subject to important risks, including
                        falling gas prices. Spending growth in the baseline scenario remains relatively
                        strong as falling gas receipts may be offset by other tax and non-tax receipts. A
                        bigger shock would require significant expenditure adjustments.

Closer attention to     The PER highlights three areas of fiscal risks that warrant closer attention and

and SEEs.

                        The PER recommends to: (i) adopt and publish a borrowing plan for the Union
                        Budget, moving eventually to a Medium-Term Debt Strategy; (ii) centralize
                        authority in MoF for negotiation and approval of new loans; (iii) channel all
                        resource rents from Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise to the Union Budget,
                        consider fiscal rules and benchmarks, and integrate gas revenue scenarios in

                        SEEs.

                     spending was lower than the Lower-Middle and Middle-Income-Countries. The
                     situation is changing. The 2015/16 budget included a near doubling of the
                     wage bill. This may not pose an immediate concern in the medium-term
                     because there may be scope for a reduction in the high share of capital
                     spending. Even so, the authorities should link any further wage increase to a
                     fiscal sustainability analysis and broader public administration reform.


                     The PER recommends to: (i) review and rationalize tax exemptions through a
                     tax expenditure analysis, and consolidate the granting of any new exemptions;
                     (ii) prioritize management of revenue arrears and consider gradual elimination
                     of extra-budgetary ‘other accounts’; (iii) initiate an expenditure review of
                     military spending to identify potential efficiency gains; (iv) conduct a review of
                     public investment management and efficiency, including scope for savings
                     through reduced spending on commercial activities in economic services; (v)
                     conduct a pay and grading exercise to help inform any future changes to the
                     wage bill.

                       reforms and spending to improve coverage, quality and equity of education.

                       Myanmar has suffered from low school enrolment and completion rates (one
                       third of 1.2 million students enrolled in grade 1 made it to grade 11, and only
                       one third of those passed the school leaving exam); poor learning outcomes (9

                       in poorer areas compared to 85 percent average nationally).

                       government quadrupled the budget on education between 2011/12 and
                       2013/14, albeit from a low base.

                       The MoE is now grappling with pressures to deliver more despite: (i) limited
                       administrative, budget and performance data as a basis to prioritize spending;
                       (ii) fledgling capacity to analyze policy and budget linkages; and (iii) fiduciary

                       To assist in policy making and monitoring, the PER recommends: (i) use
                       standardized assessments of student learning outcomes to monitor the quality
                       of the education system. As a starting point, MoE could use the Early Grade

                       To ensure that rapidly rising budgets are aligned with implementation capacity,
                       the PER recommends: (ii) MoE and MoF to carry out thorough costing of new
                       initiatives (e.g. more school years, more teacher training, modernized
                       curriculum, coverage to disadvantaged groups, early childhood education) and
                       propose resourcing needs with implementation plans; and (iii) strengthen

                        schools, the PER recommends: (iv) to empower district officers or school
                        principals to take decisions within a framework of accountability for results to
                        be developed under the leadership of MoE; and (v) carry out a Public
                        Expenditure Tracking Survey to ensure schools are receiving allocations in
                        accordance with the Ministry’s guidelines (i.e. in accordance with the formula
                        and the time table specified in those guidelines).

                        The PER aims to analyze government expenditures and policies for healthcare
                        between 2009/10 and 2013/14, and to propose options for further reforms in
                        policies and spending, in particular through more efficient and more equitable
                        government spending.

                        In 2012, government spending on public health was a mere $1.6 per-capita per
                        year, with out-of-pocket payments by households accounting for almost 80
                        percent of total health spending. This has created serious obstacles to
                        healthcare access, with rural and hard to reach areas most severely affected,
                        and some of the lowest health outcomes among ASEAN countries.

                        emergency surgery under certain circumstances in some facilities.

                        There are early signs that these are beginning to help reduce prohibitive out-

                        increase in expenditure on drugs and medical consumables. Further costs have
                        been incurred due to wage increases and heavy investments in facilities and
                        equipment. These policies have been financed through a nine-fold increase in
                        Ministry of Health spending between 2009/10 and 2013/14.

                        Ongoing challenges include constraints on policy making and monitoring due
                        to unreliable and incomplete data, and high costs due to expenditure
                        inefficiencies. In the medium-term, the government may also want to consider

                        The PER aims to provide an assessment of intergovernmental fiscal relations
                        over the period 2009/10 through 2014/15 and suggests options for prioritizing
                        administrative and fiscal reforms. These are provided within an overall
                        framework of which includes expenditure and revenue responsibilities and
                        fiscal transfers.

                        The 2008 Constitution provides the overarching framework for sub-national
                        administration in Myanmar. Initial steps have been taken to establish
                        legislative and executive bodies at State and Region level.

                        There are functional tensions between newly established sub-national
                        institutions and traditional arrangements of central control. This could lead to
                        confusion over management of and accountability for public services. In
                        addition, accountability for results in public service delivery will be made easier
                        when outcome and output monitoring is systematic and publicly reported.

                        States/regions have little impact on public sector borrowing because their
                        expenditures are budgeted to match expected revenues and Union transfers.

                        States/Regions. The sub-national spending share in 2013/14 was therefore
                        small (7 percent of public sector budget). A relatively large portion of
                        State/Region spending is used for capital investment. Per-capita spending by

    INTRODUCTION

1   Union Budget policies have undergone fundamental shifts since 2011 to
    accelerate delivery of essential public services. This first ever Public Expenditure
    Review for Myanmar tries to better understand these shifts and recommend
    ways to further align budget policies to development priorities.

    Decades of government underspending on the back of a very low revenue base
    with no tax culture have contributed to poor economic and social outcomes. A
    new government in 2010 sought to redress this by implementing reforms
    towards a service oriented approach.

    Efforts have been made to strengthen institutions of Public Finance
    Management. Economic controls have been gradually liberalized, steps to
    delegate fiscal responsibilities to sub-national authorities have been taken, and
    reforms to encourage private sector investment are under way.

    The PER is a first step in deepening policy dialogue on Union Budget issues. It
    focuses on general government, and touches on SEEs to the extent that the
    impact general government finances and fiscal policy.

    The Myanmar PER 2015 is divided into five parts: (i) sustainability of aggregate
    fiscal policy; (ii) rebalancing the composition of the Union Budget; (iii)
    improving coverage, quality and equity of education services; (iv) going from
    more to better government spending on health; and (v) a sound fiscal
    framework for sub-national service delivery.

    Findings and recommendations from each part will be discussed in greater
    detail with government counterparts to help develop a concrete plan of action.
    The PER is expected to be the start of future systematic analysis of Union
    Budget policies.




                             1
                     CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION
    A. Background and Objectives

1.1.    The Myanmar Public Expenditure Review (2015) aims to take stock of the fundamental shifts in
Union Budget policies since 2011, and recommend ways to further align those policies with the country’s
enormous development needs. The Myanmar PER analyzes general government finances from 2009/10
to 2013/14, a period in which government spending almost doubled and was refocused on addressing
major service delivery gaps. This marked the start of a long-term process to transform the Union Budget
into an instrument for growth and poverty reduction. Initial efforts at increasing budget transparency
have already fueled debate and demand for results in the executive, the legislature and the public at large.

1.2.     The objectives of the Myanmar PER (2015) are to: (i) provide empirical analysis of, and establish
a baseline on, the alignment of the Union Budget with the country’s development priorities; (ii) help
prioritize reform of Union Budget policies and institutions to promote fiscal discipline, allocative
efficiency, and value for money; (iii) offer a basis for future systematic analysis of Union Budget policies
and thereby enhance transparency of and accountability for public service delivery. The findings and
recommendations of this first PER should help to: further deepen policy dialogue between government
and development partners; inform the provision of technical assistance to help implement
recommendations; and enable stakeholders to monitor progress.

    B. Economic Context

1.3.     Myanmar has been characterized by a centrally controlled government and economy. The
country’s development has been stymied for decades by violent conflict. In an attempt to impose stability
and promote development, the military took over power through a coup in 1962 and introduced the
Burmese Way to Socialism, which became a blue print for Myanmar’s economic policy from 1962 to 1988.
The framework was characterized by central planning and control of many aspects of the economy, an
isolationist policy that sought to reduce foreign influence, and an increased role of the military in the
economy including through ownership of companies.

1.4.    These policies resulted in poor outcomes on macroeconomic stability and public service
delivery. Infrastructure services were far below those in most poor and lower-middle-income countries.
Health and education outcome indicators declined, as households were burdened with health care and
education costs. Families were typically required to pay for the cost of medicines and materials needed
for surgical procedures and had to pay for uniforms, writing supplies, and exercise books for their
children’s schooling. Health facility and school usage was below potential because of these high “out-of-
pocket” costs. Social protection programs for households falling into poverty were almost absent.

1.5.    A new government elected in 2010 fundamentally reoriented policies towards public service
delivery. The December 2012 Framework for Economic and Social Reform (FESR) set out a number of
policy reforms that committed the government to achieving people-centered development, civic
participation and human resource development, effective and transparent use of public financial
resources, sustainable regional development, decentralization and greater autonomy for local
government, and poverty reduction.


                                                     2
1.6.     Economic controls were gradually liberalized with major impact on public finances. One of the
most distorting elements of prior economic controls was the use of a highly overvalued official exchange
rate, which created substantial resource misallocations in the economy. According to one estimate, the
total efficiency loss caused by the multiple exchange rate regime was estimated at about 14–17 percent
of GDP in 2006/07.1 The over-valued official exchange rate was unified under a managed float in 2012,
thus effectively bringing the official rate to near parity with the market determined rate used by the rest
of the economy. This had a major positive impact on government revenue thanks to revaluation of Kyat
denominated receipts.

1.7.    Policies on intergovernmental relations also began to evolve. Parliaments for States/Regions
have been created and elections were held in 2010. According to the 2008 Constitution, States and
Regions are assigned specific but limited responsibilities for public service delivery, particularly for the
small and medium-scale infrastructure in their areas. The new government has made it clear that it
intends to implement this change and has issued several edicts to that end. Even so, the Union continues
to maintain a high degree of control over the fiscal policies of States/Regions. Moreover, the 2008
Constitution continues to assign to the Union responsibilities for providing most public services, including
health and education, as well as large scale infrastructure.

1.8.    To help encourage the private sector, the FESR commits the government to corporatize or
privatize most SEEs. In 2009/10, the Union had ownership of 50 formally defined SEEs and the states and
regions own still more. Many of these, in turn, operate multiple factories or other facilities in industries
that do not warrant public sector involvement. SEEs also benefit from implicit and explicit government
subsidies, which have restricted competition and private sector growth.

    C. Scope of Public Sector

1.9.     A description of the scope of the public sector is important to establish the unit of analysis in
this PER. Until 2011, the Union government controlled all aspects of the public sector, which included:
central ministries and departments; sub-national authorities (States/Regions, cantons, development
committees); and SEEs, most of which fall under the ownership of ministries and departments (Figure
1.1). The PER is focused primarily on the general government part of the public sector, which in a unitary
state like Myanmar includes central and sub-national authorities that are engaged in non-market, non-
production public service delivery. It excludes SEEs, which even though in Myanmar are part of general
government ministries, are still engaged in either market or other production-based activities.

1.10. The scope of Union government coverage changed slightly during the period of preparation of
this PER. With effect from November 2010, each State and Region has its own parliament that adopts its
own annual budgets, subject to review by a Finance Committee led by one of the Vice Presidents, the
Minister of Finance and selected ministers. Thus, in theory, the Union government is now equivalent to
the central government. In practice, however, the concepts of central and general government in
Myanmar were essentially equivalent for the period under review because of limits on any actual
devolution of authority to States and Regions. For the purposes of this review, “Union” refers to general
government, excluding SEEs, while the “public sector” refers to the broader definition of government
including the SEEs.

1.11. The PER covers SEEs to the extent that they affect general government finances. In the case of
Myanmar, during the period under review, the SEEs were funded through the Union Budget. All SEE
transactions flow into and out of the same Union Fund Account (also referred to as the State Fund
Account) used by the Union ministries as well as sub-national authorities. Analysis of macro-fiscal policies
needs to take account of the links between SEEs and the general government (e.g. transfers to and from
SEEs, contingent liabilities). This is covered in chapter 2, which looks at strengthening fiscal oversight of
SEEs. But in fiscal accounting, SEEs that are market operators should be treated as entities with separate
balance sheets.2 This is usually formalized through corporatization processes, which the government has
already begun to explore for selected SEEs.

1.12. There are two other topics related to the comprehensiveness of public sector accounts and their
impact on general government finances and macro-fiscal outcomes. These are: (i) extra-budgetary
accounts; and (ii) the operations of two off-budget military holding companies. Extra-budgetary accounts,
referred to as “other accounts,” are part of the consolidated Union Fund Account (together with Ministry
and Development Accounts and SEE Accounts) but are not part of the Union Budget. There is little
oversight or reporting on these accounts. They are touched on briefly in chapters 2 and 3, but are not
analyzed in the PER. The two military holding companies (Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited
and Myanmar Economic Corporation) have wide-ranging economic interests. UMEHL for example has 38
wholly owned businesses and shares in 9 joint ventures with foreign companies, and employs about
14,000 workers. The conglomerate has a monopoly on the country's gems sector and also has a significant
portfolio in various industries including banking, tourism, real estate, transportation, and metals. There is
little reporting or publicly available information on these companies, and therefore they are not covered
in this PER.

    D. Scope and Outline

1.13. The Myanmar PER 2015 is divided into five chapters: (i) sustainability of aggregate fiscal policy;
(ii) rebalancing the composition of the Union Budget; (iii) improving coverage, quality and equity of
education services; (iv) going from more to better government spending on health; and (v) a sound fiscal
framework for sub-national service delivery.

1.14. Chapter 2 on sustainability of aggregate fiscal policy aims to build on the government’s ongoing
efforts to strengthen macro-fiscal institutions for monitoring and responding to the challenge of ramping
up spending on the back of limited fiscal space. It starts by providing an overview of aggregate fiscal
developments in Myanmar and public debt issues, including debt levels and sustainability, and deficit
financing policies. It then looks at possible scenarios for Myanmar’s medium-term fiscal outlook, and the
implications these may have for fiscal aggregates in the Union Budget. It ends with a discussion on options
for managing fiscal risks that may arise from: the decentralized nature of debt management; the impact
of commodity price volatility on government revenue; and the capacity to ensure fiscal oversight of State
Economic Enterprises (SEEs).

1.15. Chapter 3 on rebalancing the composition of the Union Budget helps to take stock of major shifts
in the Union Budget since 2009/10 and highlights possible measures that can further enhance the
alignment of budget allocations with policy priorities. It reviews the current revenue effort and
composition in Myanmar, and recommends short to medium-term options for strengthening revenue
policies, institutions and administration so as to enhance collections in an efficient and equitable manner.
It analyzes spending shifts across the Union Budget, as government tries to temper expenditure growth
in line with financing and implementation capacity. The PER reviews the current functional and economic
composition Union Budget expenditures to explore ways to create fiscal space for development priorities.

1.16. Chapter 4 on improving coverage, quality and equity of education services aims to assist in
further prioritizing spending and policy reforms in the education sector. It focuses on basic education,
which accounts for around two thirds of government spending on education as a whole. It provides an
overview of how the sector is organized for the regulation and delivery of education services and
highlights some of the big gaps in education outcomes. It looks at the government’s recent strategy to fill
education gaps, and proposes measures that could further strengthen that strategy. It then analyzes how
government spending has responded to the new strategy and suggests options for further prioritization.
It ends by reviewing the current arrangements for budget preparation, implementation and reporting in
the sector, with recommendations to manage the rapidly growing inflows of resources in the sector.

1.17. Chapter 5 on going from more to better government spending on health aims to assist in
prioritizing spending and policy reforms to improve health outcomes, particularly through better targeted,
more efficient and more equitable government spending. It starts with an overview of the health sector,
which unlike education, has a strong private sector presence. It provides an overview of health challenges
in Myanmar, how these have informed government priorities in recent years, and the implications these
have had for health sector financing. It then looks more deeply at government spending on health and
recommends possible changes to allocations that could improve the efficiency and equity of that
spending.

1.18. Chapter 6 on a sound fiscal framework for sub-national service delivery looks at options for
prioritizing administrative and fiscal reforms to inform ongoing discussions on the overall framework of


                                                     5
intergovernmental relations. It reviews the current arrangements for sub-national administration in
Myanmar, including the structure of government and key features of public administration. It then
analyzes the main pillars of fiscal decentralization, namely: what government functions and expenditures
are assigned to whom; what local receipts help to fund those assignments; and on what basis are Union
transfers helping to close fiscal gaps. In each area, the PER proposes options to strengthen current policies
and institutions, and discusses their coordination and sequencing. It ends with a brief review of sub-
national budget preparation and implementation.

      E. Approach and Methodology

1.19. The Myanmar PER is based on data covering the years 2009/10 through 2013/14 made available
to the World Bank and its development partners in May and September 2013. Government expenditures
are reported in a system based on paper ledgers that is difficult to analyze in detail on a timely basis. For
purposes of this review, data in the ledgers was converted to an electronic database (BOOST).3 Aside from
this, the review uses a mix of data sources. Chapter 2 utilizes aggregated data in various IMF reports
published through 2014, complemented by World Bank staff estimates. The analysis in chapters 3-5
examines Union and SEE operations individually using the BOOST database. The BOOST database
produces results highly similar to, but not the same as, those provided by the IMF. Importantly, for the
years 2012/13 and 2013/14, the BOOST database numbers are revised estimates and budget estimates
while the IMF data are preliminary outcomes and revised estimates respectively. Chapter 6 relies on state
and region data provided by the Ministry of Finance. There is some uncertainty about the accuracy of
other data, such as GDP, population, and poverty rates. Specific issues are summarized in Box 1.1 as well
as Annex 1.

1.20. The PER was developed in very close collaboration and consultation with the Ministry of Finance,
the Ministry of Education (MoE), the Ministry of Health (MoH), the Ministry of Home Affairs (MoHA) and
other government agencies and departments. The findings and recommendations of the PER have been
part of ongoing policy dialogue and will be discussed in greater detail to help develop a concrete plan of
action. The PER is expected to be the start of future systematic analysis of Union Budget policies.

                                                   Box 1.1: Data Quality

Developing quality national data is one of the four priority areas of the government’s economic plan. Limited capacity and
funding over the years eroded the country’s statistical database, while the use of some data became highly politicized. These
constraints have caused many debates. Although an increasing amount of information is becoming available via government
websites, a large portion is not published in a timely manner. Some of the key issues are summarized below.

Poverty: Two Integrated Household Living Conditions Assessments (IHLCA) were conducted, one in 2005 and one in 2010.
There are two weaknesses inherent in these surveys. First, given that the last population census was conducted in 1983, the
sampling frame used for the survey may not be representative of the population. Second, due to conflict, the survey did not
cover some of the border areas. These weaknesses have called into question the extent to which the survey data was
representative of the country. Some of the results appear to be inconsistent with available data regarding public service
delivery and infrastructure. It is hoped that the results of the 2014 population census will provide a more up to date sampling
frame for the next full round of IHLCA, currently planned for 2015.

National accounts: Historical data show high real growth rates that are inconsistent with economic fundamentals and
available data from key sectors. Public sector activities were recorded at deeply over-valued exchange rates. Growth rates
from recent years appear to be more realistic and consistent with other indicators but there remains considerable uncertainty
about the actual level of GDP. In particular, if the historical growth rates were incorrect, then all subsequent estimates based
on those growth rates will also be incorrect. The IMF (2014) Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance observes several
additional short-comings but also notes good progress in improving the quality of new estimates.

Population: The last published census was conducted in 1983. Provisional results from the March 2014 census were made
available in August 2014. Final results had not been published at the time of this public expenditure review. Population
estimates range from 48 to 61 million, with an estimated 3 million people living abroad. Uncertainty about the true
population size creates doubts about estimates of GDP per capita.

Trade: There are substantial flows of illicit drugs, jade and timber from the border areas which is difficult to capture in
officially produced export statistics. Merchandise imports are under-estimated: known omissions include military imports,
imports linked to FDI under joint venture agreements, and some imports linked to exemptions from custom duties. Trade
data are recorded at the time of entries by customs, causing serious volatility in values and incorrect time records. As in
many countries, data recorded by the authorities and data recorded by trading partners are inconsistent. Recent data are,
however, fairly well correlated over time.

Balance of payments: According to the IMF Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance, detailed data on services
transactions and financial flows are generally not available and transactions that are not undertaken through the official
banking system are usually not estimated.

External debt: The evaluation of external obligations which are not nominated in U.S. dollars is conducted irregularly.
Historical data are distorted by applying the exchange rate at the evaluation point.

Consumer price statistics: Consumption basket weights represent urban households only. Some construction inputs are
included; rentals of owner occupied housing are excluded; missing prices are not imputed; and the classification of items is
outdated.

Fiscal data: There is no comprehensive monthly or quarterly compilation of fiscal data. Annual comprehensive data are
compiled with delays of up to 12 months after the end of the reference year. In addition, only consolidated data for state
economic enterprises are available, and some transactions are recorded partly on an accrual basis and partly on a cash basis.
It is difficult to know the true size of consolidated government because the full array of transactions between the Union
government and its state economic enterprises are not well identified. Fiscal and monetary data are not consistent. The
recording of government debt statistics is not comprehensive.

Monetary and financial statistics. The monetary survey compiled by the CBM covers the central bank and all commercial
banks (public and private). Reporting of monetary data in accord with IMF classification principles was established only by
January 2012. Prior data may have problems associated with the use of the previously overvalued official exchange rate for
valuing foreign currency-denominated balance sheet accounts.

    SUSTAINABILITY OF

2   AGGREGATE FISCAL POLICY
    Background: Myanmar has maintained a relatively prudent fiscal stance,
    albeit aided by one-off policies that generated revenue windfalls. As these
    begin to recede, there are renewed fiscal pressures on fiscal balances.

    Objectives: To identify short to medium-term options for strengthening
    macro-fiscal institutions to monitor and respond to the challenge of
    sustainably ramping up spending on the back of limited fiscal space.

    Key findings: The size of general government in Myanmar is small compared
    to other countries. This reflects its historically narrow revenue base (6.3
    percent of GDP in 2009) and limited role in public service delivery (general
    government spending 7.2 percent of GDP in 2009).

    Between 2009 and 2014, revenue went from 6 to 11 percent of GDP thanks to
    one-off measures (exchange rate devaluation, telecom license sales) and a
    widened tax base. Expenditure nearly doubled to 13 percent of GDP.

    The overall level of public debt in Myanmar has declined from 77 percent of
    GDP in 2007/08 to 47 percent in 2013/14 thanks to arrears clearance. Public
    sector debt is within sustainability thresholds, but is vulnerable to lower real
    GDP growth and fiscal slippages.

    Part of this vulnerability stems from the composition of Myanmar’s public debt
    portfolio: non-concessional external loans, and half of the portfolio in mostly
    domestic short-term financing instruments. This calls for greater attention to
    the composition of deficit financing.

    Myanmar’s medium-term fiscal outlook is subject to important risks, including
    falling gas prices. Spending growth in the baseline scenario remains relatively
    strong as falling gas receipts may be offset by other tax and non-tax receipts.
    But a bigger shock would require significant expenditure adjustments.

    The PER highlights three areas of fiscal risks that warrant closer attention and
    could be managed more actively: the decentralized nature of debt
    management, which leads to fragmented decisions on debt and increases the
    risk to the debt portfolio; the impact of commodity price volatility on
    government revenue; and the capacity to ensure fiscal oversight of State
    Economic Enterprises (SEEs).

    Recommended options: (i) adopt and publish a borrowing plan for the Union
    Budget, moving eventually to a Medium-Term Debt Strategy; (ii) centralize
    authority in MoF for negotiation and approval of new loans; (iii) channel all
    resource rents from Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise to the Union Budget,
    consider fiscal rules and benchmarks, and integrate gas revenue scenarios in
    the MTFF; and (v) establish a comprehensive framework for fiscal oversight of
    SEEs.

                                                      AGGREGATE FISCAL POLICY
    A. Background

2.1.     The Union government has maintained a moderately prudent fiscal stance between 2009/10
and 2013/14, with deficits below 5 percent of GDP, albeit aided by one-off policies on debt arrears
clearance, exchange rate devaluation, and telecom and banking licensing. As these windfalls begin to
recede, there are renewed pressures on fiscal balances. Greater access to external concessional finance
and policies to develop domestic debt markets are gradually helping to reduce monetization of the fiscal
deficit, which nonetheless remains high at 50 percent of net domestic financing. These forces will pose
important challenges for the government’s emerging Medium-Term Fiscal Framework.

2.2.      The PER aims to build on ongoing efforts to strengthen macro-fiscal institutions for monitoring
and responding to these challenges. It provides an overview of aggregate fiscal developments in
Myanmar and public debt issues, including debt levels and sustainability, and deficit financing policies. It
then looks at possible scenarios for Myanmar’s medium-term fiscal outlook, and the implications these
may have for fiscal aggregates in the Union Budget. It ends with a discussion on options for managing
fiscal risks that may arise from: the decentralized nature of debt management; the impact of commodity
price volatility on government revenue; and the capacity to ensure fiscal oversight of State Economic
Enterprises (SEEs).

      B. Aggregate Fiscal Developments

2.3.     The size of general government in Myanmar is relatively small compared to other countries
(Figure 2.1). This reflects the government’s historically narrow revenue base on the one hand and limited
role in public service delivery on the other. General government can play a pivotal role in Myanmar’s
growth prospects by improving public services, infrastructure and the enabling environment for a healthy
and productive population, and private investment. Significant spending needs have to be balanced with
fiscal constraints. Strong real GDP growth, averaging around 7 percent between 2010/11 and 2013/14,
was thanks to economic rebound and natural resource exports. This offers important scope to enhance
fiscal space, which in turn can be used to eliminate poverty and promote shared prosperity.

2.4.    The fiscal space needed for a near doubling in aggregate spending in Myanmar from 7.2 percent
of GDP in 2008/09 to 13.5 percent in 2012/13 (Table 2.1 and Figure 2.2) was in part afforded by a jump in
government revenue (Figure 2.3). While low relative to international standards, aggregate revenue went
from 6.3 percent of GDP to 9.6 percent. This was largely thanks to the devaluation of the exchange rate,
leading to a more accurate accounting of Kyat denominated receipts from gas exports. Receipts from the
sale of telecom and banking sector licenses in 2014/15 contributed to a further 2 percent of GDP in
receipts.

2.5.     The general government deficit over this period expanded rapidly from 0.8 percent of GDP in
2008/09 to 4.6 percent in 2010/11 (Figure 2.4). This was driven by capital spending, partly destined for
Nay Pyi Taw, but also due to rising interest payments, which went from 0.6 percent of GDP to 1.1 percent
between 2008/09 and 2011/12. This was followed by a period of consolidation, as reflected by the growing
gap between the overall and primary deficits (Figure 2.4). A notable achievement is that despite the rapid
increase in spending, the government has maintained a recurrent surplus (i.e. recurrent revenue covering
recurrent expenditure). Maintaining a positive current balance (i.e. no borrowing for recurrent spending)
will be an important benchmark for fiscal sustainability going forward.

2.6.    Under-estimation of revenues has affected aggregate fiscal discipline. The ministries used larger
than expected revenues to finance unplanned expenditures. Revenues were on average under-estimated
by 1.3 percent of GDP between 2009/10 and 2010/11 (Table 2.2). Over-realized revenues financed extra,
unbudgeted (mostly capital) spending. The data show, however, that the deviations in expenditures
exceeded the revenue deviations so that the Union typically saw net borrowing exceed budgetary targets
by no less than 0.9 percent of GDP in 2012/13 and as much as 2.2 percent of GDP in 2009/10.

2.7.     The government has instituted a process of supplementary budgets to address revenue and
policy uncertainty and is reviewing rules for changes to budget appropriations (i.e. allocations approved
by parliament). More work is needed. The supplementary budget for example simply formalizes changes
to budget appropriations that have already been made. The Union Budget Law has a clear appropriation
structure. Though this could be complemented by further guidance on authority for approving changes to
budget appropriations. Some countries allow reallocations from one category of spending to another up
to a certain ceiling without having to seek Ministry of Finance or Parliament approval. However, it is
advisable that any change to the overall level of government spending through for example over-realized
revenue, be reviewed and approved by the legislature as this has direct implications for financing
decisions.

                                                                                                         12
government was US$12.3 billion or approximately 61 percent of GDP (Figure 2.6). Two-thirds of that was
attributable to debt service payments in arrears, most of which were owed to bilateral creditors.

2.9.    External arrears were eliminated between 2012/13 and 2013/14 (Figure 2.6). In April 2012,
Myanmar agreed with Japan, its largest creditor, on a debt restructuring plan to resolve its arrears through
a bridge loan operation and cancelation of principal payments and overdue charges. Myanmar also
resolved its arrears held by the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank in January 2013, with the
help of a bridge financing operation by Japan. In late-January 2013, the Paris Club agreed to write off 50
percent of all arrears and reschedule the remaining arrears over 15 years with a seven-year grace period.
The result is a sharp reduction in Myanmar’s external obligations, from 50 percent of GDP in 2011/12 to
40 percent of GDP by 2013/14. (Figure 2.7).

2.10. Debt Sustainability Analysis by the IMF and the World Bank concludes that Myanmar is at low
risk of debt distress following the above arrears clearance operations.4 All indicators of external debt
solvency and liquidity remain below their indicative sustainability thresholds over the projection period,
both under the baseline scenario and alternative scenarios and stress tests.5 Total public sector debt (i.e.
external and domestic public debt) also remains within sustainability thresholds, but is vulnerable to lower
real GDP growth and fiscal slippages. Part of this vulnerability stems from the composition of Myanmar’s
public debt portfolio. Unlike other Low Income Countries, less than 20 percent of external debt is in the
form of concessional loans from multilateral organizations. Over half of public debt is in the form of
domestic, mostly short-term, financing instruments. With arrears clearance, Myanmar is regaining access
to concessional resources, and should reduce its reliance on non-concessional financing. This, however,
will require active debt management to ensure that short to medium-term deficit financing choices are
consistent with longer-term objectives of ensuring debt sustainability.

 Real GDP growth assumed at 8.1 percent over the medium-term and 6.6 percent over the long-term; overall fiscal
balance at -4.6 percent over the medium-term and -3.8 percent over the long-term; non-interest current account

2.11. Budget deficit financing has come from four main sources: (i) short-term Treasury Bill
subscriptions by the Central Bank (main source of monetization; 3-month maturity, 4 percent interest);
(ii) recently instituted Treasury Bill auctions (3-month maturity, market rate of 8 percent in recent
auctions); (iii) medium-term treasury bond subscriptions by local banks (2, 3 and 5-year maturity); and (iv)
foreign loans. The government has historically relied very heavily on monetization (Figure 2.8), due to lack
of domestic debt markets and limited access to external loans. This fuelled double digit inflation for most
years between 1988 and 2010 (peaking at 57 percent in 2002) and contributed to high debt servicing costs
discussed earlier. Reducing the monetization of the budget deficit has therefore been a major priority of
the government.

2.12. A number of measures are being taken to diversify financing sources. Firstly, the government
has tried to rebalance the financing mix away from short-term Treasury Bill subscriptions by the Central
Bank towards medium-term Treasury Bond sales to institutional investors. Secondly, starting January this
year, the government conducted its first Treasury Bill auction, and is expected to conduct Treasury Bond
auctions in January 2016. Although uptake of Treasury Bills has been lower than expected, this is a very
important step in the long road ahead for developing domestic debt markets. Thirdly, the government is
gradually accessing more external debt on concessional terms. This should help to rebalance the financing
mix closer to the norm for Low-Income and Lower Middle-Income Countries (Figure 2.9). Financing from
the Central Bank of Myanmar (CBM) is estimated to have declined from 3.5 percent of GDP in 2010/11 to
1.8 percent of GDP in 2011/12 because of some of these measures. Although this is expected to gradually
reduce monetization, eliminating it completely is likely to take some time.

2.13. Ensuring a sound financing mix for a balanced debt portfolio can be informed by an annual
borrowing plan, first, and then gradually moving to a Medium-Term Debt Strategy. Myanmar currently
has annual borrowing limits set out in the Union Budget Law. These limits, however, are set in absolute
terms with no breakdown of the actual mix of debt instruments. For example the 2014/15 Budget Law set
the gross borrowing limit at Kyat 3.6 trillion, going to Kyat 3.9 trillion in the 2015/16 Budget Law. There is
currently no analysis of how the costs and risks of the government’s debt portfolio is affected by the
proposed new borrowing. The Parliament approves external loans (usually associated with specific
projects), which form part of this limit; domestic borrowing is the residual. Although there is a Treasury
Bill auction calendar, given the limited scope of these auctions and uncertainty over uptake (including for

Treasury Bond subscriptions), Central Bank purchase of Treasury Bills make up for outstanding financing
needs.

2.14. A borrowing plan or Debt Management Strategy would help implement the government’s
objective of diversifying financing sources. The plan would help assess the overall cost of the debt
portfolio, and potential risks (i.e. changes to costs) arising out of different factors including interest rate
changes, exchange rate movements, refinancing needs, or other. In doing so, it can inform the
government’s decisions on the most appropriate financing strategy given its borrowing constraints.
Without systematically going through such an assessment and analysis, the government may end up with
a costly debt portfolio that is highly vulnerable to economic shocks, as noted in the discussion on debt
sustainability. During the period under review, for example, nearly half of the government’s debt portfolio
is in short-term debt, which is subject to constant rollover and is not matched to gestation periods of
public investments.

2.15. The government can prepare a borrowing plan and MTDS with joint Bank-Fund technical
assistance. This assistance would look at: setting debt management objectives; analyzing the cost and
risk of existing debt; identifying and analyzing potential funding sources; baseline projections including
policy risks; reviewing long-term structural factors; assessing and ranking alternative borrowing strategies
base on the basis of cost-risk trade-off; reviewing proposed strategies with fiscal and monetary policy
authorities; and finally agreeing the borrowing plan.6 The Debt Management Office in the Ministry of
Finance would lead this exercise, coordinating closely with the Central Bank and the Ministry of Planning
in particular.

    D. Medium-Term Fiscal Framework

2.16. Myanmar’s medium term economic outlook through 2020/21 is strong, though with important
downside risks. Growth is driven by investment and commodity exports, encouraged by trade
liberalization, the suspension of sanctions and gas production. Expansion in the tourism and
telecommunication services also holds up the outlook. Inflation is expected to trend down with the
discontinuation of fiscal deficit monetization and a strengthened monetary policy framework.

2.17. The baseline medium term fiscal forecast is for real GDP growth to peak at 8.5 percent in 2015/16
following several years of accelerating growth (Table 2.3). The real growth rate is forecast to gradually
taper down to a steady-state rate of 7.5 percent per annum by 2020/21.7 This is expected in part because
of slower than expected progress in the large gas export projects with almost no volume growth after
2015/16. Growth is also expected to slow as initial productivity gains from the burst of reforms in 2012
through 2014 are gradually exhausted. Consumer price inflation is expected to accelerate to 8 percent in
2015/16, driven by supply side constraints, from 6.6 percent expected in 2014/15. Phased elimination of
central bank financing should allow inflation to fall gradually to 5.6 percent by 2020/21. The exchange
rate is assumed to move in accord with the differential between domestic and international inflation.8

2.18. Gas prices are expected to fall by 16 percent in 2015/16 and then slowly grow by 1-2 percent per
year through 2020/219 (Figure 2.10). Historically, however, gas prices have been quite volatile. The long-
run standard deviation in price growth rates between 1978 and 2014 is 18 percent. This creates upper
and lower boundaries on the projected price (Figure 2.10).

2.19. The baseline scenario assumes that fiscal and monetary policies of 2015/16 are continued
through 2020/21. Tax rates and SEE obligations remain unchanged. Union revenues as a share of GDP
gradually fall, partly because gas export volumes do not grow as quickly as GDP and partly because gas
prices are not expected to fully recover from the drop in 2015. It is also assumed that the government
will maintain a consolidated public sector deficit target close to 4.5 percent of GDP with a Union deficit of
close to 5.5 percent of GDP being offset by a net SEE surplus near 1 percent of GDP. The net external
financing in the baseline scenario is conservative: could be as high as 2 percent of GDP in 2016/17 and
2017/18.

2.20. The baseline scenario allows for healthy expenditure growth. Union revenues are expected to
remain close to 11 percent of GDP. This implies that Union government expenditures will be kept at levels
close to 16 percent of GDP, yielding an average 8 percent real increase in current spending per year.

2.21. Three alternative scenarios presented below include slower real growth, a less effective tax
effort, and lower gas prices. Each alternative projection scenario includes the assumption that the
government will maintain a consolidated public sector deficit target close to 5 percent of GDP. This implies
that revenue reductions will need to be compensated by reducing expenditures below the baseline values.

      A prolonged down-turn in gas prices is a risk to Myanmar’s growth prospects. If gas prices were to
       decrease in line with the low case depicted in Figure 2.10 above, then the real value of total Union
       expenditures in 2020/21 would need to be 7 percent lower than the baseline value for that year.10

    This forecast is for European gas, mainly supplied by pipelines, from the April 2015 Commodity Markets Outlook.
10
     This calculation assumes the gas share of GDP averages about 8 percent of GDP.

                                                                17
       This would be equivalent to 20 percent of the baseline capital budget projected for 2020/21. The
       down-turn in 2015 may be offset to some extent by planned investments and increased production,
       but the government will need to monitor closely to ensure external and fiscal buffers for exchange
       rate stability and fiscal sustainability.
      Another serious risk to the budget is low non-gas tax revenues. If the projected increase in the tax
       to GDP ratio to 8.1 percent of GDP by 2020/21 is not maintained and instead gradually falls back to 6
       percent of GDP by 2020/21 (e.g. if more tax exemptions are granted), then the real value of total
       Union expenditures in 2020/21 would need to be 13 percent lower than the baseline value for that
       year. This would be equivalent to 40 percent of the baseline capital budget projected for 2020/21.
      There are other fiscal risks as well. Real GDP growth could be slower than expected. If actual growth
       is two percentage points lower than forecast, then the real value of total Union expenditures in
       2020/21 would need to be 7 percent lower than the baseline value. Intergovernmental transfers
       could continue to add to net spending if not off-set by slower growth in other expenditures. Off-
       budget external financing can complicate fiscal management and pose risks to debt control. Lastly,
       various SEE operations could generate large contingent liabilities for the government: this risk can be
       managed if their situation can be carefully monitored and ongoing reforms managed carefully.

       E. Treatment of Upstream Hydrocarbon Revenues

2.22. This public expenditure review proposes that all resource rents (royalties, corporate income
taxes, profits) from the Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE) be channeled directly and in their
entirety to the Union Budget. Upstream hydrocarbon enterprises such as MOGE extract non-renewable
natural resources that are also national assets. Therefore a proportionately larger share of their profits
should accrue to the government for the broader benefit of the national population.

2.23. Different countries have adopted different models for managing rents from their state
enterprises operating in the hydrocarbon sector.11 At one extreme (e.g. Timor-Leste, Ghana), all receipts
are channeled to and spending is appropriated through the national budget. At the other extreme (e.g.
Myanmar), all receipts are channeled through the enterprise, which then pays royalties and share of
profits (tax and contributions) to the Union Budget. Even in more advanced cases (e.g. Norway), however,
all resource rents are paid directly to the national budget. The difference for these more advanced cases
is that the National Oil Company (e.g. Statoil in Norway) operates like any other commercial operator.
The government allows the National Oil Company to do so because it is subject to corporate governance
standards under a Companies Act consistent with international standards. This is not the case for SEEs in
Myanmar.

2.24. There are several additional reasons for proposing that all resource rents from MOGE be
directed to the Union Budget. First, they are macro-critical because of their size. Second, it enables the
government to maintain oversight of major investment decisions by appropriating for these through the
budget. Third, until MOGE and other upstream hydrocarbon SEEs are corporatized and are subject to
standard international norms of corporate governance, their rents should be subject to budgetary
discipline and oversight. A fourth critical benefit is increased transparency over natural resource rents.
At the moment it is not possible to say from published documents how much MOGE and other
hydrocarbon SEEs are retaining in their own accounts.

    F. Fiscal Risk Management

2.25. The PER highlights below some areas of fiscal risk that may warrant closer attention going
forward. Fiscal risks are factors (e.g. macroeconomic shocks, commodity price developments, extra-
budgetary activities) that can cause major deviations to fiscal outcomes (e.g. government revenue,
deficits, public debt) from what was planned in the budget, and therefore prevent achievement of service
delivery objectives. The PER proposes possible institutional reforms to better manage fiscal risks in a few
areas, namely: the decentralized nature of debt management; commodity price volatility; and the capacity
for fiscal oversight of SEEs.

2.26. The decentralized nature of debt management refers to the lack of clarity in Myanmar’s legal
framework on authority to approve borrowings and loan guarantees. According to the country’s 2008
Constitution, the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (parliament) is empowered to make decisions on state borrowing
of international, regional or bilateral agreements submitted by the President. However, the role of the
Ministry of Finance is not specified and it is not clear if line ministries and SEEs have the right to undertake
borrowing transactions directly and if so under what conditions and procedures. Lack of oversight and
coordination in this area can lead to unsustainable levels of borrowing and derailment of fiscal objectives.

2.27. Line ministries are currently able to contract loans directly, with some Ministry of Finance
oversight, which was instituted only recently. For example, in the 2014/15 Union Budget Law, the Ministry
of Construction accounted for nearly three quarters of Kyat 697 billion in planned borrowing by Ministries
and Departments, and nearly a third of Kyat 970 billion in the 2015/16 Union Budget Law (Figure 2.11).
The Ministry of Finance accounted for less than 1 percent, as these are external, project-linked loans
(though there is no detail in the Union Budget Laws on the source or terms and conditions of these loans).
SEEs, which are part of line ministries, planned to borrow an additional Kyat 542 billion and Kyat 293
billion in 2014/15 and 2015/16 respectively (Figure 2.12). Half of this on average was borrowing by SEEs
under the Ministry of Electric Power.

2.28. Government policies also allowed line ministries to directly service loan obligations. Since many
line ministries do not have their own-source of revenue (and even if they do, good practice requires these
funds to be consolidated in the Treasury), the Union Budget Law appropriates funds to those ministries

                                                              19
for debt service payments. Based on data from the 2014/15 and 2015/16 Union Budget Laws, the Ministry
of Finance was responsible for over 90 percent of debt service obligations. This is likely because: (i) these
planned amounts include obligations on domestic debt, which the Ministry of Finance is responsible for;
and (ii) external debt servicing obligations on line ministries’ project related loans may have grace periods
or extended maturities and loan repayment schedules. Therefore debt service obligations of ministries
and departments may grow over time. Between 2014/15 and 2015/16, debt service obligations of
Ministries other than Finance went from Kyat 37 billion to Kyat 82 billion due to a jump in debt service
obligations of the Ministry of Construction.

2.29. Efforts have been made since 2011 to ensure that borrowing by line ministries is adequately
coordinated with the government’s overall objectives for debt management. There is for example the
overall borrowing limit in the Union Budget Law – though as noted above, this measure is not very
effective in the absence of any detail on the planned financing mix. The more important measure is the
delegation of greater responsibility to the Ministry of Finance to oversee any new borrowing by line
ministries and SEEs, even though the loan can actually still be signed by the line ministry.

2.30. The PER proposes to take this further by explicitly assigning the authority to approve
borrowings and loan guarantees to the Ministry of Finance through a Public Debt Law, which was under
consideration as this report was being written. It is critical to concentrate these functions in a single debt
management entity that has the capacity and mandate to review borrowing plans and ensure that these
are consistent with the government’s debt management objectives. The alternative of having fragmented
decision-making over financing of the Union Budget deficit can impact severely on fiscal risks through lack
of comprehensive information on borrowing across government, over-borrowing, heightened portfolio
risks or other. The PER recommends that the Debt Management Office in the Ministry of Finance should
assess and negotiate all loans on behalf of the government. In addition, to establish greater transparency
over these borrowing decisions, particularly important now given concerns over rising debt levels, the
Ministry of Finance should publish the key elements of its annual or medium-term borrowing plan.

2.31. Commodity price volatility is another source of fiscal risks. The price of Myanmar’s gas exports
is indexed to the heavy fuel and a variety of production cost indicators. The price is adjusted every quarter
by taking the last 12 months’ average of these variables. Available data shows that large price shocks in

                                                          20
2008 and 2009 (Figure 2.15) did impact negatively on gas revenues (Figure 2.16). For the period 2000/01
through 2012/13, the average elasticity of gas revenues measured in US dollars per million British thermal
units (MMBTU) to gas prices in US dollars per MMBTU was 0.6. Thus, if world oil prices fluctuate by a
maximum of 40 percent, up or down, net gas revenues per billion cubic feet could swing up or down by a
maximum of 24 percent. This can significantly derail budget policy objectives, particularly given that over
18 percent of government revenue in Myanmar comes from gas.

2.32. One way to deal with the commodity price risk is to diversify further the tax base away from
volatile oil and gas receipts (Chapter 3). Options under consideration by the government include excise
tax reform, broadening the income tax base, a new value-added tax and a new property tax. Each of these
should be less correlated with oil and gas receipts. In addition, the property tax, if enacted, would be
uncorrelated with the income and value-added taxes, to the benefit of fiscal stability.

2.33. Establishing a sovereign wealth fund is another option for managing oil and gas revenue
volatility. These funds can play several roles. They can accumulate savings for intergenerational equity,
which may require rules for example on withdrawing only interest earnings so that the capital can grow
(or be maintained) in real terms over the long-term. These funds could also help to smooth revenue flows
into the budget, saving when revenues are high and allowing draw-downs during commodity price
downturns.

2.34. The government, through the Ministry of Finance Fiscal Policy Department, could also consider
fiscal rules or benchmarks to avoid pro-cyclical spending. These could be in the form of targets that aim
to maintain fiscal discipline during commodity price booms and avert real exchange rate appreciation. For
example, targeting: (i) the non-oil and gas fiscal balance (i.e. fiscal balance excluding revenue from gas) as
a share of non-oil and gas GDP can help to ensure that the fiscal deficit excluding gas revenue does not
become unsustainable as a result of spending during commodity price booms; (ii) growth in primary
expenditure (i.e. recurrent expenditure excluding interest payments) can help to contain growth in
government consumption and non-essential spending; or (iii) a positive recurrent balance (i.e. recurrent
expenditure as a ratio of non-gas revenues) can help ensure that government consumption is funded
entirely out of stable, non-gas revenues.


                                                                                               21
2.35. Finally, it is important to integrate gas revenue issues explicitly in the government’s emerging
Medium-Term Fiscal Framework. The PER proposes that the Ministry of Finance Budget Department and
Internal Revenue Department work with the Ministry of Energy to establish a protocol for data exchange
on oil and gas production and price projections. The MTFF should look at various scenarios for medium-
term gas revenues. These should be presented and discussed across relevant government departments
during budget preparation to have an agreed forecast. It is generally recommended to base planned
revenue in the budget on conservative price assumptions to avoid over-budgeted spending in case of a
downturn. Throughout the fiscal year, it will be important to closely monitor developments on gas
revenues, to ensure that timely adjustments can be made to government spending if and when needed.

2.36. It would be prudent to make SEEs subject to strong fiscal oversight as their operations make up
over half of all public sector operations, and therefore constitute a potential source of fiscal risks. In
Myanmar these risks are heightened by the fact that SEEs are controlled by the line ministries and their
deficits are automatically financed directly from the Union Fund Account. This makes the general
government explicitly liable for SEEs, unlike some other countries where state enterprises are semi-
autonomous. In Myanmar, however, beginning in 1990/91, a Union Fund Account system was established
in which the receipts from SEEs were integrated with line ministry receipts. All SEE operations were to be
funded from the Union Fund Account, through the Union budget.12

2.37. The lack of autonomy -- combined with numerous implicit subsidies, a direct financial subsidy
for SEE deficits, and an over-valued official exchange rate -- reduced the incentive for SEEs to adapt and
grow under changing conditions. The over-valued exchange rate also distorted the valuation of SEE
operations by reducing the Kyat value of their net foreign exchange positions relative to their net local
currency positions. This meant, for example, that an exporting SEE might register a net loss because its
domestic costs outweighed the value of its exports. In 2009/10, 31 out of 50 enterprises were found to
be loss-making.

2.38. The exchange rate reforms in 2012/13 as a result had an overall positive impact on SEE finances.
The number of enterprises that recorded negative overall balances fell from 23 out of 46 in 2011/12 to
only 8 out of 44 in 2012/13.13 In 2013/14, the expected outcome was 14 out of 42 enterprises. Most of
the gains were earned by MOGE, Myanma Petroleum Products Enterprise, and Myanma Petrochemical
Enterprise.14 The overall balance of the SEE sector becomes negative when these enterprises are omitted
(Table 2.4). This is largely due to a few large loss makers including Myanma Railways and Myanma Electric
Power Enterprise. Myanma Railways was a loss-maker in all years under review.15 Myanma Electric Power
suffered from exchange rate reform, having to purchase gas at a higher local currency price from MOGE.
The authorities revised electricity tariffs upward in response, but not enough to cover the full costs of
production.

2.39. Further reforms helped set a firmer budget constraint for SEEs. At the start of 2012/13, the Union
government introduced a limit on the level of implicit subsidies by requiring SEEs to finance 78 percent of
working capital requirements from their operating revenues. At the same time, SEEs were allowed to
keep a larger share of their profits: 25 percent of net profits were to be paid as income tax and 20 percent

of net profits were to be put into the State Fund as a contribution to general government. The remainder
could be carried over in their “Own Fund Account” for their own use in the next fiscal year. In 2013/14,
profitable SEEs were expected to self-finance 100 percent of their working capital from their “Own Fund
Account” or borrow from state owned banks at 4 percent interest. The government will cover 20 percent
of working capital expenses of loss-making SEEs. In 2014/15, four SEEs were moved off-budget.16

2.40. To complement these efforts, the PER recommends that the SEE Department in the Ministry of
Finance establish a comprehensive framework for fiscal transparency and oversight of SEEs. The
objective would be to ensure that the government is exercising fiscal discipline in relation to SEEs, averting
undue burden and risks. This could be done through an analysis of the financial status of SEEs and advice
on the legal and regulatory framework for fiscal oversight of SEEs, taxation and dividend policies, and
fiscal reporting. These should in turn help to better monitor fiscal risks from SEEs.

2.41. The analysis of the financial status of SEEs should help to develop a typology of SEEs for risk-
based monitoring. This would look at characteristics of SEEs (in terms of sectors, size, line of business
(commercial/non-commercial), turnover, employment, and ownership structure), and their financial links
to government (preferential access to credit, government guarantees of SEE debt, preferential tax
treatment, any SEE bond issuances, recapitalization of SEEs, post-privatization (or joint venture)
obligations). The legal and regulatory review should aim to take stock of all SEE-related provisions in laws
outside of the SEE Law (1989) (e.g. procurement, public debt, employment, public financial management,
audit, competition, banking, bankruptcy). This can help establish existing arrangements for oversight and
potential for reform including if necessary greater control over any new obligations that SEEs can enter
into. This would also cover the existing framework for financial controls, and treatment of SEE profits
including in the natural resources sector as discussed above. All these elements should be brought
together with a review on further strengthening fiscal reporting standards on SEEs, and using this to
manage fiscal risks.

    G. Conclusions and Recommendations

2.42. Myanmar faces the challenge of meeting large service delivery needs on the back of relatively
limited fiscal space, as characterized by an already small general government, narrow revenue base and
limited financing options. Revenue windfalls from one-off measures have enabled the government to
rapidly increase spending, while maintaining fiscal deficits within 5 percent of GDP. Overall public debt
levels are still within sustainability thresholds, though there is a need to focus greater attention on
ensuring a sound financing mix for a balanced debt portfolio. Over the medium-term, fiscal balances are
vulnerable to lower gas revenue (around 18 percent of total revenue) due to international commodity
price developments. This may be offset by other tax and non-tax receipts thanks to strong projected
growth, failing which there may be a need for significant expenditure adjustments.

2.43. The above points to the need for greater attention to monitoring and managing fiscal risks. The
PER highlights three areas in this regard. The first is on consolidating debt management functions, in
particular the authority to negotiate and approve new loans and guarantees, within the Ministry of
Finance. This should help to avoid fragmented financing decisions and build-up of unsustainable debt. The
second is on managing risks from commodity price volatility. This may require a review of how
hydrocarbon SEE profits are managed and adoption of fiscal rules. The third is on strengthening the fiscal
oversight of SEEs given their impact on general government operations and finances. Managing these risks
should help ensure that budget policies are not derailed by unexpected shocks to fiscal aggregates.

    REBALANCING

3   THE COMPOSITION OF
    THE UNION BUDGET
    Background: The government’s transition to a service oriented approach
    has come with major rebalancing along and across the Union Budget since
    2010/11. Further spending growth however needs to be balanced against
    financing and implementation capacity constraints.
    Objectives: To identify short to medium-term options for strengthening
    revenue policies, institutions and administration; and to explore the scope
    for further rebalancing expenditure across the budget to create fiscal space
    for Myanmar’s development priorities.
    Key findings: Overall revenue effort has historically been low. Economic
    recovery, one-off measures, and reforms to expand the revenue base have
    improved revenue from 6 to 11 percent of GDP between 2009 and 2014.
    Income tax, tax on goods and services and non-tax revenue each make up
    roughly just under a third each of total revenue. Performance across all
    types of revenue remains below international comparators, including for
    customs duties (0.3 percent of GDP).
    Tax exemptions for investment promotion are widely applied through a
    range of different legal instruments. There is however no assessment of tax
    expenditures or impact on incremental investment. Two areas to focus on
    in tax administration are arrears management, and transparency and
    consolidation of receipts in extra-budgetary “other accounts.”
    On Union Budget spending, big changes between 2009 and the 2015
    Budget include the share of: general public services, falling from 45 percent
    to 11 percent; social services, increasing from 10 to 33 percent; defense
    increasing from 21 to 32 percent; and capital investment falling from 63 to
    38 percent.
    The wage bill in Myanmar has historically been suppressed by limits on both
    the size of and pay in the public service. Recent increases in the wage bill,
    including near doubling in the 2015/16 Budget, should not pose major
    concern in the medium-term. Any further increase should be linked to
    broader public administration reform.
    Recommended options: (i) review and rationalize tax exemptions through
    a tax expenditure analysis, and consolidate the granting of any new
    exemptions; (ii) prioritize management of revenue arrears and consider
    gradual elimination of extra-budgetary ‘other accounts’; (iii) initiate an
    expenditure review of military spending to identify potential efficiency
    gains; (iv) conduct a review of public investment management and
    efficiency, including scope for savings through reduced spending on
    commercial activities in economic services; (v) conduct a pay and grading
    exercise to help inform any future changes to the wage bill.

                   COMPOSITION OF THE UNION BUDGET
                  A. Background17

3.1.     The government’s transition to a service oriented approach has come with major rebalancing
along and across the Union Budget since 2010/11. Along the budget, efforts are under way to improve
revenue mobilization, which increased from 6 to 11 percent of GDP between 2011 and 2014. Across the
budget, spending has shifted from general public services towards social sectors. A gradual decline in
capital investments has provided fiscal space for salaries and wages of public servants, essential goods
and services in the social sectors, and other public investments.

3.2. The PER takes stock of these shifts and highlights possible measures that can further enhance
the alignment of the budget with policy priorities. After reviewing the current revenue effort and
composition in Myanmar, the PER touches on options to strengthen revenue policies, institutions and
administration. It then reviews the current functional and economic composition Union Budget
expenditures to explore scope to further rebalance allocations and create fiscal space for Myanmar’s
development priorities.

                  B. Revenue Effort and Composition

3.3.   The overall revenue effort of the Union government has historically been below potential.
General government receipts in 2010/11 were at 6.3 percent of GDP, compared to a regional average of
around 21 percent (Figure 3.1). Even when controlling for per-capita GDP, Myanmar’s tax revenue remains

  Much of the data in this chapter, especially for expenditures, come from the MoF BOOST database. They are
similar to but not the same as the IMF estimates reported in Chapter 2 for all years except 2012/13 and 2013/14.
The IMF data for 2012/13 and 2013/14 are staff estimates while the BOOST data portray the revised budget
estimates for 2012/13 and the budget estimates for 2013/14. The BOOST data provide more detail on composition.

                                                                                                                                26
low compared to other countries at similar income levels (Figure 3.2). This was due to a combination of
factors: a narrow tax base dominated by SEEs and the public sector; a closed economy meant little by way
of trade taxes; and an overvalued exchange rate that suppressed government receipts from export
earnings.

3.4.     Economic recovery coupled with recent reforms have helped to improve revenue mobilization
(Figure 3.3). The average ratio of the percentage change in general government revenue to the percentage
change in GDP (buoyancy) for the years 2006/07 to 2011/12 was 1.0, indicating that, on average, revenues
grew at the same pace as GDP.18 The average ratio for a sample of eight East Asian countries was 1.1 with
a low of 1.0 and a high of 1.4.19 This is in part because most other countries in the region have a higher
share of income taxation in their total revenues, which are typically more buoyant.

3.5.     Income tax receipts in Myanmar in 2013/14 were close to 2.4 percent of GDP compared to 5.7
percent in a sample of nine low and middle-income East Asian countries (Figure 3.4). The income tax
effort is of special concern not only for revenue generation but also for macroeconomic management.
Progressive income taxes can act as stabilizers, automatically reducing burdens on business and families
during recessions. Administrative and policy reforms are under way to enhance income tax collections.

3.6.    Taxes on goods and services and non-tax revenue each accounted for around a third of general
government revenue. Taxes on goods and services, also referred to a commercial taxes, are indirect taxes.
In 2013/14, they accounted for around 2.1 percent of GDP compared to 6.4 percent in a sample of nine
East Asian countries mentioned above (Figure 3.4). Non-tax revenue, which includes SEE contributions
and capital receipts such as sale of licenses to the banking and telecommunications sector accounted or
2.2 percent of GDP compared to an average of 3.4 percent of GDP in selected Asian countries.

3.7.     Customs duties collected in Myanmar were around 0.3 percent of GDP in 2013/14 compared to
1.3 percent in the same sample of East Asian countries mentioned above (Figure 3.5). Customs duties
often constitute a large share of government revenue at Myanmar’s stage of development. However,
imports as a share of GDP in Myanmar (20.7 percent) is considerably lower than the regional average (50.4
percent of GDP). This will likely change with further integration. In the short run, however, there may be
gains from customs administration reform. Myanmar scores poorly when it comes to the speed, simplicity
and predictability of customs clearance in the World Bank Logistics Performance Index (Figure 3.6).

3.8.     Social contributions do not make up a large share of revenues. These are revenues that finance
social insurance schemes including retirement benefits. The amounts involved can be large, ranging from
1 percent of GDP for Thailand to 5 percent for mineral rich Mongolia. Although the amounts recorded by
the authorities for this purpose are extremely small, with a GDP share close to zero, there are several
social insurance schemes in operation. The Ministry of Labor operates a social insurance system through
its Social Security Board established in 1954. A review of accounting practices (e.g. imputation from wages
and salaries) could reveal the actual magnitude of resources collected for social insurance schemes.

3.9.    SEEs have contributed importantly to Union revenues. Their combined payments to the Union
increased from 3.7 percent of GDP in 2009/10 to 4.1 percent of GDP in 2013/14 (Table 3.1). Of this,
payments by MOGE jumped sharply from an average of 0.1 percent of GDP through 2011/12 to 2.2
percent of GDP by 2013/14. MOGE payments thus accounted for 19 percent of total Union revenues in
2013/14. Payments by other SEEs fell from 3.7 percent of GDP in 2009/10 to 1.9 percent in 2013/14. The
public sector had a net gain of 0.6 percentage point of GDP.

3.10. The cumulative change from all other taxpayers was impressive, suggesting that the tax base
has begun to diversify away from dependence on the SEEs. Non-SEE revenue increased from 2.1 percent
of GDP in 2009/10 to 3.0 percent in 2011/12 and 7.4 percent of GDP in 2013/14. The cumulative change
between 2011/12 and 2013/14 was 4.5 percentage points of GDP. Thus, the SEE share of total Union
revenues and grants has fallen from 63.9 percent in 2009/10 to 35.8 percent in 2013/14.

3.11. Further diversification of the tax base would help the Union in two ways: (i) increase fiscal space;
and (ii) help manage the risk created by the volatility in gas export receipts, as discussed in Chapter 2.
Options under consideration by the government include excise tax reform, broadening the income tax
base, a new value-added tax and a new property tax.

     C. Revenue Policies and Institutions

3.12. Two overarching and potentially competing objectives on revenue collections have guided
Union Government efforts: first to increase the tax-to-GDP ratio while making tax administration more
efficient and reducing the cost of tax payer compliance;20 and second to promote investment and create
job opportunities by using tax incentives. The first objective targets an important cost of doing business
in Myanmar, namely the burden of paying tax. There is however no clear evidence from other countries
that tax incentives generate incremental investment that would eventually offset the short-term costs of
incentives, particularly in countries like Myanmar that have more binding constraints to investment.

3.13. The PER therefore proposes to comprehensively review existing exemptions. In Cambodia, for
example, such an analysis showed that the combined cost of exemptions in 2010 exceeded the value of
FDI and was the equivalent to half of total investment. The first step in Myanmar should be to take stock
of all exemptions, which are covered in various legislation: the Foreign Investment Law (2013), Myanmar
Citizens Investment Laws (1994), Special Economic Zone Law (2011), the Dawei Special Economic Zone
Law (2011), and sector laws such as the Myanmar Mines Law (1994). There may be discretionary channels
to grant exemptions, such as for customs.21 The system for granting exemptions should be consolidated.

                                                              29
It can otherwise add significant burden on tax administration. The next step would to estimate the level
of tax expenditures from current exemptions and recommend ways to rationalize these.

3.14. The legal framework for Myanmar’s tax system has been fundamentally revised and continues
to evolve. The country’s Socialist period saw the promulgation of the Income Tax Law (1974), the Profit
Tax Law (1976), and the Goods and Services Tax (1976).22 The Commercial Tax Law, enacted in 1990,
replaced the goods and services tax and applied to all sectors in the economy. In April 2012, the
Commercial Tax rate was harmonized at 5 percent for most goods and selected services. There are now
plans to phase out the Commercial Tax and introduce a value added tax (VAT). Going forward, the
government could consider adopting a unified tax code to ensure consistency in overall tax policy and
avoid the problem of tax cascading.

3.15. Income tax legislation has also been reformed. Income tax includes corporate income tax,
individual income tax, capital gains tax, and withholding tax. It applies to all types of taxpayers. In April,
2012, income tax bands were adjusted and extended to public officials. The latter were previously exempt,
though the tax free income threshold has also increased from MMK 500,000 to MMK 2,000,000. In April,
2012, the corporate income tax rate was reduced from 30 percent to 25 percent for resident companies
(one rate) while the corporate rate for non-resident companies remains at 35 percent. Before 2011, a
separate profits tax, adopted since 1976, was imposed on certain types of income not covered under the
income tax law. The profit tax was repealed in April 2012 as it was causing tax cascading. The current
system is simpler, less distortionary and more progressive.

       D. Revenue Administration

3.16. The Internal Revenue Department (IRD) of the Ministry of Finance administers the largest share
of domestic revenues. There are currently fifteen types of taxes and duties levied in Myanmar. The IRD
collects personal and corporate income tax, commercial tax, state lottery tax, and stamp tax. The Customs
Department handles customs duties while the Trade Directorate of the Ministry of Commerce takes care
of fees for import licenses. The General Administration Department of the Ministry of Home Affairs is
responsible for excise duty, land tax, water and embankment tax and minerals tax. The Road Transport
Administration Department administers transportation taxes. The Forestry Department looks after a tax
on rubber and on general forestry extraction. The Fisheries Department administers a tax on fisheries.

3.17. Several reforms are underway in tax administration within the Internal Revenue Department.
These include the establishment of a large taxpayer office, the assignment of tax identification numbers,
the introduction of tax-payer self-assessment, the forthcoming establishment of medium and small
taxpayer offices, modernization of information and communications technology, organizational
restructuring and a recruitment effort intended to increase staff size by 35 percent.

3.18. Management of arrears is one area that warrants closer attention. According to the Public
Expenditure and Financial Accountability report of 2013, both the IRD and Customs Department have not
to date introduced systematic arrears management systems. There is no analysis of tax arrears or arrears
management plans based on systemic, well-defined classification of arrears by tax type, age, and subject
taxpayers. The aggregate level of tax arrears have not been reduced over the past three years and remain
stably high at about MMK100 billion (8 percent of total tax collections in 2010). The arrears collection of
the two main taxes, income and commercial, shows the persistent low performance. The collection during

                                                     30
the year over the total tax arrears at the beginning of the year for income tax stands at just 62 in 2009/10
and 2010/11 and 52 percent. The collection of commercial tax arrears during the same two years is even
lower: 24 and 26 percent.

3.19. Transparency of tax policy is gradually improving. In April 2012 the government published the
revised personal income tax code and corporate tax code in both Myanmar and English on the IRD’s
website. The IRD also published and distributed a simplified guide to taxpayers for calculating taxable
income based on the revised tax code for all major tax instruments. This was followed by a countrywide
taxpayer outreach program, including training to tax officials on application of the revised tax laws.

3.20. Transparency of revenue management could be enhanced through greater control over the use
of off-budget “other accounts” held in the Myanmar Economic Bank (MEB) for ministry and SEE
transactions. Other account receipts in 2011/12 were estimated at MMK 2.54 trillion (44 percent of total
Union revenue), and expenditures at MMK 2.26 trillion (28 percent of Union expenditure). Although
financial regulations only allowed the Ministries of Defense and Home Affairs to open such accounts,
others have been allowed to do the same upon request. The Ministry of Defense held the largest number
of other accounts, followed by the Ministry of Health. The Ministry of Health, for example, had 427 other
accounts, which were used for receipts from community cost sharing, hospital equity funds, and interest
on trust funds (each of the 330 townships has an other account).

3.21. It would be useful to MoF if these “other account” receipts could be accounted for in gross
terms in the Union Budet in order to ensure a comprehensive picture of fiscal policy. Aside from
criticality from a fiscal transparency perspective, this change could also enable greater budget flexibility
by redirecting previously off-budget revenues to priority needs across the Union budget. and more
efficient cash management. For example, liquidity constraints would not need to be alleviated through
short-term borrowing. To achieve this, it would be effective if the authorities closed all “other accounts”
and merged associated revenues all other Union Budget receipts.

    E. Functional Composition of Expenditure

3.22.   The functional composition of spending in the Union Budget in 2009/10 was misaligned relative
to the country’s development priorities. Spending for general public services and defense far exceeded
the average share in middle-income countries. Conversely, expenditure shares were well below lower
middle-income average for social protection, public order and safety, education, health, and housing and
community amenities (Figure 3.7).

3.23. Spending on social services increased very rapidly in between 2009/10 and 2013/14, reflecting
the country’s shifting priorities. For most of Myanmar’s history, the budget had been decided by the
government. In 2012/13 however, the new Parliament debated its first budget. At the same time,
spending on projects associated with Nay Pyi Taw were winding down. The expenditure share for general
public services correspondingly declined from 45.4 percent in 2009/10 to 23.0 percent in 2013/14 (Figure
3.8), which is closer to, though higher than, the lower middle-income average. This made room for a rapid
expansion in spending on social services. The expenditure share for education almost doubled, increasing
from 7.2 percent in 2009/10 to 12.5 percent in 2013/14. The share for health was more than tripled,
increasing from 1.7 percent to 6.4 percent over the same period. The higher expenditures financed
several policy changes, among them the elimination of some household out-of-pocket costs for
educational and healthcare expenses, and more teaching and healthcare personnel. These and other
changes are discussed in further detail in chapters 4 and 5 of the PER. Spending on social protection also

international norms (Figure 3.9).

3.24. Defense is an important public good. Yet, military spending remains high and necessarily limits
the expansion of other public services. At around 4.2 percent of GDP planned for 2013/14 (Figure 3.10),
it remains above the lower middle-income average of 2.3 percent of GDP. Average defense shares are
lower still for upper middle-income countries and high income countries.

percent of spending on economic affairs were for recurrent needs, most likely regulatory functions.

       F. Economic Composition of Expenditure

3.26. The economic composition of spending was misaligned at the beginning of the review period.
Capital investments in 2009/10 accounted for around 63 percent of the Union Budget compared to an
average of 18.6 percent for lower middle-income countries (Figure 3.11). This crowded out other critical
expenditure including employee compensation, goods and services, and social benefits.

3.27. Capital expenditures as a share of the Union Budget declined rapidly over the review period
from from 63.5 percent of the total in 2009/10 to 38.3 percent of the total in 2013/14 (Figure 3.12). This
share remained above the average for LMICs (Figure 3.13). The share in other countries tends to fall with
development and concurrent growth in private capital investments. The composition of capital
investment shifted substantially as well, falling in general public services, while increasing in defense and
economic affairs. Capital spending for social services increased substantially too, from a low base, in
2012/13 and 2013/14.

3.28. Spending on employee compensation increased rapidly over the review period, going from 15.9
percent of total Union spending in 2009/10 to 20.5 percent in 2013/14 (Figure 3.14).24 The military had
the largest share of employee compensation and made the biggest gains over time. The next largest
expansion occurred in the education sector, which also had the most employees in 2009. A portion of
these increases can be attributed to salaries and allowances, which went up three times. Allowances were
increased by MMK 20,000 per employee in 2011/12, salaries were increased by MMK 10,000 per
employee in 2012/13 and allowances were pushed up again in 2013/14 by MMK 20,000. Another portion
of the increase cost comes from new hires particuarly in education and health (see chapters 4 and 5).
Overall, the MoF could ensure future affordability of the wage bill by linking any further increase in salaries

  Employee compensation is defined here as salaries, honoraria and allowances including travel allowances. The
share of total military spending on employee compensation is assumed to be the same as the share of total non-
military spending on employee compensation.

3.29. Available data suggests a misalignment between the size of the civil service and Union
expenditures on capital investment. The total number of people employed by the Union government in
2009 was 883,215 compared to a population of 51.5 million people (Table 3.2). This was the equivalent of
1.7 percent of the population compared to 0.9 percent for low income countries and 2.9 percent for lower
middle-income countries (Figure 3.15). More important, however, is whether the civil service was able to
perform all the duties and functions needed for an ambitious program of national development. Much
more research is required to answer such a question. One hint can be found by looking at the ratio of
spending on capital investment to spending on employee compensation. The Myanmar ratio (1.5 to 1)
looks very high relative to other country groups (Figure 3.16). The MoF and Ministry of National Planning
and Economic Development (MNPED) could explore this further by reviewing Public Investment Management
practices and capital expenditure efficiency, including the scope for savings through reduced spending on
commercial activities in economic services.

                              Box 3.1: Size of the Wage Bill – Lessons from ECA Countries
     The non-defense public sector wage bill in Myanmar increased by around 40 percent in the 2015/2016
     Budget.a Changes to the wage bill will have important implications for the overall fiscal stance and the
     government’s ability to implement counter-cyclical policies. Upward or downward adjustments to
     government spending during periods of economic recession or boom respectively becomes more difficult if
     non-discretionary spending on wages take up a large share of total expenditure.
     A study by Eckardt and Mills (2014)25 of European and Central Asian (ECA) countries looking at the behavior
     of the aggregate public sector wage bill across business and electoral cycles, and its impact on public finances,
     point to relevant issues for Myanmar. The size of the wage bill in ECA varies a lot from 4 percent of GDP in
     Kazakhstan to 14 percent in Montenegro. Most countries spend between 20-30 percent of the budget on
     wages compared to around 17 percent in Myanmar.
     Between 2000 and 2008, the average annual growth of wage bill expenditure in ECA was 9.4 percent in real
     terms, compared to 48 percent in Myanmar between 2012/13 and the 2015/16 Union Budget. With the onset
     of the global financial crisis in 2008, many ECA countries had to drastically cut the size of their wage bills. In
     Latvia for example, real wage spending in 2011 was cut to 65 percent of the 2008 level. Cuts were implemented
     through nominal wage freeze, nominal wage cuts, hiring freeze, and retrenchment/rationalization.
     The study finds that the size of the wage bill in ECA countries is highly pro-cyclical in relation to both business
     and electoral cycles, and is more pro-cyclical than other types of government expenditure. This is consistent
     with developments in Myanmar where the wage bill has grown rapidly with recent economic recovery, and
     spiked further during an election year.
     Another, perhaps more surprising, finding is that the cuts implemented to the wage bill during the economic
     downturn was sharper than the increase during the high growth years of 2000-2008. One possible explanation
     for this finding is that nominal freezes lead to erosion of real wages, similar to past practice in Myanmar.
     The study also finds that wage bill expansions are associated with a deterioration of the overall fiscal position
     – a one percentage point increase in the wage bill as a share of GDP increases the fiscal deficit by half a
     percentage point. This is also consistent with Myanmar: a higher wage bill in 2015/16 was accommodated
     with cuts to other spending, but the cuts were not enough to avoid a higher overall deficit.
     The wage bill in Myanmar does not pose an immediate concern in terms of crowding out discretionary
     expenditure and constraining counter-cyclical policies. The general government wage bill (excluding defense
     and SEEs) is around 20 percent of general government recurrent expenditure.b There is also a clear need to
     compensate public servants for loss in real income. Going forward however, any increase should be linked to
     medium-term sustainability and to pay and grading reform/performance considerations.

3.30. Expenditures on goods and services also expanded rapidly from 8.2 percent of total spending in
2010/11 to 14.0 percent of the total in 2012/13 and an expected 17.7 percent in 2013/14. Defense
consumed the greatest portion of goods and services and also grew the fastest, particularly between
2011/12 and 2012/13. Other large gains were made in health, education and economic affairs. The Union
expenditure share intended for goods and services in 2013/14 is similar to the averages in the middle-
income countries, though GDP shares are lower (Figure 3.17).

3.31. Social benefits expenditure26 expanded sharply but remained below international levels. This
was mainly social security and pensions rather than social assistance. Their combined expenditures
increased from 0.2 percent of GDP in 2009/10 (1.7 percent of total expenditures) to a target of 0.8 percent

of GDP (5.1 percent of total expenditures) in 2013/14.27 This is substantial, but still far below the average
for LMICs (Figure 3.18).

3.32. The number of people with pension coverage has been very limited. Most of the spending on
social benefits consists of pensions and commuted pensions for government. According to MoF data,
there were 916,199 government workers who had pension coverage in 2010. This was the equivalent of
only 2.7 percent of the working age population. At the time of the review, there was no government
operated or mandated pension scheme for the private sector and very few private sector employees have
private pension coverage. As a result, the majority of the population, particularly the poor and vulnerable,
has no access to predictable social protection. Instead, they have to rely on informal coping mechanisms
and ad hoc assistance from donor-financed programs.

3.33. The government has been considering reforms to its civil service pension scheme but key details
were undecided at the time of this review. Fundamental decisions under discussion included whether
to proceed with defined contributions, or defined benefits, unfunded or partially funded, and whether to
include all employees or only the new employees from 2015 onward. As a consequence, it was not
possible to know the costs involved. The authorities are encouraged to ensure that the chosen pension
system is prudently managed and fiscally sustainable. An expanded system will bring welcome benefits
but could become a substantial government liability if not well managed. A particular risk is associated
with the idea of defined contributions flowing into a central provident fund.

3.34. The establishment of a provident fund fed by defined contributions would result in a significant
fiscal outlay in the short run and a rapidly growing fund that would, in a few years, become the largest
single institutional investor in the country, posing significant risks. The proposal also envisions the
possibility of investing in equities, corporate bonds and unspecified ‘other’ assets. At present however,
capital markets in Myanmar are underdeveloped and offer no liquid securities or other assets that would
normally be included in a pension fund’s portfolio. For this reason, a special government bond issued
expressly for the provident fund and linked to bank deposit rates is preferable to investing in illiquid
assets. This is the approach taken in Singapore, where the government issues special bonds to the Central
Provident Fund.28

3.35. Social security coverage has been very limited but will expand. The 1954 Social Security Act was
replaced in August 2012 by a new act that mandates a new pension scheme for the formal private sector.
Under the new law, all citizens are eligible to register for social security, but enrollment is not automatic.
Even so, coverage is expected to grow substantially beyond the estimated 650,000 beneficiaries in 2012
or about 1.7 percent of the labor force.

3.36. The new social security benefits program had not been costed, appeared overly generous and
may strain government capacity. Most governments at Myanmar’s level of development cannot afford
to provide unemployment benefits or publicly-funded housing as mandated by the 2012 Social Security
Act. Administrative costs could be high: the law sets a cap of 25 percent which is far higher than the 1
percent seen in Singapore, 2 percent in Thailand, Malaysia and Korea and 10 percent in the Philippines.

27
   According to notifications 106/2011 and 107/2011 by the Ministry of Finance and Revenue, retired State service
personnel and political pensioners were allowed to draw increased pension rates beginning July 2011.
28
   Singapore’s CPF also guarantees a nominal return of 2.5 or 4 percent per annum (depending on the type of
account). This guaranteed return is lower than the actual return on investments which are made by the Singapore
Investment Corporation.

                                                       37
The overall costs could be high if the new scheme is implemented as a government-funded defined
benefits program. Alternatively, costs could be held down by setting up individual accounts under a
contributory scheme. There is also a need for better coordination between the Social Security Board and
the Ministry of Health in order to eliminate overlapping health care systems. Most fundamentally, the
new law needs to tighten up its fiduciary regulations in order to ensure funds are safely invested and costs
are contained.

3.37. It will be useful to finding a good balance between social security and social assistance for poor
and vulnerable populations, backed by complementary policies for economic development and poverty
reduction. The diversity of needs and coping mechanisms by the populations in each State/Region raises
interesting challenges for shaping a national social protection approach. Recently introduced government
programs (e.g., stipends) are a good way to begin expanding social assistance. Yet, some caution is
justified about creating unsustainable social protection entitlements through large national programs that
might exceed government capacity or resources. Sequencing and phasing will be critical.

    G. Conclusions and Recommendations

3.38. The government has made good progress in gradually realigning the Union Budget towards the
development priorities. Efforts at mobilizing government revenue has generated early results. Reaching
levels comparable to other countries will be a long-term endeavor. There are nonetheless some short-
term measures that could contribute to improved revenue collections without adversely affecting equity
and efficiency. On the expenditure side, the government has effectively started to address major needs
in the social sectors by reallocating away from areas such as general public services in order to create
fiscal space. There may be additional potential, which warrants more detailed review for example in the
defense or capital expenditure budgets. The increase in the wage bill is large by most standards. While
not an immediate source of concern, experience from other countries shows that downward adjustments
during periods of recession can be more severe than increases during high growth periods.

    IMPROVING THE COVERAGE,

4   QUALITY AND EQUITY OF
    EDUCATION SERVICES
    Background: Many decades of government under-spending on education and
    prohibitive household financing requirements have left major gaps in education
    outcomes. The government has initiated several reforms since 2012/13 to improve
    the situation.

    Objectives: The objectives of this chapter are to analyze government expenditures
    and policies for basic education between 2009/10 and 2013/14, and to propose
    options for policy reforms and spending to improve coverage, quality and equity of
    education services.

    Key findings: Myanmar has suffered from low school enrolment and completion
    rates (one third of 1.2 million students enrolled in grade 1 made it to grade 11, and
    only one third of those passed the school leaving exam); poor learning outcomes (9
    percent of a third grade class in Yangon cannot read a single word); and inequalities
    in access and quality (net primary enrolment as low as 69 percent in poorer areas
    compared to 85 percent average nationally).

    Reforms initiated since 2012/13 include elimination of primary and secondary school
    fees, introduction of compulsory primary education, hiring 79,000 more teachers,
    expansion of the stipend program for poor students, and delegation of some
    spending authority to district and township education offices and to school head
    masters through block grants. To implement these policies, the government
    quadrupled the budget on education between 2011/12 and 2013/14, albeit from a
    low base.

    The MoE is now grappling with pressures to deliver more despite: (i) limited
    administrative, budget and performance data as a basis to prioritize spending; (ii)
    fledgling capacity to analyze policy and budget linkages; and (iii) fiduciary risks
    arising out of large cash payments and weak procurement rules.

    In addition, pressures are emerging for other important needs including teacher
    training; adding more years of schooling; ensuring wider coverage to include
    marginalized groups; and Early Childhood Development. Another emerging issue
    within education is how much to decentralize and how soon.

    Recommended options: (i) MoE to use standardized assessments of student
    learning outcomes to monitor the quality of the education system. As a starting
    point, MoE could use the Early Grade Reading Assessments piloted in 2014 in the
    Yangon region; (ii) MoE and MoF to carry out thorough costing of new initiatives
    (e.g. more school years, more teacher training, modernized curriculum, coverage to
    disadvantaged groups, early childhood education) and propose resourcing needs
    with implementation plans; (iii) strengthen implementation through more
    procurement training; (iv) to empower district officers or school principals to take
    decisions within a framework of accountability for results to be developed under the
    leadership of MoE; (v) carry out a Public Expenditure Tracking Survey to ensure
    schools are receiving allocations in accordance with the Ministry’s guidelines (i.e. in
    accordance with the formula and the time table specified in those guidelines).



                              39
      CHAPTER 4 IMPROVING THE COVERAGE,
       QUALITY AND EQUITY OF EDUCATION
       A. Background

4.1.    The government has initiated profound changes in the education sector since 2011 to help
redress decades of under-spending and prohibitive out-of-pocket payments that have led to low school
enrolment and completion rates; poor learning outcomes; and inequalities in access to and quality of
education across the country. To deal with these challenges, the education system is transitioning to a
new approach. The Ministry of Education (MoE) is taking on a stronger policy role. Public spending on
education is rising rapidly, having already been quadrupled from a low base between 2011/12 and
2013/14.

4.2.    The PER aims to assist the government in further prioritizing spending and policy reforms to
gradually improve the coverage, quality and equity of education services. It focuses on basic education,
which accounts for around two thirds of government spending on education as a whole. It starts with an
overview of how the sector is organized for the regulation and delivery of education services. It highlights
some of the big gaps in education outcomes. It looks at the government’s recent strategy to fill education
gaps, and measures that could further strengthen that strategy. It then analyzes how government
spending has responded to this new strategy and suggests options for further prioritization. It ends by
reviewing the current arrangements for budget preparation, implementation and reporting in the sector,
with recommendations to manage the rapidly growing inflows of resources in the sector.

       B. The Education Sector

4.3.    Almost all educational services in Myanmar are provided by the Union government, with a small
role for sub-national governments. Education is clearly specified as a Union responsibility by the 2008
Constitution. Thus, the administration and funding of the education sector has been centralized within
Union ministries, mainly the Ministry of Education. As such, new reforms for the delegation of functions
to deconcentrated agents of the MoE (state or district education officers) have advanced further than
ideas about what functions to devolve to state and region governments. Non-governmental and private
sector providers are almost absent.

4.4.     The Ministry of Education (MoE) accounts for more than 80 percent of Union spending in the
sector. MoE has responsibility for: (i) administration of basic education services (grades 1-11) through a
Department of Basic Education (DBE)29; (ii) planning and training which includes curriculum preparation,
teacher training, publication of learning materials, compilation of statistical yearbooks, and costing of new
policies; (iii) running the national matriculation exam; and (iv) running public universities through a
Department of Higher Education. In addition, fourteen ministries provide vocational and higher education
services in their own sectors with funding from their own budgets (Table 4.1). For example the Ministry of
Health runs and finances health related universities.

4.5.    Sub-national authorities (States and Regions) had a very limited role in education as of
November 2014, but this could change under the new education law. Some limited steps have been
taken to delegate decision-making of the day-to-day running of schools. For example, since 2012 township
and district education officers received increased responsibility for implementing and managing both
recurrent and capital parts of the budget. Another example is that starting in 2013/14 MoE schools
received part of their non-wage recurrent expenditures as a “block grant”, which they spend under the
supervision of a newly established school grant committee. Nonetheless, sub-national authorities do not
own or operate any pre-schools, primary schools, universities, training centers. They therefore do not
receive dedicated funds for education from the Union.30 In principle they can decide to use some of the
transfers they receive from the Union government (totaling around $600 million in FY2012/13) for
education. However, a lack of data makes it difficult to assess this.

4.6.    Non-governmental actors including monasteries and private schools play a marginal role in the
education sector. The MoE is by far the largest provider. Others include the Monastic Education School
System (less than 1 percent of total enrollment) and other non-state providers. In the school year 2012/13,
the education sector supported by the MoE included about 35,500 primary and post-primary schools,
3,000 middle or lower secondary schools, and 2,300 high or upper secondary schools. In these schools,
about 5.2 million students were enrolled in primary school (grades 1-5), 2.3 million in middle school
(grades 6-9) and 0.7 million in high school (grades 10-11). Enrollment in private primary and middle school
is almost non-existent, but accounts for approximately 5 percent of enrollment in high school. The MoE
has no experience in sub-contracting services from the private sector.

  There were cases where the central government has passed resources on to the office of the state or region level
Chief Minister to hire “contract” teachers.

    C. Education Challenges

4.7.     Educational outcomes, for much of Myanmar’s recent history, have been below potential. Older
generations completed fewer years of education (Figure 4.1). Three dimensions of educational outcomes
are of special concern: (i) coverage so that more children could be enrolled in and attending school; (ii)
quality to ensure more children could be gaining basic foundational skills and competencies in reading
and arithmetic; and (iii) inter-regional equity so that children of every income level, ethnic group, gender,
and geographical area have access to good quality education.

4.8.     In terms of coverage, Myanmar (along with Brunei Darussalam and Indonesia) has one of the
lowest enrollment rates in the region at all levels of education. Basic education includes primary schools
(G1-5) and secondary schools. Secondary schools are divided into middle schools (G6-9) and high schools
(G10-11). Data for enrollments vary widely. For instance, estimates of net primary enrollment rates vary
between 85 percent in 2012 (MoE) and 93 percent in 2010 (IHLCS, Figure 4.2). Even if the larger estimate
is correct, it remains well below what many of Myanmar’s regional peers have achieved.

4.9.     In terms of quality, there are clear signs of weaknesses based on school leaving examination
results, used both to graduate students from high school and to manage their placement in universities.
Only 460,000 out of 1.2 million students starting in grade 1 eventually make it to 11th grade. Most of them
leave school or drop out along the way. Since 2000, approximately 300,000 11th graders have taken the
exam each year. Every year, the national average pass rate has hovered around 33-36 percent, with wide
variance across the country (Figure 4.3). Others can repeat 11th grade and attempt to pass the exam the
following year. Thereafter, they have to quit school and can attempt to pass the test on their own.

4.10. Many students are not learning the ability to read. An Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA)
on a sample of schools in the Yangon region in 2014, where results are expected to be more favorable,
revealed that as many as 9 percent of a third grade class cannot read a single word (Figure 4.4). For
students who were able to read some words, 12 percent of them could not answer simple questions about
the text, suggesting lack of understanding. In February 2012, UNICEF supported a government assessment
of almost 23,000 students across 868 schools in the Myanmar language and mathematics. More than 75
percent of third graders could only master the most basic operations.

poorer states lagging behind in virtually all dimensions (Table 4.2). For instance, Chin had one of the
lowest net primary enrollment rates in 2009/10 and some of the poorest quality of education. Of the Chin
students that remained in school to the 11th grade in 2010, only 17 percent passed the final examination.
Within rural areas, the highest net primary enrollment rate in 2009/10 was 96 percent in Kayah and the
lowest was 69 percent in Rakhine. The highest pass rate in the 2010 final examination was 45 percent in
Mon and the lowest was 17 percent in Chin.

4.12. Myanmar’s children from poorer and rural households are less likely to enroll, complete, and
learn in school (Table 4.3). For example, 46 percent of children from the richest income quintile attend
pre-school, compared to only 7.6 percent of children from the poorest quintiles. In Myanmar, almost 95
percent of children from the richest income quintile attend primary school, compared to only 81.4 percent
of children from the poorest quintiles. The comparable numbers in Vietnam are 95 percent enrollment
for the richest quintile and 94 percent for the poorest quintile.

4.13. Students from urban and more affluent households have a much better prospect for completing
more years of education. In Myanmar, an analysis of the 2010 Integrated Household Living Conditions
Survey (IHLCS) indicates that students from the highest income quintile are over three times more likely
to attain a tertiary education as those from the lowest income quartile. The distribution of infrastructure
is important as well. In 2012, financial constraints were frequently cited by Township Education Officers
as barriers to the adequate provision of functioning latrines and clean drinking water in schools.31 Many
children were unable to attend school because they had to spend time fetching water for their families.
Results from the IHLCS shows that States and Regions with better rural access to safe water in 2009/10
tended to also have higher enrollment rates and higher pass rates on the 2010 school leaving exam.

         D. Policy Priorities in Education

4.14. The government in 2011 adopted a “10 points Education Policy” to reform education policy and
address some of the above challenges. The ten points (Box 4.1) have been the motivation for several of
the MoE’s initiatives in the past three years, including eliminating school fees in primary schools (in the
school year 2013/14) and middle school (in 2014/15), increasing teacher salaries, and working more
closely with development partners, among others.

                                          Box 4.1: 10 Points Education Policy
          Implement a free, compulsory primary education system.
          Increase the enrollment rate in basic education sector.
          Nurture new generations as intellectuals and intelligentsias in the development of human resources.
          Improve capacities of teachers in both basic and higher education sectors.
          Utilize teaching aids more effectively.
          Upgrade the quality and socio-economic status of educational personnel.
          Provide scholarships, stipends and awards both locally and internationally.
          Promulgate relevant laws for the participation and contribution of private sector in education sector.
          Collaborate with international and local organizations including the United Nations and international
           non-government organizations (INGOs) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).
          Upgrade education standards to international levels.


4.15. It would be helpful to have a clearer focus on the quality of education and equity. Although the
10th item in the Ten Points alludes to the importance of quality, this fundamental objective seems to have
received inadequate attention. For example, in the MoE’s annual reports, the sections on “quality” do not
contain any information on operationally defining the quality of education (as measured by assessments
of students’ learning outcomes); rather, they discuss the types of interventions that might help improve
learning (e.g. child centered learning, upgrading the curriculum). To promote equity, the MoE will need
to be more inclusive and proactively seek to attract and support students from socio-economically weaker
backgrounds, disabled children, and children from ethnic minorities.

4.16. Achieving a clearer focus would involve choosing measurable outcomes that correspond to
quality and the develop assessment tools to monitor gaps in achieving those quality outcomes (i.e. to
ensure equity). For Myanmar, a “tangible target” (or “learning standard”) would be to focus on reading
and numeracy skills for first, second and third graders. For instance, the measure of progress could be the
number of words per minute a child can read. The MoE could set a target of ensuring that all children can

                                                          45
read at least one word by the end of Grade 1. At the time of this review, 27 percent of children at the end
of Grade 1 could not read a single word. In the early grades of schooling, the Early Grade Reading
Assessments (EGRA) and Early Grade Mathematics Assessments (EGMA) could be used for this purpose.32

4.17. The government would benefit from investing early in better data and analysis on coverage,
quality and equity to prioritize spending towards the 10 Points Policy. Data gaps pose challenges for
effective policy-making, especially because most important decisions are made at the Union level rather
than at the sub-national level where officials would be better informed of local needs and issues.
Establishing a solid framework for data compilation and analysis that feeds into policy-making is a long-
term endeavor (Box 4.2). In the short to medium-term however, the MoE could enhance the capacity for
policy analysis by maintaining three critical databases: (i) Education Management Information System to
electronically record administrative data, which is currently collected in paper format; (ii) student learning
outcomes, and (iii) budget and expenditure data.

                                               Box 4.2: Data Challenges
         Education Management Information System: MoE currently collects monthly and annual
          administrative data (e.g. number and type of schools, teachers and students), compiled in a
          Statistical Yearbook published with 12 months delay. An MIS would improve quality, timeliness, and
          accessibility of this important information.
         Household surveys: These are important sources of estimates on enrollment, drop-out rates,
          household spending on education, and returns to education among other things. Existing surveys are
          dated (2009/10) and do not cover the entire country. Census data and new household survey data
          will become available in 2015. These data provide invaluable information on enrollments and drop
          outs. To be useful, though, staff in MOE need training to be able interpret and use these data for
          policy making.
         Accounting for different education levels: Many schools that integrate multiple levels (i.e. primary,
          middle and high school) do not account for spending at each tier (e.g. nearly all middle schools are
          also primary). Going forward it will be important to separate cost of each tier to accurately assess
          costs per student at each level.
         Assessment of student learning outcomes: There are currently no regular reviews of whether
          schooling translates into learning at different stages of the education cycle. The Early Grade Reading
          Assessments (EGRA) and an Early Grade Mathematics Assessments (EGMA) could be instituted to
          start the process for grades 1-3.
         Government spending: Key to monitoring the effectiveness of links between policy and government
          spending is timely, relevant, and accurate fiscal data. This will involve review of budget classification
          and broader FMIS. As part of the writing of this PER, data were compiled in a consolidated BOOST
          database to facilitate analysis. However, this database need to be updated and actively used by
          budget staff in MOE – a process which will require training and experience.


4.18. The legal framework for the education sector, which has been in place for many decades is also
currently being updated. The Basic Education Law and the University Education Law, in effect at the time
of this public expenditure review, both date to 1973. Formal technical and vocational education (TVE) is
regulated by the Agricultural, Technical, and Vocational Education Law of 1974 with amendments in 1983
and 1989 under the Ministry of Science and Technology. The Parliament and the MoE have recently begun

updating the laws. Thus, on September 30, 2014, a new National Education Law was passed, marking an
important milestone in updating the various laws governing the education system. The new law is seen as
an “umbrella law” for the entire sector, with more detailed laws to follow for each of the sub-sectors.

4.19. The creation of new roles for States and Regions in the education sector is one of the more
important changes under the new National Education Law. It enhances State and Regional: (i)
operational responsibilities “to communicate and transfer between government and other schools”; (ii)
operational responsibilities with budgetary implications, including autonomy to develop courses and
language classes for different ethnic groups; and (iii) budgetary responsibility in terms of managing public
finances for those education functions that are assigned to them under relevant law.

4.20. Some delegation of responsibility is warranted, particularly when it comes to the day-to-day
running of schools in a large country like Myanmar, where the center may not be adequately attuned to
local needs. Effectiveness of delegation will depend on many things, including local capacity, incentives,
and accountabilities. There will also be asymmetry of information between central and local authorities,
which can only be addressed in time through data reforms discussed above. Nonetheless, it is
recommended to start delegating authority to local authorities against accountability for results (e.g. test
scores, attendance, rates). Coordination of the framework could take place at the State/Region level.

     E. Sector Financing

4.21. The main sources of financing for education in Myanmar have been the Union government and
households, with external donors contributing only a small share.33 Reflecting years of under-
investment from public resources, an unusually high share of total education spending was funded by
households in 2009/10. The IHLCS shows public resources accounted for around 31 percent, and
household spending was around 63 percent of total education spending (Figure 4.5).34 This is triple the
international average of 18.5 percent.35 Donor resources made up the remainder.

4.22. Out-of-pocket costs deterred many families from schooling. When households were asked why
their children are not in schools, over half (55.5 percent) identified reasons related to economic and cost
factors. Common responses included high school fees and indirect “opportunity” costs, such as lost
services in agriculture, work, or care of a family member. Almost a third of the respondents (29.9 percent)
indicated out-of-pocket costs were not affordable.

4.23. Beginning in 2012/13, the Union government has likely replaced private households as the main
financier for education, although updated information on household spending will only become available
as part of the household survey data collected in 2015. Enrolments may have been motivated by the

33
   In 2009/10, external financing accounted for approximately US$40 million, and accounted for approximately 6
percent of spending in the sector (Figure 4.5). Donor support has grown in size since then to an estimated US$100
million or more per year.
34
   The estimate of private spending obtained from the Integrated Household Living Conditions Survey carried out in
2009/10 (and covering some 18,000 households source) is roughly comparable to numbers reported in a 2010
UNICEF report in which 660 parents from 131 schools located in 24 townships were interviewed in details about
their spending on education. UNICEF (2010): Household Education Expenditure Report. The UNICEF estimates for
private spending by households (in the schools they visited) are roughly 10-15 percent higher (or around MMK 6000
per year) than the average figures obtained from IHLCS and seem mainly due to the fact that the UNICEF
methodology included “pocket money to children” as an education -related expense whereas the IHLCS did not.

removal of primary school feels in 2013/14, the removal of secondary school fees in 2014/15 and the
provision of free textbooks. Ministry of Education officials believe that these cost savings for households
motivated an increase in the number of children enrolled in primary and secondary schools in 2014/15 by
300,000 to 8.5 million. It may be possible to do more. These tuition fees and textbooks are not the only
out-of-pocket cost paid by households, as illustrated by Figure 4.6. Improved stipend programs for the
poor and disadvantaged, which are beginning in 2015/16, could help cover some of these costs.

4.24. In terms of overall levels of government spending, Myanmar has, for many decades, directed a
much lower share of GDP to education than most other countries. In 1973/74, Union expenditures on
education were estimated to be close to 3.3 percent of GDP. The GDP share subsequently and almost


                                                                                            48
consistently fell since then, reaching 0.7 percent of GDP by 2011/12 (Figure 4.7). The level of spending in
Myanmar, even in 1973/74 and certainly in 2011/12, was far below that of regional peers (Figure 4.8). The
decades of inadequate spending have, as discussed, above affected the quality of education. School
infrastructure is very basic, and school supplies and teaching materials are highly inadequate. This makes
learning conditions very difficult and affects the fundamental capacity to provide quality education. There
are many opportunities for significant improvements even in the short-term (Box 4.3).

           Box 4.3: Important Gaps to Address through Higher Government Spending on Education
   The basic education system consists of only 11 years of schooling compared with 12 or 13 in the rest
    of ASEAN
   Despite evidence of high returns to early childhood education, there has been no budget for
    kindergartens.
   The learning curriculum has not been updated on a regular basis to reflect strengths and weaknesses
    revealed from standardized assessments.
   Most of Myanmar’s textbooks have not been modified in the past 10 years.
   The budget to cover all the non-wage running costs for schools was very small, averaging less than
    $250 per school in 2009/10 leading to high out-of-pocket payments.
   The budget for vocational education is very small and spread thinly across several ministries.
   There is no budget for in-service teacher training and inadequate resources for pre-service training.
   Until recently, the only targeted support for financially disadvantaged students was in the form of a
    stipends scheme and provided support to only 0.1 percent of all students.
   There is virtually no system of support from children with disabilities
   Some functions that are commonly found in ministries of education are missing in Myanmar (e.g. data
    collection, regular assessments of learning outcomes).


4.25. In 2012/13, the Parliament approved a substantial increase in the education budget. Estimated
actual spending on education by all ministries increased to the equivalent of US$894 million or 1.6 percent
of GDP. The budget for 2013/2014 was increased further to about US$1.1 billion equivalent, 2.1 percent
of GDP, or about 14 percent of overall government spending (Table 4.4). The kyat value of spending was
more than tripled between 2011/12 and 2013/14. Yet, even after these increases, Myanmar continues to
allocate one of the smallest regional shares of GDP to education (Figure 4.8).

4.26. There were important shifts in the composition of spending on basic education associated with
the overall increase in expenditure level. The biggest driver of spending was teachers’ salaries, which in
2011/12 constituted around three quarters of total spending on basic education (Table 4.5). The wage bill
more than doubled between 2011/12 and 2013/14. The share of salaries and allowances however fell
from 76 percent of total spending in 2011/12 to an estimated 62 percent in 2013/14. This was because

                                                          49
spending on goods and services and capital investments grew even more quickly than salaries and
allowances. The share of spending on goods and services (and other recurrent items) went from 14 to an
estimated 24 percent between 2011/12 and 2013/14, and that of capital from 10 to 14 percent over the
same period.

4.27. Part of the wage bill increase was driven by higher teacher wage rates. Previously the
government used to keep wages fixed in nominal terms over very long periods of time, leading to
significant erosion of real income. During the period 1972-2010, nominal wages were only increased five
times coinciding with changes in government: 1972, 1989, 1993, 2000 and 2006. In other words this
implied a freeze in nominal terms of salaries for these periods: 1) 1972-88; 2) 1989-93; 3)1993-2000; 4)
2000-2006; 5) 2006-2010. This policy came to an end in 2011 and subsequent years when salaries were
increased on an annual basis. It is estimated that 80-90 percent of the 2012/13 increase in teacher salaries
was due to a 30,000 kyat monthly “bonus” added to the salaries of all government employees, including
staff working in the education sector (Table 4.6).36 For a primary school teacher employed in an urban
area, this monthly “bonus” amounted to a 64 percent salary increase. In addition, the salary bill rose as a
result of introducing a “hardship allowance” (a doubling of the monthly salary) of teachers working in 87
remote locations in the country. However, in terms of its budgetary impact, the “hardship” allowance was
much more modest, since it only affected 16,000 teachers (approximately 6 percent of all teachers).

  The bonus was added starting in April 2012 (the first month of the 2012/13 fiscal year), applies to all government
staff and has been added for every month since April.

4.28. The education wage bill was also driven by a major drive for recruiting new teachers. At least
29,000 new contract teachers were hired in basic education in 2013/14 and at least another 43,000 in
2014/15 for a total new hiring of 72,000. Seeking to ensure that every primary school had at least one
teacher per grade, the MoE has been rushing to hire more teaching staff. A key constraint in doing so,
however, is that the 22 teaching colleges located across the country only produce approximately 10,000
graduates each year (and each teacher is trained for two years). To meet the ministry’s new more
ambitious staffing norms, the ministry decided to let state and regions hire and then train, graduates from
other fields of study, or even high school graduates, if they were willing to move to “hardship townships.”

4.29. Increased spending on goods and services and capital coupled with a policy on eliminating
school fees has helped reduce out-of-pocket payments by households. The loss in revenue from fees
(estimated at $63 million in 2009/10 for all levels of education including tertiary) and other household
contributions (estimated at around $36 million) was more than offset by government spending on goods
and services, maintenance and capital. Government expenditure on these categories increased from $29
million in 2009/10 to $188 million in 2013/14. MoE officials believe that the elimination of school fees
motivated an increase in the number of children enrolled in primary and secondary schools in 2014/15 by
300,000 to 8.5 million.

4.30. Other new policy initiatives, while relatively small, were introduced to further reduce out-of-
pocket payments. These included free textbooks, and scholarships and stipends (Table 4.7). Expanding
stipend programs to support poor and disadvantaged students is an effective way to keep poor children
from dropping out of school. Stipends can help poor families invest in schooling by supporting them with
direct costs, such as uniforms, and by helping families to recover some of the opportunity costs, such as
alternative income earning opportunities for the child. Experience from other countries suggests that a
stipend program has the potential to lead to higher school attendance rates and lower dropout and
repetition rates in the targeted grades.

4.31. Block grants were another source of increased recurrent spending. This is a transfer that schools
have flexibility on in terms of spending. Block grants grew from approximately US$285 per high school in
2009/10, after adjusting for inflation, to more than US$8,000 by 2013/14 (Figure 4.9). As schools did not
have such flexibility in the past, there may be mistakes in recording and reporting these expenditures in
the beginning. These will lessen in time and with experience, and therefore are not an obstacle for bigger
transfers.

4.32. Going forward, new initiatives will require additional fiscal space and therefore warrant
thorough costing. In the immediate future, adding more years of schooling, one at the beginning and one
at the end of the cycle, will be the biggest driver of costs. For example, adding one year of preschool will
bring 1.2 million more students into the system, which represents an almost 20 percent increase in
student numbers. Assuming 25 students per class, this will require hiring 48,000 new teachers and building
approximately 60,000 new kindergartens. Using the 2013/14 average recurrent cost per student (75,703),
this will cost approximately 91 billion kyat a year, every year, an increase in the recurrent budget of
approximately 12 percent. Keeping 322,000 students in high schools for one more year will cost
approximately 180,000 kyat a year per high school student, a total of 58 billion kyat a year. Actual costs
are likely to be higher if the government is to pursue higher quality of education services.

4.33. The quality of education is unlikely to improve unless Myanmar’s current teachers are
retrained, and equipped with better textbooks and teacher guides. Modernizing a curriculum, writing
new textbooks, re-training teachers, and rolling this out to every classroom in the country usually takes
at least five years in a well-functioning ministry of education. Most likely, this could take even longer in
Myanmar, where no undertaking of this scale has been attempted for at least 10 years.

4.34. Delivering on the promises of the new Education Law to provide education to all children,
including those with disabilities is another concern.37 There is virtually no system in place to serve
children with disabilities. A cross-ministerial effort—involving the Ministries of Education, Health, and
Social Welfare, Rehabilitation and Resettlement—is needed to identify and remove the barriers. As a start,
the MoE could consider setting up an administrative unit, tasked with developing activities (or
“programs”) to be implemented in regular and special schools. These activities could be presented as part
of next year’s budget proposal or submitted to development partners for financial support.

4.35. Early Childhood Development (ECD) is another issue. The new education law mentions early child
development as a responsibility of “parents, villages, and appropriate departments and organizations

37
  “Special education programs and services shall be established so that every school-aged child and youth, including
those citizens who are disabled or who for whatever reason have not had a chance to study, can access their right
to education in line with Education for All.” Myanmar National Education Law, Chapter 3, Education principles 4.c.

                                                                               52
according to existing policy.” Moreover, the law makes explicit that “free education” only starts at the
primary level. However, a clear budgetary commitment from the government for ECD would address the
most important years for a young child’s survival, growth and development. It is critical particularly for
children from poorer households to be able to start school as prepared as children from richer households.
Myanmar is developing a policy on early childhood care and development (ECCD). This proposes
coordination of services in education, health, nutrition, sanitation, and child protection. A recent analysis
by UNICEF provides suggestions on how to strengthen this policy.38

4.36. MoE should, with MoF assistance, explore sources of fiscal space starting with efficiency gains
within the education sector. One potential area of savings is MoE’s current policy on purchase of school
books. The current 92 titles used throughout the school system are of such poor quality that they have to
be replaced every year, compared to other countries where a textbook can easily be used for three
years.39 40 million poor quality textbooks are being printed each year, for a total of 120 million over three
years.

4.37. By investing slightly more, only 40 million textbooks would have to be produced over a three
year period. It will also have raised the quality of the content and the reproduction to an acceptable
standard in the interim period before a wholly new curriculum and its accompanying textbooks and
teacher’s guides are introduced.40 Chapter 3 proposes additional options including a stronger revenue
effort by the Union government and reductions in low priority and/or wasteful expenditure programs.

     G. Public Financial Management in Education

4.38. The budget preparation and implementation processes for basic education are much more
important and expenditure levels have been substantially increased because better results are being
demanded and the Parliament is involved. The budget preparation process (Figure 4.10) begins with
bottom up needs of schools submitted through Township Education Offices (TEO), Regional Education
Offices (REO), who then submit to the central DBE for final review and decision. 41

4.39. It would be useful if the increased focus on education policy objectives could be accompanied
by greater analysis and scrutiny of budget requests within MoE before these are submitted to MoF.
Previously, government spending in education was mostly wages and salaries, which were fixed in nominal
terms, offering little scope or need for analysis. Now there needs to be more attention on whether budget
requests align with policy priorities. This requires: (i) scrutiny and vetting of both existing and new
initiatives; (ii) analysis of available data on spending and education outcomes; and (iii) improved
coordination between the recurrent and capital budgets, particularly as the government increases
spending on new schools.

4.40. The MoF and MNPED also need to review budget submissions more actively. During the period
under review, MoF made only minor adjustments to the budget before forwarding the proposals to the
Financial Commission and Parliament (See steps 5 through 10 in Figure 4.10). It would be helpful if MoF

   This section provides a review of the budget cycle only for basic education which accounts for approximately three-
quarters of all MoE expenditures. The budget processes governing higher education is, however, highly similar to
what is reviewed here.

and MNPED could have dedicated staff to oversee, vet and challenge budget proposals coming from MoE
and other ministries. Establishing this capacity will reduce Union vulnerability to unexpected cost
increases.

4.41. The budget calendar could allow more time for Cabinet review and inputs. Figure 4.10 shows
that the Cabinet is allowed only two or three days to review the budget proposal. This is not enough time
in circumstances when big changes are proposed or needed for the level or composition of spending.
Further decompression will be needed if and when the draft Budget proposal is made available to the
public.

4.42. In the medium-term, it would be helpful to make budget proposals more informative. MoE (and
all ministries) could facilitate budget formation and review by arranging spending proposals by program
or objective. It would also help to make a distinction between the expenditure requirements of old versus
new programs and the savings made possible by the completion or elimination of some old programs.

4.43. The rapid growth in budget allocations for education could put stress on fiduciary
arrangements. There is an orderly process in place for flow of funds from the Union to townships and
schools. The funds flow mechanism from the Department of Basic Education to townships operates
through the banking system and is secure. However, townships transfer school budgets in cash. This
creates fiduciary risk, particularly when the level of transfers is growing rapidly. This warrants closer
review to assess the extent to which central allocations are making it to frontline service delivery units.
This assessment can be made through a Public Expenditure Tracking Survey (PETS). A PETS type exercise
is planned as part of the World Bank/Australia supported school grants and stipends program.

4.44. Budget implementation has been dominated by the three DBEs42 but this is beginning to change
with the introduction of school grants. Up until recently, DBEs were responsible for: hiring and transfer of

teachers; procurement and distribution of goods through the townships to schools; contracting and
execution of capital projects above $5 million. Since 2014/15 however, schools are receiving a “school
grant” based on the number of students of enrolled (see paragraph 31 above). Schools decide how to
spend this money, based on a list of eligible expenditures.

4.45. The current procurement system is another source of fiduciary risk in the face of rapidly rising
expenditure. As noted above, budget allocations to goods and services and capital investments have
grown very rapidly. There are indications that MoE has struggled with procurement, largely because of
lack of experienced, trained staff. Most staff members have little or no experience in contracting services
or purchasing goods from the private sector. Solving this would open up good opportunities for reforms.
For example, bringing competition to the monopoly on printing textbooks held by the state-owned
Printing and Publishing Enterprise would improve the quality of textbooks and value for money. Beyond
MoE, there is a general need for clear and universal regulations, backed by a law, for procurement
planning, implementation, and performance monitoring.

4.46. Financial management capacity within MoE is good in comparison with other less developed
countries in South East Asia. The staff within the finance functions are dedicated and staff turnover is
generally low. All managerial staff, apart from general administration staff, have some form of university
degree.43 These strengths could be further amplified by working to ensure more staff have specialist
qualifications and expertise in accounting, information technology, procurement, and internal audit. In
addition, it would be helpful to ensure more staff have their own computers and know how to use them.
The ability to use an electronic spreadsheet or databases such as the EMIS for analytical purposes is very
rudimentary and concentrated in a few staff. Thus far, spreadsheets are used mainly used as convenient
way to set up tables, rather than as a powerful tool to do analysis.

4.47. The accounting and audit systems appear to be orderly and systematic. All accounting and
financial reporting is on a cash basis and manual recording and reporting processes are currently used at
the DBEs. The reporting system follows a very orderly and bottom-up process based on accounts at the
school level. TEOs aggregate school accounts, add expenditures of township administration and send
them to REOs. REOs aggregate township reports, add expenditures of regional administration and submit
these reports to DBEs periodically. The formats used for financial reporting are the same as the budget
formats and they include budget versus actual variances for each budget line. The general ledger and
subsidiary ledgers for inventories and fixed assets are regularly reconciled. All accounting and supporting
documents are retained and are accessible. The bank reconciliation processes appear to be strong and
they ensure that all receipts and payments have been correctly recorded in the accounting records. The
main disadvantage is that it is paper based and it takes a long while to consolidate reports. It takes around
three months to consolidate year end reports and prepare provisional actual year-end financial reports
by DBE’s. The external audit arrangements appear to be adequate. Regular external audits are conducted
and audit recommendations are monitored for implementation.




43
  The Basic Education sector benefits from the fact that all staff members begin their careers as teacher trainees,
who firstly obtain their University and teaching qualifications and then move up through the various education sector
institutions management structures (school teacher, school principal, township education officer, and into DBE or
Ministry of Education management).

    H. Conclusions and Recommendations

4.48. Tackling education sector challenges is a high priority on the government’s agenda. Since 2011,
it has initiated fundamental reforms to education sector policy including elimination of school fees,
introduction of compulsory primary education, provision of stipends, delegation of authority to States and
Regions, improvement of learning conditions, and enhancement of teacher qualifications. To implement
these policies, the government’s budget on education quadrupled, albeit from a low base. A larger
education wage bill has enabled higher salaries and more teacher recruitment, and increased resources
for non-wage recurrent and capital investments have helped reduce the burden of education costs on
households.

4.49. The MoE will be grappling with pressures to deliver more despite: (i) limited administrative,
budget and performance data as a basis to prioritize spending; (ii) fledgling capacity to analyze policy and
budget linkages; and (iii) fiduciary risks arising out of large cash payments and weak procurement rules.
In addition, pressures are emerging for new priorities such as teacher training; more years of schooling;
extending coverage to marginalized groups; and Early Childhood Development.

    GOING FROM MORE TO

5   BETTER GOVERNMENT
    SPENDING ON HEALTH
    Background: Health services in Myanmar have been inadequate due to
    historically low levels of government spending, and the ensuing weaknesses in
    health systems and regulatory capacity. The government in 2012/13 initiated
    reforms meant to improve the situation.
    Objectives: The objectives of this chapter are to analyze government
    expenditures and policies for healthcare between 2009/10 and 2013/14, and
    to propose options for further reforms in policies and spending, in particular
    through more efficient and more equitable government spending.
    Key findings: In 2012, government spending on public health was a mere $1.6
    per-capita per year, with out-of-pocket payments by households accounting
    for almost 80 percent of total health spending. This has created serious
    obstacles to healthcare access, with rural and hard to reach areas most
    severely affected, and some of the lowest health outcomes among ASEAN
    countries.
    The Union government introduced policies to improve access to, and
    affordability of, healthcare services. More medical personnel have been hired.
    Beginning in 2012/13, essential drugs and selected health care services are
    provided free of charge to children, pregnant mothers and for patients needing
    emergency surgery under certain circumstances in some facilities.
    There are early signs that these policy changes are helping to reduce
    prohibitive out-of-pocket payments by households. They have, however,
    caused a dramatic increase in expenditure on drugs and medical consumables.
    Further costs have been incurred due to wage increases and heavy investments
    in facilities and equipment. These policies have been financed through a nine-
    fold increase in MoH spending on health between 2009/10 and 2013/14.
    Ongoing challenges include constraints on policy making and monitoring due
    to unreliable and incomplete data, and high costs due to expenditure
    inefficiencies. In the medium-term, the government may also want to consider
    options to increase equity public service provision including more rural primary
    care and better financial protection policies.
    Recommended options: To assist in policy making and monitoring, (i) improve
    the coverage and comprehensiveness of data for public and external financing
    of the health sector and conduct household budget surveys for private
    financing; to reduce expenditure inefficiencies, (ii) increase the share of MoH
    budget resources for preventive care and health interventions with strong
    public goods characteristics and (iii) formulate a policy for the strategic
    procurement of pharmaceuticals; to make public services more equitable, (iv)
    formulate a policy on capital spending that better balances rural construction
    against acquisition of expensive tertiary care equipment; and (iv) formulate
    financial protection policies to ensure universal access to health services.

        CHAPTER 5 FROM MORE TO BETTER
       GOVERNMENT SPENDING ON HEALTH
     A. Background

5.1.    Historically low levels of government spending in the health sector, and the ensuing weaknesses
in health systems and regulatory capacity, have translated to inadequate health services in Myanmar.
In 2012, government spending on public health was a mere $1.6 per-capita per year, with out-of-pocket
payments accounting for almost 80 percent of total health spending. This has created serious obstacles
to healthcare access, with rural and hard to reach areas most severely affected. It also resulted in some
of the lowest health outcomes among ASEAN countries. The government has introduced major policy
reforms in the health sector to address these issues as a matter of high priority. Government spending in
the health sector has increased nine-fold in the five years between 2009/10 and 2013/14.

5.2.     The PER aims to assist the government in prioritizing spending and policy reforms to improve
health outcomes in Myanmar, in particular through better targeted, more efficient and more equitable
government spending. It starts with an overview of the health sector which, unlike education, has a strong
private sector presence. It provides an overview of health challenges in Myanmar, how these have
informed government priorities in recent years, and the implications these have had for health sector
financing. It then looks more deeply at government spending on health and recommends possible changes
to allocations that could improve the efficiency and equity of that spending.

     B. The Health Sector

5.3.    The Ministry of Health is the regulator and the main health service provider in the public sector,
accounting for around 73 percent of public spending on healthcare in 2011/12 which, in turn, constituted
only around 15 percent of health sector spending. In that year, there were around 987 public sector
hospitals and 1,565 rural health centers. MoH’s service delivery network is deconcentrated and extends
to the village level. Township health departments, managing the township health system, are the
backbone of Primary Health Care and provide comprehensive health services at the local level. At the
regional administrative level, the Health Departments of the states and regions provide supervisory and
technical support. They also manage the provision of tertiary care and referral services.

5.4.     Several other government ministries and agencies incur expenditures on health,44 which
together account for 27 percent of all health expenditures from public sources and 4 percent of total
health spending in Myanmar in 2011/12. Most of these health expenditures were for curative care
services for staff and family members through hospitals and health facilities owned and run by each
ministry. The Ministry of Defense is well known for providing the most comprehensive health services and
coverage to staff of the armed forces and their family members. It operates hospitals and medical schools
that train health personnel, including medical doctors and nurses. Several military hospitals also provide
health care services to local residents in remote areas who live near the hospitals.

44
  These ministries and agencies include the Ministries of Defense, Labor, Railways, Mines, Industry, Energy, Home,
and Transport, as well as Yangon City Development Committee, Mandalay City Development Committee, and Nay
Pyi Taw City Development Committee.


                                                                                                               58
5.5.    The City Development Committees (CDCs) of Yangon, Mandalay and Nay Pyi Taw also provide
health services, primarily health promotion and disease prevention services.45 The Yangon CDC, for
instance, provides disease prevention services against dengue fever, cholera, gastroenteritis, and
tuberculosis. The services include mass health education through media and health education at schools.
Other health activities include food and drug control and environmental health. Yangon CDC, for instance,
routinely provides food safety and control services, particularly the inspection of markets, food stores,
food industry, schools, and restaurants in 32 urbanized townships of Yangon Division.

5.6.    Non-governmental providers (both for profit and non-profit) are big conduits for health sector
spending and employ the majority of medical personnel in Myanmar. For-profit providers typically offer
ambulatory care and hospital care. Not-for-profit institutions include civil society organizations and
international non-governmental organizations. According to MoH data for 2012/13, non-governmental
providers employed 57 percent of Myanmar’s doctors and 73 percent of the dentists. There are over 40
private hospitals and thousands of private health clinics in Yangon city, at least five private hospitals in
Nay Pyi Taw, and thousands of private health care institutions in the regional cities, and in rural villages.46

     C. Health Challenges

5.7.     Living standards in Myanmar are among the lowest in the region. Myanmar is a geographically
and culturally diverse country, with 135 groups speaking over 100 languages and dialects. It has been one
of the poorest countries of the world, and ranked a low 149 out of 168 countries on the 2012 Human
Development Index. Poverty incidence is twice as high in rural areas compared to urban areas, and states
and regions such as Chin, Rakkhine, Shan, Tanintharyi and Ayeyarwady are much poorer than others.47
Despite recent gains, living standards in Myanmar are among the lowest in the region and social well-
being is well below those of regional peers (Figure 5.1).

5.8.    Government spending on health in the past decades has been very low. In 1975/76, Union
expenditures on health were approximately 0.8 percent of GDP (Figure 5.2).48 These fell to 0.4 percent of
GDP by 1995/96 and just under 0.3 percent of GDP by 2010/11. The health sector, accounted for only 1.3
percent of total government expenditure in 2011/12, equivalent to about US$1.60 per person per year.
As a result, private out-of-pocket payments accounted for almost 80 percent of total spending on health
in 2011/12. Use of health services is disproportionately skewed in favor of those who can afford to pay
for health, rather than those who most need the services.

5.9.      The above has translated to very low levels of basic healthcare services in Myanmar.
Approximately 30,000 doctors and 55,000 nurses and mid-wives serve over 51.4 million people. Less than
half of these doctors work in the public sector, making it very difficult to staff adequately the public health
facilities in rural areas.49 Medical training is poor, and does not provide midwives and nurses with full skills
and knowledge to address all competencies for basic and emergency obstetric care. In-service training is
mainly provided by projects and programs, and not adequately coordinated. Many health facilities require
upgrading and refurbishment, including basic facilities and equipment. Transport is inadequate to ensure
effective service delivery, supervision and monitoring, and referral for those in of need emergency care.

own revenues through tax collection, fees, licenses, and property development.

5.10. Health systems and regulation have also suffered. The supply chain system is not well developed,
and there are problems with storage and distribution of supplies, especially to facilities at the township
level and below. The health information system has many weaknesses, and there are gaps in data from
the community level and from hard-to-reach areas. There has been no national survey of maternal and
under-five mortality since 2002. Much of the growing private sector is unregulated.

5.11. Myanmar has one of the lowest health outcomes in the ASEAN region. As shown in Table 5.1,
life expectancy at birth is 65 years for both sexes (71 years in Cambodia, 76 years in Vietnam). The age-
standardized death rate in Myanmar is estimated at 1,112 deaths per 100,000, about 60 percent higher
than that of neighboring Thailand.50 In other words, Myanmar records 259,260 deaths that could be
prevented if the health system delivered outcomes similar to Thailand (Figure 5.3). If the regional
relationship between GDP per-capita and the age-adjusted death rate were applied to Myanmar, there
would be 17 percent lower with only 922 deaths per 100,000 people (Table 5.1). The five leading causes
of death are cerebrovascular disease (related to circulation of blood to the brain), neoplasms (abnormal
cell growth, possibly cancerous), HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, chronic respiratory diseases, and lower
respiratory infections.51 Some of these could be avoided with higher spending on preventive care (section
G below).

   The age-standardized mortality rate is a weighted average of the age-specific mortality rates per 100,000 persons,
where the weights are the proportions of persons in the corresponding age groups. The numbers of deaths per
100,000 population are influenced by the age distribution of the population. Two populations with the same age-
specific mortality rates for a cause of death will have different overall death rates if the age distributions of their
populations are different. Age-standardized mortality rates adjust for differences in population age distribution by
applying the observed age-specific mortality rates for each population to a standard population.

5.12. Maternal and child health outcomes are poor despite significant improvements since 1990.
Maternal mortality fell from 520 per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 200 in 2010, while under-five mortality
fell from 106.4 per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 54.2 in 2011 (Table 5.1). During the same period, infant
mortality rate fell from 76.1 per 1,000 live births to 42.4 per 1,000 live births.52 This translates to 2,000
pregnant women and 50,000 children dying every year from mainly preventable causes. If the regional
relationship between GDP per-capita and infant mortality rates applied to Myanmar, the infant mortality
rate would be 30 percent lower or 29 deaths per 1,000 live births. Notwithstanding the gains in recent
years, Myanmar is unlikely to reach its health-related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs): MDG4, to
reduce child mortality (36 per 1,000 live births for under-five mortality), and MDG5, to improve maternal
health (130 per 100,000 live births for maternal mortality) for 2015.

5.13. Antenatal care coverage remains poor, although there have been some improvements in recent
years. Available numbers suggest that between 73 percent and 83 percent of pregnant women had at
least one antenatal visit and 43 percent had at least four visits to a health care provider in 2010.53 Likewise,
there are a number of different estimates for skilled birth attendance, varying between 70 and 80 percent,
and for institutional deliveries, which is estimated to be 36 percent. Available statistics therefore suggest
that emergency obstetric care is not adequate or affordable for all women who need it.

5.14. Malnutrition has been a serious issue in Myanmar. This remains true, even though the overall
prevalence of stunting and underweight has been decreasing over the past two decades. Estimates for
2009 suggest that 1 in 7 infants were born with a low birth weight, 35 percent of children under the age
of five are stunted, 23 percent are underweight, and 8 percent are wasted. Analysis of survey data
suggests that only 24 percent of Myanmar children were exclusively breastfed up to the age of six months.

   There are several discrepancies in these numbers between what is reported by national sources and by external
agencies. The Central Statistical Organization (Health in Myanmar 2013, accessed at http://www.moh.gov.mm/ on
8-23-13) reports U5MR of 34.9 per 1,000 live births in 2011 (compared to 62.4 reported by WDI and 46.1 by the
Myanmar 2009/10 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, or MICS), MMR of 142 per 100,000 live births (compared to
200 reported by WDI), and IMR of 25.6 (urban) and 27.8 (rural) per 1,000 live births (compared to 49.3 overall
reported by WDI and 37.5 by MICS).

5.15. Inequalities in health status and access are significant particularly in rural and hard-to-reach
areas, and among the most vulnerable populations. There are huge gaps particularly in relation to
immunization coverage, access to health care, nutritional status, antenatal care coverage and skilled
attendance at birth (Table 5.2). Women and girls of reproductive age and young children are the most
adversely affected by this lack of affordable, quality health services. Many rural areas are poorly served
because difficult terrain, geographical remoteness, conflict, and cultural diversity hinder the delivery of
essential services. Even where services are available, access is limited by financial and other barriers. Out-

of-pocket expenditure is high within and outside the public health sector, and serious illness or a medical
emergency can throw a family into deeper poverty.

         D. Policy Priorities in Health

5.16. The government’s Health Vision 2030 (2001) continues to provide the overarching policy
framework to address the above challenges.55 This is backed up by a series of more recent short-term
plans56 that have set a series of commitments to improve access to healthcare services, including: 80
percent antenatal care coverage; 80 percent of births attended by a skilled attendant; 70 percent access
to emergency obstetric care; and 80 percent coverage for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of
HIV. They also include universal childhood immunization coverage, increased coverage of newborn care,
increased contraception prevalence and reduced unmet need for contraception, improvement in the
midwife to population ratio from 1:5,000 to 1:4,000. The government plans to comprehensively update
its overall health strategy, including the Public Health Law (1972).57

5.17. Improved accuracy, coverage and comprehensiveness of health sector spending data should
underpin any revision to the overall health strategy, and will require early commitment on the part of
government. As a start, there is much scope to improve the coverage and comprehensiveness of fiscal
data. Box 5.1 provides a list of some of the more important gaps in the data. Secondly, critical to
prioritizing government expenditure in health is a comprehensive picture of overall financing in the health
sector. Public spending is the only well recorded portion of health financing data, and it explains only a
small percentage of total spending on health. Spending on health from external sources, including
bilateral aid and assistance from development partners, is not completely and accurately recorded.
Private spending, which is the single largest financer of health, is the most poorly documented.

                   Box 5.1: Gaps in the Coverage and Comprehensiveness of Budget Data on Health
          Capital and recurrent budget/expenditure on health of non-Ministry of Health government
           ministries and departments, townships etc., for 2012/13 and 2013/14
          Recurrent health expenditures of non-MoH government ministries and agencies in 4-digit series58
           for the period 2009/10 to 2013/14
          Capital health expenditures of non-MoH government ministries and agencies by investment
           categories the period 2009/10 to 2013/14
          Capital and recurrent budget/expenditure on health at the state, regional, and township level
          Capital expenditure (with the exception of construction category) that can be disaggregated into
           different levels of MoH’s health facilities
          Recurrent expenditure on drugs that can be disaggregated into different levels of MoH’s health
           facilities.

of Action on Food and Nutrition (2011–2016) and the Health Workforce Strategic Plan 2012-17.
57
   At least 14 additional laws govern the sector, including the 2007 Law Relating to Private Health Care Services.
58
   Data on recurrent expenditures are available in 2 levels: 2-digit and 4-digit series. The 4-digit series is a
disaggregated level of the 2-digit series that allows a more clear understanding and therefore more robust analysis
of expenditures in health.

                                                                                                                63
5.18. Regular household surveys can improve estimates of household expenditures on health care.
Private spending on health, as recorded in National Health Accounts (NHA) is estimated from the previous
years’ numbers, which themselves are estimates from previous years. Total private spending is estimated
on the basis of a formula that takes into account the country’s GDP, the private sector contribution to the
GDP, national annual consumption, share of household expenditure in the private consumption, and share
of medical care expenditure in total household expenditure, which is drawn from the 2006 Household
Income and Expenditure Survey. NHA estimates of private spending are thus likely to be inaccurate, and
could under- or over-report the actual numbers. Surveys, such as the IHLCA could facilitate more informed
estimates if they could be held on a regular cycle (e.g. every three years or every five years).

5.19. Reporting on aid funded projects also has scope for improvement and stronger enforcement. In
the absence of actual expenditures by development partners, the PER uses inferences based on the
memorandum of understanding (MOU) that each them signs with the International Health Division of
MoH. These MOUs describe multi-year planned activities. Annual spending estimates are estimated by
dividing equally the amount budgeted in the MOU across the years of operation. Expenditures across
different types of health interventions are also inferred from the MOUs. Hence, the budget amount stated
in the MOU can be very different from actual expenditures.

    E. Health Sector Financing

5.20. There are three main sources of health sector financing: public, private and external. Public
funding consists of general government revenues, which are channeled through the budgets of MoH,
other ministries and departments, and CDCs involved in health services; they are also channeled through
the government’s Social Security Scheme. Private funding is mostly out-of-pocket payments made by
households. These are channeled mainly through individuals and households themselves, with a small
amount going through the Social Security Scheme. External funding is mostly from Official Development
Assistance, which is channeled through the government and not-for-profit institutions working in health.
The relationship between financing sources and financing agents in 2011/12 is summarized in Table 5.3.

5.21. Private financing, in particular out-of-pocket payments, has historically been the biggest source
of health sector funding in Myanmar. The share of out-of-pocket payments has fallen from 82 percent in
2009/10 to an estimated 60 percent in 2012/13, due to increased government spending. This remains

high relative to Myanmar’s peers (Figure 5.4). Pharmaceuticals account for 53 percent of total out-of-
pocket spending, followed by curative services at 31 percent, and diagnostic services at 15 percent. In
terms of service providers, hospitals account for 76 percent of out-of-pocket spending, whereas
ambulatory (out-patient) healthcare services account for around 19 percent.

5.22. The government’s share of total spending in health in 2011/12 had been among the lowest in
the region (Figure 5.5). From 2012/13 onward, public financing as a share of total health care spending
has been increasing while the out-of-pocket share has been declining (Figure 5.6). The relative share of
public spending on health increased from 8.5 percent of total spending on health in 2009/10 to 35 percent
in 2012/13 and is expected to go up to 41 percent in 2013/14 (Figure 5.7). The big increase in public
spending came about in 2012/13, when it rose by 260 percent relative to the previous year and increased
the share of public sources from 14 percent in 2011/12 to 35 percent in 2012/13. The share of private
financing of health has fallen over time, from 82 percent in 2009/10 to 79 percent in 2011/12 and 60
percent in 2012/13. Following a further increase in planned spending from public sources, the share of
private out-of-pocket is expected to further fall to 54 percent of total health spending by 2013/14.

5.23. External financing of health services is a relatively small share of total financing at around 5
percent, even though it has been growing in absolute terms. Actual spending may be even higher. Over
80 percent of the external financing (Table 5.3) is channeled through not-for-profit institutions that
provide a range of prevention and curative health services, both in clinics and at the community level.
Their main activities include health education, medical care (prevention and treatment), and distribution
of drugs and other commodities (such as contraceptive pills and condoms). Their main areas of
intervention are: (i) maternal, newborn and child care; (ii) reproductive health; (iii) malaria, tuberculosis,
pneumonia and HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections; and (iv) nutrition. Most spending goes
to preventive care services, which accounted for 81 percent in 2010/11 and 78 percent in 2011/12. As
fiduciary arrangements, policy making and policy monitoring improve within MoH, the donors could be
encouraged to provide their assistance directly through the budget process.

5.24. Myanmar has a Social Security Scheme established in 1956 under the Social Security Act of 1954,
which provides social service benefits including healthcare. The scheme is funded out of employer and
employee contributions (2 percent of salary and, after age 60, 1.5 percent contribution by the employee
and 2.5 percent by the employer). The scheme covers only 650,000 persons, or less than one percent of
the population. As result, the Social Security Fund is a small fraction of total health financing, ranging from
0.15 percent in 2009 to 0.48 percent in 2011.

5.25. A new law enacted in 2012 requires employees of public or private firms with three or more
employees to participate in the scheme, thus broadening coverage. It will also allow formal and informal
sector workers to join the scheme voluntarily. Some benefits are expanded: the sickness cash benefit will
be increased from 50 to 60 percent of wages for 26 weeks and pediatric care will be provided up to the
age of one year. Additional benefits are introduced: family benefit, old age pensions, disability and
survivors’ pensions, unemployment insurance, and housing benefits. The law is to be implemented in
phases over several years. As of April 2014, only the existing branches of social security were covered
(sickness, death, maternity and work injury) but with higher cash benefits than under the 1954 law. As of
April 2014, contributions under the new law include the original 4 percent plus the employer contributes
an additional 1 percent of the worker’s wage which is assigned to an employment injury fund. It is
estimated that full implementation of the new law will require a mandatory contribution equal to 13

5.26. The overall level of spending by the Ministry of Health has risen very sharply since 2011/12,
from 0.2 percent of GDP to 0.9 percent in 2013/14, but continues to remain low compared to other
countries in the region (Figure 5.8). MoH is responsible for three quarters of government spending on
health. Its expenditures have increased over nine-fold from MMK 55.8 billion in 2009/10 (equivalent to
less than $1 per person per year) to around MMK 500 billion in 2013/14 (equivalent to over $8 per person
per year). As a share of total government spending, MoH expenditures on health increased from a little
over 1 percent in 2011/12 to almost 4 percent in 2013/14 (Figure 5.8).

5.27. Capital expenditure, which in 2011/12 constituted around 27 percent of MoH spending, rose
sharply to 51 percent 2012/13 and was one of the big drivers of the overall increase (Figure 5.9). The
share of capital fell back in 2013/14 to 39 percent with a shifting focus towards primary healthcare and
prevention, which requires less capital investment (see section G). With the level increase in capital
spending, there was also a compositional shift away from construction (share falling from 88 percent of
capital expenditure in 2009/10 to 43 percent in 2012/13) towards machinery and equipment (share of
capital spending in 2012/13 was 53 percent). Preliminary findings suggest that this went to expensive
machines (e.g. x-ray machines and CT scanners) in higher-level health facilities such (i.e. mostly hospitals).

5.28. Capital construction expenditure on primary care facilities increased sharply in 2012/13 (Table
5.4). Prior to this, nearly all construction expenditures went to township hospitals and general hospitals.
There was no construction-related expenditure in rural health centers during this period. This changed in
2012/13, when rural health centers’ capital allocation went from zero to 14 percent of the construction
budget. The number of rural health clinics increased from 1,558 in 2010/11 to 1,635 in 2012/13.59 At the
same time, station hospitals, which also deliver primary care, continued to receive about 21 percent of
the construction budget. Construction expenditure of teaching hospitals increased dramatically during

5.29. Pay and allowances have tripled between 2009/10 and 2013/14 due to more hiring and
increased wages and benefits. The largest year-on-year increase took place in 2012/13, when salaries
went up by 83 percent relative to the previous year. One of the measures financed by the budget was a
23 percent salary increase to public sector workers and pensioners intended to reduce the gap between
public sector salaries in Myanmar and peer countries.

5.30. The government also hired more doctors and dentists (Table 5.5). The number of doctors per
1,000 people increased from 0.5 in 2010 to 0.6 in 2012. This remains below the lower-middle-income
average of 0.8 physicians per 1,000 people.60 Available data suggest that the number of nurses and mid-
wives increased as well, but not as quickly as the number of doctors. Thus, the ratio of nurses and mid-
wives to doctors fell from 1.8 to 1.7 between 2010 and 2012. The share of pay and allowances in the
overall MoH budget however fell from above 55 percent in 2009/10 to below 20 percent in 2013/14
because other categories – namely capital and drugs and consumables – increased more sharply over this
period.

5.31. Drugs and medical consumables expenditure has increased most dramatically from MMK 4
billion in 2011/12 to MMK 148 billion in 2013/14. As a share of total MOH spending, drugs and medical
consumables accounted for less than 5 percent in 2011/12, increasing to 30 percent in 2013/14. This sharp
rise is due to three new and progressive health policies aimed at increasing access to affordable
healthcare: (i) introduction of free essential drugs at primary health care facilities; (ii) free health care
services for children under five years of age, pregnant mothers, and patients needing emergency surgery
(first day of hospital admission); and (iii) free essential drugs to children under 5 years in township
hospitals.

                   G. Efficiency of Government Spending on Health

5.32. The allocative efficiency of government spending has potential to improve if more resources
were channeled to programs with strong public goods characteristics.61 Prevention and treatment of
communicable diseases is an example of a public good in health, because it benefits the individual
concerned and also reduces the risks of infection to others.62 Since the public good provider is not
compensated for the positive externality of reducing risk of infection, the private sector would not provide
prevention and treatment of communicable diseases in sufficient quantity in terms of societal welfare.
This would result in allocative inefficiency, which the government needs to address.

5.33. MoH spending on programs with strong public goods characteristics increased, from MMK 3,401
million in 2011/12 to MMK 6,485 million in 2012/13. Examples include programs for nutrition, water and

61
   Allocative efficiency refers to the production of those goods and services that are most desirable for the society,
and is thus concerned with the optimal mix of health goods and services. Goods and services with public goods
characteristics are those that are provided to almost everyone as a matter of policy, such as universal childhood
immunization for all families. A pure public good will provide benefits that cannot be withheld from any member of
the population (a positive externality), such as the reduction in infectious diseases that follows from universal
immunization.
62
   Note, however, prevention and treatment requires excludable inputs, such as vaccination, clean water or
condoms, as well as non-excludable inputs, such as knowledge of preventive interventions. Examples of
communicable diseases include HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis (especially drug-resistant TB), eradicable disease (e.g.
polio), anti-microbial resistant disease, and malaria.

                                                                                                                                        69
sanitation, occupational health, maternal and child health; and programs to fight leprosy, AIDS-STD,
tuberculosis and water-borne diseases. As a proportion of total MoH spending on health, however, the
share of these programs fell from 5.4 percent in 2011/12 to 3.7 percent in 2012/13, declining further to
2.6 percent in 2013/14 (Figure 5.11). Maternal and child health, water-borne diseases, tuberculosis and
leprosy account for over two-third of total spending on these health programs.

5.34. Assessing the adequacy of spending on public goods programs is difficult, but judgments can be
based on relevant outcome indicators. For example, the fact that Myanmar is unlikely to achieve by 2015
its MDG4 target of reducing child mortality to 36 per 1,000 live births and MDG5 target of reducing
maternal mortality to 130 per 100,000 live births, suggests that current levels of public goods expenditures
are not enough. Thus, the government may want to consider increasing significantly public funding of
programs aimed at improving maternal and child health.

5.35. Ensuring adequate preventive care can improve technical efficiency in addition to allocative
efficiency.63 Preventive care can help to eliminate or delay the burden of disease and therefore a higher
health bill linked to curative care. It can also prevent people with minor complaints from flooding the
emergency wards of hospitals. Primary preventions (measures intended to prevent the onset of a
condition) focus on administering immunizations to prevent infectious diseases and modifying unhealthy
behaviors (smoking), and is the focus of study in the PER.64 Expenditures related to prevention services
are recorded in the NHA based on the OECD’s International Classification for Health Accounts functional
classification of health care (ICHA-HC). This classification scheme categorizes the types of goods and



63
   Technical efficiency refers to the physical relationship between resources used to produce health goods and
services—capital, labor, land—and the health outcome, and is achieved when the maximum quantity of an output
is obtained using the minimum quantity of inputs.
64
   Secondary preventions (measures intended to detect disease in clinically asymptomatic people at an early stage
when it is most treatable) focus on reducing the severity of diseases, such as cancer and heart disease, through
screening programs that detect the diseases or their risk factors at early stages, before they become symptomatic
or disabling. Tertiary preventions (measures to slow the progression of a disease after it is clinically obvious and a
diagnosis established) focus on efforts to avoid or defer the complications of diseases after they have developed.

services produced by health care providers and by institutions and actors engaged in related activities to
health care. One such category is that of “preventive and public health services.”

5.36. Preventive care in Myanmar is funded largely through public and external sources. Even though
spending on preventive care from public sources is high, the proportions of total health spending are low
overall.65 Expenditures on preventive care went down from approximately MMK 60 million in 2009/10 to
MMK 55 million in 2011/12, the last year for which this information is available. As a share of total
spending on health, expenditure on preventive care fell from 8.3 percent in 2009/10 to 6.8 percent in
2011/12 (Figure 5.12). The bulk of the spending on preventive care comes from external sources, whose
share of total spending on preventive care went up from 72 percent in 2009/10 to 82 percent in 2011/12.
During this period, the share of preventive care in total public spending went down from about 30 percent
in 2009/10 to 17 percent in 2011/12. Within MoH spending, the share of expenditure on preventive care
declined between 2009/10 and 2011/12, while that of curative and capital expenditures increased (Figure
5.13).

5.37. Four out of the five top causes of premature deaths in 1990 and 2010 were due to preventable
communicable diseases. This warrants more spending on preventive care. Unlike treatment, prevention
faces unique challenges in demonstrating its economic value, even when the health value is apparent. The
basic goal of prevention is to maximize the number of years lived in good health by deferring illness.
However, the economic value of prevention is strengthened by the fact that preventive interventions,
addressing even a single risk factor, can alter the prevalence and severity of a broad range of conditions.
Furthermore, prevention compounds health benefits over time in ways that disease care does not.

5.38. Another potential source of technical efficiency is improvements in the procurement of
pharmaceuticals. In addition, greater consumption of free drugs provided by MOH would significantly
reduce out-of-pocket spending on health. Yet, as noted above, this has proven to be very expensive. The
formulation of a comprehensive policy for the strategic, cost-effective and timely procurement of
pharmaceuticals would allow MoH maintain its policy objective on a more affordable basis.

65
  The expenditures on prevention presented here are under-estimates. This is because many of the services related
to prevention are provided as part of other services and are not specifically recorded as prevention activities. Typical
examples are infant and child care, vaccination services, campaigns and special reproductive health programs.

                                                                                                                                                       71
5.39. Yet another potential source of technical efficiency is improved linkage between recurrent and
capital spending. This can be assessed through very indicative benchmarking. Heller (1991) proposes r-
coefficients, which approximate recurrent costs as proportional to capital cost. For the health sector, the
value of r ranges from 0.27 to 0.71 for rural health centers, 0.17 for urban health centers and 0.11 to 0.30
for hospitals. Another rule of thumb is that building maintenance costs should be 2 to 4 percent of the
replacement cost of the building.66 These are indeed broad indicators, but in practice, some method of
approximation is necessary to budget for project-specific recurrent cost implications.67

5.40. Public spending in Myanmar on health infrastructure and capital goods increased nine-fold from
MMK 23,840 million in 2011/12 to MMK 185,569 million in 2012/13. Maintenance allocations also went
up during this period, doubling from MMK 2,737 million in 2011/12 to MMK 5,518 million in 2012/13 and
then increasing six-fold to MMK 35,800 million in 2013/14. Details of these allocations are not available,
but the 23 percent set aside of maintenance charges in 2012/13 relative to capital spending in 2011/12
(appropriately lagged by one year) suggests that budgetary implications of increases in capital spending
are being taken into account. Maintenance charges in 2011/12 were only 12 percent of capital spending
in the previous year. This would need to be analyzed in greater depth.

     H. Equity in Government Spending on Health

5.41. The gap between spending on urban and rural facilities increased between 2009/10 and
2013/14. This outcome risks exacerbating inequalities in health status and access discussed in section C
above. Urban centers accounted for about two-thirds of total public spending on health in 2011/12.
Teaching hospitals, state and division hospitals, specialist hospitals, and township hospitals are located in
urban areas. Station hospitals, secondary health centers, and rural health centers are located in rural areas
(Table 5.6).68 Despite increased attention to rural facilities discussed above, the share of expenditures
going to urban health facilities went from 67 percent in 2009/10 to 70 percent in 2013/14, with a
concurrent decrease for rural health facilities.

5.42. Healthcare seeking behavior and expenditure on healthcare across quintiles suggests that
wealthier households seek more healthcare than the poor (Table 5.7). On average 8.5 percent of the
population reports any illness or injury, with fewer among the poorest quintile reporting illness. On
average, 78 percent of those reporting an illness or injury seek care, but there are huge differences in
health care seeking between the poorest (67.3 percent) and the richest (87.4 percent) quintiles. Out-of-
pocket spending varies significantly across income quintiles, with the richest 20 percent spending over six

   Some research suggests that a dollar of investment may frequently yield as little as 50 cents worth of capital. The
reasons are various, and include poor project selection and implementation, diminishing returns arising from
bottlenecks during investment surges, as well as outright corruption. Thus, public investment ceases to be
productive if inefficiency, waste, or corruption leave behind a trail of poorly executed and ineffective projects and
distort the impact of public spending on capital accumulation,. For an index of public investment efficiency, together
with selected country-specific scores, see: Dabla-Norris, E., J. Brumby, A. Kyobe, Z. Mills, and C. Papageorgiu (2011)

   Note that only current expenditures (Form 2, collected by the Ministry of Finance) can be disaggregated to the
health facility level. Capital expenditures (collected by the Ministry of National Planning and Economic Development)
cannot be disaggregated to the health facility level. Most drug-related expenditures are also not disaggregated to
the facility level, since most drugs are procured centrally through the Central Medical Store Depot.

times compared to the poorest. The difference is most pronounced in expenditure on medicines (nine

5.43. Benefit incidence analysis suggests that government spending on health is weakly progressive
in that it helps to close the gap between the rich and the poor. Table 5.8 compares the distribution of
public expenditures with population shares and presents cumulative quintile shares of the service-specific
subsidies and for the total public spending across all services. The data shows that the poorest quintile’s
share of public expenditures is less than 20 percent for general, specialized and station hospitals but very
close to 20 percent for ambulatory care. At higher quintiles, the cumulative public expenditures shares
are lower than the respective population shares for general and specialized hospitals, but higher for
station hospitals and facilities providing ambulatory care.

5.44. Households face a real risk of incurring large medical care expenditures if any member falls ill
due to the absence of any prepayment mechanisms, such as health insurance. Not only does this disrupt
the material living standards of the household, it is also potentially impoverishing and catastrophic. For
many households in Myanmar, most of the budget resources are allocated to food and other items
essential for sustenance, leaving very little to spend for health care. A common approach to measure the
size of this problem is to define catastrophic expenditures in relation to expenditures net of basic

a. Benefit Incidence Analysis describes the distribution of public spending across individuals ranked by their living standards.
The methodology and approach used for this analysis is derived from O'Donnell et al. (2008). Public spending data is obtained
from NHA 2009/10. Utilization of public facilities is derived from IHLCA survey. The survey distinguishes between public and
private care for all provider categories. Unit costs are obtained by dividing aggregate expenditures by the weighted sum of
utilization reported in the IHLCA survey data, where weights are expansion factors indicating how many individuals in the
population are represented by each sample observation.
b. Dominance tests: – indicates the 45° line/Lorenz curve dominates the concentration curve; + indicates concentration curve
dominates 45° line/Lorenz curve; blank indicates non-dominance.

5.45. Catastrophic payments are defined for health payments as a share of both total household
expenditure and non-food expenditure, using various threshold budget shares. As the threshold is
dropped from 25 percent to 5 percent of total expenditure, the estimate of the number of people who
suffer adversely increases from 7.6 percent to 35.6 percent of the population. At the same time, the
average degree by which payments (as a proportion of total expenditure) exceed the threshold as a
proportion of total expenditure – or intensity – increases from 3.5 percent to 6.7 percent of expenditure.
Those spending more than 5 percent of total expenditure on health care spent, on average, 23.9 percent
of their total expenditure on health. Likewise, those spending more than 25 percent of the household
budget on health care spent, on average, 70.7 percent of their total expenditure on health.

5.46. Catastrophic health care costs are a high share of household spending, regardless of how they
are measured. Table 5.9 also reports the headcount (incidence) and intensity of catastrophic payments
for health defined as a share of non-food expenditure. As expected, both the headcount and intensity are
higher for a given threshold when catastrophic payments are defined with respect to health payment
relative to non-food expenditure. For instance, for about 20 percent of households, health spending was
40 percent of non-food expenditure, but only 10 percent of total expenditure. At the threshold level of 25
percent, these households spend 94 percent of their non-food expenditure on health care. For the 18

significant borrowing or dis-saving to finance health care.

    I. Conclusions and Recommendations

5.47. The government’s policies and budget on health went through a major transition in 2012/13.
The Union government introduced policies to improve access to and affordability of healthcare services.
More medical personnel have been hired. Beginning in 2012/13, essential drugs and selected health care
services are provided free of charge to children, pregnant mothers and for patients needing emergency
surgery under certain circumstances in some facilities. There are early signs that this is beginning to help
reduce prohibitive out-of-pocket payments by households. This policy, however, has caused a dramatic
increase in expenditure on drugs and medical consumables. Further costs have been incurred due to
wage increases and heavy investments in facilities and equipment. These policies have been financed
through a nine-fold increase in MoH spending on health between 2009/10 and 2013/14.

5.48. Ongoing challenges include constraints on policy making and monitoring due to unreliable and
incomplete data, and high costs due to expenditure inefficiencies. In the medium-term, the government
may also want to consider options to increase equity public service provision including more rural primary
care and better financial protection policies. This chapter recommended a number of options to help
strengthen policy making and monitoring, improve the efficiency of MoH expenditures and make the
provision of health care more equitable. These are summarized below.




                                                                                                                 75

outcomes would be helped by         Short-term: MoH could require development partners, private and
stronger analytical capacity and    not-for-profit institutions financing or delivering health services to
access to better information.       provide annual data on health spending by function and use.
                                    Medium-term: MoH could further develop its analytical capacity.
                                    Medium-term: As fiduciary arrangements, policy making and policy
                                    monitoring improve within MoH, the donors could be encouraged to
                                    provide their assistance directly through the budget process.

    A SOUND FISCAL FRAMEWORK FOR

6   SUB-NATIONAL SERVICE DELIVERY
    Background: Myanmar has embarked on a transition from a centralized to a decentralized
    system of government based on its 2008 Constitution. New institutions of sub-national
    governance are slowly being established but, as yet, with limited authority.

    Objectives: This chapter provides an assessment of intergovernmental fiscal relations over
    the period 2009/10 through 2014/15 and suggests options for prioritizing administrative and
    fiscal reforms.

    Key findings: The 2008 Constitution provides the overarching framework for sub-national
    administration in Myanmar. Initial steps have been taken to establish legislative and
    executive bodies at State and Region level.

    There are functional tensions between newly established sub-national institutions and
    traditional arrangements of central control. This could lead to confusion over management
    of, and accountability for, public services. Accountability for service delivery will improve
    when results monitoring is systematic and publicly reported.

    States/Regions have little impact on public sector borrowing because their expenditures are
    budgeted to match the sum of expected revenues and Union transfers. Most functional
    responsibilities in the 2008 Constitution are assigned to the Union government, with smaller
    and more localized responsibilities assigned to States/Regions. The sub-national spending
    share in 2013/14 was therefore small (7 percent of public sector budget). A relatively large
    portion of State/Region spending is used for capital investment. Per-capita spending by
    States/Regions is weakly correlated with poverty incidence.

    Revenue assignments to States/Regions are limited (6 percent of public sector revenue).
    Own-source revenues collected by States/Regions financed 36 percent of total expenditures
    in 2013/14, the remaining 64 percent was financed from Union transfers. The distribution of
    own-source revenues is uneven: 68 percent of own-source revenues in 2013/14 were
    collected in Yangon and Mandalay. The burden of State/Region revenue is moderately
    progressive when comparing revenue collection per-capita to poverty incidence.

    Intergovernmental fiscal transfers have grown rapidly in the past three years but the lack of
    a rules-based system for determining general-purpose grants has made them ad hoc and
    unpredictable on a year-to-year basis.

    Recommended options: (i) strengthen accountability of public administration to new
    institutions of sub-national governance by clarifying lines of authority of GAD officials to
    locally elected State/Region authorities; (ii) improve accountability for service delivery by
    introducing a systematic performance monitoring and evaluation framework to be designed
    and developed under the leadership of GAD in partnership with sector ministries ; (iii) develop
    and adopt a policy on functional and expenditure assignments; (iv) develop and adopt a
    policy on State/Region revenues with options for potential sub-national revenue autonomy;
    and (v) adopt a simple formula-based system of intergovernmental fiscal transfers.

CHAPTER 6 FISCAL FRAMEWORK FOR SUB-
NATIONAL SERVICE DELIVERY
     A. Background

6.1.     Myanmar has embarked on a transition from a centralized to a decentralized system of
government based on its 2008 Constitution. The objective is to improve the responsiveness, quality and
efficiency of service delivery. Steps have been taken to establish sub-national legislatures, engage local
authorities in budget allocations, and increase fiscal transfers to States and Regions. The government is
engaging in reforms to strengthen policies and institutions of intergovernmental relations. This is a
complex policy agenda involving many stakeholders and requiring careful coordination and sequencing of
reforms.

6.2.    The PER looks at options for prioritizing administrative and fiscal reforms. It summarizes sub-
national administration in Myanmar and analyzes the main pillars of fiscal decentralization, namely: what
government functions and expenditures are assigned to whom; what local receipts help to fund those
assignments; and on what basis are Union transfers helping to close fiscal gaps. The PER proposes options
to strengthen current policies and institutions, and discusses their coordination and sequencing. The
chapter ends with a brief review of sub-national budget preparation and implementation.

     B. Sub-national Administration in Myanmar

6.3.    The 2008 Constitution provides the overarching framework for sub-national administration and
decentralization in Myanmar. Prior to this, central authorities undertook all government functions and
managed all public resources across the country. The 2008 Constitution sets a vision of decentralized self-
government within a strong national framework. This is elaborated in the 2012 Framework for Economic
and Social Reforms (FESR), which calls for a comprehensive decentralization policy, underpinned by new
laws and regulations to support increasing autonomy of State and Regions.70 New institutions of self-
government at State/Region level have been active for approximately two years. The decentralization
experience to date therefore is at its infancy. The future shape and direction of relations between sub-
national units of government and the Union level have been core parts of Myanmar’s ongoing peace
process, aimed at finding an end to the multiple conflicts with ethnic armed groups that have affected
Myanmar since independence.

6.4.    Four different types of sub-national government under the Union are recognized in the 2008
Constitution (Figure 6.1). These include: 7 States, 7 Regions,71 six self-administered areas (SAA),72 and

   States and Regions are constitutionally equivalent. Regions were formally known as divisions and have been
historically populated by an ethnic Bamar majority. They include: Ayeyarwady, Bago, Magway, Mandalay, Sagaing,
Tanintharyi and Yangon. States, which were historically recognized and named for their ethnic minority dominated
populations, include Chin, Kachin, Kayah, Kayin, Mon, Rakhine and Shan.
72
   There are 6 SAAs including 4 self-administered zones and 1 self-administered division in Shan state, and one self-
administered zone in Sagaing region. They are areas that have been engaged in civil conflict and are equivalent to
States and Regions under the Constitution, in that they may form their own assembly comprising elected and

one Union territory (Nay Pyi Taw). Levels below States/Regions serve primarily as deconcentrated units
of central government and are not regarded as independent sub-national authorities. They include 67
Districts that form States and Regions, and 325 Townships that form districts. Townships are further
divided into towns, villages and urban wards, but with limited governance structure.

6.5.     The 14 States and Regions each have their own legislatures (hluttaws). These include a mix of
elected representatives from particular groups (e.g. 2 from each township, representatives from each
ethnic groups with more than 0.1 percent of the Union population), and appointed representatives (e.g.
one third representation from defense services). The State/Region executive is headed by a Chief Minister
(appointed by the Union President) who appoints a Cabinet. The latter lead up to 12 sub-national
ministries that, in turn, have up to 21 departments and State Economic Enterprises (SEEs). Sub-national
ministries are part of the new structure and therefore not yet fully functional. The land mass and
population of each State and Region varies significantly from around 10,000 Km2 to 155,000 km2 and from
0.5 million to just over 7 million people. Population density is relatively low across most States and Regions
(14 to 214 people per km2) except for Yangon (638 km2). See Figure 6.2.

appointed officials. They are headed by a chairperson appointed by the Union President. They may propose annual

6.6.    Accountability for service delivery would be more effective with greater clarity about
subsidiarity between the various levels of government. For example, although the Union could design
routes for municipal bus services, municipalities could do the job as efficiently and with greater
accountability to the local populations being served. The 2008 Constitution recognizes the three branches
of sovereign power (executive, legislative and judicial) as being shared between the Union, Regions, States
and SAAs.73
6.7.      Central government however retains a strong role, which is consistent with a unitary system.
At the same time, unitary systems typically have relatively strong local governments (i.e. township and
district level) in terms of raising revenue and delivering services; regional governments (i.e. states and
regions) focus mostly on coordination and intra-regional issues. Myanmar seems to be moving in the
direction of a stronger regional role. Under a unitary system, this arrangement could pose risks that would
need to be managed. These include: centralization within States/Regions (i.e. bloated regional
administration, lack of delegation to local authorities), and lack of progress on redistributive or other
development policies of central government. There has been mention of potentially moving to a federalist
structure, though this would require even stronger sub-national legislative and executive capacity.

6.8.     Public administration at the sub-national level retains strong centralized features from the pre-
2008 period. Prime among these is the role played by the General Administration Department (GAD) of
the Ministry of Home Affairs (MoHA). Centrally appointed senior GAD officials serve as Executive Secretary
of the Office of the State or Region, and are responsible for coordinating between State/Region ministries
and departments. This Executive Secretary is appointed by the MoHA, and reports upwards to the Union
level ministry, although in theory this position is also meant to report to the Chief Minister. The GAD is
responsible for administration at the township level, coordinating efforts of central line agencies such as
the ministries of health and education as well as directly providing services through deconcentrated
central line agencies (e.g. land registration, tax collection).

6.9.      The creation of new sub-national institutions alongside older, centralized agencies is
contributing to challenges in establishing management and accountability for services at sub-national
level. The establishment of State/Region level legislative and executive bodies represents a significant
move towards greater autonomy and accountability to local citizens. By contrast, centrally appointed
officials are not directly accountable to regional or local elected representatives for their performance.
Although there are State/Region level cabinet positions with specific responsibilities for service delivery,
the capacity to develop and execute policies is at a nascent stage. GAD performs the secretariat function
to these new Ministers but GAD officers are upwardly accountable to the MoHA rather than to the
State/Region Minister. This significantly impairs the ability of sub-national governments to manage staff,
execute policies and hold officials accountable for their performance.

6.10. Options for addressing management and accountability issues by effectively managing this
transition should be considered early. As a start, line agencies should coordinate with and be
accountable to sub-national government. Currently there are no formal mechanisms allowing
State/Region executive and legislative branches to have meaningful input on the central provision of key
public services in their area. There are two possible solutions but each involves making some trade-offs.
One option is to reassign all GAD staff from the Office of the States and Regions to the direct supervision
and control of the state or region executive (with checks and balances held by the state or region
parliament). Under this option, the position of Executive Secretary of the Office of the States and Regions

would be directly accountable to the Chief Minister, who would have power to hire, fire, discipline, or
reward as necessary. The existing Government Office and Parliament Office would continue to provide
support to the executive and the parliament respectively; however, staff under the General
Administration Office would be reassigned to the state and region ministerial portfolios. This would
maintain existing capacity but it could also require a potentially difficult transfer of loyalties. The second
option would be to refocus existing GAD staff on coordination between the Union level government and
state and region governments, instead of day-to-day operations, and to permit states and regions to hire
and manage their own individual administrations. The existing cadre of Municipal Officers could serve as
a foundation for this new sub-national public administration. This option would entail a significant
capacity development effort and time.

6.11. If deconcentrated line agencies remain the primary service providers at sub-national level over
the medium-term, then the government could also adopt a system of dual subordination. This would
mean upward accountability to the central line agency, as well horizontally to the State/Region. The
President has proposed regulatory changes that would move the system in this direction. The proposed
changes would allow States/Regions to compile performance evaluation forms for line agency officials at
the State/Region level, and submit these evaluations to the Union government. Such a system has been
used effectively in Pakistan following the promulgation of their local government law, and is being
considered in Thailand.

    C. Fiscal Developments

6.12. Public sector borrowing was not affected much by the fiscal performance of the states and
regions. This is because the overall balances of each state and region had been kept close to zero. The
overall balance for all states and regions as a share of GDP was a surplus of 0.06 percent in 2012/13 PA
and deficit of 0.003 percent of GDP in 2013/14 RE. The authorities achieved this by ensuring that
budgeted expenditures would closely match expected revenues, as illustrated in Table 6.1 below. Total
budgeted expenditures in 2012/13 BE and 2013/14 BE were very close to 100 percent of budgeted
revenues and transfers. The only exceptions were Kayin and Yangon in 2012/13.

6.13. The authorities ensured that actual expenditures were also kept very close to actual revenues
and transfers, as shown in Table 6.2 for 2012/13 PA and 2013/14 RE. Total spending by all states and
regions as a share of total revenues and transfers was 96 percent in 2012/13 PA and 100 percent in
2013/14 RE. This was achieved by adjusting Union transfers to the states and regions when actual
revenues plus budgeted transfers were insufficient to cover expenditures. This is illustrated in Table 6.2
below. For example, in 2012/13, actual revenues collected by Kayin plus budgeted transfers were only 53
percent of budgeted revenues and transfers. The authorities therefore increased transfers to compensate
for the missing 47 percent. This implies that actual Union transfers will often deviate from budgeted
amounts.

equity across states and regions.

    D. Expenditure Decentralization

6.15. Functional and sub-functional responsibilities of different levels of government are laid out in
Schedule One (Union), Schedule Two (States/Regions) and Schedule Three (SAAs) of the 2008
Constitution. Major public services are either exclusively or primarily the responsibility of the Union

                                                                                                                     82
government. These include education, public health, infrastructure, energy production and distribution,
resource extraction and processing, and social welfare. This suggests that, as per the Constitution, the
Union government could deconcentrate responsibilities, though it may be difficult to devolve them
completely. State/Region responsibilities are mostly confined to localized, small-scale services. (See
Annex 3 for a summary.) The newly established ministerial portfolios at the State/Region level do not align
perfectly with those of central ministries. This has created overlaps that need to be addressed, especially
if the authorities are intending to develop a system of dual subordination.

6.16. State/Region expenditure as a share of overall public sector expenditure is unsurprisingly low
relative to international comparators (Figure 6.3). Since Myanmar is still in the very early stages of
decentralization, States/Regions accounted for approximately 7.1 percent and 7.4 percent of public sector
expenditure in 2012/13 and 2013/14 respectively. Budgeted State/Region expenditure for 2014/15 grew
to approximately 11 percent, inclusive of spending out of transfers from the Union government. The
average across other countries in the 1972 – 2000 period is closer to 25 percent. In 2013/14, 64 percent
of sub-national government spending (excluding SEEs) was financed out of transfers from the Union due
to low local receipts.74 The level of dependence on transfers across other countries in the 1972-2000
period is closer to 35 percent (Figure 6.4).

6.17. The economic composition of sub-national expenditure varies significantly across
States/Regions.75 In general, however, capital spending as a ratio of State/Region budgets is large, with
12 of 14 States/Regions spending at least 40 percent of their budgets on capital (Figure 6.5). Interestingly,
the two States with highest poverty incidence, Rakhine and Chin, have very different shares of capital and
recurrent expenditure. This may reflect the composition of Union expenditure in those States, but there
is likely little coordination between levels, so this would need further separate analysis to explain the
differences.

6.18. The share of wages and salaries in State/Region budgets is low, at an unweighted average of 14
percent. This outcome is almost certainly explained by the Union’s dominance in service delivery. This is
likely to change as sub-national legislative and executive bodies get fully established, particularly if more
functional responsibilities are assigned to sub-national authorities. Going forward, it will be important to
balance the need for more staff for service delivery against the need for more staff for general
administration.

6.19. Budget execution rates for expenditures were close to 100 percent for most states and regions.
A few States/Regions overspent, notably Kayin, Sagaing and Yangon (Figure 6.6). This was made possibly
mainly because of higher than expected revenues. Very few States/Regions underspent: Shan deeply
underspent in 2012/13 while there was some minor under-spending by Kachin in 2012/13 and Magway
in 2013/14. This was generally the consequence of less than expected revenues.

6.20. The level of per-capita spending across States/Regions seems weakly correlated with poverty
levels (Figure 6.7). The correlation improved between 2012/13 and 2013/14, moving from 0.36 to 0.47.
Expenditures in poorer States/Regions with low population density are expected to play a bigger role due
to higher service needs and costs of delivering those services. Chin for example, has high poverty incidence
and low population density, which has translated into high per-capita spending. This was thanks to higher
transfers, the overall redistribution effect of which is discussed in section F. Two States/Regions with
lower incidence of poverty (Kayah and Yangon) appear to be outliers with large per-capita spending. A
fuller picture of per-capita spending and poverty links would be required to determine whether
expenditures and transfers for these outliers should be modified. Moreover, any analysis is incomplete
without full knowledge of what the Union government spends in each state and region. Such spending
could usefully augment expenditures in States/Regions with particularly low capacity for public service
delivery.

6.21. Greater decentralization of functional and spending assignments could potentially improve
prioritization and outcomes of service delivery, but this needs to be systematic and based on clear
principles. Assigning functional responsibility to different levels of government can be seen at two levels.
The first is the assignment of the actual government function (e.g. education) or sub-function (e.g. primary
education). Secondly, for each function or sub-function, there should be clarity on who is assigned
responsibility for specific tasks such as: (i) policies, standards, oversight (e.g. which level of government is
responsible in primary education for policies on education curriculum, standards on student/teacher
ratio, oversight of policy implementation); (ii) provision and administration (e.g. which level of
government is responsible for recruitment and performance management of teachers); (iii) production
and distribution (e.g. which level of government is responsible for contracting the services of the private
sector to provide school meals).

6.22. Some functions should exclusively be the responsibility of central government (e.g. defense or
foreign policy) as these are national in scope. Other government functions and sub-functions can be
shared or concurrent across different levels of government (e.g. both central and sub-national authorities

                                                                                                                                               85
responsible for tertiary education). Generally, functions should be decentralized to the lowest level of
government that is fully capable of performing those functions and ensuring responsiveness to citizen
needs. For shared/concurrent functions, however, only one level of government should be responsible
for each of the tasks noted above within a particular jurisdiction (e.g. in one district, only one level of
government should be involved in provision of primary education) to avoid overlap and coordination
costs. Usually, regulation of service delivery (i.e. policies, standards, and oversight) is assigned centrally
to ensure adequate access and quality across the country. The provision of services and administration is
often decentralized.

6.23. The decision on what functions and tasks to assign to different levels can be based on several
considerations. These include: economies of scale (whether more centralized provision is more efficient);
externalities (if an activity in one area affects another area, a higher level may be best suited); equity (if
equal access is a priority, centralized provision may be better); and variation in needs (if people have
different requirements and preferences, lower levels could better address these variations).76

6.24. A policy on functional and expenditure assignments based on the above principles and
provisions in the 2008 Constitution would be beneficial to all stakeholders. When developing such a
policy, it would be helpful to be clear about any exclusive responsibilities assigned to a particular level of
government. For exclusive assignments, one order of government is responsible for regulation, financing
and service delivery. Secondly, the policy can elaborate on which functions and sub-functions can be
shared between the Union and States/Regions. The 2008 Constitution would suggest that although the
central government retains responsibility for most major functions, it still has the option to deconcentrate
and therefore share some responsibilities to States/Regions. Actual decentralization can be asymmetric
(i.e. States/Regions with more capacity can have greater decentralization). Thirdly for each of the shared
functions, the policy should elaborate on responsibilities for regulation, standards, oversight; provision
and administration; and production and distribution. Fourthly the policy can lay out options for adopting,
implementing and monitoring some of these measures.

       E. Fiscal Transfers

6.25. Intergovernmental fiscal transfers increased from 0.6 percent of GDP in 2011/12 to 1.2 percent
of GDP in 2011/12, and 2.3 percent of GDP in 2014/15.77 These transfers account for the majority of
States/Regions revenues. In 2013/14, transfers accounted for 64 percent of total receipts collected by
the states and regions (excluding financial receipts). Transfers from the Union government can be
grouped under two broad categories: (i) grants for State/Region authorities, which are similar to general
purpose transfers; and (ii) development funds (e.g. poverty, township development), which are similar to
conditional transfers.

6.26. Fiscal transfers do more than provide extra resources; they have also helped equalize the
distribution of per-capita receipts across States/Regions. Equal per-capita revenues per jurisdiction can
be visualized as a 45-degree diagonal line, as depicted in the Lorenz curves in Figure 6.8.78 Inequality can

  Loans to States/Regions should be recorded as financial receipts.

  A fuller measure of equalization can be defined in terms of the ability of each State/Region to provide reasonably
comparable levels of public service at reasonably comparable tax burdens. While there is insufficient data to support

be visualized as curves below the diagonal line. Per-capita own-source current receipts are unequally
distributed across States/Regions, as discussed earlier. This inequality is exacerbated with the addition of
large capital receipts collected mainly by wealthy Yangon and Mandalay. The bottom four quintiles
collected only 44 percent of all revenues in 2013/14 while the top quintile collected 56 percent (Figure
6.8). The addition of intergovernmental transfers increases the share of the bottom four quintiles to 55
percent and reduces the share of total per-capita revenues held by the top quintile to 45 percent. This
analysis should be considered preliminary: a more complete analysis should also include direct Union
financing of services across States/Regions.

6.27. The process for determining general-purpose grants begins with States/Regions’ budget
proposals. These are reviewed and approved by the State/Region parliament before being forwarded to
the Finance Commission, which recommends the level of transfers. These are consolidated into the Union
budget that is submitted to the Union Parliament, which makes the final decision.

6.28. The lack of a rules-based system for determining general-purpose grants has made them ad hoc
and unpredictable on a year-to-year basis. The rapid growth in transfers between 2011/12 and 2014/15
was not supported by an analysis of costs in providing services, nor by any formal rules. The multiple
reviews and approvals needed at Union level creating delays in communicating the approved level of
transfers to States/Regions. In some instances, transfers were only confirmed one month after the start
of the new fiscal year. This jeopardizes any attempt at bottom-up planning and budget preparation, even
for a limited set of functional and expenditure assignments.

6.29. The states and regions would benefit from the development of a simple, transparent and
formula-based system of general-purpose grants to encourage sound budget management by the
nascent institutions of States/Regions. Ordinarily, a system of general-purpose transfers to sub-national
authorities would aim to enhance the ability of each State/Region to provide reasonably comparable
levels of public service. This could be based on a formula that helps estimate fiscal capacity on the one
hand (i.e. based on estimations of own-source revenue collections) and spending needs on the other (e.g.


such an analysis for Myanmar, anecdotal evidence suggests major disparities in service delivery quality and access
across states and regions.

                                                                                                                                                87
based on criteria that help assess the level of development and performance in delivery of services
assigned to the State/Region). The gap between the two would be the level of transfers.

6.30. It is strongly recommended to keep the approach as simple as possible, given States/Regions’
evolving and very limited revenue and expenditure responsibilities at this stage. Since the majority of
services in States/Regions are still provided directly by the Union authorities, the transfer system at the
moment would not in itself have a major impact on overall level of public service delivery in the
States/Regions. It would nonetheless impact significantly on the key economic services, and some social
services. While these may still be marginal and supplementary to Union level provision of services at
State/Region level, it is critical to embed early the principles of transparency, equalization, and
predictability in the transfer system.

6.31. The government could consider two possible options on formulae for general-purpose grants.
The first would aim to fill the horizontal gap between fiscal capacity and spending needs across
States/Provinces. This would be different to the current arrangement because spending needs would be
estimated ex ante across all State/Regions on a consistent basis drawing on specified criteria (i.e. rather
than simply using the State/Region budget estimates). Since most of the State/Region expenditure
assignments are for economic services, the criteria for estimating spending needs could be simple
indicators of: (i) economic development (e.g. spending needs are inversely proportional per-capita GDP);
equalization (e.g. spending needs are directly proportional to population); and (iii) efficiency (e.g.
spending needs are inversely proportional to population density or share of State/Region that is rural).

6.32. A second option for general-purpose grants would be for the authorities to apply the formula
on a predetermined pool of Union resources. Under this option, instead of having to determine the fiscal
gap for each State/Region, the government may decide to increase the overall pool of transfers each year
by a certain percentage, then apply the above criteria for each State/Region to determine their share of
that pool. One possible advantage of the second option is that it may create less incentive to
underestimate State/Region revenue and thereby inflate the size of the needed transfers. As discussed
earlier, underestimation of revenue seems to be an ongoing problem, e.g. actual revenues have often
been over-realized in comparison to original estimates.

6.33. A clear policy for what happens to over-realized revenues would be useful. If States/Regions are
allowed to retain the over-realized revenue to spend at their discretion, this could lead to consistent
underestimation. Conversely, if they are not allowed to retain the over-realized revenue, then it could
discourage local revenue effort. Balance is needed. These issues would need to be monitored closely as
the transfer system evolves.

6.34. Development funds are another type of transfers. These are aimed at promoting national
objectives such as poverty reduction fund or township development. For FY2014/15, development funds
were around 5 percent of total transfers. The poverty reduction fund totaled around some 50,000 million
kyats, and was divided on the basis of poverty incidence rates, with 15,000 million each for Rakhine and
Kachin States, 5,000 million for Shan state, and the remaining 15,000 million divided equally amongst
states and regions. The constituency/township development fund grant represented some 33,000 million
kyats, and was allocated equally across townships.

6.35. As capacity grows, Myanmar could consider turning the development funds into output-
oriented grants to link transfers to results. These grants aim to promote sub-national autonomy by giving
managers the freedom to make spending decisions consistent with local conditions and priorities, while

                                                                                                        88
also preserving accountability by making transfers conditional on delivery of results – typically in the form
of some national minimum standards for service delivery in the particular area. Good access to reliable
and timely information on service delivery performance is required – as such, introduction of such grants
may be a medium term consideration for Myanmar, and may exist as part of a suite of reforms to improve
public sector accountability.

6.36. Myanmar could also consider capital transfers to help address infrastructure deficiencies across
the country. These could be awarded based on centrally planned criteria – for example, proximity of
villages or townships to certain categories of roads, schools within defined distance from residents.
Currently, capital needs are articulated on a project-by-project basis through bottom up planning.
However, there is a risk more developed States/Regions end up attracting a larger share of the total pool
of capital resources because they have more capacity to develop and articulate proposals and capital
needs. In such cases, a formula based capital transfer program may prove more effective in promoting
relatively comparable access to capital infrastructure both within and across different States/Regions.

    F. Sub-National Planning and Public Finance Management

6.37. Sub-national planning and public financial management capacity will be central to effective
implementation of the above policies. The preparation of State/Region plans and budgets is conducted
in parallel. Planning Departments in the States/Regions are meant to coordinate the preparation of 5-year
plans and the investment budget, while State/Region Budget Departments prepare the recurrent budget
and coordinate the overall budget. In reality, institutional responsibilities are more blurred and depend in
big part on capacity across States/Regions.

6.38. Annual plans in Myanmar are based on production targets in different sectors of the economy.
These are determined by iteration between the Planning Departments and Union level ministries. There
is often considerable divergence between the ‘bottom up‘ estimates of states and regions and the ’top
down’ estimates of the Union ministries. The key formal mechanism for reconciling these differences is
through the Planning Commission, which includes both Union and State/Region representation. Annual
plans however have scope for improvement if they are to better inform budget allocations. The plans
should cover the policies and activities that require financing through State/Region budget and should
explain how these policies and activities can help achieve the State/Region’s development objectives that
cannot be performed by the private sector.

6.39. Budget preparation is led by the MoF Budget Department, which starts the process in August
through issuance of budget circulars, including to States/Regions. State/Region Budget Departments
coordinate the process at sub-national level. Each sub-national ministry/department submits budget
estimates to the Budget Department based on standard guidelines and forms. Budgets are prepared on
an incremental basis rather than informed by plans and policies. Allocations down to districts and
township offices are managed at the budget execution stage with no budget ceilings agreed prior to
budget approval. Ministries/departments are also at liberty to make changes to allocations during the
course of the financial year (e.g. moving budgeted funds from one township to another). There is also no
parliamentary oversight of how funds will be allocated down to district and township level.

6.40. Budgets are first scrutinized by State/Region Finance Ministers before going to budget vetting
committees chaired by Vice President 2. Budgets are then submitted to the Union Financial Commission
chaired by the President with the Minister of Finance acting as Secretary. Chief Ministers from all the states


                                                                                                           89
and regions are members, as well as the Vice Presidents, the Auditor General, the Attorney and the
Chairperson of Nay Pyi Taw Council. The next stage is submission of State/Region budgets for approval to
the Union level parliament. Only after being approved by the Union hluttaw are budgets finalized and
submitted to state and region hluttaws, which play a very limited role in influencing budget decisions.

6.41. States/Regions are calling for more influence over sub-national budgeting. At present,
States/Regions lack authority to influence Union-level service provision in their jurisdiction. Even for
functional responsibilities assigned to States/Regions, budget allocations are agreed at the Union level
and there is limited scope for States/Regions to reallocate resources between their
ministries/departments. Responsibility for key decisions that might influence budgetary allocations has
also not been decentralized: for example, the recruitment of additional staff would require approval from
the Union. Capital and recurrent budget preparation are managed through separate processes and as
such there is limited scope to reallocate resources from one to the other. Authorities therefore have little
control over ensuring an appropriate balance between capital investment and the necessary recurrent
expenditures to use those assets productively.

6.42. Budget execution procedures are similar to those in place at the Union level. All expenditure
financed through State/Region budgets is meant to take place through accounts held at Myanmar
Economic Bank (MEB). Once the budget has been approved, responsibility for authorization for spending
(within approved budgetary allocations) passes to MEB. Expenditures are controlled using the same
system of quarterly ‘drawing limits’ that is in place at the Union level.79 State/Region offices of MEB are
responsible for administering these controls. Each spending unit80 that receives funds through state and
regional budgets holds an individual account at their local MEB branch for making payments. Payments
from accounts held at the MEB are made using bank cheques or cash. It is then the responsibility of the
spending units to make payments and to record those transactions.

6.43. Accounting and financial reporting are based on Union financial regulations. Financial
statements are prepared on a monthly basis and show cash payments and receipts as well as movements
in cash balances. Responsibility for preparing financial reports is highly decentralized. Each spending unit
is responsible for submitting monthly accounts to respective departments. The finance sections in each
department compile information and prepare a summary report to be submitted to the State/Region
Budget Department. State/Region offices of MEB compile a consolidated monthly bank statement for
each department in their state or region. These statements are then submitted to State/Region budget
departments for reconciliation with the financial reports that are submitted by the finance sections of
each state and regional departments. Once financial reports and bank statements have been reconciled,
State/Region Budget Departments forward the information to the Union Budget Department.

6.44. State/Region accounts are audited by the deconcentrated Offices of Auditor General (OAG). The
OAG submits the audited reports to the respective hluttaw, where the findings and recommendations are
discussed and reports are approved. Recommendations are sent back to each ministry with guidance on
improvements. An example from the FY12-13 Audit Report recommends that civil servants taking annual
leave of more than 10 days should not be paid for extra days. Internal audit mechanisms are established
in some state and region departments (e.g. Mandalay region Construction Department), but this is not
uniform in across the country. The scope of internal audit is limited to basic financial audit.

79
  See World Bank (2013), Public Financial Management Performance Report for further details.
80
  Within each department, there may be a number of spending units (also called primary accounting units). Certain
departments have offices at district and township level, each of which would constitute a spending unit.

                                                                                                              90
6.45. The current lack of transparency surrounding State/Region budgets inhibits linkages between
the local priorities of citizens and the allocations that are approved by State/Region parliaments. There
have been some progress on transparency of the Union budget in recent years. The draft budget law
presented to parliament is now routinely published in the national press,81 which shows the size of
transfers (both grants and loans) that are made to States/Regions. At present, however, it is more difficult
to access information in the media about how State/Region budgets are being allocated and actually used.
Further, the comprehensiveness of budgets presented to state and region hluttaws is also unclear.

6.46. Giving state and regional governments greater influence over the use of public funds will also
require an effective reporting and oversight framework between the center and States/Regions.
Existing procedures for financial reporting ensure that there are numerous checks and balances during
preparation of financial reports and that detailed information is available on each and every spending
unit. These reports do not lend themselves easily to analysis. As such, they are rarely used to inform
dialogue between the Union and States/Regions.

6.47. The decentralized approach to reporting involves over 5,000 spending units that must submit
accounts on a monthly basis. This means there is enormous potential for evidence-driven expenditure
and policy analysis. However, a lack of a standardized classification and manual systems mean that the
information available is unsuited to deeper analysis. For example, it is not possible to analyze how funds
are being allocated and spent by deconcentrated units at the township level. Putting in place the
information and technology systems and processes to analyze this rich data will enable improved
understanding of how expenditures are being distributed to the population.

6.48. The existing system of practice-based regulation of public financial management should move
towards one which clearly defines the boundaries in which states and regions can operate. The Union
government has previously relied upon a practice-based system of regulation. As states and regions gain
new powers and recruit new staff, new risks will arise as well. On the one hand, states and regions will
not feel sufficiently empowered to innovate, as it is unclear as to where they can follow their own
procedures and where they must fit in with existing Union practices. On the other hand, in an absence of
regulation, there is also a risk that states and regions may deviate from certain core practices that the
Union government would view as non-negotiable. These risks can be addressed by better defining the
regulatory environment for public financial management.

6.49. A lack of regulation also makes it difficult to exercise proper oversight of state and regional
spending. It is difficult to sanction officials, if there is no clear guidance on what is, or is not permitted.
Oversight is also currently limited to a fairly basic financial audit of their budgetary transactions. However,
often the greatest risks to fiscal stability are the transactions undertaken by regional and local entities
that take place off-budget.

       G. Revenue Decentralization

6.50. The different types of own-source revenue for States/Regions are set out in Schedule 5 of the
2008 Constitution. These include municipal taxes, transportation taxes, taxes on a limited range of
forestry products, salt tax and an entertainment tax. Non-tax revenues include land revenues, registration
fees, and service fees including tolls, fines and profits from investment. These are broadly in line with

81
     See for example the New Light of Myanmar.

                                                                                                            91
sound principles of revenue assignment, which includes assignment of taxes with immobile bases (e.g.
land and property) to local authorities because there is no scope to shift location to avoid taxation. It is
also helpful to provide the States/Regions authorities with autonomy on fees and charges for local
services.

6.51. The overall level of revenue of States/Regions is unsurprisingly low, in line with limited
spending assignments. All major sources of general government revenue in Myanmar (i.e. commercial
tax, personal and corporate income taxes, customs duties, stamp duties, various fees and fines, and the
majority of revenues derived from natural resources) accrue to the Union government. Myanmar has a
centralized and harmonized tax regime. Own-source revenue of States/Regions account for around 6
percent of public sector revenue in Myanmar, which is low compared to other countries (Figure 6.9).

6.52. The composition of total own-source revenue collections in 2013/14 shows that 54.2 percent
came from non-tax sources, 30.4 percent came from capital receipts (i.e. sale of government assets),
and 15.4 percent came from taxes (Figure 6.10). It is helpful to treat capital revenue separately to tax and
non-tax revenue because these are receipts from sale of fixed assets: channeling them to recurrent
activities is not sustainable. Tax collections are likely to remain low in the years to come given a historically
narrow tax base and limited tax assignments. Non-tax receipts, on the other hand, are more transaction-
based and in exchange for delivery of particular services, therefore easier to collect. One issue to monitor
is that non-tax fees and charges do not become overly regressive, such that there is disproportionate
burden on poorer households.

6.53. The level and composition of own-source revenue across States/Regions vary significantly. In
2013/14, 68 percent of total own-source revenues were collected in Yangon and Mandalay (Figure 6.11).
They are among the top three most populated States/Regions after Ayeyarwady. Both Yangon and
Mandalay are also major economic hubs in Myanmar, which provide the local authorities the scope for
earning important non-tax receipts. It is also important to note that Yangon and Mandalay collected
nearly all of the capital receipts, most likely through sale of land given the property development boom
in both cities in the past three years.

6.54. One source of non-tax receipts are contributions from SEEs operating within the State/Region.
Twenty percent of SEEs’ after tax profits must be paid to States/Regions. Available data suggests that
these contributions are less than 10 percent of revenue for most State/Regions (Figure 6.12). This may
be because many of these SEEs are small or are not very profitable in the first the place. The exceptions
are Chin and Rakhine which have very low own-source revenues. In all other States/Regions, most tax
and non-tax revenues are paid by the private sector.

6.55. The burden of State/Region tax revenue is moderately progressive when comparing recurrent
revenue collection per-capita to poverty incidence (Figure 6.13).82 The poorest States/Regions show the
lowest tax payments per-capita. For example, Chin shows the lowest tax receipts per-capita and Yangon

82
  Capital receipts are omitted because they tend to originate from isolated incidents such as the sale of property
rather than a steady stream of revenues paid by a large share of the population within a state or region. Moreover,
capital receipts were collected almost exclusively in Yangon and Mandalay.

                                                                                                                                                                  93
shows the highest tax receipts per-capita. As a next step, it will be useful to extend this analysis to examine
the progressivity of each specific tax within each state and region. For example, property taxes are likely
to affect a different category of taxpayers than those who pay transportation taxes.

6.56. Own-source revenue autonomy for States/Regions in terms of policy and administration is very
limited and warrants early review to see whether there may be options to grant some independence.
Some degree of revenue autonomy is important for accountability. It helps to better link local citizens’ tax
payments to local service delivery compared to financing service out of central transfers. Evidence from
other countries also suggests that funding local services out of local taxes can promote more responsible
spending. This however is long-term endeavor for Myanmar. Developing countries seldom have large
taxing powers devolved to sub-national governments, especially at the onset of decentralization. This can
dilute central authorities’ capacity to conduct its macro-stabilization and fiscal redistribution functions.
Moreover, subnational governments may be reluctant to take on the responsibility of making politically
unpopular decisions to raise their own taxes. Nonetheless, some preliminary steps could be considered.

6.57. The authorities may find it helpful to develop a policy on State/Region revenues. This policy
could be based on provisions in the 2008 Constitution and an analysis of possible options for providing
some revenue autonomy. It would be useful to align the design of this policy with the policy on functional
and expenditure assignments. Misalignment between spending and revenue assignments can lead to
unfunded mandates (i.e. insufficient local revenue to finance local responsibilities), or wasteful spending
(i.e. local revenue in excess of local responsibilities). In terms of revenue autonomy, the policy paper
could:

    (i)        Clarify the degree of autonomy on existing revenue assignments set out in the 2008
               Constitution. This includes for example the State/Region authority over setting rates on the tax
               and non-tax revenue sources set out in Schedule 5.
    (ii)       Propose additional sources of revenue, which are typically assigned to sub-national authorities
               but currently not covered in Schedule 5 (e.g. environmental and property taxes). An important
               consideration is whether introduction of such new taxes is possible through legislation given
               that they are not included in the 2008 Constitution.


                                                                                                                            94
    (iii)   Propose sharing arrangements for major sources of revenue that are assigned to central
            government. This would involve decisions on what revenue pool to share (e.g. commercial tax,
            corporate income taxes) and how to allocate that pool across States/Regions. A common
            practice in other countries is to share taxes at the same rates across States/Regions.
    (iv)    Explore the option of States/Regions being able to impose a surtax on existing Union level taxes.
            This maintains a harmonized system while allowing sub-national authorities some
            independence on the tax rate.

6.58. The tax administration function can remain centralized, even with enhanced revenue
autonomy. In fact there is scope to further consolidation at the Union level because responsibility for tax
administration is quite fragmented. Several Union agencies (e.g. Internal, General Administration, Roads,
Transport, Fisheries) and their deconcentrated units in States/Regions are involved in revenue collection
and administration. Given this, and existing weaknesses in tax administration at Union level, it would not
make sense to further split this function now. Additionally, separation of tax administration between
Union and State/Region level potentially increases administrative costs – particularly when sub-national
revenue assignments are so limited.

    H. Accountability for Results

6.59. Good sub-national governance requires both autonomy and accountability. Giving sub-national
governments the freedom to respond to the needs of their populations within their own unique social,
economic, and environmental conditions can be very helpful. The probability that they will succeed will
increase if they are also held to account for their performance. Sub-national accountability depends
critically on the ability of both the central government and the population to monitor sub-national
government performance. Sub-national autonomy is therefore best framed in a governance structure
which includes central regulation and oversight, as well as both upwards and downwards accountability
mechanisms.

6.60. The current framework of oversight has focused primarily on central controls rather than
monitoring how well public services are provided by states and regions and the municipalities within
them. Reporting and recording systems in Myanmar have not focused on whether government programs
are performing well and getting good results. Instead, they have been concerned with compliance with
procedures. There have been some positive exceptions. For example, the establishment of school grants
committees and the requirement that school budgets are visible at each school (see chapter 4) have made
it possible for communities to become more involved in monitoring the performance of their public
schools.

6.61. Myanmar’s framework for performance monitoring and local accountability is still evolving.
Given that the process of decentralization has only recently begun, authorities are still considering which
institutional arrangements and mechanisms will best support prudent financial management and
accountable and responsive local service delivery.

6.62. Accountability for results in sub-national public service delivery easier when sub-national fiscal
data and service delivery outcomes are reported publically. Systems for collecting and reporting sub-
national fiscal data are being developed and modernized; this data could be compared against service
delivery performance and be made publically available in a simple and appropriate format. The GAD is
well positioned to undertake this role in coordination with sub-national governments and Union
ministries.

                                                                                                          95
6.63. Simplicity is important, especially in the short-run. As a counter-example of what not to do, the
state of Minas Gerais in Brazil attempts to keep track of 85,000 performance indicators. This far exceeded
the capacity of the Brazilian government to monitor and analyze. A medium-term step could be the
introduction of national minimum service delivery standards based on the data previously collected from
sub-national governments.

    I. Conclusions and Recommendations

6.64. The government has taken a sound approach to very gradual decentralization of administrative
and fiscal responsibilities to States/Regions as per the 2008 Constitution. However, the transition
necessarily involves tensions between new institutions of sub-national governance and centralized
structures of public administration. This can be managed by developing and adopting new policies that
help spell out how to implement the provisions on decentralization in the 2008 Constitution. First among
these is the establishment of clear lines of accountability for centrally administered public servants to the
newly appointed Chief Ministers in the States/Regions. This can be followed by new policies on functional
and expenditure assignments, revenue assignments (including more autonomy for States/Regions), and a
rules-based systems for intergovernmental transfers.

6.65. The above transition is a very broad and complex agenda of institutional reforms involving
many stakeholders. Those involved include the Office of the President, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of
National Planning and Economic Development, Ministry of Home Affairs, Chief Minister of States/Regions,
and several line agencies. To oversee and coordinate the decentralization process envisaged above, the
authorities have established an inter-ministerial Committee on Union-State/Region Relations (CUSRR)
chaired by the President. Similar committees have been established in other countries to coordinate
across stakeholders; set common objectives; develop and consider policy options; and take decisions as
appropriate. The objectives of the CUSSR would be to promote a common vision and shared set of
objectives; establish a sound policy and institutional framework; and regularly monitor and evaluate
implementation.

6.66. The chapter closed with some important observations about accountability for good results.
Existing systems of accountability have, thus far, been more focused on procedural matters. In fact,
accountability for results in sub-national public service delivery will be more effective when the authorities
publicly report sub-national financial data and service delivery outcomes. The PER therefore proposes
options for gather and sharing fiscal data and service delivery outcomes.

Confusion over the management of,       Medium-term: To improve conflicts over accountability, the

services could be reduced by            the states and regions to the direct supervision and control of the
clarifying lines of authority between   state or region executive (with checks and balances held by the
Union ministries and new sub-           state or region parliament); or (ii) transition GAD officers to a

                                        deconcentrated central line agencies, the authorities could give

   ANNEX 1: DATA AND ACCOUNTING ISSUES
The time period under review includes five years. It includes budget estimates (BE) for 2009/10 through
2013/14 and provisional actual (PA) outcomes for 2009/10 through 2011/12. The provisional actual
outcomes for 2012/13 were unavailable at the time of the review, so intermediate results, the revised
estimates (RE), were used for that year. Neither the revised estimates nor provisional actuals were
available from the government authorities for 2013/14 at the time the review was underway. Estimated
outcomes for 2012/13 and 2013/14 from the IMF are used, however, in Chapter 2.

The data coverage is almost comprehensive. It includes the Union state administrative organizations,
the Union ministries, Union transfers to the states and regions, the Union state economic enterprises, the
cantons and the district development committees. The data do not include the off-budget “other
accounts” used by Union ministries for their retained revenues collected by states and regions, revenues
collected by the states and regions, or economic enterprises owned or controlled by state or regional
governments. The data do not include the two military holding companies.

The government maintains a cash-based accounting system. This means that expenditures measure
what has actually been paid for, regardless if some revenues due have not been collected (tax arrears) or
if some payments due to vendors or creditors have not been fully paid (payments in arrears). Non-cash
concepts are not recorded. An example found in the IMF GFS Manual (2001) is the consumption of fixed
capital, meaning the decline in the value of the stock of fixed assets during the accounting period as a
result of physical deterioration, normal obsolescence, and normal accidental damage.

The data do not include final estimates provided by the Office of the Auditor-General. These are not
published and are not shared outside of the government. The budget estimates are the original budgetary
allocations approved just before the start of each new fiscal year. The revised estimates are modified
allocations based on various ad-hoc policy changes and unanticipated needs. These are approved at the
end of each fiscal year. The preliminary actual estimates are generated by the Accounting Department
approximately 12 months after the close of each fiscal year.

Estimates for GDP, population and poverty may not be accurate. Historical data show high real growth
rates that were inconsistent with economic fundamentals and available data from key sectors. Public
sector activities were recorded at deeply over-valued exchange rates. Growth rates from recent years
appear to be more realistic and consistent with other indicators but there remains considerable
uncertainty about the actual level of GDP. In particular, if the historical growth rates were incorrect, then
all subsequent estimates based on those growth rates will also be incorrect. Population and poverty
estimates are also subject to scrutiny. Both are expected to benefit from the recent census. The new
census data were considered preliminary at the time of this review and have not been utilized. The IMF
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance observes several additional short-comings but also notes
good progress in improving the quality of new estimates. To minimize the probability of errors, this review
uses estimates published in various IMF country reports.

The review uses a mix of data sources. Chapter 2 utilizes aggregated data in various IMF reports
published through 2014, augmented by World Bank staff calculations. The analysis in Chapters 3, 4 and 5
examines Union and SEE operations individually using the BOOST database. The BOOST database
produces results highly similar to, but not the same as, those provided by the IMF. Importantly, for the
years 2012/13 and 2013/14, the BOOST database numbers are revised estimates and budget estimates
while the IMF data are preliminary outcomes and revised estimates respectively. Annex Tables 1 and 2
provide a comparison. Chapter 6 relies on state and region data provided by the MoF.

to begin thinking about whether the level or composition of spending could be further improved. With
this in mind, Annex 2 Table 1 was constructed to make such comparisons easy.

The data come from the IMF Government Financial Statistics which are standardized across a wide
range of countries. This makes it easier to compare one country with another. The sample of countries
used in the table below was selected on the basis of three key criteria: each country had to have data for
at least two years between 2000 and 2007, the accounting system is cash-based, and the level of
government is general government. The specified time period allows one to avoid the impact of the global
food and fuel crisis and the subsequent global financial crisis and recession. (Myanmar was largely
unaffected by these shocks due to its low level of trade and financial integration.) The resulting sample
shown in Annex 2 Table 2 includes 40 countries: 2 low income, 12 lower middle-income, 15 middle-income
and 11 high income. Of these, 39 have data for the economic classification of government (ECOG) but only
25 have data for the classification of government functions (COFOG). Average GDP shares and
expenditure shares have been calculated for each ECOG and COFOG category within each of the income
groups. The results for the low income group are not included in the table since the sample size (2) is too
small to be representative.

The comparison of Myanmar with the three income group averages is only a first step in what should
be a more systematic process. The results should be interpreted with care. Income per-capita is not the
only driver of expenditure levels or composition. Recent research shows that the old and often cited
relationship between GDP per-capita and the size of government (Wagner’s Law) no longer exists in many
countries. Brady and Lee (2013), for example, found that government spending in many OECD countries
has been falling as a share of GDP since the 1990s despite continued growth in GDP per-capita. Shelton

                                                                                                             108
(2007) finds that GDP per-capita becomes insignificant as an explanatory variable when demographic
variables are introduced: more aged (healthier) societies are wealthier and spend more on social security.
The GDP shares of most other categories of spending tend to fall as GDP per-capita grows. Shelton finds
several other explanatory variables are relevant as well. For example, more populous and/or ethnically
diverse countries tend to be more decentralized.

Policy and external shocks matter too. For example, defense expenditure shares have been falling almost
everywhere in the world since the collapse the former Soviet Union and the end of the “cold war.”
Governments that favor universal health care will spend more than those that rely heavily on household
“out-of-pocket” contributions. Governments facing falling commodity prices for its producers may choose
to boost spending temporarily on social safety net programs.

                   ANNEX 3: ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF
                     VARIOUS ORDERS OF GOVERNMENT
This table broadly draws on the 2008 constitution to broadly define categories of public sector activities
and examine how various responsibilities within these broad categories are assigned across different tiers
of government. For some activities, responsibilities may be largely exclusive to a single level of
government (such as Defence and Security, which are exclusively undertaken by the Union level); whereas
for others, responsibilities may be shared (such as in the Finance and Planning sectors). An N.A. implies
no role for a level of government in a specific area of public sector activity.
