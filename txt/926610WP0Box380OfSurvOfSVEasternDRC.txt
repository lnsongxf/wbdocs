                                                       CAMPS to develop an animal husbandry program where
                                                       beneficiaries would be trained and acquire livestock, while
                                                       CAMPS would also be able to maintain the program as the
                                                       animals reproduced. In addition, CAMPS could draw on

                                                       In the case of married couples, it is vital that husbands also
                                                       obtain medical care along with their wives, particularly for
                                                       STI testing and treatment. Beneficiaries noted that currently
                                                       only women have access to medical care, resulting in cases
                                                       where the untreated husband continues to infect his wife.
                                                       Given CAMP’s funding, it would be most realistic if they built

                                                       of potential services. Thus, male family members could
                                                       potentially be referred to other NGOs for medical services

     to providing different kinds of care for survivors.


         Survivor arrives at CAMPS office



              Psychosocial: When a potential beneficiary arrives at a CAMPS office, the first step is for a staff
              member to engage in an active listening session to learn about the individual and assess her or his
              needs and determine what, if any, referrals can be recommended. For those who receive services
              from CAMPS for an extended period of time, all receive psychosocial assistance through individual
              and group counseling sessions throughout their period of care.


                    Medical: If the beneficiary is assessed to be in need of
                    medical attention, CAMPS will provide a referral, transport,
                    and pay the fees of care at a local hospital. For severe
                    cases, referrals are made to Panzi Hospital in Bukavu; for
                    less severe cases, local general hospitals are used.


                    Legal: If the beneficiary knows the perpetrator of the sexual assault,
                    then CAMPS begins to collect information about the case, as well as
                    attempts to find the perpetrator and transport them to jail. CAMPS’
                    legal team then works to bring the case to court, which, ideally,
                    would result in a conviction and jail time for the perpetrator.


                                              Socio-economic Reinsertion: If the beneficiary is both a survivor
                                              of sexual violence AND traumatized, they are eligible for financial
                                              support. Additionally, those classified as being particularly
                                              vulnerable, including those who become pregnant because of rape;
                                              widows; those divorced, rejected or stigmatized because of sexual

         Conference Discussion Questions

                                  Activités en Carrefour : SESSION I

Groupe 1 : Assistance Socio-Économique
Il a été constaté que les bénéficiaires veulent souvent avoir des services sociaux-économiques à long-
terme et des revenus durables. Cependant, en réalité, il peut être très difficile de prévoir quels genres
d’activités rapporteront les revenus à long terme.
•	 Selon votre expérience, avez-vous vécu cela?

•	 Si oui, qu’est-ce que vous pouvez envisager de faire pour améliorer le travail à l’avenir par rapport à
   ce résultat ?

•	 Si non, qu’est-ce que vous avez trouvé qui est différent par rapport à ce résultat ?

•	 Pensez-vous qu’il y a quelque chose d’important à ajouter à ce résultat pour qu’il devienne plus com-
   plet ou précis?

Groupe 2 : Assistance Juridique
Il a été constaté que les survivants n’accèdent pas souvent aux services juridiques, et cela demeure un
défi.
•	 Selon votre expérience, avez-vous vécu cela?

    ˏˏ   Si oui, qu’est-ce que vous pouvez envisager de faire pour améliorer le travail à l’avenir par rapport
         à ce résultat ?

•	 Si non, qu’est-ce que vous avez trouvé qui est différent par rapport à ce résultat ?

•	 Pensez-vous qu’il y a quelque chose d’important à ajouter à ce résultat pour qu’il devienne plus com-
   plet ou précis?

Groupe 3 : Assistance Psycho-Sociale
Il a été constaté que les survivants de violences sexuelles et leurs familles pensent que le counselling
était très utile pour la guérison ou le rétablissement.
•	 Selon votre expérience, avez-vous vécu cela? Si oui, quel traitement de santé mental avez-vous trouvé
   très efficace?

•	 Si non, qu’est-ce que vous avez trouvé qui est différent par rapport à ce résultat?

•	 Pensez-vous qu’il y a quelque chose d’important à ajouter à ce résultat pour qu’il devienne plus com-
   plet ou précis?

Groupe 4 : Assistance Médicale
Il a été constaté que les survivants de violences sexuelles pensent que les soins médicaux faisaient ob-



                                                         Assessing the Impact of Programming to Reduce the Stigmatization of
                                                     Survivors of Sexual Violence in Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo
                                                                                                                                27
     jet de critique en ce qui concerne la guérison ou le rétablissement des patients. Cependant, ils ont af-
     firmé que les institutions médicales sont toujours éloignées, et les services étaient limités aux femmes
     victimes, et rien n’était fait pour leurs époux ; ceci a constitué un frein pour une guérison définitive
     surtout quand il s’agissait des IST.
     •	 Selon votre expérience, avez-vous vécu cela?

         ˏˏ   Si non, qu’est-ce que vous avez trouvé qui est différent par rapport à ce résultat ?

     •	 Pensez-vous qu’il y a quelque chose d’important à ajouter à ce résultat pour qu’il devienne plus com-
        plet ou précis?


                                       Activités en Carrefour : SESSION II

     Question I :
     Les bénéficiaires des services ont constaté qu’il y a une interaction importante entre les différents services.
     Ils ont parlé avec insistance d’une interaction positive dans l’acquisition de l’assistance. Etes-vous d’accord
     avec cela selon votre expérience? Si oui, quelles sont les meilleures pratiques que vous trouvez rassurantes par
     rapport aux services voulus et les services fournis aux survivants ? Si vous n’êtes pas d’accord, qu’est-ce que
     vous proposeriez à la place?
     Question II :
     Comment engageons-nous efficacement la communauté afin de favoriser des changements des attitudes au-
     tour du stigma lié à la violence sexuelle? Comment pouvons-nous le faire même dans des régions éloignées?
     Quelles sont les meilleures pratiques face à ce défi?
     Question III:
     Les survivants ont dit que la réconciliation et l’acceptation par la famille étaient un des aspects les plus impor-
     tants pour la guérison. Quels sont les moyens efficaces pour impliquer les membres de famille dans le traite-
     ment et la guérison? Mais parfois la réconciliation de famille n’est pas possible. Quelles sont les meilleures
     pratiques dans une telle situation?

About the Women in War Program

The Harvard Humanitarian Initiative’s (HHI) Women in War program seeks to investigate and address
women’s needs in today’s most troubled settings. HHI’s network of diverse faculty, fellows, and researchers
examines pressing issues that impact women’s security throughout the world. Our projects emphasize the
unique vulnerabilities women face in humanitarian settings, including gender-based violence, other forms of
exploitation and abuse, and economic insecurity. Our research identifies some of the consequences of social
instability and violence on women’s livelihoods as well as the key role women can play as agents of social
change. Our work highlights the ways in which women are vital actors in their communities - advocates for
change, businesspeople, service providers, and leaders. HHI’s research attempts to capture the complexities
and nuances of these roles and to explore how women interact with other actors.
HHI’s investigations inform approaches to reduce the vulnerability of women in conflict and support com-
munity-level resilience strategies. The Women in War program employs a participatory research approach
grounded in collaborations with international and local non-governmental organizations and community-
based associations. This approach helps us bring the voices of the experts – the women affected by violence
and instability – to practitioners and policy makers to catalyze the development of more effective program-
ming. The program’s goal is to translate the knowledge gained from working with affected communities into
timely and impactful programming and policy.
This report was produced by Jocelyn Kelly, the director of the Women in War program, and Beth Maclin, the
research coordinator of the program.

About LOGiCA

Established in 2009, LOGiCA is a three and a half year program financed by a multi-donor trust fund of
US$8.7 million.
LOGiCA’s specific objectives are:
•	 To increase gender-sensitive programming in demobilization and reintegration operations in the
   great lake region by better addressing the gender-specific needs of male and female ex-combatants;
•	 To generate knowledge and good practice on how to address gender and conflict issues - with a focus
   on programs addressing demobilization and reintegration, gender-based violence, vulnerable women
   in conflict affected areas, and young men at-risk in Sub-Saharan Africa

LOGiCA is built upon lessons from the Learning for Equality Access and Peace (LEAP) Program: LEAP
was established in 2007 under the Multi-country Demobilization and Reintegration Program (MDRP) to
strengthen the impact of Programs from a gender perspective.
LEAP used a combination of gender-sensitive approaches and piloting activities which proved crucial in con-
tributing to the MDRP’s understanding of gender issues facing demobilization and reintegration programs.
Furthermore, LEAP served to identify a number of broader post-conflict gender issues with currently limited
operational responses. Thus LOGiCA was established as a stand-alone initiative with a widened scope to ad-
dress other critical gender and post-conflict issues, in addition to a retained focus on demobilization and re-
integration in the Great Lakes Region in collaboration with MDRP’s phasing-out initiative – the Transitional
Demobilization and Reintegration Program (TDRP).
This project was financed by LOGiCA through the World Bank.
