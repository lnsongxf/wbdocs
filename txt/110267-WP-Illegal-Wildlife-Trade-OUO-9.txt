    Foreword

    On behalf of the 183 Parties to CITES and the CITES Secretariat, I would like to congratulate everyone
    who contributed to the publication of this timely report, Analysis of International Funding to Tackle
    Illegal Wildlife Trade.

    The inception of this analysis goes back to the 16th meeting of the Conference of the Parties held
    in Bangkok in 2013, where the Parties requested the CITES Secretariat to collaborate with the World
    Bank and other relevant financial institutions, cooperation agencies, and potential donors to organize
    a Wildlife Donor Roundtable in order to share information on existing funding programs on wildlife,
    to understand the long-term financial needs of developing countries, and to explore the potential for
    scaled-up financial resources.

    Subsequently, and in line with CITES Decision 16.5, the first donor roundtable meeting was held in
    New York on 7 July 2015. The meeting was jointly organized by the CITES Secretariat, UNDP, UNEP,
    UNODC, and the World Bank on the sidelines of the United Nations High-Level Political Forum on
    sustainable development. At this meeting, which I had the great honor to chair, the World Bank Group
    (WBG) kindly agreed to lead the donor portfolio review.

    The WBG has since fully used its global outreach and expertise in economic analysis, engaging a wide
    range of donor groups and developing the current report. We are all indebted to the WBG and the
    Global Wildlife Program team for their exemplary work.

    On our part, CITES has actively engaged in the process over the last three years—not only because
    we are the co-convenor of this collective effort but because we strongly believe that the findings and
    recommendations of this report will make a vital contribution to CITES Parties, be they donors or
    beneficiaries or from range, transit, or destination states, in better connecting their efforts along the
    entire illicit trade chain in combating these serious and highly destructive crimes.

    We remain committed to collaborating with our many wonderful partners in advancing our collective
    efforts to support CITES Parties as they combat illegal trade in wildlife and work to ensure the conser-
    vation and sustainable use of the world’s wildlife.

      Foreword

      Poaching and illegal wildlife trafficking are reaching unprecedented levels, robbing the livelihoods
      of local communities and eroding the global commons. In response, the Global Environment Facility
      (GEF) has launched a major effort to help tackle the supply, trade, and demand for wildlife products.
      Importantly, the project is not only about stopping the slaughter of animals in the forests and savannas
      of Africa; it also aims at reducing the demand in Asia.

      The $131 million GEF-funded program includes 19 countries in Africa and Asia. It is expected to lever-
      age $704 million in additional financing over seven years. The national projects aim to promote wildlife
      conservation, wildlife crime prevention, and sustainable development in order to reduce adverse impacts
      to known threatened species. Additionally, a global coordination grant from the GEF will strengthen
      cooperation and facilitate knowledge exchange between national governments, development-agency
      partners, and leading practitioners.

      This program is part of the wider effort by the international donor community to combat illegal wildlife
      trade. Numerous international financial institutions, governments, nongovernmental organizations,
      and foundations have launched strategies, programs, and projects to address this serious problem.
      But while there is a growing momentum from the international community to combat the problem,
      reliable information on donor funding has been lacking.

      This important new report, Analysis of International Funding to Tackle Illegal Wildlife Trade, fills an
      important gap in our understanding of the collective response. The analysis will not only provide a
      better understanding and coordination of the contributions of the international community, it should
      ultimately assist those on the ground protecting the wildlife and the livelihoods of local communities.
      I want to congratulate the World Bank for leading this work, and all the partners who contributed to
      providing such a comprehensive overview of the investments of the international community to tackle
      this wildlife crisis.

    Preface

    The World Bank Group’s vision is a world free of poverty. We help countries achieve their poverty
    reduction and prosperity goals in part by helping them manage their natural resources more sustain-
    ably. Wildlife crime directly threatens our ability to do this.

    Criminal activities that affect the environment and natural resources are on the rise and pose an increas-
    ingly serious threat to sustainable and inclusive development. Wildlife crime undermines efforts to
    reduce poverty, damages important tourist assets, further alienates and sometimes criminalizes already
    disadvantaged communities, breeds corruption and distrust in civil authorities, and pollutes the supply
    chains of legitimate natural resource-based businesses.

    In Africa, for example, wildlife crime is growing and threatens significant ecological, cultural, and
    economic assets. The elephant population—a critical draw for the tourism sector—has declined by
    30 percent since 2007. Two elephants are poached each and every hour, and over 1,000 rangers have
    been murdered in pursuit of poachers in the same time frame. This tragedy results in natural and
    human losses, instability and violence, but also in lost jobs and lost GDP. Wildlife crime undermines
    rural economies and privileges the pursuit of private, criminal profit at the expense of communities
    that rely on nature for their food, shelter, start-up capital, and safety net in a warming world.

    The good news is that wildlife crime can be stopped or significantly reduced. But to do that, effective
    national efforts to tackle growing criminality will need to be backed by international cooperation and
    collective action. Too many countries that suffer from wildlife crime are underserved by existing inter-
    national and domestic law enforcement institutions. Recent experiences show that collaborative multi-
    agency efforts in specific countries and regions, and global delivery models such as the International
    Consortium on Combatting Wildlife Crime (ICCWC), can provide critical services to support national
    governments in their efforts to dismantle illicit wildlife trafficking operations.

    Partnership matters. Financing does too. With support from the GEF-funded Global Wildlife Program,
    we have run the numbers to understand exactly how much support is already being provided to this
    fight. As this report shows, a great deal of resources are already being invested: 24 international donors
    committed over US$1.3 billion to combat international wildlife trafficking in 2010–2016. This analysis
    is the first step to help the donor community identify gaps and potential economies of scale, and to
    enhance knowledge related to the efficiency and effectiveness of specific interventions. Having a better
    understanding of current financing flows and what other investments they can mobilize, will allow
    us to build stronger collaboration, avoid wasted effort and learn lessons that together will help us a
    mount a more effective response to this global and national issue.

    Executive Summary


    W
                ildlife brings significant ecological, cultural, and economic benefits to countries and regions
                around the world. In many developing countries, it is an engine for tourism, job creation,
                and sustainable development. Populations of some of the most iconic wildlife species are
    under threat due to the illegal wildlife trade (IWT) and other pressures. There is growing momentum
    in the international donor community to combat IWT and ensure the survival of these species and the
    realization of benefits to local communities that live with them.

    Information on investments to combat IWT is not readily available—donor procedures, processes,
    and systems to collect and report on funding data are often complex and time-consuming. This port-
    folio review addresses these challenges by collecting and analyzing IWT funding information across
    international donors and fills the knowledge gap of international donor IWT funding trends. It collects
    data on the significant international donor funding committed between January 2010 and June 2016 to
    combat IWT in Africa and Asia, which totals over US $1.3 billion and is equivalent to approximately
    US $190 million per year. Key findings include:

    •	 Since 2010, funding has fluctuated over these years, peaking at US $316 million in 2014.

    •	 The top five donors (the Global Environment Facility, Germany, the United States, the European
       Commission, and the World Bank Group) together account for US $1.1 billion of total funding (86%).

    •	 Two of the three foundations included in the analysis were among the top 10 donors.

    •	 Twelve of the 24 donors committed less than US $10 million in funding.

    •	 Donor funding was allocated to projects in 60 different countries and to various regional/multi-
       country and global projects. In total, inclusive of country-specific and regional/multi-county and
       global investments, 63% of the funds were committed to Africa (US $833 million), 29% to Asia
       (US $381 million), 6% to global programs and initiatives (US $81 million), and 2% to projects
       covering both Africa and Asia (US $35 million).

    •	 The top five recipient countries account for US $328 million: Tanzania (8%), the Democratic Republic
       of the Congo (5%), Mozambique (5%), Gabon (3%), and Bangladesh (3%).

    •	 Regional or multi-country investments, combined account for 26% (US $339 million) of total funding.

    •	 The majority of the funding is allocated to national governments (61%; US $809 million), followed by
       funding to international nongovernmental organizations (16%; US $218 million), intergovernmental
       organizations (9%; US $114 million), and researchers and research groups (4%; US $4 million).

    •	 It is estimated that approximately 46% of the funding supported protected area management to
       help prevent poaching, 19% was for law enforcement that included intelligence-led operations and
       transnational coordination, 15% for sustainable use and alternative livelihoods, 8% for policy and
       legislation, 6% for research and assessment, and 6% for communication and awareness raising.

    Asian Development Bank (ADB)
    ADB helps developing member countries improve their living conditions and quality of life by financ-
    ing infrastructure, environment, regional cooperation, education, health, agriculture, and public sector
    management projects. In 2015, ADB approved 65 loans and grant projects for more than US $7 billion,
    contributing to environmental sustainability. ADB’s work on the illegal wildlife trade originated in the
    Environmental Law and Enforcement component of the Office of the General Counsel’s Law, Justice,
    and Development Program, which initiated the Asian Judges Network on Environment.

    Canada—The Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC)
    The ECCC finances environmental protection and conservation of natural heritage. Through ECCC’s
    Enforcement Branch, the Wildlife Enforcement Directorate (WED) conducts targeted operations to
    address illegal trade of rhinoceros horn and ivory from elephants and helps conserve habitats and
    protected areas at high risk for non-compliance. ECCC/WED supports the INTERPOL Wildlife Crime
    Working Group and the INTERPOL National Bureau to help combat IWT.

    European Commission (EC)—DG EuropeAid Development & Cooperation (DEVCO)
    The EC is the European Union’s executive body. It represents the interest of the EU as a whole and
    works on issues related to human rights, governance, agriculture, economic growth, infrastructure,
    environment, energy, health, and education. From 2010 to 2016, DEVCO supported over 365 biodiversity-
    related projects in over 30 countries, with a total volume of more than €1.4 billion. The EC is focused
    on implementing the recently adopted EU Action Plan against Wildlife Trafficking.

    Fauna and Flora International (FFI)
    FFI’s mission is to act to conserve threatened species and ecosystems worldwide, choosing solutions
    that are sustainable, are based on sound science, and take into account human needs. FFI’s work spans
    the globe, with over 140 projects in over 40 countries. FFI focuses on reducing poaching, trafficking,
    and demand. FFI is also developing innovative technologies and finance mechanisms to address IWT
    more effectively.

    France—Agence Française de Développement (AfD)
    Through grants and loans, AfD finances health, education, agriculture, water supply, transportation,
    energy, nature, and development programs/projects in developing countries. From 2011 to 2013, AfD
    invested €420 million in biodiversity projects. AfD’s strategic biodiversity priorities include protect-
    ing, restoring, managing, and enhancing ecosystems, while fairly sharing the benefits of their utiliza-
    tion, mainstreaming ecosystem conservation in all sectoral development policies, and strengthening
    partnerships.

      Global Environment Facility (GEF)
      The GEF has supported over 1,300 global biodiversity projects in more than 155 countries, with a total
      volume of more than US $4.2 billion. The GEF is the largest funding mechanism for protected areas
      worldwide. Combating IWT is a high priority for the GEF, and its investment in the Global Wildlife
      Program provides over $131 million across 19 countries in Asia and Africa and will serve as a catalyst
      to channel financial and technical resources to combat IWT.

      Germany—German Development Cooperation
      The German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) works to combat
      poverty; secure food; establish peace, democracy, and human rights; and preserve the environment
      and natural resources. Since 2013, the German government has provided €500 million annually for
      the global conservation of forests and other ecosystems. The German Development Cooperation is
      committed to supporting priority IWT investments that strengthen protected area management, law
      enforcement capabilities, and demand reduction.

      Japan—Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan (MoFA)
      Japan finances programs in development, emergency humanitarian assistance, infrastructure develop-
      ment, disaster risk reduction, health, women’s empowerment, education, the environment, and cli-
      mate change. The Japan Biodiversity Fund was created to help developing countries develop capacity
      to implement the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020 (the Aichi Biodiversity Targets), to revise
      their National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plans, and to strengthen their capacity to implement
      the Convention.

      Netherlands—Ministry of Economic Affairs and Ministry of Foreign Affairs
      The government of the Netherlands finances biodiversity and wildlife crime projects through the
      Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Specifically for the biodiversity sec-
      tor, the Netherlands invests in park management globally. The Dutch goals for international policy on
      biodiversity are to bring loss of biodiversity to a halt by 2020, to consolidate the Natura 2000 network,
      and to compensate for biodiversity loss by applying the No Net Loss principle.

      Norway—Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD)
      NORAD’s main focus areas are climate change and the environment. Specific programs within this
      sector include the International Climate and Forest Initiative, which aims at supporting efforts to slow,
      halt, and eventually reduce greenhouse gas emissions resulting from deforestation and forest degra-
      dation in developing countries (REDD+). Additionally, Norway contributes to sustainable fishing in
      developing countries.

      Sweden—Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA)
      SIDA finances democracy, human rights, sustainable infrastructure, health, market development, peace
      and security, the environment, agriculture, and education. All of SIDA’s initiatives and all sectors of
      development cooperation have integrated environment and climate aspects. In 2012, approximately

    Annex C:
    Additional Notes on Donor Data

    Due to differences in how USFWS and USAID categorized activities for this analysis, some funding
    levels differ from those used to calculate prior USAID reporting on combating wildlife trafficking pro-
    gramming in Central Africa. USAID data includes projects for fiscal year 2014 and 2015. USFWS includes
    data for fiscal years 2012–2015. USDOS includes data for fiscal years 2013–2015.

    The EC funding  comprises of selected biodiversity-related projects funded  by the Commission’s
    Directorate-General for International Cooperation and Development (DG DEVCO), from 2010 to 2016.

    GEF funding was categorized as GEF, rather than through the implementing agencies and only
    includes GEF-5 and GEF-6 replenishment cycles.

    For Germany, the funding analyzed is provided by the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation
    and Development  (BMZ),  and  supplemented  with Federal Ministry for the Environment,  Nature 
    Conservation, Building  and NuclearSafety (BMUB) funds. The  majority of BMZ’s financing,  plan-
    ning, and coordinating development cooperation is channeled through Germany’s bilateral development
    cooperation arrangements:

    •	 Financial cooperation by the German development Bank (KfW)

    •	 Technical cooperation by the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH

    GIZ staff estimated IWT intervention categories by analyzing internal project documents.

    The World Bank data comprises of funding from IBRD, IDA, DGF and Technical Assistance loans only.
    Funding does not include any GEF grants.
