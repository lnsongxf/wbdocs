       latrines (reward repeated use at the same place and      thinking. A core insight from the behavioral sciences (see
       time, at least initially).                               Kahneman, 2011) is that human behavior is the product

7. Leverage point-of-action reminders and cues.                 Finally, as field practitioners explore folding these ideas
     • Example: Create salient cues at typical OD sites to      into OD interventions, we encourage the use, where
       act as reminders that these physical spaces have a       practical, of randomized control trials (RCTs), the robust
       new meaning (e.g., use vermillion powder to              measurement of outcome data, and the sharing of
       ritually cleanse the site).                              successes and failures alike. In particular, we encourage the
                                                                sharing of new ways to translate, tailor, and “bring to life”
8. Highlight descriptive and “localized” norms that reduce      these basic science principles as makes sense in specific
   cognitive demands.                                           environments, cultures and sub-populations.
     • Example: Develop and frame incentive systems in
       ways that work at the level of a local group
       (e.g., local village or women’s group), rather than
       individuals or entire area.

     Relevance to OD:
     The aforementioned rituals or existing routines can
     reinforce poor sanitation behaviors. For example, morning
     walks that include OD among communities in certain
     Indian states can serve as a cue or reminder to carry out
     typical behavior (OD). Other cues within that context,
     like the time of day or a sunrise, may also be cues for OD
     practice.

     In this report, we have advanced 8 System 1 Principles                        In closing, we reiterate that these 8 principles are designed
     that can be used to promote the initiation and                                to augment, not replace, approaches based on System 2
     maintenance of behavior change around OD and                                  thinking. As we have emphasized throughout, human

     Development Report: Mind, Society, and Behavior, the                          motivated) and System 1 (automatic, cue driven habits).
     principles were derived from basic science in social                          Thus, the most powerful behavior change strategies are
     psychology, cognitive science, behavioral economics, and                      likely to come from combining different intervention
     health psychology. Critically, we focused specifically                        tactics that, collectively, address both systems.
     on “System 1” tactics that do not depend on the end
     users’ rational, effortful decision-making or their                           Finally, as field practitioners explore folding these ideas
     motivational systems (see Thaler & Sunstein, 2011;                            into OD interventions, we encourage the use, where

     The 8 System 1 Principles to support OD behavior change                       environments, cultures, and sub-populations.
     are as follows:

     1. Ensure critical products and infrastructure are
        immediately and consistently physically available for the
        end user.

     2. Create or capitalize on context change to drive
        new behavior.

     3. Piggyback on other existing behaviors and cues.

     4. Address friction for the old and new behaviors.

     5. Support context-stable repetition for latrine use.

     6. Embed ritualized elements in the change process.

     7. Leverage point-of-action reminders and cues, and,

     8. Highlight descriptive and “localized” norms that
        reduce cognitive demands.
