THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: DB2014 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2014 that capture the effects of s uch
factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practic e or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy a t the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number

        Obtain construction line and site qualification

        To request a construction line, BuildCo must present the deed of
        ownership and a topographical plan with geodesic coordinates. This is
        required to ensure that public works (street or highway) will not affect
        the land. The construction line is the document that defines the
        alignment of new construction with the Metropolitan Area of San
        Salvador (AMSS) road network. It describes the right of way, retract
        area, and transversal section of the road projects to be developed, or
        widening to be undertaken in the San Salvador metropolitan area. The
        document is valid for 5 years. For San Salvador, this document should
   2    be requested at the Office of Planning of Metropolitan Area of San          11 days          no charge
        Salvador (OPAMSS).

        The site or land qualification defines whether the proposed
        construction is allowed on that land for the use projected. The
        compatibility of land use is based on reference to the soil matrix, as
        defined in the General Plan of Zoning in force for AMSS, which
        indicates the requirements for project development. This document is
        valid for 12 months and should be requested from OPAMSS, the
        Municipal Authority, or the Vice-Ministry of Housing.

        Time and cost have been calculated on the assumption that a special

      a premium (double the cost) is paid. The silence-is-consent rule applies
      to this procedure. Approvals are granted automatically if the applicant
      does not hear from OPAMSS in 30 days.

      Obtain approval of environmental form (formulario ambiental)

      According to Acuerdo Ejecutive No. 23 (Environmental Law on the
      Classification of Activities, Works and Projects) published in the Diario
      Oficial No 162, Tomo No 380 from September 1st 2008, the warehouse
      in the Doing Business case study would fall under Category 'A' which is
      exempt from an Environmental Impact Study. In this case, all that is
      required is for the architect or engineer to fill out an Environmental
      Form and submit it to MARN (Ministry of Environment). The Form               30 days       no charge
3
      outlines the project and its potential environmental impact. MARN will
      then decide if the work can be considered exempt from the full impact
      study. In the Doing Business case study, the project would most likely
      be exempt from the full impact study.


      Agency: Ministry of Environment



      * Obtain zoning or road construction revision

      The zoning or road construction revision should be requested from
      (Office of Planning of Metropolitan Area of San Salvador, OPAMSS), the
      Municipal Authority, or the Vice-Ministry of Housing. The document
      verifies the compliance of the planned construction with the
      requirements established for the use of soil, as established under the
      General Plan of Zoning for the Metropolitan Area of San Salvador and
4     its standing bylaws. Compliance with this procedure includes                 21 days       no charge
      verification of the internal road network, dwelling spaces, circulation of
      pedestrians, recreational areas, and the provision of equipment.

      submitted to the OPAMSS, the Municipal Authority, or the Vice-
      Ministry of Housing. In order to obtain the feasibility study, BuildCo
      should receive an on-site inspection by the Office of Planning of
      Metropolitan Area of San Salvador.

      As of 2010, the feasibility analysis fee is USD 0.20 per sq. m of land.

        The deed is presented to the Registry office for registration

        The public deed is filed at the Register of Property to be recorded under
        the name of the buyer. The deed will be registered, if it meets all the
        legal requirements, in 2 - 4 weeks. The registry has to check with the
        Ministry of Finance ("Hacienda") if the parties are Tax solvent. In addition
        to reforms at the registry set out by the Law on Standard Procedures of
        August 2004, an electronic system is currently being introduced and,
        once fully functional, is expected to reduce the registration time. In
        addition, a special service is available (mainly used by banks, law firms or
        companies). Upon signing a special agreement with the registry, certain 14-28 days (10-

        in exchange for a premium payment. The payment is a fixed amount
        determined according to a cost table. The amount is usually
        automatically withdrawn from a special running account at the registry.
        At the time of signing the agreement, the user sets up this account,
        depositing a certain amount (not more than US$ 100). The agreement
        has to be renewed on an annual basis. This service is not taken into
        account here, since it is only one transaction.

        The public deed is filed at the respective Municipality

        This is done in order to update the information at the Municipality and
        for calculation on municipal taxes. The title is already valid even if not
        filed at the Municipality. The incentive to file the public deed lies on the
        old owner, who will have to continue paying the taxes on the property if
        this is not done. Depending on the municipality, this step can take from                        USD 0.06 for every
        1 to 5 days. In San Salvador, the municipality has offices in each district.                    USD 114.29 of the
