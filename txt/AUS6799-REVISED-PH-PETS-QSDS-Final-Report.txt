Box 1: The Philippines Public Education Expenditure Tracking and Quantitative Service Delivery Study


  The aim of the Philippines Public Education Expenditure and Quantitative Service Delivery Study has been to answer four
  main questions on the use of the public education budget:

  1. Resource ow, management, and control. What factors prevent resources from reaching their intended destination in a
     timely and transparent manner?

  2. Existence, use, and nancing of inputs at the school level. Do schools have access to essential inputs and how e ective are
     the systems that govern their use?

  3. Equity. How do the resources available to schools and the systems that manage these resources di er among regions
     and socioeconomic groups?

  4. School performance and resources. How and why does the performance of schools di er and what drives those
     di erences?

  The study has tracked over 80 percent of the national government education budget (including teacher salaries and
  training, school maintenance and operating expenses, construction, and learning materials) as well as local government
  spending on basic education.

  In order to assess how funds ow and how they are used at the school level, the study team conducted a nationally
  representative survey of government institutions and public schools in the last quarter of 2014. The Autonomous Region
  in Muslim Mindanao was excluded from the study because government funds for this region are managed separately and
    ow to schools through a di erent mechanism. In addition, integrated schools (which o er both elementary and high
  school education) and schools that did not have nal grade elementary and high school students were excluded from the
  sample, primarily because the study aimed to measure outcomes at the end of elementary school and at the end of high
  school.

  The sample for the survey included all regional o ces of the Department of Education (DepEd) and the Department
  of Budget and Management (DBM), 51 division and 113 district o ces of DepEd, 54 district engineering o ces of the
  Department of Public Works and Highways, 74 provincial and city/municipality local governments, 249 public elementary
  schools, and 200 public high schools. At the school level, interviewers administered a questionnaire to each parent-teacher
  association, assessed the competencies of approximately 1,500 teachers, and interviewed 2,200 student households.

  The data collected were used to explore the systems that govern the use of public funds and to assess how the availability
  of resources di ered among schools. The study team combined information on the ow of funds to schools with
  information on school characteristics and quality to evaluate how nancing and governance a ected school performance.

Introduction
Introduction nd Purpose
Over the last decade, the Government of the Philippines has
embarked on an ambitious education reform program to en-
sure that all Filipinos have the opportunity to obtain the skills
that they need to play a full and productive role in society. The
government has backed up these reforms, particularly over
the last ve years, with substantial increases in investment in
the education sector. Between 2010 and 2015, spending on
basic education increased by 60 percent in real terms, and per
student funding levels have increased considerably.

The reform program has halted a long-term decline in public
basic education services. Most of the increases in education        While there have been improvements in education sector

 nd Outcomes
Introduction
Over the last decade, the Government of the Philippines
has embarked on an ambitious education reform program
to ensure that all Filipinos have the opportunity to obtain
the skills that they need to play a full and productive role
in society. The government has backed up these reforms,
particularly over the last ve years, with substantial
increases in investment in the sector. As a result, access to
basic education has increased, particularly for the poorest
households, and the overall learning environment has
improved.

While these improvements have halted a long-term decline
in education sector outcomes, signi cant challenges
remain. In particular, the share of national income devoted
to basic education has only recently returned to the
levels of the early 2000s, and spending per student in
the Philippines is still low compared to spending in other
middle-income countries. These relatively low levels
of spending per student are likely to have limited the
scope of the improvements in education outcomes over

For example, prior to 2012, all kindergarten teachers in public schools were classi ed as volunteer teachers and were not included in the reported data.
Classroom ratios are based on the total number of rooms used for teaching rather than on the total number of rooms in the school.

Basic Education Spending Trends and Outcomes




 Summ r
 The Government of the Philippines has made signi cant e orts to increase public investment in education to expand
 access and raise education quality. This note has shown that recent increases have led to modest improvements in key
 education inputs and outcomes. However, it has also found that additional investment will be needed to build on these
 recent gains, particularly in schools and locations serving poor and disadvantaged communities. Moreover, recent studies
 have raised concerns about the e ectiveness of existing systems to allocate and manage the increased resources. In
 particular, the World Bank’s recent public education expenditure review concluded that merely increasing allocations to
 the sector is unlikely to produce signi cant improvements in outcomes.

 These ndings suggest that tackling spending ine ciencies has the potential to raise education outcomes both by using
 existing resources better and by ensuring that further funding increases are used e ectively. While recent studies have
 highlighted many of the potential constraints to more e cient resource use, more detailed analytical work is needed
 to explore the main drivers of e ciency and inequality and to identify the changes that will be needed to increase the
 e ectiveness of public education investments.

Hirin nd Deplo in Te chers
Introduction
Over the last decade, research from many di erent
countries has demonstrated the important role played by
teachers in improving students’ learning and increasing
their competencies.1 Studies from countries as di erent as
the US and Indonesia have shown the enormous bene ts
that follow from having adequate and e ective teachers
working in a country’s schools. In Indonesia, a value-added
analysis of student learning outcomes found that the more
teachers know, the greater the improvements in the learning
competencies of primary and junior secondary students.2 In
the US, better teaching in elementary and secondary schools
has been shown to increase students’ college participation
rates, raise their subsequent earnings, and improve other
long-term outcomes.3

Ensuring that schools have enough teachers to provide educa-
tion in classes that are small enough to foster a good learning
environment is an important rst step. While the optimal size
of classes and the impact of reducing class sizes continue to
be debated, it is clear that very large class sizes are detrimental
to learning. Moreover, evidence from recent impact evalu-
ations in developing countries shows that, on the whole,
reducing class sizes in elementary schools improves learning.4
In the Philippines, the Department of Education (DepEd) has           that already have a su cient number while others continue

Box 1: Procedures for Measuring Teacher Absenteeism through Observation


  The approach to directly observing teacher attendance that was adopted in the Philippines PETS-QSDS survey followed
  procedures and protocols used in a number of other well-known surveys of provider absence in health and education.
  DepEd’s regional and division o ces were not informed in advance about which schools would be visited by the PETS-
  QSDS survey teams. Where it was not possible to arrive unannounced on the rst day of their school visit, survey teams
  would complete all other survey activities in the school and then come back to the school at a later date, usually after
  they had nished surveying the other sample schools in the city or municipality.
  The survey teams would arrive at the sampled schools at least one hour before the start of the school day. An enumerator
  was posted at each school entrance and at the o ce where teachers o cially recorded their arrival (on ngerprint readers
  or in manual records). As the teachers arrived, the team would record their full name and time of arrival.
  After the teacher observation, eld team supervisors transferred information from each enumerator’s observation
  schedule to the teacher roster for the school. As part of the wider school survey, the team collected information on all
  school teachers and identi ed those who were scheduled to be at the school at the time when the teacher observation
  exercise was undertaken. This yielded information on the number of teachers who were supposed to be present at the
  time of the observation to compare with the number of teachers who actually arrived. Information on the punctuality of
  each teacher was also recorded.
  The survey team did not monitor the activities of the teachers once they were in school. This made it impossible to
  discover how many teachers were actually present and teaching in the classrooms after they had arrived at the school
  as some other studies have done. Other studies have also checked for absenteeism at di erent times of the day to get a
  more thorough picture of teacher attendance throughout the day. However, given the size of many of the schools visited
  by the survey teams in the Philippines and the large amount of other school-level information that they collected, it was
  not feasible to do this as part of the PETS-QSDS study.

Box 2: The Current Process for Allocating and Hiring Teachers


                 The Department of Education’s Central O ce decides on the number of new teacher positions that will be allocated to
                 each elementary school and high school. It then submits the list to the Department of Budget and Management (DBM)
                 Central O ce, which in turn informs all of its regional o ces and provides them with copies of the NOSCA (notice of
                 organization, sta ng, and compensation action) for their region. The NOSCA speci es the number of new positions
                 for each teacher classi cation and provides the authorization for making salary payments. The DepEd Central O ce
                 similarly informs all of its regional o ces, which then inform the DepEd division o ces who are responsible for hiring
                 all elementary and high school teachers. Until 2014, the NOSCA for each division included new teacher positions for all
                 elementary schools in the division. However, in 2015 this practice was changed. Now the DepEd Central O ce allocates
                 speci c positions to each elementary school in an addendum to its main memo and this is also re ected in the NOSCA.

                 The hiring process begins when the DepEd division o ces advertise the vacancies. Once applications are received, the
                 division o ce checks that candidates are included on the Registry of Quali ed Applicants (RQA), a list of teachers who
                 are quali ed to ll these positions. The division o ces then interview candidates and select individuals to ll the new
                 positions. They then submit the names of the teachers whom they have selected to the regional o ces of the DBM.

                 There are special procedures for the DBM to release funds to DepEd division o ces to pay newly hired teachers in their
                  rst few weeks on the job. These procedures were initiated in 2012 to enable newly hired teachers to start being paid as
                 soon as they were hired because there were often delays in establishing them on the o cial payroll.

Introduction
Over the last decade, research from many di erent countries
has demonstrated the important role played by teachers in
increasing students’ learning and improving their academic
performance.1 Studies from countries as di erent as the
US and Indonesia have shown the enormous bene ts
that follow from having adequate and e ective teachers
working in a country’s schools. In Indonesia, a value-added
analysis of student learning outcomes found that the more
teachers know, the greater the improvements in the learning
competencies of primary and junior secondary students.2 In
the US, better teaching in elementary and secondary schools
has been shown to increase students’ college participation
rates, raise their subsequent earnings, and improve other
long-term outcomes.3

Providing teachers with good quality professional
development opportunities has been shown to be an
e ective way of increasing their competencies and
improving student learning outcomes in many di erent
settings. A series of systematic reviews have been
undertaken recently to assess the impact of di erent
interventions on student learning outcomes in developing
countries.4 One of the most consistent ndings from these
reviews has been the positive and signi cant impact that

Box 1: PETS-QSDS Approach to Assessing Teachers


  As part of the PETS-QSDS study, a nationally representative sample of 377 Grade 6 (elementary) teachers and 946 Grade
  10 (high school) teachers took two assessments:
  1. A subject-based content assessment for measuring teachers’ knowledge of the content of the K to 12 curriculum in English,
     Filipino, Mathematics, and Science. The assessments consisted of multiple choice and open-ended questions. Grade 6
     teachers were randomly assigned to complete one subject assessment, whereas Grade 10 teachers completed the test
     in the subject that they taught.
  2. A short form of the Philippine government’s Teacher Strengths and Needs Assessment (TSNA) based on the National
     Competency Based Teacher Standards (NCBTS). The TSNA assesses a teachers’ own perceptions of their pedagogical
     competence in the seven NCBTS domains: (i) social regard for learning; (ii) learning environment; (iii) diversity of
     learners; (iv) curriculum; (v) planning, assessing, and reporting; (vi) community links; and (vii) personal growth and
     development. Teachers were asked to rate their own level on a four-point scale from low to high on a set of statements
     related to the seven domains.
  The content tests were drawn from larger assessments used by the Research Center for Teacher Quality (RCTQ) at the
  Philippines Normal University. The results of the PETS-QSDS tests are consistent with ndings from a larger regionally
  representative study conducted by the RCTQ.
  Two scoring rubrics were used for the content tests:
  1. Binary credit - questions were marked either correct or incorrect.
  2. Partial credit - each question was scored on a four-category scale, with 1 being “incorrect,” 2 being “displays some
     understanding, skill, and knowledge,” 3 being “displays a higher level of understanding, skill, and knowledge,” and 4
     being “completely correct.”
  Responses coded 1, 2 or 3 on the partial credit scale were recorded as 0 on the binary scale and those coded as 4 on
  the partial credit scale were recoded to 1 on the binary credit scale. In the case of the multiple choice items, the choices
  provided represented di erent levels of the teacher’s understanding of the competency being tested. For open-ended
  questions, the graders marking the tests interpreted written responses according to the four-point scale.
  The binary credit scores provided a clear picture of whether teachers displayed a thorough understanding of the
  competencies included in the curriculum. The partial credit scale, on the other hand, provided a more detailed
  assessment of how far teachers were from a complete understanding of the underlying competencies and from having
  the necessary knowledge to teach e ectively.
  Given the assessment categories used by teachers to assess their own competencies, the TSNA was scored using a rubric
  similar to the partial credit scale. To account for di erences in the di culty of test items, a one-parameter Rasch model
  was used for both the subject content tests and the TSNA to transform the raw test scores into scores (logits) that ranked
  teachers according to their underlying ability.
  Full details of the instruments used and the methods for analyzing the data are available in RCTQ and SiMERR, (2015)
  “PETS-QSDS nal report”.

Box 2: Indonesia’s Integrated Framework for Teacher Accountability


  The Ministry of Education in Indonesia is starting to implement its integrated Teacher Professional Management System
  (TPMS). The system consists of three main elements:

  •	 Competency Testing. Teachers are expected to undergo a competency assessment to identify their strengths and
     weaknesses. The competency test is focused on teachers’ subject knowledge, which has been shown to be strongly
     related to student learning outcomes. Performance on the competency test is expected to be used as one of the key
     criteria for teachers’ career advancement.

  •	 Performance Appraisal. A school-based scheme has been piloted that links the outcomes of teachers’ annual performance
     appraisal to increments in the salary scale in order to give them an incentive to improve their performance.

  •	 Continuous Professional Development. This component covers a number of di erent aspects of in-service teacher training
     including the induction of teachers into schools, mentoring, and the activities of local teacher working groups.

  The aim of the TPMS is to link these three components together and make teachers more accountable for both their
  work performance through the annual appraisal and for taking advantage of in-service training opportunities. By scoring
  well on their appraisals and by participating in training, teachers can earn credit points that are ultimately linked to salary
  increases and promotion. While the TPMS is not yet being fully implemented, it represents a major development in
  terms of the provision of incentives and is expected to increase the motivation of teachers to improve how they teach.
  Integrating continuous professional development into the TPMS framework has also provided the government with the

Polic Note 3: Buildin Better
Le rnin Environments
Introduction
Evidence from around the world has shown that improving
school infrastructure leads to better learning outcomes.1
For example, a 2011 review of the economics literature
over the last 20 years showed that the availability of basic
school infrastructure (such as classrooms, desks, and chairs)
and facilities (such as electricity, libraries, and blackboards)
is frequently associated with better student learning
achievement.2 These ndings have been backed up by
a systematic review of recent impact evaluations, which
showed that infrastructure investments have a positive
impact on school enrollment rates, attendance rates, and
learning achievement.3 Also, research in the Philippines has
shown that reducing the number of students per classroom
is associated with better student learning outcomes,
particularly in rural schools.4

Ensuring that schools have adequate infrastructure of
good quality is a central pillar of government e orts to
improve education outcomes in the Philippines. Over the
last ve years, the government has been conducting a
renewed reform e ort to increase access to good quality
basic education. It has supported these reform e orts with
signi cant increases in public spending on education. In
real terms, school infrastructure spending in 2015 was ve          In assessing government systems, it primarily focused on
times higher than in 2010 and has been used to reduce              projects managed by the Department of Public Works and

operating multiple shifts.                                         infrastructure projects.

The purpose of this policy note is to provide a snapshot of        The note nds that, while there is a continuing need to invest
the state of existing school infrastructure in the Philippines     in school infrastructure, any increases need to be combined

Box 1: Responsibilities for Joint DPWH-DepEd Projects


       Each year, DepEd identi es the extent of school infrastructure needs using the Basic Education Information System (BEIS)
       and develops a list of school-level projects to be carried out by the DPWH using the infrastructure budget appropriations
       for the year. Once the DepEd central o ce has selected the projects, it informs the regional and divisional o ces who in
       turn notify the selected schools.
       The Schools Division Superintendent (SDS) and the Schools Division Engineer (SDE) within DepEd Division o ces are
       responsible for coordinating with their DPWH counterparts on the procurement and implementation of projects. The
       main stages where coordination occurs are:
       •	 The DPWH prepares the program of works, undertakes procurement, and implements the works in accordance with
          DepEd’s standard designs and speci cations.
       •	 The SDS approves the program of works prepared by the DPWH.
       •	 The sta of DepEd’s Physical Facilities and Schools Engineering Division (PFSED) and the Division Physical Facilities
          Coordinator (DPFC) supervise the DPWH’s procurement, monitor the implementation of the projects, and conduct joint
          inspections of the completed works.
       •	 The DPWH, DepEd’s Physical Facilities sta , and the school principals are expected to carry out a joint inspection of the
          completed works.
       •	 The DepEd SDS and the DPWH District Engineer both approve the Certi cate of Completion for each completed
          project.

Box 2: Mexico’s Better Schools Program


  The Better Schools Program (BSP) in Mexico was a key component of a broader education reform program aimed
  at improving the quality of basic education. Between 2008 and 2012 the program carried out school infrastructure
  improvement projects in 19,400 of the neediest basic education schools in Mexico.
  The involvement and participation of each school community through its parent association was a major thrust of
  the BSP. A central government body was in charge of making payments to contractors and of overseeing the overall
  implementation of the program, but the schools’ parents associations acted as the legal client and was responsible for:
  •	 Commenting on, making decisions, and supervising the school project
  •	 Contributing to the transparency and presentation of nancial accounts
  •	 Verifying that the building materials and improvements were of good quality
  •	 Approving all stages of the planning and implementation of the project.
  After the Ministry of Education made an initial selection of schools in need of urgent repair, technical facilitators worked
  with each school to complete a technical assessment of its requirements that formed the basis of the project. Prospective
  contractors aiming to implement BSP projects were required to go through a rigorous pre-screening exercise, after which an
  approved list of contractors was drawn up and these companies were randomly selected to implement packages of projects.
  A recent assessment of the program noted:
  •	 The process of identifying priority schools and working with the schools’ parents associations to undertake the
     necessary work was e cient and exible enough to adapt to each school’s circumstances

M n ement
Introduction
In recent times, many countries around the world have be-
gun to devolve more authority and resources to schools in an
e ort to improve teaching and learning conditions. School-
based management (SBM) reforms of this kind are seen as a
strategy to improve education quality by bringing decision-
making closer to local communities and by strengthening
accountability between schools and the parents and children
that they serve.

Recent studies from many di erent countries have shown
that school-based management can have a positive impact
in terms of increasing access to education and improving
learning outcomes.1 However, these reviews have also shown
that the type of SBM reforms being implemented varies
enormously from country to country and that the reforms
can take some time to yield results. Moreover, their success
depends critically on parental participation, political support,
and e ective implementation.

In the early 2000s, the Government of the Philippines
began to introduce school-based management reforms,
which have had a positive impact on student learning
outcomes.2 A key aspect of the success of these reforms has
been the provision of ever-increasing levels of operational
funding to the school level coupled with the devolution
of greater school autonomy over the use of these funds.3
                                                                   The note shows that the key elements of an e ective

Box 1: Measuring the Implementation of School-based Management in the Philippines


  DepEd rst introduced a self-assessment tool in 2009 to help schools to improve their school-based management
  practices. In 2013, it introduced a new self-assessment tool that asked schools to rate the extent to which they had
  implemented SBM based on 22 indicators that could be converted into an aggregate three-point scale as follows:

  1. Level 1 – developing: Schools have developed structures and mechanisms that have increased community participation
     and improved learning outcomes to an acceptable level.

  2. Level 2 – maturing: Schools have introduced and sustained continuous improvements that have led to community
     participation and have signi cantly improved student learning outcomes.

  3. Level 3 – advanced: Schools have fully implemented a school-based management system that fully involves the local
     community and is self-renewing and self-sustaining.

  In the PETS-QSDS study, schools were also asked to identify any weaknesses they might have in six aspects of school-
  based management de ned in the original 2009 assessment. These six aspects are related to the three dimensions of
  school-based management assessed in this policy note, which are:

  1. Autonomy. School principals were asked about strengths and weaknesses in their school leadership, their ability to

Box 2: An Evaluation of School-based Management Training Activities in Indonesia


  In 2011, Indonesia embarked on a massive program to train school principals and school committee members on the
  core elements of school-based management, including planning, budgeting, and nancial management. Approximately
  650,000 people attended a three-day training event held in di erent locations across Indonesia. An evaluation of the
  program came to a number of important conclusions:

  •	 A follow-up survey of participants found that the materials covered under the training program were relevant to the
     needs of schools in terms of school-based management.

  •	 The training program contributed to a number of changes at the school level particularly in terms of school
     governance. These positive ndings were con rmed by interviews with parents and community members, which
     revealed that schools were using discretionary funds in a transparent and accountable way.

  •	 Schools reported that they were better able to follow the central government’s guidelines for reporting on their use of
     discretionary funds, which increased transparency and accountability.

  •	 The follow-up survey highlighted overall improvements in the management of school operational funding, particularly
     by school committee members.

  •	 The quality of training varied greatly across regions. There was a lack of supervision of the training events at the district
     level, which resulted in di erences in the length of the training, class sizes, the capacity of trainers, and the quality of
     training facilities.

  The majority of trainees interviewed in the follow-up survey felt that more guidance and assistance was needed to help
  them to implement the training elements in their own schools.

Box 3: An Evaluation of School-based Management Training Activities in Uganda


  A randomized controlled trial in Uganda explored the impact of di erent interventions that used school report cards as a
  way for school managing committees to monitor performance. The two interventions that were tested were as follows:

  •	 A standard scorecard. School committee members were trained on how to use a school-level report card developed by
     education o cials and NGOs.

  •	 A participatory scorecard. School committee members were trained and helped to produce a school-level report card
     that they themselves had developed and that included indicators of school progress agreed upon with the school.

  Interventions like these can be expected to improve education outcomes by providing local communities with the
  information needed to hold their schools accountable. They can also encourage schools to improve their performance
  either through social pressure or through a closer collaboration between the school and community.

  The experiment found that the participatory scorecard approach had a statistically signi cant impact on education
  outcomes. In terms of student learning, schools where the participatory scorecard was introduced had a statistically
  signi cant advantage in primary school test scores of approximately 0.2 standard deviations over control schools. Teacher
  attendance also improved, with teachers working in participatory scorecard schools being 13 percentage points more
  likely to be present than teachers in control schools.

  The results for the standard scorecard approach were less promising. The experiment found no statistically signi cant
  e ects on student learning although it did appear to have a positive e ect on the attendance of some teachers.

  The authors argue that the better outcomes for the participatory scorecard were primarily the result of increased
  cooperation between the school and the local community rather than because of di erences in the information
  contained in the di erent scorecards. These ndings suggest that using participatory methods to develop school report
  cards may improve education outcomes and strengthen the supporting role played by school committees.

government has provided directly to schools to support their

increased by 45 percent in real terms, demonstrating the
government’s commitment both to increasing operational
funding and to providing schools with the funding that they
need to implement their own improvement plans.1

Box 1: Approach to Tracking


        In order to track the ow and use of MOOE funds, the study team obtained from o cial records maintained by Division
        o ces the amount they received for school MOOE, and on the amount they reported downloading to each PETS-QSDS
        sample school and for each MOOE advance. The records also included details on the check number, the date of check,
        the date on which the check was collected by schools, and the date on which the corresponding liquidation report was
        submitted. The same set of information was collected from records maintained by schools. In addition, the team collected
        information on the types of expenditures for which the schools used their MOOE funds from school liquidation reports
        corresponding to each MOOE advance downloaded to the school from the division o ce.


Only 40 percent of parents were aware that schools receive                         reporting on funds. The survey used o cial records (such
MOOE funds, and the majority did not know how MOOE                                 as notices of cash advancements, checks, and liquidation

Box 2: The Pupil Premium in England


 In 2011, the United Kingdom government introduced a “pupil premium.” This initiative provides government-funded
 schools within England with additional per-student funding to raise the attainment of disadvantaged pupils and to
 narrow the gap between them and other students. In 2014/15, each school received an additional £1,300 (US$2,031) for
 primary-aged students and £935 (US$1,461) for secondary-aged students. Rough calculations suggest that an average
 sized secondary school would receive approximately £200,000 (US$312,500) in additional funding through the pupil
 premium, which is the equivalent of ve full-time teachers.
 The main criteria used to calculate schools’ eligibility for this extra funding is the number of students in the school that
 have received free school meals over the last six years. Head teachers and school governing bodies are accountable for
 the use of these funds in two ways. First, performance tables that outline the performance of disadvantaged students
 compared to their peers are made available to the public. Second, schools are required to publish details online each year
 of how they have used the premium and what impact it has had.
 Schools typically use the additional resources to hire more teachers and teaching assistants in order to introduce
 special programs for disadvantaged students. In addition, the resources are frequently used to allow eligible students to
 participate fully in after-school activities.
 A recent study of the implementation of the pupil premium found that:
 •	 Schools are using the funding e ectively to improve learning outcomes of disadvantaged students and narrowing
    learning disparities.
 •	 The best schools combine targeted interventions with robust tracking to evaluate their e ectiveness.
 •	 School governing bodies take strategic responsibility for student targeting and hold school leaders accountable.
 •	 Challenges remain in schools with weak leadership, including weak governing bodies.

Introduction
Many developing countries have devolved the responsibility
for education services to local governments in an e ort to
improve educational quality and make public spending more
e cient. Advocates of decentralization have argued that
bringing decision-making closer to schools makes public policy
more responsive to local needs, strengthens accountability,
and fosters innovation. In some countries, decentralization has
gone further in that schools have been given responsibility
for developing their own improvement plans and a degree of
autonomy over the use of their resources.

While the Philippines decentralized some public services
to local governments in the early 1990s, basic education
remains largely under the control of the national
government. The 1991 local government code devolved
responsibility for many basic services to local government
units (provinces, cities, municipalities, and barangays1)
including primary health care, hospital care, social welfare
services, and a range of environmental and agricultural
services. Local governments’ responsibilities in the eld
of education were largely limited to maintaining basic
education infrastructure and funding sports activities. The

education responsibilities comes primarily from a surcharge       Philippines. Using data that the PETS-QSDS team has

Policy Note 6: Assessing the Role Played by Local Government in Supporting Basic Education




Box 1: Legal Framework for the Role Played by LGUs and their Local School Boards in Basic Education


  The Local Government Code (LGC) issued in 1991 (Republic Act 7160) set out the legal framework for the role of LGUs in
  basic education. It initiated the creation of provincial, city, and municipal local school boards (LSBs) as the main bodies
  for making decisions over the use of local government education funds. Each LSB is co-chaired by the head of the local
  government and either the DepEd’s School Division Superintendent (for provincial and city LSBs) or the Public School
  District Supervisor (for municipal LSBs). Members of the parent-teacher associations and representatives of teachers and
  non-teaching sta are also represented on the LSB.
  The main functions of the LSBs are: (i) to develop the annual school board budget in accordance with the amount of
  revenue in the SEF and with their determination of the supplementary maintenance and operating needs of public
  schools covered by the LSB; (ii) to authorize SEF disbursements; (iii) to act as an advisory committee for the local council;
  and (iv) to recommend school name changes.
  The LGC and a series of joint circulars from DepEd, the Department of Management and Budget, and the Department
  of the Interior and Local Government have set out the main priorities for the Special Education Funds, including the
  provision of additional teachers, the construction and repair of school buildings, other capital investments for schools,
  educational research, the purchase of books and instructional materials, equipment purchases, sports, and other extra-
  curricular activities.

Box 2: The Seal of Good Local Governance

  Building on earlier attempts to promote greater local government transparency and accountability in the use of public
  funds, the national government introduced the Seal of Good Local Governance in 2014. In order to receive the Seal,
  local governments must demonstrate good performance in three core areas (good nancial housekeeping, disaster
  preparedness, and social protection) and in at least one essential area (business friendliness and competitiveness, peace
  and order, and environmental management).
  Support for basic education falls under social protection. In order for a local government to receive the seal, it must demon-
  strate that it has completed 70 percent of the local school board’s annual plan and that the plan is aligned with schools’ own
  improvement programs. The DepEd superintendent currently certi es the achievement of these two conditions.
  Recipients of the Seal are also eligible for the Performance Challenge Fund (PCF), which provides additional funding for
  local governments to pursue their own priorities. In 2015, 41 of the 80 provinces, 28 of the 143 cities, and 170 of the 1,491
  municipalities were awarded the Seal.

Drivers of Public School Perform nce
 nd Eﬀicienc
Introduction
After a long period of stagnation, public spending on
education in the Philippines has increased signi cantly.
Between 2005 and 2015, education spending more than
doubled in real terms, with much of it being devoted to
increasing the number of teachers and improving school
infrastructure. As a result, student-teacher and student-
classroom ratios have improved signi cantly. For example, the
average student-teacher ratio in high schools fell from 40:1 in
2005 to 27:1 in 2014.

Despite increased spending and improvements in key input
ratios, improvements in learning outcomes have been
relatively modest so far. Studies have shown this to be the
case in many other countries as well. Clearly spending is only
one of a host of factors that can a ect the ability of schools
to improve the academic outcomes of their students. Some
of these factors fall within the control of the education
system and schools such as the provision and quality of
education inputs and the e ectiveness of school-based
management. Others such as the characteristics of students
and their households are beyond the control of schools, but
all of these factors a ect the e ciency of resource use and
education outcomes.
                                                                  school infrastructure. It also found that student and school

Box 1: Finalizing Datasets for Analysis


  The World Bank study team made the following revisions to the datasets when conducting preliminary analyses using
  the data submitted by TNS in July 2015. All of the nal analyses for the policy notes were conducted using the revised
  datasets.

  •	 Six non-implementing high schools were accidentally administered the HSIU2 questionnaire meant for implementing
     (IU) high schools. For variables that overlap between the HS2 and HSIU2 questionnaires, the data from the HSIU2
     questionnaire for these six schools were appended to the HS2 data. All information in the HSIU2 dataset for these six
     schools were then removed.

  •	 An IU high school that was not in the sample was accidentally interviewed in place of Baguio High School of Agriculture
     - Tambobong Annex (which was in the original sample). All of the variables corresponding to this school in the high
     school, teacher, GPTA, and household questionnaires were set to missing.

  •	 Non-zero values for MOOE amounts in the division-level data were recorded for ve IU high schools. Following phone
     calls to verify their IU status and whether they had received any MOOE funds from the division o ce or from the DBM,
     the study team set the variables for MOOE amounts in the division data for four of these schools to missing as they did
     not report receiving any MOOE from divisions.

  •	 Adjustments were made to the teacher and RCTQ assessment datasets. Teachers who do not teach kindergarten,
     Grade 6, or Grade 10 were dropped as the analyses on teachers were focused on teachers who teach these grades. In
     addition, some teachers who had not been included in the “teacher roster” in the school questionnaires but had been
     interviewed were also dropped.



Use of Other D t Sources
While most of the analysis was conducted using the                information gathered in the study. Table 6 lists all of
datasets from this PETS-QSDS study, the study team                these other data sources that were used in all seven
often had to use other data sources to supplement the             policy notes.
