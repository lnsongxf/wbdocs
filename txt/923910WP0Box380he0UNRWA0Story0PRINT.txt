Since 2009, as part of the World Bank–supported Middle East and North Africa (MENA) Regional
Network for Education Research, the Palestinian Authority Ministry of Education (covering the West Bank
and Gaza) has been examining learning outcomes at United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA)
schools. It found that in 2007 UNRWA students outperformed students attending public schools by more
than a year’s worth of learning in the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational
Achievement (IEA)’s Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) assessment. This
was also found to be true in Jordan. While in 2011 both the UNRWA and public systems reflected declines
in TIMSS scores, UNRWA schools still showed a significant student performance advantage. Given the
resource-constrained administration and the various sources of adversity facing students and teachers —
especially refugees, who often suffer disproportionate physical, emotional, and psychological
disadvantages—the findings raise questions about what lies behind such results.

This mixed methods research study was undertaken to better understand the reasons for success at
UNRWA schools and their positive variation from comparable public schools. Econometric techniques
were used to analyze international (TIMSS and Programme for International Student Assessment, or PISA)
and national learning achievement data. Pedagogical practices and classroom time-on-task were observed
using structured methods (Stallings model). Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER)
tools were used to better understand the policies and implementation strategies for school and teacher
management and for monitoring and evaluation. Additionally, qualitative data were collected and analyzed
in line with an education resilience conceptual framework to better uncover factors that help students
develop the skills to learn despite the adversities they face.

The goal of this study is to allow us to better understand how a school system can operate efficiently under
adversity. The results of this work will be useful in identifying relevant policies in the region. These
findings will also be shared with other countries in conflict or post-conflict situations to share findings on
how schools can remain effective, relevant and perform well in difficult contexts.

Our community is interested in and appreciates learning. The school ensures the
students like going there and enjoy the learning that happens. The goal of the
school is to create well-educated students. My family also has a big role in
learning, and they will be happy when I finish my learning and graduate from the
university with high grades.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: THE UNRWA STORY
Palestine refugees are achieving higher-than-average learning outcomes in spite of the adverse
circumstances they live under. Their education system—the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for
Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA)—operates one of the largest non-governmental school
systems in the Middle East. It manages nearly 700 schools, has hired 17,000 staff, educates more than
500,000 refugee students each year, and operates in five areas, including the West Bank, Gaza, Jordan,
Lebanon, and Syria. Contrary to what might be expected from a resource-constrained administration
serving refugee students who continually face a multitude of adversities, UNRWA students outperform
public schools in the three regions—the West Bank, Gaza, and Jordan—by a year’s worth of learning.

This study uses a mixed methods research approach1, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative
research to address the complexity of the research question and its exploratory nature, namely how do
UNRWA schools continually and consistently outperform public schools? This study was prepared using
the following tools, techniques, and data collection:

            Econometric techniques were used to analyze learning achievement data, including international
             (TIMSS and PISA) and national student assessment data.
            The Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER) tools and rubrics were used to
             assess different system components, such as teacher effectiveness, school autonomy, and student
             assessments.
            Stallings classroom observations provided a structured method to compare teachers’ and students’
             interactions.
            Qualitative data collected through interviews captured the lived experiences of a sample of
             UNRWA students.

These tools were applied through a concurrent research process (Figure 1), constituted through a mixed
methods research design that led to integrated findings.

It is important to recognize the methodological and practical limitations of this study to establish its
relevance to other education systems and contexts of adversity. The UNRWA system covers five regions,
of which this study examines three: West Bank, Gaza, and Jordan. Thus, the findings represent factors
that appear to be working within a system, but they do not imply that the system as a whole is achieving
positive results. That would require additional data collection and analysis for Lebanon and Syria. Nor do
the findings attempt to negate or discount the incidence of falling standards in UNRWA schools in recent
years. Moreover, the international assessment data point to UNRWA’s performance in relation to the
public system in some of the host countries. But the data do not cover the inputs and processes in public
school systems, which may differ from those in UNRWA schools, so they cannot be used to pass
judgment on what these public systems may face.

International assessment data from 2007 was analyzed to assess learning outcomes of these schools while
the explanatory data, to which the bulk of this study is dedicated, was collected in 2011. Results of 2011
test scores, however, demonstrated a decrease in learning outcomes for both the public sector and
UNRWA schools. While overall standards have decreased, a controlled analysis of these results adjusted
for the same range of variables as the 2007 results still illustrates UNRWA’s learning outcomes to be
significantly higher for the West Bank, Gaza, and Jordan. This situation aligns to our understanding of
resilience not as an outcome in itself but as a process in contexts of adversity. Both the 2007 and 2011
data suggest that the UNRWA system is gauging and promoting a set of assets and opportunities which
better support its students to ‘navigate’ the adversities they face. Even in rapidly changing contexts, and
with concomitant results, assessing these assets and opportunities is crucial to understanding why
outcomes are achieved and how to support such processes.

Main takeaways from the research

UNRWA schools continually and consistently outperform public schools by a margin equivalent to
more than one additional year of learning.

This is achieved as a result of the way these schools recruit, prepare, and support teachers; because of
instructional practices and pedagogy in the classroom; and because of school leadership, accountability,
and mutual support. This has created a distinguished learning community centered on the student. Of
note:

   UNRWA selects, prepares, and supports its education staff to pursue high learning outcomes.
   Time-on-task is high in UNRWA schools, and this time is used more effectively than in public
    schools.
   UNRWA schools have a world-class assessment and accountability system.
   UNRWA schools are part of a wider community and culture of learning that supports the child and
    ensures that the education received is meaningful and relevant.

1. UNRWA schools increase student performance.

Analysis points to significantly higher scores in relation to the mastery of curriculum content and
cognitive learning domains. Moreover, more UNRWA students achieve the international benchmarks in
math and science. On average, UNRWA students in Jordan, West Bank, and Gaza achieve scores 23 to 80
points higher than their peers at public schools, even after controlling for student characteristics and for
urban or rural contexts.

Performance of UNRWA students is higher than their peers despite two important parental and
teacher characteristics.

One would expect that socioeconomic status or parental education would be highly associated with
performance, as documented in the education literature. But UNRWA students outperform their peers in
public schools despite their socioeconomic disadvantages. Differentiating factors include student self-
confidence, as well as parental support and involvement in school activities. Figure 2 shows how
increased parental involvement and support leads to improved student performance.

                     Figure 2: Parents are more involved in UNRWA schools
                                          51%

One would also expect that teachers’ academic qualifications would be associated with student
performance, but this is not the case. Students at UNRWA schools outperformed students at public
schools despite having teachers with the same years of service and degrees completed as their
counterparts in public schools. The most important factors in explaining this performance gap were
teachers’ confidence in teaching the subject matter, job satisfaction, and on-going professional
development and training. At UNRWA schools, 75 percent of teachers are either satisfied or highly
satisfied with their jobs, compared with roughly 50 percent in public schools (Figure 3, below).

From the perspective of UNRWA students, teachers demonstrate their satisfaction and pedagogical
confidence through their interaction with students inside and outside of the classroom. This is epitomized
by the responses of two students in Gaza who, when asked what helps them to learn, responded:

        The teacher, the teacher is a role model. He is teaching us the right things and does so in an
        excellent way, using worksheets, media, and group work.
                                                                Male student, Gaza

        Teachers always support me and make me participate in competitions such as math
        competitions in Gaza and Khan-Younis. And my English teacher always asks me to
        write essays in English because she wants to motivate me. I also always get rewards
        from school, which encourages me to work harder and to study harder: When you
        love your teacher, you always try your best to get high marks in her class.
                                                                 Female student, Gaza

The UNRWA advantage in learning outcomes—despite apparent commonalities with public schools—is
25 points, a quarter of a standard deviation, or about a year’s worth of learning. Once other factors are
controlled for, the differential declines but remains at 26 points, which is equivalent to a full year of
learning (as shown in Figure 4, below).

These higher learning outcomes are achieved teaching the same curriculum as the public schools in their
host countries, at a lower unit cost and with unstable funding that could decline from one year to the next.
The cost per student in UNRWA schools is 20 percent less than in public schools in Jordan. Figure 5
demonstrates that the cost per student in UNRWA schools is much less as compared with public schools.

2. UNRWA schools provide critical support for teachers and management.

UNRWA schools use the curriculum of the host authority in a given Field of Operation. Therefore,
teachers and associated school management structures, as the main mechanism for implementing the
curriculum, can provide a source of variation to understand differences in learning outcomes. Based on
this, we analyzed data on selection, preparation, and support of teachers as key learning support attributes
of the UNRWA system.

UNRWA is more successful at attracting and recruiting high quality teachers.

UNRWA teachers’ colleges attract the best high school graduates to enroll free of charge and with
guaranteed employment after completion and upon meeting the high standards set. Prior to recruitment,
UNRWA teachers are also interviewed and are required to pass a written exam. As a result, the UNRWA
system appears to have created a sound built-in quality control that is lacking in the public system.

Clear expectations are set for UNRWA teachers, who receive guidance and mentoring services.

UNRWA teachers are provided with explicit standards regarding what students must know and be able to
do, and receive direction on how to achieve these standards. Teachers also benefit from guidance on how
to effectively use their time in the classroom, and there is a clear and official focus on time on task.
Teachers additionally support the development and implementation of school plans, design curricular
material, and take part in the evaluation of activities.

UNRWA has more mandated ongoing professional development and orientation for teachers than
public schools.

Although both public and UNRWA school systems require at least four years of college education to
become a primary school teacher, UNRWA also requires classroom experience (built into the curriculum
at their teachers’ colleges). In addition, all new teachers must complete a mandatory two-year intensive
and structured training program focused on classroom instruction after they are hired.

Teachers at UNRWA schools are supported by well-qualified, well-prepared, and experienced school
principals.

The UNRWA system invests heavily in preparing and developing qualified school principals through
programs designed to support school-based leadership through coursework and mentoring. School
principals are required to evaluate teacher performance and provide guidance for curriculum and
teaching-related tasks. Student narratives point to a keen awareness of their principal’s abilities. A female
student in Gaza spoke of her principal in this way:

        When we have difficulty understanding a teacher, she listens to us and talks to
        the teacher. She tries her best to solve the problem. She also maintains peace
        at school. She provides the atmosphere necessary for us to learn. She urges
        teachers to come to school early to give reinforcement classes. She also urges


                                                     6
        students to be kind to each other and help each other…in addition to giving us
        advice about how to prepare for exams…
                                                                Female student, Gaza

3. The UNRWA system has fewer management layers and is more accountable for student outcomes
   than public schools.

    UNRWA and public schools are similar in many aspects; both have limited autonomy with regard to
    budget, financing, and personnel. But they differ significantly in terms of assessment and
    accountability—UNRWA has a world class assessment system and is more accountable than the
    public schools (as shown in Table 1, below).

      Table 1: Comparison between UNRWA and Public Systems policies in school management &
      autonomy

UNRWA has established a well-defined and carefully implemented accountability system to assess and
support teaching and learning. Assessments are a priority and are disseminated to teachers (to inform
lesson plans and instructional practices) and to policy makers. Teachers are also required to participate in
internal and external monitoring and evaluation. While both public and UNRWA evaluation systems
include classroom observations and multiple criteria, UNRWA evaluations are more rigorous and
frequent. Professional development and performance evaluations are requirements to remain in the
teaching profession within the UNRWA system, with incentives for good performance and sanctions for
poor performance.

4. UNRWA schools promote high-quality teaching and classroom time.

UNRWA teachers, in addition to being well prepared and supported, operate differently in the classroom
than those in the public system. The proportion of time spent on learning activities in UNRWA schools
compares favorably with successful systems in developed countries. UNRWA schools appear to use this
time to engage students through confidently led collaborative activities, discussions, and assignments, all
promoting greater student participation.


                                                             7
There is less wasted time in UNRWA schools.

Quality teaching and instruction are the main focuses at UNRWA schools. In Jordan, 90 percent of
teachers’ working time is dedicated to teaching, compared with less than 60 percent at public schools.
Teachers in UNRWA schools are also supported by mentors to improve their instructional capacities.
There are fewer incidences of students being off-task in UNRWA classrooms as a result.

Teacher practices at UNRWA schools reflect a high level of confidence to teach various subjects
through a variety of methods.

Teachers in UNRWA schools seem to have confidence to engage with multiple approaches rather than a
single pedagogical tool. They facilitate learning through innovative techniques supported by multiple
classroom materials and teaching aids. Illustrative materials relevant to subject content are also posted in
classrooms.

Teachers in UNRWA schools implement more interactive learning activities, discussions, and
assignments.

UNRWA classrooms provide greater opportunities for discussions and debates, as well as for asking
questions than in public schools (Figure 6). There are more cooperative activities on projects and group
work. Students are more engaged working on assignments and classwork such as solving problems. The
focus is on interaction and problem solving, rather than on lecturing, as at public schools.

Students in UNRWA classrooms participate at higher levels than in public schools through structured
activities.

Students in UNRWA schools spend more time taking notes and collaborating on learning activities. In
this way they are able to interact further with the subject material and may be more encouraged to
synthesize, analyze, and prioritize. They are also able to interact more with each other. Indeed, peer
academic support was an important theme in the student narratives. As one explained:

               … teaching is excellent; they give information in a good way to the students
               and nothing is left out of our learning. They ask us if there is any need to
               explain things again. The teachers make peer groups and each group has an
               excellent student in it who teaches the others. I was in one of these groups and
               had four students with me.
                                                                            Male student, Gaza

One incentive for collaborative learning may be that graded activities assessed by the teacher are more
common in UNRWA schools. Students in UNRWA schools are not only engaged in a variety of functions
during class, but the percentage of classes in which students work on graded activities is higher. Student
work is assessed, and feedback expected. Quizzes and exams are common, and teachers are more likely to

review material when preparing for a test in UNRWA schools. Such formative assessments were
observed in about half of the classes in UNRWA schools in Gaza.

5. UNRWA schools successfully create a community and culture of learning.

UNRWA’s positive learning outcomes seem to be supported by a close interaction between school and
community actors, as revealed in the qualitative data for this study. UNRWA schools have become key
entities that form part of a broader culture of learning for Palestine refugees. Education provides meaning
and relevance for children and youth in contexts of adversity. This is grounded in close interactions
among parents, family members, teachers, and principals. Such school-community structures seem to
evolve organically and are supported by classroom practice, school management, and system priorities
(through explicit policies, rules, institutions, and dedicated resources). The resilience lens used to analyze
data from student interviews identified five mechanisms in UNRWA schools that promote learning in the
face of difficult living situations.

Education provides a collective meaning and purpose for Palestine refugees in the face of adversity.

For the Palestine refugee community, with over 60 years of experience facing various causes of adversity,
parental and community participation in school seems to be collectively valued and expected. This
collective participation in quality education appears to have evolved as a way to face the difficulties
experienced as a community. Students referred time and again to the social, cultural, and economic
importance of being well-educated, as noted in the following indicative responses:

        What motivates me is that I have a goal in my life, which is to become a
        doctor and work here and serve my country, Gaza-Palestine. I want to become
        an important person in the society, and being a doctor means being an
        important person in our society.
                                                      Male student, Gaza

        What drives me to learn is that I want to be an engineer or a doctor; and I
        don't want to be like my father, without a job or a certificate; and to improve
        the situation in my home, and increase my country's level.
                                                         Male student, Jordan

        School is a place where we come to learn in order to achieve our goals in life,
        especially since we are under occupation. I tell all occupied countries that
        knowledge is the only way to face occupation.
                                                       Female student, West Bank

UNRWA staff understand and are able to model a positive identity and well-being for their students in
the midst of challenge.

The sense of community appears to be strengthened by the fact that UNRWA teachers originate from the
same at-risk population, are part of the same communities as students, and have themselves been through


                                                     10
the UNRWA system. In sharing these difficult living situations, teachers are accessible role models for
their students, providing them with motivation, a sense of responsibility, and kindness and support in
times of need. Students recognize and value their teachers’ understanding and assistance in times of need.
Teachers, therefore, provide real-life examples to demonstrate that education can contribute to a person’s
identity and well-being in times of adversity; as one girl in Jordan explains:

        For me, when I see my teachers, I wish to be one of them…I wish to be one of
        the teachers. When I look at a teacher, I ask: What made her reach this level?
        I’m sure she studied, and it was hard. Our computer teacher… always
        encourages us; she gives us advice on how to study, and when I follow it, I
        achieve what I want…I want to say that when I look at my teacher , I wish to
        become like her.
                                                          Female student, Jordan

The school system supports students’ competence in the midst of adversity through academic guidance
and socio-emotional support.

Effective teaching strategies require socio-emotional support and a caring and supportive environment in
which to learn. This dual integrated focus on academic and affective guidance provides students with a
sense of control and competence through education, which they see as relevant to their contexts. A non-
dualistic approach to education that integrates knowledge and values also appears to reflect the longer-
term guiding principles espoused by UNRWA (a vision of empowerment and human development). This
was aptly expressed by a female student in Jordan:

        Teaching is an essential thing. I have been at this school since first grade now.
        Teaching is really important and so is meeting other classmates and making
        friends. When it comes to the headmistress, she cares about discipline,
        psychological support, and students being responsible. When it comes to
        teachers, they always support us psychologically, teach us how to study, help us
        with our homework, help our mothers, set plans for exams, and prepare our
        lessons. In general, they guide us in many useful ways so we can study well.
                                                                Female student, Jordan

Learning is supported by many actors including teachers, students, peers, and family members.

Because UNRWA serves a refugee community, relations between school staff and families extend beyond
the boundaries of the school campus. Students report multiple sources of support in their learning through
these relationships, especially from family members and peers. This echoes much of what is well known
about healthy child development (Figure 7). Such community participation in the UNRWA system
implies a wider organic process—beyond traditional top-down structures and models for school
management.

UNRWA’s close partnership with the refugee community creates shared accountability for learning
outcomes.

Within the explicit references made by students on the varied roles school and community actors played
to ensure a quality learning experience, they also pointed to a sense of mutual accountability across the
classroom, school, household, community, and even society. In this way, UNRWA exemplifies a shared
and reciprocal accountability for education by monitoring and supporting each other’s actions:

          Interviewer: Do you have any thoughts, notes, or recommendations that will help you
          reach the highest levels of education, regardless of the difficulties that you talked
          about?

          Student: Provide a safe environment for the whole society—family, teachers,
          classmates, and neighbors. Simplify the lessons by explaining them in detail, and
          through hard work, I will learn and reach the highest levels of education.


UNRWA’s performance in an adverse context (occupation, armed conflict, restricted movement, and
protracted displacement) presents important lessons for other school systems. Specifically, the effective
classroom practices of teachers, strong school leadership, sound assessment system, and shared
accountability for learning are strong features. Equally important is recognizing the risks and
vulnerabilities that students face and fostering relevant interactions across school and community actors
to support learning and protection of students in such challenging contexts.




                                                                  12
The five main lessons stemming from the study include:

   1. Adequate teacher preparation appears to be a differentiating factor, but more can be done to
      expand on pedagogical innovations in the classroom.

   2. Public schools in Jordan and Palestine can learn from the UNRWA system of assessment and
      accountability, as well as its teacher preparation and mentoring.

   3. The fluctuating performance of UNRWA schools (as seen in the TIMSS 2011 results) is affected
      by rapidly changing contexts of adversity and continues to be of concern. While UNRWA is
      successful in many ways and appears to provide relevant classroom and system level support,
      more is needed to strengthen this process in order to manage (downward) performance
      fluctuations over time. This also points to the fact that addressing the external sources of
      adversity is paramount.

   4. Other countries can build on the UNRWA model to create a community and culture of learning
      that recognizes the adversity of vulnerable groups and promotes collaboration amongst the
      school, the teacher, the parent, and the community, all focusing on student achievement and well-
      being.

   5. The UNRWA example highlights the need to understand education resilience as a process
      phenomenon which may be gauged and subsequently promoted by a set of assets and
      opportunities across a school-family-community partnerships. Resilience theory offers a better
      understanding of how education systems can achieve this for a given at risk-population, while
      concentrating efforts to end any structural causes of adversity.

The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) is a regional United Nations (UN) agency with
a quasi-state function to provide basic education, health, relief, shelter, micro-finance, and community

population of refugees in a given region. Over the
years, adaptations of UNRWA’s services have been
made possible by its flexible mandate, which facilitates rather than restricts the agency in its activities.

UNRWA’s education program shares and in many ways defines this history because it was quickly
established as a priority for UNRWA, and it remains the most significant program. It was also set up
through a partnership with UNESCO that continues to this day, with UNESCO providing technical
support through the funding of several key staff posts. The education program is managed by the
Administration and Governance Unit at UNRWA Headquarters.

Implementation is decentralized and based on project or program cycle management. Planning occurs in a
fairly short timeframe, and the various components are strategically linked to each other through a
common and harmonized framework of results. The current strategy for service delivery (for 2011–15) is
set out in UNRWA’s Medium Term Strategy, the “blueprint for programmes and field operations .” The
strategy provides the objectives, priorities, reforms, and new approaches for a six-year period, broken
down into three biennia. These are in turn operationalized through Field Implementation Plans and
Headquarter Implementation Plans. Across all of the strategy documents, the baselines, targets, and goals

through voluntary contributions of any amount from member states, which account for 95 percent of
UNRWA’s income.

Chapter 2: The UNRWA Effect: Evidence from Test Scores




UNRWA schools’ results in international tests present something of an education system paradox that
merits further study. Specifically, an econometric analysis of available achievement data concurs that
UNRWA students have a competitive advantage over students in public schools. Observed characteristics
related to schools, teachers, and students using an estimated education production function explain some
of the differences in learning outcomes. Differences nevertheless persist even after matching. Finally,
regression decomposition supports the conclusion that while contextual factors explain part of the
variation in scores, a significant part remains unexplained and more ‘latent’ factors need to be uncovered
to support our understanding.

UNRWA schools continually and consistently outperform public schools by a margin equivalent to
more than one additional year of learning.

Econometric analysis shows that there is a significant difference in test scores between UNRWA schools
and public schools in Jordan and Palestine (West Bank and Gaza, or WBG). Evidence for the analysis




                                                   16
comes from several years2 of TIMSS, PISA, and national assessment results. In all cases, UNRWA
schools in Jordan and WBG outperformed public schools. Notably, on the 2007 TIMSS assessment,
UNRWA students in Jordan scored 494 and 541 points in math and science, respectively, compared to
427 and 482 points by public school students, more than two-thirds of a standard deviation higher and
representing a significant difference in education outcomes. Also in 2007, UNRWA students in Jordan
achieved close to the international mean in math and above the international mean in science. In WBG,
UNRWA students scored 381 and 414 points in math and science, respectively, compared to 367 and 404
by public school students and showed more significant differences in Gaza. Given UNRWA’s status as an
education system run for refugees, many of whom live in socioeconomic difficulty and contexts of
ongoing violence and conflict, this merits further exploration and understanding. Specifically, the
assessment data was analyzed with modeling techniques in order to identify factors which contribute to
the difference in performance between the two school systems, as well as to measure the levels of
explained and unexplained variation between them.

Regression analysis was used to first test the degree to which school factors, teaching characteristics, and
family factors explain the differences observed in the student achievement of UNRWA and public
schools. Iterative regression steps were then used to demonstrate the association between school type and
performance. After each iteration ˗ controlling for school location and socioeconomic characteristics, the
change in the magnitude and significance of the coefficient for school type was assessed (Box 2).


    Box 2: Data modeling method used in the study

    Mathematics and science scores are modeled against school type and characteristics, as in equation:

    Y2007 = β0 + β1Type + β2 School +β3 Teaching + β4 Student + β5 Interaction + ε

    Where Y represents individual student test scores in TIMSS 2007, βo is the constant, β1 is the coefficient for
    attending UNRWA schools, β2 represents the coefficient for school characteristics, β3 represents the coefficient
    for teacher characteristics, β4 is the coefficient for student’s characteristics such as mother education or
    socioeconomic characteristics, β5 is used to assess how the school type is interacting with the different factors to
    affect scores, and ε is an error term.


It is important to keep in mind the UNRWA student selection criteria, as UNRWA students have
to possess a refugee identification card in order to enroll. Students in possession of a refugee
identification document cannot be refused enrollment in UNRWA schools, though they also have
the option to enroll in public schools in Jordan, West Bank, and Gaza. However, Jordanians and
non-refugee Palestinians whose families are not registered as having been displaced in 1948
cannot enroll in UNRWA schools except in special circumstances (occasionally made if there are
no public schools available in the area for non-refugees). Thus, there is no “selection” into
UNRWA schools.

assessments. In addition, Jordan participated in PISA in 2006, 2009, and 2012.

Beyond this criterion, the 2007 results showed that there are no major differences in background
characteristics between UNRWA and public school students. This is corroborated by similarities in the
wealth index3 based on overall family possessions and the level of education of students’ mothers.
Overall, in the WBG, UNRWA students are slightly poorer but their mothers are slightly more educated
than their peers in public school (Table 2).

At baseline (without controls) UNRWA schools increase student performance

In terms of the curriculum, UNRWA students consistently outperform their peers in math and science at
public schools in Jordan and in the WBG (Figure 8). These results are based on comparative evidence
from TIMSS, which helps demonstrate the extent to which eighth grade students have mastered
curriculum content in mathematics and science that is common across participating countries. Only in
2003, in Jordan, was the difference between UNRWA and public schools not statistically significant.4

3 For constructing the wealth index, we used the calculation methodology developed by Filmer (1988).
4 Focus group participants indicated that the drop in UNRWA’s 2003 performance could be due to a management crisis that happened around the
implementation of the field test.

                                                                    18
In terms of skills and competencies, UNRWA students consistently outperformed their peers in public
schools in Jordan based on PISA (Figure 9). PISA assesses whether 15-year-old students in participating
countries can apply their knowledge and competencies in reading, mathematics, and science to real world
situations. WBG does not participate in PISA.

Finally, in terms of knowledge economy abilities, UNRWA students demonstrate their advantage in terms
of a Jordanian national assessment instrument to test students’ abilities in skills required for a knowledge
economy (known as NAfKE).5 NAfKE assesses student skill domains related to communication and
problem solving. The results of NAfKE’s 2006 and 2008 implementation for students in grades 5 and 9
(UNRWA does not have grade 11) were considered and scoring relates to the percentage of test items
answered correctly. Findings were similar to those of TIMSS and PISA; though, with exception of math
2006 scores, the major differences occurred at higher grade levels. Students in UNRWA schools
significantly outperformed their peers in public schools especially at grade 9 (end of cycle for UNRWA)
in all content domains: Arabic, math, and science. On average, UNRWA students had scores one-fifth of
a standard deviation higher than the scores of their peers in public schools. This suggests that students
graduating from the UNRWA system have higher work-related skills than students graduating from
public schools. Figure 10 shows the differences in test scores between the two systems in the two years of
NAfKE implementation. Similar results are present in the national assessment in Palestine.

    NAfKE was developed in Jordan by the National Center for Human Resources Development in collaboration with the Ministry of Education.

Performance of UNRWA students is higher than their peers despite two important characteristics.

According to PISA 2009, globally 60 percent of within-country variance in reading performance is
explained by the economic, social, and cultural status of the student. Contrary to international evidence,
the difference in achievement between UNRWA and public schools goes far beyond this. While the
general perception is that refugees have relatively less well-off socioeconomic backgrounds than non-
refugee peers, resulting in lower learning outcomes, the opposite is true in the Palestinian context.
Notably, the school type coefficient continues to be statistically significant and UNRWA schools had a
40-point advantage after controlling for socioeconomic status of children. Similarly, the significant
advantage continued after controlling for other characteristics, such as location and student gender (Figure
11).

To what degree can this difference be explained once other school, teacher, and student characteristics are
controlled for? Furthermore, how much of the difference in performance, to the advantage of UNRWA, is
associated with UNRWA’s teaching and learning environment, given that they teach the same
curriculum? Possible reasons include that UNRWA schools tend to enrich the curriculum with programs
and activities that are not implemented in public schools (as revealed by field visits to schools). Family
commitment and participation in the learning process may be another reason (as hinted to by mothers’
education status).

Do UNRWA schools increase student performance?

While UNRWA schools use the same curriculum as public schools, there are differences in teachers’
morale, training, support, and supervision. Using the teacher and the school questionnaires that
accompany the TIMSS assessment, the differences between UNRWA and public schools in TIMSS 2007
were examined.6 To ensure systematic variable selection, school visits and focus groups were conducted
in order to then build a hypothesis for testing.

There are no significant differences between UNRWA and public school teachers’ completed degrees.
But, on average UNRWA teachers report higher job satisfaction (75 percent compared to about 51
percent) than their counterparts in public schools and slightly more educators have a teaching certificate
(81 percent compared to 76 percent).

Another important area of difference was the instructional time devoted to math and science at school.
UNRWA students on average have slightly more hours per week of instructional time studying math and
science. They dedicate more time to solving problems and are assigned more homework than their peers
in public schools. Also, all UNRWA schools acknowledged that they offer enrichment or remedial
classes. This is not the case for public school students. More significant differences were found in terms
of school principals’ perceptions related to parental support for education. UNRWA students have higher
levels of parental support for student achievement and higher levels of parental involvement in school
activities (Table 3).

Various contextual factors that influence student learning were also tested to see if they explain some of
the difference in scores between UNRWA and public schools. These factors include school, teacher,

6
    We utilized 35 teacher questions and 22 school questions.

                                                                21
pedagogy, student, and home characteristics. In addition to location and general characteristics, overall
school climate was considered (including the percentage of students who come from economically
disadvantaged or affluent homes), whether or not the school offers enrichment and remedial courses in
mathematics, and the frequency and severity of various problematic student behaviors occurring at the
school. Teacher qualifications were also tested relative to their perceptions of job satisfaction, parental
support and involvement, students’ desire to do well in school, regard for school property, how well
prepared they feel to teach topics included in the TIMSS exam, and their expectations for student
achievement. Pedagogical factors included percentage of time spent on problem solving, frequency with
which the teachers ask students to do various content-related activities in mathematics/science, frequency
and amount of homework, and frequency with which the teachers give tests or examinations.

As expected, these variables are positively correlated with learning outcomes. All correlations are
statistically significant (Table 4 shows results based on separate regressions while controlling each for
location, gender, and SES).

Finally, student factors included motivation in terms of their affinity for school, their perception of other
students’ motivation in school, of teachers’ expectations for them, of how much they like and feel
competent in math and science, the importance and value they attribute to math and science, and the level
of education they expect to complete. Student engagement and perceptions of feeling safe in terms of
whether or not they were subject to problematic behaviors by other students were also included, along
with the frequency with which they completed various learning activities and out-of-school activities
(summarized by frequency with which a student participates in various nonacademic activities and
homework outside of school).

Each of the contextual factors was divided into one of two sub-factors: one that is changeable and could
be adjusted by the education system for improvement and the other sub-factor which is exogenous and
beyond school influence. A stepwise regression method was implemented to monitor the changes in the
magnitude and significance of school type (UNRWA or public) on performance. Tables 5-6 show the
different models for Jordan, West Bank, and Gaza, and the following represents the overall findings:

   1. School type continued to be significant with additions of each of the contextual variables.
      Controlling for additional factors related to student, school, teacher, and pedagogy reduces the
      magnitude of the coefficient, but it continues to have a sizable and significant magnitude
      (between 23 and 42 points).

   2. Student motivation and proactivity play a significant role in achievement.

   3. Student behavior at school is crucial and the increase in incidence of problematic misconduct has
      a major association with low performance at the school level.

   4. Teacher qualification, in terms of the degree completed, did not demonstrate a significant
      association with student performance. However, their level of confidence to teach the subject was
      associated with an increase of about six points on the average student score.

   5. Teacher job satisfaction played a significant role in explaining the differences in student
      achievement. A student taught by a teacher with high job satisfaction tended to achieve close to
      10 points higher than a student taught by a teacher with low job satisfaction.

   6. Although schools were not expected to have high variation in terms of instructional time, the
      difference in time allocated for math or science at the school did not indicate significance effects
      on achievement.

   7. However, pedagogical activities, such as a focus on problem solving, testing, and practical
      activities in class showed a significant association with student achievement.

This difference is confirmed under additional approaches

Propensity score matching (PSM) method was used to construct a matching group for every student
attending UNRWA schools (possible observation under treatment). Then, performance on the different
assessments was compared with the non-treatment group (for students attending public school). School
and student characteristics were used to construct scores with which the matching is implemented.7

The positive effect of attending UNRWA schools decreases but remains statistically significant in Jordan,
while in the WBG the positive effects are higher than the ones observed in a linear regression (Table 7). It
is important to note that the magnitude of the association is considerably high, especially in Jordan in
2007, when in math the estimate of the average treatment effect was 72 points while in science it was 65.

At the end, not all the difference is explained

The observed test score differential can be decomposed as:

                         (                       )                     (                      )

Where T is the standardized test score, Xi is a vector of student, and school related characteristics for the
    individual, β is a vector of coefficients, and UNRWA and public subscripts are identifiers of the
TIMSS test score in Math/Science in year 2007. The overall increase in test scores can, therefore, be
decomposed into two components. One is the portion attributable to differences in characteristics
(                     ) or to the performance of the UNRWA group of students               , while the other
portion is attributable to differences in the effects on performance (                      ) of Public and
UNRWA students derived from the same characteristics. The second component is the unexplained
portion of the test score difference that may reflect certain unobserved family characteristics that are
correlated with achievement, possibly related to household wealth or perhaps due to school and
institutional characteristics.

As shown in Figure 12, the explained portion of the difference in test scores between UNRWA and public
schools due to characteristics is between 30 and 40 percent. Hence the majority of the difference is due to
institutional characteristics and other factors. This leads us to believe that the largest part is most likely

due to other institutional and individual factors beyond the observed inputs and socioeconomic
characteristics of students.

To this end, further investigation of the overall system is needed. The next chapter identifies some of
these factors that might shed light on the other piece of the explained variation in scores. An
investigation of what happens in the classroom in the UNRWA schools relative to what occurs in the
public schools is covered in Chapter 3, and in Chapter 4 those social and emotional supports (individual,
community, and systematic) that support academic outcomes and the education resilience among refugee
students are presented. Collectively, the findings present a more holistic view of UNRWA’s learning
model, which may explain some of the differences noted here.

Classifications were provided according to the following metrics.




The results show that overall, in terms of teacher policy and its implementation, the UNRWA system
differentiated itself from the two public systems in four areas: (1) leading teachers with strong principals;
(2) establishing strong and clear expectations for teachers; (3) monitoring teaching and learning; and (4)
preparing teachers with useful training and experience.

UNRWA is more successful at attracting and recruiting high quality teachers.

While the public and UNRWA systems require the same level of education for recruited teachers, the
UNRWA system differentiates itself in two areas, attracting the best into teaching and stringent
requirements to become a teacher. UNRWA attracts the best high school graduates to enroll in the
UNRWA teacher colleges free of charge but with rigorous selection requirements. Attending the
UNRWA teaching programs is very competitive as it targets high achievers on the high school national
exam (Tawjihi). Also, before teachers are recruited at UNRWA schools they are interviewed and required
to pass a written exam.

There are clear expectations about the work expected of UNRWA teachers, who receive guidance and
mentoring services.

UNRWA teachers are provided with explicit standards regarding what students must know and be able to
do, and the tasks that teachers are expected to carry out are officially stipulated. There is helpful guidance
on the use of teachers’ working time. Ninety percent of teachers’ working time is dedicated to teaching
while less than 60 percent of teachers’ working time at public schools in Jordan is devoted to teaching. At
the same time, at UNRWA schools teachers’ official responsibilities include tasks related to instructional
improvement with the help of a teacher mentor. The system also encourages teachers to support each
other on school plans, design of curriculum material, and to take part in the evaluation of activities.

The focus on teachers also results in teachers who are more motivated to perform than their public school
counterparts in Jordan and the WBG.

The UNRWA system has a structured mechanism to hold teachers accountable. Teacher performance
evaluations and professional development are requirements to remain in the field. Upon hiring, teachers
are placed in a probation period during which mentoring and training is mandatory. After successful
completion of the probation period, teachers are offered open-ended appointments and are granted extra
compensation based on performance. Teachers can also be dismissed for poor performance, absenteeism,
or misconduct such as child abuse. In the UNRWA system, teachers’ compensation is linked to
performance through advancement and promotions from one level to another derived from an established
ranking ladder. In the public system in Jordan, teacher classification exists (e.g., beginner to master);
however, promotion is based mainly on attending training programs and less on classroom performance
and student learning as found in the UNRWA system.

UNRWA has more mandated ongoing professional development and orientation for teachers.

Although both public and UNRWA systems require at least ISCED5A 8 to become a primary school
teacher, UNRWA also requires classroom experience. After recruitment, all new teachers must go
through a mandatory intensive two-year structured training program that is focused on teaching and
instructional practice.

The SABER assessment also found that UNRWA teachers are better prepared in the area of improving
their instructional practices. Of note, support for teachers is central in the supervision system established
by UNRWA, especially during the beginning of their service. School principals are also mandated to
ensure that teachers who need support are directed towards appropriate professional development
programs or assigned mentors.

With regards to matching teachers’ skills with students’ needs, no major differences were noted between
the public systems in Jordan and the WBG and UNRWA. Each of the systems was found to be
‘established,’ offering similar incentives for teachers to work at hard-to-staff schools.

Teachers at UNRWA schools are supported by well-qualified, well-prepared, and experienced school
principals.

The UNRWA system invests heavily in preparing and developing qualified school principals. Structured
programs prepare and support school-based leadership through specific coursework activities and
mentoring programs. UNRWA school principals tend also to have extensive experience before becoming
school leaders, more so than in public schools. They are explicitly required to evaluate teacher
performance and provide guidance for curriculum and teaching-related tasks.

directors. Similarly, school councils (may include the
school principals) do not have legal authority to hire and
fire teachers, nor to hire and fire a school director (Box 5).

Finally, in terms of the participation of school councils in school finance matters, there are no major
differences in relation to the role of school councils (where they exist) in budget planning and
management, operational efficiency, and teacher incentives. This is because budgets are prepared at the
central level outside of the influence of schools, and school councils do not extensively participate in
assisting the school in the preparation of the school budget, nor do they have legal authority to approve

 School autonomy is defined as an increasing degree of local control of central fiscal transfers in terms of schools having authority to manage its
operational budget, set and manage staff and teacher salaries, or raise other funds in addition to the transfers received from national or sub-
national sources.

                                                                       35
budgets. At the same time, school councils have no legal authority to supervise the implementation of the
school budget, as it is the responsibility of central administration. In all areas, UNRWA and public
schools were found to have a ‘latent’ status.

The UNRWA system has fewer management layers and is more accountable for student outcomes.

Despite the generally weak picture both systems present in terms of school accountability, some
differences were noted in the UNRWA focus on the assessment of student learning, which was higher
than that of the public system.

During their orientation, new UNRWA teachers are trained to assess student achievement, and overall
assessment data is monitored by UNRWA ‘policy’ makers. All major exams are prepared at the central
level and are common across UNRWA schools in all fields of operation. Assessments are carried out in
several ways including through standardized testing, inspections, and follow-up advice regarding
identified issues at schools. Assessment findings are disseminated to teachers and used to identify schools
and teachers who require additional support. The assessment data is also used to inform the development
of teachers’ lesson plans and support provided by the system in terms of instructional practices.

The UNRWA system also integrates a rigorous evaluation process as teachers are required to participate
in internal and external monitoring and evaluation. While both public and UNRWA evaluation systems
include classroom observations and multi-criteria reviews – covering knowledge of subject matter,
teaching methods, student assessment methods, and student academic achievement – the evaluations are
more rigorous and more frequent within the UNRWA system. In addition to their own assessment
process, UNRWA schools also participate in national and international assessments, and the results of the
school and student performance assessments are generally made available to parents.

Some of these differences also extend to the ways in which the UNRWA system assesses the mechanisms
in place to render parents, local governments, and society accountable for education outcomes. UNRWA
schools have manuals regulating the use of the results of the yearly assessments of school and student
performance by school administrations or councils. Moreover, the assessment of school and student
performance is part of a national and in some cases regional assessment system with results occasionally
being used to compare school performance with schools in similar conditions.

Conversely, in neither public nor UNRWA systems do school councils have the legal authority to hire
external auditors to perform financial audits at the school. Given the important interconnections between
different critical components of education systems in achieving quality learning outcomes, it will be
important for UNRWA to build on these relative strengths.


Promoting high quality teaching and classroom time

The Stallings Classroom Observation snapshot was used to study and compare instructional practices in
UNRWA and public schools (Box 6).


       Box 7: Stallings Classroom Observation
  This data collection tool samples short time segments of classes in process. Known as the Classroom Snapshot,
  (snapshot for short) it records every person in the classroom, what activities they are engaged in, and it also
  shows with whom they are engaged. Trained observers make a visual sweep of the classroom, view everybody
  and what they are doing, and with whom they are doing it. The results are then recorded in a grid that includes
  all the possible adults (teacher, teacher aide, and visitor), all possible combinations of students (one, two, small
  groups, and large groups), and 15 categories of activities (including discussion, lecturing, assignments, social
  interaction, discipline, classroom management, etc.). The snapshot takes place 10 times during a class period.



The data collected shows that relative to advanced education systems (for example those in OECD
countries), the time spent on learning activities in both UNRWA and public systems in Jordan and
Palestine is positively comparable. Significant class time (about 85 percent) is spent on learning activities.
In the three regions, teachers in public schools spend similar amount of time on learning activities as in
UNRWA schools (Figure 13).

Classroom instruction at UNRWA schools as well as at public schools includes a considerable amount of
time on learning activities. Differences were however noted with regard to how this time is used.

There is less waste of teaching and learning time at UNRWA schools.

UNRWA classes dedicate more time for discussion and assignments than classes in public schools.
Conversely, classes in public schools spent more time on lecturing and reading than in UNRWA schools.
The UNRWA model includes more opportunities for students to engage with activities and writing. The
trend at the public schools is more focused on the teacher and the textbook. Teachers in UNRWA schools
are using teaching aids and Information and Communications Technology (ICT) more than in public
schools and teachers utilize the displayed relevant material in the classroom (on the walls and tables). For
example, all science classes in UNRWA schools are conducted in a Science Lab. Science is taught in
regular classrooms in most public schools. Though less often in UNRWA schools, in both systems some
students are off-task roughly a quarter to a third of class time.

Both the UNRWA and public systems include schools at different levels of instructional effectiveness.
Signs of system effectiveness are highlighted by the higher percentage of competent teachers, as
perceived by the observers, at the UNRWA schools. Additionally, snapshot observations reveal that
UNRWA schools have less variation between schools and are more consistent in terms of instructional
activities. This implies that pedagogical practices are more standardized in the UNRWA systems (likely
through the preparation of teachers). This might also indicate effectiveness in teacher selection criteria.

While more could be done to improve the level of interactions in the classroom within UNRWA schools,
observable indications suggest that the current pedagogical training and practices are something to build
on in this respect.

Teacher practices at UNRWA schools reflect a high level of confidence to teach the subject.

Teachers and students in public schools read more from textbooks than in UNRWA schools. Students are
writing and taking notes more in UNRWA schools than in public schools. Teachers in UNRWA schools
use teaching aids and ICT more than in public schools while teachers in public schools spend more time
writing on the blackboard. Figure 15 illustrates material use by region and school type.

Teachers in UNRWA schools implement more activities, discussions, and assignments.

Observable differences at the classroom level included higher levels of student engagement in UNRWA
class activities (as a percentage of class time). This was most common in Jordan and Gaza across the
three core subjects. However, there appears to be large variation within UNRWA schools, particularly
West Bank versus Jordan and Gaza, which could be due to a variety of factors, including 1)UNRWA
schools are more effective in some areas than others, or 2) public schools in the West Bank are becoming
closer to UNRWA in these practices than in the other areas.

In some cases it was noted that UNRWA teachers provided students with practice tests or dedicated time
to review and test preparation. This was most frequent in Gaza, where it was observed in about half the
classes in UNRWA schools (Figure 17).

This may help account for the lower incidence of students being off task in UNRWA schools. The
snapshots also measured the incidence of students who were not engaged in learning and were either
socially interacting with other students or remained completely uninvolved in any classroom-based
activity. Results show that overall the incidence of the latter two possibilities was 10 percent higher in
public schools as compared to UNRWA schools. The difference between UNRWA and public schools
was highest in Gaza and Jordan (Figure 18).

Furthermore, at the end of each classroom observation, researchers were asked to provide an overall
rating of the class and the teacher. The results presented in Figure 19 show that in the areas of teacher
competency and mastery of class content, UNRWA schools scored higher in comparison to public
schools for all subjects observed.

Conclusion

Thus, based on our research we find that the UNRWA system is more successful at attracting and
recruiting high-quality teachers; there are clear expectations about the work expected of UNRWA
teachers, who receive guidance and mentoring activities. UNRWA also has more mandated ongoing
professional development and orientation for teachers. These schools are well supported by well-
qualified, well-prepared, and experienced school principals. The UNRWA system has fewer management
layers and is more accountable for student outcomes. There is less waste of teaching and learning time,
more interaction and student involvement in instruction, and teachers exhibit high level of confidence in
teaching their students. Overall, school autonomy and accountability represent areas for improvement
across both UNRWA and public schools.

multi-layered process for achieving positive education
outcomes in the midst of adversity “education
resilience.” Five education resilience supportive mechanisms were identified in UNRWA schools.


Education has a collective meaning and purpose for Palestine refugees in the face of
adversity

Resilience starts from adversity. A wealth of data on the adversities faced by Palestine refugee students
was collected through interviews. Students recognized the range of adversities they live under, which
affected them in proximal ways when it came to learning. In other words, while the external context of
armed conflict, violence, or being a refugee was well understood by the young people, its negative impact
was felt in more tangible terms at home and in school. At home, students were affected by socioeconomic
hardships—such as unemployed parents, incarcerated family members, and limited access to basic
resources. At school, the external adverse context also impacted the day-to-day interactions they had with
teachers and other students.

Paradoxically, adversity was also a motivating factor to do well in school. Indeed, when faced with
particular episodes of adversity, many of the students noted how this merely provided an added impetus
to succeed in their studies:

        Because my parents' divorce affected my learning, when I overcame this problem I decided that I
        wouldn't let any problem distract me from studying, and I made some rules to use if I encounter
        any problems so I won't let it affect my learning. I must solve these problems without allowing
        them to affect my education. (Male student, West Bank)

        I can't describe the fear that we lived in… I was the only one at home who was studying for final
        exams. My father used to ask me when he saw me studying why I wasn't afraid. We all used to sit
        in the same room during the days of the war, and my father didn't go to work so we followed his

        lead, but studying for my exams was the most important thing for me to do especially during the
        days of the war. (Female student, Gaza)

Education, in turn, played an important role in helping        Figure 21: How students make sense and
students to make sense of the adverse conditions within        find purpose through education
which they lived. They understood difficult life events
                                                                     Setting goals
as opportunities and education as protection. Education
                                                                     Separating hardship from education
became the primary means through which they set
                                                                     Taking charge of problems
tangible and realistic goals for themselves and in some
                                                                     Finding something Positive in Difficulties
cases in relation to the wider Palestine refugee
community (Figure 21). As one boy in Gaza noted: My
motivation is to get a good future, and to know my
future lies and to put a goal in front of me. And I've put
education as a goal in front of me and I have to do it, so
I have to learn and to know all the subjects and to pay
my attention to the teacher's explanation, and to have a
better future.

Common goals were to become well-educated
professionals such as doctors, engineers, and, significantly, teachers. These personal goals were often
linked to a desire by students to be positive role models in their communities. This was neatly expressed
by one female student in Gaza, who in recounting her experiences of the war noted: I'm a good student
although when I was at the fifth grade, the war began and my uncle died in that war; I felt that these days
were like a test for us, the students, to work and study hard regardless the difficult days that we faced.

From the analysis of their narratives, a pattern emerged of students’ awareness of the adversities
associated with being Palestine refugees, but also of education helping them to maintain hope for the
future. The UNRWA education system seems to offer learning opportunities that are meaningful to the
lives of these students (both relevant to their situation as a marginalized refugee population, and as
individual students who have faced particular personal difficulties). Such positive values shape the
identity of Palestine refugees and promote a sense of personal well-being and control, connection with
others, and social accountability (Figure 22).

        I have one goal: to be a doctor or an engineer, so that we can show our enemy that even though
        we lived in difficulties, we became successful in our lives. (Male student, Jordan)

        Interviewer: Does being a Palestinian refugee have a positive or negative impact on you?
        Student: It urges me to study harder since we are refugees who had to leave their land and have
        to work hard to improve our status and prove our identity. (Female student, West Bank)

UNRWA staff understand and are able to model a positive identity and well-being
in the midst of the same challenges their students face

The high cultural premium for learning reflects a clear and unwavering prioritization of education, which
is promoted at the school level by teaching staff. Teachers can provide effective support to students in
adversity, especially when they understand the challenges faced. Many of the student narratives provided
evidence of how teachers, head-teachers, and counselors understood the challenges students confronted
and were dedicated to addressing the potential negative impacts on learning. School staff were often noted
to be very approachable and went above and beyond their professional duties to support students and
ensure they were able to continue learning despite living and learning in a difficult context. This included
a significant amount of out-of-class support as described by this female student in Gaza: We had a
teacher in the sixth grade; she used to come to our home and teach me math every day. I was the smartest
student in her class and always get the highest marks in math, and I'm still good at math thanks to her.
Whenever I need help with any school subject even if it's not math, I go to her house. Another boy in the
West Bank spoke of how his English teacher was always on hand to help outside of class hours: He likes
to joke with us during the class, but at the same time he’s very good at teaching. He knows how to teach
us and make us all understand, and if we have a difficulty with anything he would explain it to us during
the class or after the class; we can go to him any time.

The motivation of UNRWA teachers and their ability to understand and connect with their students is not
surprising. UNRWA teachers are themselves Palestine refugees and as such hail from the same at-risk
population, are part of the same geographical communities as the youth, and have themselves been

                                                                          47
educated in the UNRWA system. They are committed to a community project of educating their youth
and share and promote this goal in close proximity with family members. For example, when asked about
his parents checking on his school performance, one boy in the West Bank told us: Yes, my father always
calls my teachers and the principal, and one of my teachers…knows my father and uncle very well,
because he went to school with my father, so he always talks to my uncle about my performance at school,
and my father sometimes calls him and visits him at school. That's how he checks on my performance at
school.

A major benefit of school staff that share or have shared many of the same adversities as their students is
that they have useful insights into their students’ lives. Teachers can serve as role models of personal
well-being and a positive identity. This was alluded to by one girl in Gaza, who told us: The best thing
about my teachers is that they treat us like any normal student; they treat us like citizens who live in their
own country; they always talk to us and tell us about our rights. Students were acutely aware of the
influence of teachers on their lives and told us that they often saw their teachers like a second family,
while schools were also described in terms of being a second home. Students refer to this positive
influence from their teachers as follows:

        For me, when I see my teachers, I wish to be one of them…I wish to be one of the teachers. When
        I look at a teacher, I ask: What made her reach this level? I’m sure she studied and it was hard.
        Our computer teacher… always encourages us, she gives us advice on how to study, and when I
        follow it, I achieve what I want…I want to say that when I look at my teacher, I wish I to become
        like her. (Female student, Jordan)

        Interviewer: What do you like in a teacher?
        Student: The way they educate the students and treat the student as his son or little brother.
        (Male student, Gaza)

As Bocco has stated relative to the UNRWA system, ‘the practice of teachers is embedded in their local
experience: They themselves are refugees and share the same experiences of most pupils’ parents’ (Bocco
2010). Yet this connection between students and teachers is not necessarily unique to the UNRWA
system. Rather UNRWA may be using this to its benefit as an Agency that was specifically set up to
manage the adversity experienced by the refugees. Its approach to education seems to recognize that
context impacts the educational experiences of students, and vice versa.

The school system supports students’ competence in the midst of adversity through
academic guidance and socio-emotional support

Students reported that effective teaching in adversity comprised academic guidance and socio-emotional
support. As was noted in earlier chapters, academic guidance in UNRWA schools included effective
teaching and learning practices (such as time on task and the use of supplementary materials and practical
experiments), assessments (including practice exams) and accountability for results (which was achieved
through high expectations for all students and recognition of their efforts). Interviewed students also
noted the availability of equity-focused programs (which students referred to as remedial or catch up



                                                     48
classes), and an orderly learning atmosphere (through discipline and a well-maintained learning
environment).

For students, a good teacher, in terms of academic guidance, was one who provided multiple techniques
to take students beyond a passive transfer of knowledge. A good teacher engaged students in critical and
creative thinking and ensured that there was a sense of equality of opportunity among students. This was
exemplified by the response of a male student in Gaza. When asked about what made a good teacher, he
responded: …that he can provide the information clearly and he doesn’t differentiate between the
students, and he should give us more than what is in the textbook to accommodate our ideas. He should
give everything that is useful for the students, and help us with creativity and thinking, not only
memorizing and following the textbooks word for word. Other students stressed the importance of
teachers being able to simplify or clarify topics for the class, ensuring that they did not depart from a
lesson until everyone understood. For example, a male student in the West Bank explained why he liked
learning English: …it's an easy subject to learn; our teacher simplifies it for us and makes us like it. I like
his teaching method; he explains the lesson and makes sure we all understand, and if there was anyone
who didn't understand anything, he would explain everything to him. Perhaps not surprisingly, students
drew clear links between a teacher’s ability and thus motivation to do well in a particular subject.

Figure 23 presents the varied forms of academic guidance that the students reported, including
components that took place both within regular class time and outside of it (again speaking to the high
levels of commitment and motivation of UNRWA teachers).

However, the above references to academic and cognitive skills were also complemented by the socio-
emotional support and important values students saw in a good teacher. Empathy, respect, and trust were
common themes in the students’ descriptions of effective teachers and head teachers . Students provided
numerous examples of teachers providing them with personal guidance, acting as confidents, and helping
them to address particularly difficult moments in their lives. Students respected this commitment, and it
furthered their motivation to study hard and find purpose in education. For example, when speaking about
the impact of conflict in Gaza, one girl explained: Teachers were with us all the time. They even visited us
at home. That gave me a great motivation. It really feels good when you see that someone cares when you
are in an ordeal. Reflective of this as well, a male student in the West Bank spoke of the dedication of his
head teacher in supporting a fellow student whose father was in jail: One of my classmates' father was in
prison for six years, and he was released nine months ago, and he didn't have a job but now he's working
but he does not get paid enough. So the principal used to help him all the time, and sometimes when he
[my classmate] had to visit his father at the prison, he would have to miss classes that day, so the students
would go explain the lessons to him that he missed; they helped him with school and with his personal
life. Another illustration of social and emotional support comes from a female student in Jordan who,
when asked about what teachers offered their students, responded: They give moral support. Concerning
financial support, our religion teacher helps poor students; she raises money and gives it to the poor.
Whatever donations come to school she would distribute them to the poor. Our English language teacher
provides us with the necessary advice to become effective members in our country.

Yet, while it may be analytically possible to distinguish two types of support—academic guidance and
socio-emotional support— in practice they both formed an integrated approach to effective teaching and
learning. For students this translated into a sense of protection, affable feelings towards their teachers, and
sentiments of competence, motivation, and responsibility towards their studies. For example, a female
student in Jordan remarked: When I get a good mark like 30 out of 40, my teacher encourages me
positively to get full marks for the next time and praises me before others. Thus, my participation becomes
better. Moreover, whenever my answer is unique and not everyone is capable to answer the question, she
rewards me with a simple gift, not necessarily an expensive one. Every teacher has her own style in
motivating students and when a teacher is good with students, they love her in exchange and study well.

Students indeed noted that socio-emotional interactions actually enhanced students’ cognitive abilities to
excel academically. This is captured in the following interview segments regarding how teachers help
their students:

        She is one of a kind. She says yes whatever you ask her for. She helps a lot whether you are sick
        or you have a problem at home. She also goes to give condolences along with teachers when a
        member of a student’s family dies. That really affected students and encouraged the sense of
        belonging. They felt they have a value at their school and that makes them do better. There was a
        student who had lots of help from teachers and benefited a lot and did much better. (Female
        student in Gaza describing her school principal)

        There are many things that I like; you can see most of these things through the way they treat the
        students, through the ways they explain the lessons, through the way they run the class and
        manage it, and through the way they talk to students, get them to study, and get those students to

          come talk to them whenever they're facing problems. (Male student, Gaza, discussing what he
          likes about his teachers)

          Teaching is an essential thing. I have been at this school since first grade now. Teaching is so
          important as well as meeting other classmates and befriending them. Concerning the
          headmistress, she cares about discipline, psychological support, and students' honoring.
          Concerning teachers, they always support us psychologically, teach us how to study, do our
          homework, help our mothers, set plans to exams, and prepare our lessons. In general, they guide
          us to many useful ways concerning studying well. (Female student, Jordan)

The integrated nature of academic guidance and socio-emotional support points to the importance of not
simply addressing these needs through parallel psychosocial programs but rather through incorporating
non-cognitive skills and values in the teaching and school management processes. Indeed, in the case of
UNRWA, it appears that this integrated support is not simply born of individual initiative but is explicitly
supported by the Agency. This is, for example, reflected in the institutional prioritization of cross cutting
concerns such as gender, disability, youth, environment, and protection. Particularly germane to this study
is UNRWA’s focus on ‘protection’ within its policies for “safeguarding and protecting the Rights of
Palestine refugees” (UNRWA 2008). Within this approach, protection is conceived as an integral part of
UNRWA’s service delivery for which partnership with the community is an important element.10 The
emphasis on providing socio-emotional support as a key component of quality education is also
referenced in a recent education program communique entitled ‘education, learning together,’ in which
UNRWA states:

          Providing a quality education for all young people will impart an understanding of their place in
          the world and convey a common set of key values such as dignity, tolerance, a sense of cultural
          identity, gender equality, human rights, and respect for the environment; while strengthening
          coping strategies, especially in a context where poverty pervades daily life (UNRWA, n.d.).11


Learning is supported by many actors including teachers, students, peers, and
family members

Support for students’ learning seems to expand beyond the UNRWA schools. The 72 UNRWA students
interviewed noted that, in addition to their relationships with teachers, principals, and counselors, home
and peers were important sources of support for their learning outcomes (Figure 24).

  As UNRWA lacks legislative or authoritative power, implementing such values must be done at the classroom level, through the teaching staff.
Given, the importance of this approach for students, additional studies that explore UNRWA’s teacher training and professional development
programs and associated incentives could reveal important findings.

These multiple sources of support aligned well to theories of child development within different levels in
society (or ecologies)12 and have important implications for supporting community-school partnerships.
Alongside teachers, families and peers play a key role in the well-being and education process for at-risk
children. Interviewed UNRWA students provided many examples of how parents, siblings, and peers
reinforced their learning through: additional opportunities to seek information, knowledge, and clarity on
a particular topic; by encouraging mutual support and even competition among peers; and by ensuring the
most viable learning environment possible, or simply providing motivation and encouragement. In the
students’ own words:

             Interviewer: How is your father creating the suitable environment [for your studies]?
             Student: He focuses on ensuring the house is quiet, that there is no noise, and I sit in one of the
             corners of the house and study. (Male student, Gaza)

             My uncle encourages me when he talks to me, and always tells me stories about college, that
             some students have educated parents but are not that smart, while there are other students whose
             parents are not educated but they are very smart. Also, my aunt is a doctor and lives in London,
             and she always encourages me to become a journalist and to go visit her. (Female student, Gaza)

Perhaps the most illustrative example of support for learning is the one among students themselves. For
example, UNRWA schools in Gaza tapped into this additional source of learning support by formalizing
peer learning techniques in the classroom. The benefits of this are explained by one student:

             Interviewer: What do you think of the academic support programs that your school has been
             holding?
             Student: They are so useful and beneficial to weaker students who can ask high performers to
             help them understand hard materials or test them with some questions. That saves

        embarrassment from asking this of a teacher. You know that girls feel relaxed when dealing with
        each other…We gather with high achievers to read and study and ask about the things that are
        hard to understand and the high achievers help us in that. If we all don’t understand something,
        we ask our teacher to help us. Sometimes we conduct workshops in the school breaks to discuss
        issues related to Arabic, math, or science or we broadcast some programs on the useful ways of
        reading, studying, and obtaining marks. We may print all that and distribute it among the
        students. (Female student, Gaza)

By incorporating strategies to bring schools, families, and peers together, education policies and programs
are more likely to be relevant for both quality of learning and protecting students from the adversities they
face. Community-school partnerships within the UNRWA system may not be fully structured through
formal ‘school participatory management’ models, but they remain organically embedded in the mutual
support mechanisms among Palestine refugees. The importance of community-school partnerships for
learning outcomes in contexts of adversity merits further study.


UNRWA’s close partnership with the refugee community creates shared
accountability for learning outcomes

The participation of many stakeholders in supporting the learning process has created a strong matrix of
accountability for learning outcomes that stretches across the classroom, school, household, and
community of Palestinian refugees. While students benefit from high expectations placed on them by
teachers, head teachers, and parents, students also have high expectations and a clear vision of what the
school, their families, and the community can provide. Several students were able to articulate this, as in
the following:

        Our community is interested in and appreciates learning. The school ensures the students like
        going there and enjoy the learning that happens. The goal of the school is to create well-educated
        students. My family also has a big role in learning, and they will be happy when I finish my
        learning and graduate from the university with high grades. (Female student, Gaza)

        Interviewer: What helps you get high grades?
        Student: First, my determination and will; second, the help of my teachers; third, the
        encouragement of my family. They suffered a lot because their learning stopped and this
        incentivizes and encourages me to achieve the dreams of my father and my mother. There is also
        religion that helps us to learn. (Female student, Gaza)

This wider network of support for quality learning in the face of adversity is accountable to each other.
Parents checked in on students or were contacted by the school in cases where there was concern about a
student’s behavior or performance. When students were experiencing problems keeping up with their
studies, teachers informed their families and requested help at home. One boy in Gaza explains this: My
father [not only] used to ask me about my study; he also used to come ask about me at school. Teachers
used to tell him that I wasn’t doing well, which made him shed light on my studying at home and I started
to improve. Another boy from the West Bank recounted: Yes, they know about every grade I get at school,


                                                     53
and my father sometimes calls the teachers to ask about my grades, and when I get home he would ask me
and tell me not to lie because he knows exactly how much I get. Also my mother comes to school every
two weeks to ask about my grades; they do the same for all of us.

Thus, the high expectations and high value placed on learning was strengthened by a shared and mutual
school-community accountability to support the learning and well-being of students in a difficult living
situation.

What is resilience in the UNRWA Education System?

People who exhibit resilience engage in a dynamic process whereby they are able to ‘navigate’ and
‘negotiate’ adversities with the support of relevant opportunities and services .13 Education resilience – or
positive education that results in the face of adversity – is therefore a process and not necessarily a fixed
outcome. Results can fluctuate, especially in fast-changing contexts. However, the resilience process can
inform how to navigate and negotiate difficult situations. This study points to five education resilience
supportive mechanisms identified in UNRWA schools: (i) Students make sense of adversity and find
purpose in education; (ii) school staff understand the challenges students face and model well-being and a
positive identity; (iii) student competence in the face of adversity is sustained through academic guidance
and socio-emotional support; (iv) partnerships are fostered across schools, families, and communities; and
(v) accountability for learning and protection of students is shared and mutual.

These education resilience strategies at the school and community level are not intended to justify leaving
at-risk education communities unaided; rather they are identified as areas that need to be supported by
education systems. Interviewed UNRWA students mentioned some of the ways schools and the education
system can support their education resilience process. They pointed to six types of school activities
including general interpersonal relationships; teaching and learning practices; school management;
material and financial resources; and assessment, accountability, and discipline.

It can be inferred from the comments of interviewed students that an education resilience perspective
appears to be embodied in several of UNRWA’s approaches. The UNRWA system triggers resilience-
fostering opportunities by a collective sense-making of adversity and a holistic vision of education as a
meaningful purpose for Palestine refugees. All actors are accountable to this aim and to each other. In
practice, UNRWA has been able to tap into a high cultural premium for learning and enhance it with the
support of students, parents, teachers, head teachers and other education staff. The Agency has played an
important role in fostering positive attitudes towards education and subsequently embracing and
enhancing them for the benefit of the wider refugee community through a reinforced network of support
for students.

For the students, their refugee status or the daily adversity they face has not made their education dreams
less realistic or likely. Instead, these difficulties have made their education more relevant because the
system itself is focused on addressing them. UNRWA explicitly articulates its vision of education as a
service that balances the specific needs of the population it serves, aligned approaches to the contexts
13

within which they live, and the need for compatibility and competitiveness within the global education
priorities. Indeed, UNRWA states that its vision for education is in accordance with the broader UN
vision, and it therefore situates its educational developments and priorities within the global frameworks
of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the Education for All (EFA) initiative.14 Yet, it also
provides its own Agency-level interpretation of this, which translates to the skills and competencies it
would like to transmit to its students. According to the Agency’s Commissioner General:

           The fundamental goal of UNRWA’s Education programme is to ensure that the children who
           come out of our schools know how to think in a critical, independent, intelligent manner; And to
           do this, we need to review the manner in which they learn.15

One commentator suggests that UNRWA seeks to meet this challenge by implementing locally defined
curriculum content within a model of ‘western, secular, liberal education’ (Bocco 2010, p.245), based on
a specific and articulated UN vision for education to achieve sustainable positive impact in the face of
adversity. The resilience data collected for this study complements this and suggests that a strong
commitment at the systems level and varied accessible forms of support for its students support the
attainment of positive learning outcomes in the midst of a difficult context. This is what Maya
Rosenfeld’s historical perspective alludes to:

            …the consolidation of UNRWA as an education-centered agency facilitated a transformation in
           the educational and occupational profiles of second- and third-generation refugees of both
           genders…UNRWA’s pioneering efforts to universalize a basic education of nine years and to
           promote the attainment of secondary and professional education enabled young Palestinian
           refugees to achieve an “educational advantage” over their peers in the Arab host countries… 16

Specifically, for the Palestine refugees who participated in this study, learning in adversity is about much
more than a simple classroom dynamic, but rather comprises an active engagement of the whole
community around education, and the commitment and vision of the service provider to provide them
with locally relevant and accessible opportunities through which to fulfill their potential and, crucially to
make transformative contributions to their communities. In the words of UNRWA Commissioner
General, Filippo Grandi, speaking at the 30th Anniversary Conference of the Refugee Studies Centre,
Oxford University, 7th December 2012:

           UNRWA’s work, in spite of multiple challenges, was made easier by the exceptional resilience
           and resourcefulness of the Palestinians. Their accomplishments have become part of the folklore
           instilled in each succeeding generation of refugees. They reveal the depth of the refugee will – the
           universal will of refugees, if I may say so – to self-improvement, to shape their lives against
           overwhelming odds, and to contribute positively to the dynamic of development in their
           communities, in the societies hosting them, and the world at large.

   Data collected for this study is contrary to Rosenfeld’s claim in this article that the UNRWA “educational advantage” persist ed until the 1980s,
but has since not been reproduced. Yet this does not negate her central argument that adverse conditions and development in the region may have
resulted in decreases in declining student performance in the recent past.

                                                                        55
             UNRWA, and the international community that sustains it, share credit in the continuing
             contribution to the human capital of the refugees. It is, however, the refugees that have seized
             opportunities and made their own way into the firmament of business, skilled professions, civil
             society, and public service, in every continent around the globe. In exercising social mobility
             despite the many handicaps against them, Palestine refugees – just like so many other refugees
             with whom I have had the privilege to work in my professional life – call our attention to their
             ambitions, resourcefulness, and creativity…

UNRWA’s experience in providing education is an important one to help us better understand what
education resilience means at the systems level. Resilience research takes as its starting point a context of
risk or adversity. From this, however, assets – strengths, opportunities, and capacities – already existing
within the system are identified. Resilience-relevant interventions can then build on these assets to
provide vulnerable students with more mechanisms and opportunities to ‘navigate’ and ‘negotiate’17 the
risks they face. They are not left alone. This chapter considered this process relative to the UNRWA
system and was indeed able to identify important supportive processes embedded within the system.
These lessons could support UNRWA to adopt a more explicit resilience approach to its work and may
also provide useful lessons for other education systems in similar contexts. To conclude, Figure 25
provides a schematic overview of the education resilience lessons learned by the insightful comments of
72 UNRWA students who themselves exemplify learning in the face of adversity.

RELEVANCE OF FINDINGS
UNRWA has delivered quality education, significantly outperforming two public school systems, under
challenging circumstances. Such resilience does not imply that UNRWA is immune to crisis. Indeed,
since 2007, several significant events have complicated the service delivery climate in West Bank, Gaza,
and Jordan. These include: the blockade on Gaza that began in 2006, economic sanctions, withholding of
tax revenues, ongoing military and militant operations, Palestinian internal politics, and the events of
Arab Spring. Although exogenous to the education system, these factors are likely to have had – and
continue to have – an impact on both refugees and non-refugee education systems, and may help account
for the overall general decrease in learning outcomes.18

Moreover, UNRWA’s sustained competitiveness in such adverse contexts (occupation, armed conflict,
restricted movement, and protracted displacement) still presents important lessons for other school
systems. Specifically, the effective classroom practices of teachers, strong school leadership, assessments,
and shared accountability for learning are strong features in the UNRWA system that can support
organizational adaptability and performance in the face of adversity. Equally important is recognizing the
risks and vulnerabilities that students face and fostering relevant interactions across school and
community actors to support learning and protection of students in such challenging contexts. A resilience
approach does not imply that schools and communities at risk are left to fend for themselves, but calls for
an alignment and institutionalization of education systems to support the resilience processes of which
students, teachers, and families avail themselves. As such, the UNRWA experience merits further
exploration and investigation to sustain in a difficult context the quality learning opportunities for all
children and youth. Figure 26 shows some identified ways in which schools could support the resilience
process.

ANNEX: METHODOLOGY
     (a) SABER

SABER-Teachers and SABER-School Autonomy were implemented systematically. Information on a set
of questions was obtained and then aggregated into pre-established indicators—and corresponding sub-
indicators— to assess outcome in each policy area. The strength of the indicators is tied to the depth and
scope of the programs and policies associated with it. The degree of indicator strength reflects what is
implemented on the ground. At the low level of indicator strength, the policy is not implemented, while at
the high level there is complete implementation of the policy. SABER-Teachers’ 10 core policy areas are:

          Requirements to enter and remain in teaching
          Initial teacher preparation
          Recruitment and employment
          Teachers’ workload and autonomy
          Professional development
          Compensation (salary and non-salary benefits)
          Retirement rules and benefits
          Monitoring and evaluation of teacher quality
          Teacher representation and voice
          School leadership

SABER-School Autonomy and Accountability has identified five core policy goals that are important in
assessing school-based management policies:

          School autonomy in the planning and management of the school budget
          School autonomy in personnel management
          Role of the school council in school governance
          School and student assessment
          Accountability to stakeholders



     (b) Stallings Classroom Observation19

The Stallings observation system consists of three main instruments: (1) the Physical Environment
Information, (2) the Classroom Snapshot, and (3) the Five-Minute Interaction. Only the classroom
snapshot was used for this study.



19
   Several classroom observations exist. For more on the history of classroom observation, see: Lewin, Lippitt, and White (1939); Anderson &
Brewer (1945); Thelen (1951); Flanders (1962), Withall (1963); Simon and Boyer (1967); and Medley (1982), Stallings (1977); and Stallings and
Mohlman (1990). Stallings and Mohlman (1990) addressed the delineation of common elements across all “observational techniques”. These
common elements include: (a) purpose, (b) a set of operational definitions, (c) a means to train observers, (d) a focus on observation, (e) a setting,
(f) a unit of time, (g) observation schedule (timing of data collection, not the observation form itself, (h) a method to record data, and (i) a method
to process and analyze data.




                                                                         64
The Classroom Snapshot records all the participants in the classroom, what they are doing, and with
whom they are engaged (Stallings 1977). It is completed by a classroom observer and recorded in a grid
that includes all adults in the classroom (teacher, teacher aide, and visitor), all possible combinations of
students (one, two, small groups, and large groups), and 15 categories of activities (such as arts/crafts,
tables/games/etc., math, reading, social studies, science, dramatic play, practical skills, social interaction,
discipline, transitional activities, classroom management, etc.). There are a total of 22 rows of such
activities in the snapshot, and the observer marks what the adults are doing and the corresponding
arrangement of students. The snapshot is completed five times per class period, just prior to completing
the interaction codes (below). Stallings reports that the snapshot form looks formidable, but that it is
rather efficient and easy to use, with teachers and administrators learning to use it satisfactorily in just two
half-day training sessions (1983).

The tool was implemented in a stratified sample (based on TIMSS 2007 school performance, type,
location, and size) of 50 UNRWA schools and 50 public control schools and was selected following the
2007 TIMSS sampling framework. The stratification is based on school location in terms of population
concentration and proximity to other schools as a proxy for competition.

Implementation was carried out in each school in the sample by a six-person team of observers three
times in the winter term of the 2011/2012 school year. Observers were unaware of the classification of
school to be visited. An eighth grade class was also visited and observers collected data using the
snapshot and five-minute interaction tools. At the end of the observations, UNRWA schools were
compared to public schools using the different domains of the instruments. To carry out this process, a
research team was recruited and trained to conduct the field work. A regional supervisor followed up on
implementation and worked with coordinators in each of the three fields. In each selected school, three
classes (math class, science class and reading class) were visited three times during the fall session
(September to December 2011) by two observers. The same observers who visited the UNRWA schools
also visited the public schools in each field of operation. The fieldwork was managed and coordinated by
an international consultant based in Washington, D.C., while a regional coordinator supervised the data
collection in Jordan and coordinated with two supervisors: one in the West Bank and one in Gaza. Each
member of the research team received a structured training to familiarize them with the research
methodology and use of the Stallings instruments.

This process was carried out by two international experts with prior training experience. Six researchers
and a field supervisor were recruited from each of the regions to conduct the classroom observations. All
18 field researchers were retired school teachers. Training and certification workshops were conducted for
each of the three regions. Three local researchers with doctorate degrees and extensive field experience
supervised the field work (and were trained and certified on the Stallings tool, as well).

In each school selected in the sample, three eighth-grade classes were selected to be observed covering
Arabic language, mathematics, and science subjects. Each school visit also included a school instrument
to be filled by the researcher from the school principal before the observation. The observers filled a class
inventory survey before the beginning of the snapshots. Then from each class, they filled 10 snapshots.
After the training, the team piloted the instruments in four schools in West Bank, four schools in Gaza,



                                                      65
and three schools in Jordan. Data was collected during the month of November 2011. In the end, 1,800
snapshots were collected.

All data were sent to a central location in Jordan and data specialists entered the data using WinDEM 20
software. In addition to the coded field checking, each Snapshot was entered twice for data confirmation
before finalizing the entry. Finally, all data was converted to STATA for analysis.

In order to compare with other countries in which the Snapshot was implemented, activities were grouped
into: learning activities, classroom management, and teacher off-task. The table below shows the
classification of activities into these categories.

             Table A1: Teacher time categorization
              a) Learning activities:     Reading aloud, demonstration/lecture, discussion,
                                          practice & drill, assignment/classwork, copying.


               c) Teacher off-task:                       Teacher social interaction or teacher uninvolved,
                                                          teacher out of the room.

               b) Classroom management                    Verbal instruction, discipline, classroom management,
                                                          classroom management alone.

               d) Student off-task:                       Social interaction, student(s) uninvolved, discipline.


        (c) Qualitative data approach

The UNRWA resilience component was undertaken using qualitative data collection and analysis
methods. Seventy-two high performing UNRWA students of refugee families in most difficult situations
in and outside camps were interviewed in three of UNRWA’s fields of operations: the West Bank, Gaza ,
and Jordan. This was a purposeful sample of eighth and ninth graders who were selected according to pre-
determined resilience criteria: (i) They had higher-than-average school grades and (ii) came from families
which received additional school and social services due to difficult life situations. All students remained
anonymous and provided their assent to be interviewed along adult consent. To understand the context of
adversity that affects all Palestinian youth, 24 additional interviews with similar youth in public schools
in the three fields were also conducted. This complementary sample of interviews from outside the
UNRWA system helped us better understand the contexts of adversity of Palestinian youth in general. All
students were interviewed in Arabic by local researchers for half an hour during which time they were
asked about the challenges they had faced and how they had performed academically in spite of this.

All interviews followed a similar format: Children were probed about the challenges they faced and the
support mechanisms that they utilized in the home, community, and school environment. In addition to
talking about their individual approaches to pursuing education success, the Palestinian students also shed
light on those environmental factors that promote learning despite adversity (in other words, they
identified sources of support for the resilience process). Their understanding and reasoning regarding the

                                                                     66
risks and obstacles they encounter, as well as their stated educational goals and purpose, were an
important starting point from which to subsequently identify which aspects of the school system propel
them towards resilience.

Following completion of the data collection, the
interviews were entered into NVivo, qualitative data              Box A1: Interviewee Demographic
analysis software –. NVivo was chosen owing to its                Data
appropriateness for qualitative data collection and the        53 percent of those interviewed were male
                                                                  and 47 percent female

grounded theory of the education resilience mechanisms            were studying in grades 8-10
in the UNRWA system. Given the open-ended interview            Each field was attributed a third of the
questions, there was significant complexity in the                total interviews
                                                               10 different neighborhoods were included

categories, to axial relations within and between                 in the West Bank
categories identified). NVivo allowed for greater ease in      44 percent of the interviewees lived in

                                                                  outside of camp settings
between codes and supported us to adhere to a rigorous
process through which theories and concepts could
emerge and be interpreted from the qualitative data set available. This was especially important given that
the study was neither of a representative nor statistically significant sample of students, but rather of a
purposefully selected group of students with the lived experiences that could yield light into the topic of
interest: learning in context of adversity.

Once the data was uploaded into the software, we began a process of coding references made within each
and every one of the interviews in accordance with the following broad categories:
     Types of adversity
     Meaning of education
     Emerging thematic dimensions
     Sources of support
Within these categories, many more sub-categories were identified. Thus, ‘types of adversity’ was
subcategorized into adversity present in different spheres of the students’ social context (home, school,
community, or stemming from the conflict). ‘Meaning of education’ was attributed from the purpose that
students accorded to their studies: self-improvement, financial motivation, family support, community
betterment, or national goals. Similarly, ‘sources of support’ were broken down based on their genesis
(from members of the family, from the students themselves, from different actors within the education
system, or from the peer group). These three levels of analysis resulted in over 130 different codes. Some
segments of the text were coded at multiple codes

The key themes as they relate to both adversity and sources of support provided an important foundation
upon which to conduct our subsequent analysis. Once these have been presented, we will then consider
how those supportive school level approaches21 – be they implicitly or explicitly mentioned in the
narratives of the youth – address the adversities identified and relate to resilience theory and literature. At
this stage, theoretical elements and key findings within the resilience literature helped us interpret the

21
     Here we will draw upon school effectiveness theory in order to better structure and subsequently analyze school-based approaches.

                                                                         67
students’ narratives in a more integrated way. We also sought to make use of the study’s mixed methods
approach to bring together and even note the differences across our findings from the different data
collection tools. As Bazeley (2002) posits, ‘In determining how best to present the ideas and evidence
generated through the completed study, the issue becomes one of the degree to which quantitative and
qualitative components can or should be integrated.’

In this way, our analysis for the 72 UNRWA students and follows a three-tier, or leveled process:

    (i)     The codification of themes regarding adversities experienced (this included 24 additional
            interviews with public system students), the related purpose or reason for education success,
            and the sources for support for learning in spite of adversity.

    (ii)    The qualitative analysis led us to five key education resilience mechanisms (making sense
            and finding purpose; seeking identity and well-being; competence and control through
            academic and socio-emotional support; connecting with others; and committing and being
            accountable. For presentation purposes, narrative segments were selected to substantiate these
            five mechanisms.

    (iii)   Grounded on the UNRWA students’ stories of education resilience, we develop a theory or
            hypothesis of the possible relationship between education system support and academic
            outcomes in spite of adversity.

    (d) Methodological limitations

Our choice of mixed methods was intended to allow for a more comprehensive evidence base that
captures the process aspects of resilience mechanisms. Nevertheless it is important here to state the
limitations that our chosen data collection tools present. In other words, what inferences are we able to
make from the evidence base and what are we not?

With regard to the classroom observations, although subjectivity was highlighted in training and
certification sessions of the researchers before the beginning of the task, the classroom observers and
interviewers were likely to know if the school was an UNRWA school or a public school.

With regards to the qualitative data, the sample size used for interviews is always small, allowing the
researcher to probe deeper into complex relationships and new information. Thus, this type of ‘small n’
cannot be held as representative for all UNRWA schools or the three fields of operation. Rather,
qualitative data seeks to identify important characteristics to facilitate both exploration and explanation of
the research questions. Theoretical analysis and conceptualization of the new topics identified in the
students’ narratives allow us to make inferences regarding the processes and mechanisms that support
education resilience – learning in a context of adversity – in addition to those pre-identified by the
quantitative measures. The sample of students in public schools is not meant to be representative of the
public system, nor “a control group” for the UNRWA resilience findings. This much smaller sample of
public schools was selected and is intended not as a point of comparison but rather as a check against
which to compare the context of adversity across Palestinian youth – in and outside of the UNRWA
system. There was a strong convergence between UNRWA and non-UNRWA students on their reports of
the proximal and external risks experienced by Palestinian youth in West Bank, Gaza, and Jordan. In this
way, the bulk of the analysis for the education resilience component centers on the data collected from

our sample are ‘resilient’ but rather what process mechanisms and inputs help them in their resilience.
