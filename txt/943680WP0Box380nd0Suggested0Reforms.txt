1. Introduction

The misalignment between labor-sending and-recipient country objectives has long proved
a barrier to international labor mobility. Developing countries are reluctant to see their
most skilled workers emigrate, but typically welcome ‘the remittances and job
opportunities that migration provides for less-skilled workers’ (Gibson and McKenzie
2011a). On the other hand, developed countries are wary of the sociocultural and
economic impacts of low-skilled immigration, while broadly supportive of the arrival of
high-skilled workers. There are also a heterogeneous set of non-government stakeholders
trying to influence outcomes on labor mobility, including unions and industry bodies. In
this environment competing objectives often prove to be barriers to achieving the intended
outcomes.

It has been estimated that eliminating all barriers to labor mobility would ‘amount to large
fractions of world GDP – one or two orders of magnitude larger than the gains from
dropping all remaining restrictions on international flows of goods and capital ’ (Clemens
2011). Their removal depends largely on finding an arrangement acceptable to all.
Temporary or seasonal migration offers a compromise, which addresses both labor-
sending and receiving country concerns and provides clear benefits for both.

For labor-sending countries there are sizeable remittance flows, which contribute to
increased income and consumption at the household level and ‘help finance trade deficits
and bolster financial reserves at the macroeconomic level’ (World Bank 2014, p. 2).
Remittances are also often invested in education and health, thus having positive flow-on
effects for human capital development. This aside, migration generates critical employment
opportunities for the migrants themselves and the possibility of transferring skills and
knowledge upon return (Dos Santos and Postel-Vinay 2003). For labor-receiving countries
seasonal workers fill gaps in particular industries that are experiencing labor shortages,
enabling them to raise output (World Bank 2014).

Whilst empirical evidence is limited, recent international experiences with seasonal
migration programs have been largely positive. In Korea’s Employment Permit System
(EPS), participating Filipino households had higher spending on health, were more likely to
put children into private schools and borrowed less from their extended family (Clemens
and Tiongson 2012). Meanwhile, the Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) Scheme in New
Zealand increased the per capita incomes of participating households by over 30 percent,
allowed households to accumulate more assets, and increased subjective standards of
living (Gibson and McKenzie 2010).



                                             2
The Seasonal Worker Program (SWP), which was informed by the Pacific Seasonal Worker
Pilot Scheme (PSWPS), represents the first effort by an Australian government to explicitly
open low-skilled work opportunities to Pacific Islanders since Federation. The PSWPS was
largely modelled on the success of New Zealand’s equivalent RSE scheme. The PSWPS ran
over a four year period in the horticulture sector (2008-2012) and had a total cap of 2,500
workers. Despite the widespread success and rapid expansion of the RSE, the PSWPS got
off to a slow start and never managed to reach its full potential. Over the entire duration of
the PSWPS there were 1,623 arrivals, 65 percent of the total cap (DIAC 2012b).

In response to evidence of low take-up in the PSWPS, researchers at the Development
Policy Centre of the Australian National University conducted an employer survey. Hay and
Howes (2012) determined that three factors limited demand for Pacific seasonal workers:
the lack of an aggregate labor shortage, a lack of information about the PSWPS, and the
perceived level of risk and costs. This survey was carried out between May and June, 2011.
Since these employers were surveyed, the PSWPS has finished and the SWP has been
introduced. It differs in both structure and scale. Along with accommodation, which was
already being trialed, three new trial sectors have been added (aquaculture, cotton and
cane). Four new countries have sent workers (Nauru, Samoa, Solomon Island, and Tuvalu)
and the cap has increased nearly fivefold.

The demand for Pacific seasonal workers in the SWP has improved relative to the PSWPS,
but still remains weak. In FY 2012-13 there were 1,473 arrivals against a total cap of 2,000
workers. In FY 2013-14 there were 2,014 visas granted up against a cap of 2,500 workers
(DOE 2014). This number remains insignificant for the Australian horticulture industry,
which employs approximately 75,000 – 175,000 workers annually, and in comparison with
New Zealand’s RSE scheme, which started with a cap of 5,000 workers, expanded to 8,000
workers the following financial year and the new cap is now up to 9,000 workers (NFF
2008b; Gibson and McKenzie 2014; Trevett 2014). The SWP’s small size means that its
overall development impact remains limited for participating countries (Gibson and
McKenzie 2011b).

This paper aims to determine whether the factors constraining demand have changed since
the PSWPS and what reforms could help lift employer demand. It does so through assessing
the views of a sample of employers and industry bodies across the horticulture industry.
The trial sectors are not covered. The study is divided into five sections. Section 2 describes
the origin, design and features of both the PSWPS and SWP. Section 3 provides a brief
overview of the survey. Section 4 presents the key results and discusses how these
compare with those collected by Hay and Howes (2012). Section 5 explores a possible way
forward by suggesting a series of reforms based on the core set of findings.

2. The Seasonal Worker Program

2.1 Origins

A labor mobility initiative for the Pacific had been widely considered for several decades
before the PSWPS was introduced in 2008. As early as 1984, the first major review of
Australia’s aid program (The Jackson Report) recommended that Australia adapt its
assistance to the special circumstances of the South Pacific through a special immigration
program (Senate Foreign Affairs Committee 2003). Whilst there was periodic mention of
labor mobility in each review of the aid program thereafter, it was widely recognized that it
would be difficult to implement. In addition to concerns about domestic unemployment,
the Government was also concerned about its potential to undermine ‘the integrity of
Australia’s largely non-discriminatory aid policy’ (The Simons Review 1997).

In 1992 the unemployment rate in Australia reached a high at 11 percent and then trended
downwards over the subsequent decade, dropping as low as 6.1 percent by 2002 (ABS
2014). That same year Australia experienced a debilitating drought with 56 percent of the
country suffering from severe rainfall deficiencies for the 11 months from March 2002 to
January 2003 (Treasury 2004). This drought led to the largest decline in employment on
record across the agricultural sector, with 100,000 jobs estimated to have been lost
(Houston 2004; Treasury 2004). The rapid loss of agricultural workers who permanently
relocated to other sectors led to concerns of future labor shortages (NFF 2005). These
concerns were particularly acute in the horticulture sector, which is highly labor intensive.

In a 2003 inquiry into Australia’s relations with Papua New Guinea and the island states of
the south-west Pacific, the idea of a seasonal worker scheme for the horticulture sector first
officially surfaced. The Committee received ‘several submissions from enterprises in
Australia and PNG requesting the Committee seriously consider such a scheme’ (Senate
Foreign Affairs 2003). Based on these submissions, the Committee recommended the
Australian Government ‘develop a pilot program to allow for labor to be sourced from the
region for seasonal work in Australia’ (Senate Foreign Affairs Committee 2003). The
Government issued a one-line response to the recommendation stating ‘it has traditionally
not supported programs to bring low-skilled seasonal workers to Australia’ (Maclellan &
Mares 2006).

In 2005, the National Farmers Federation (NFF) released its labor shortage action plan,
highlighting the issues the industry was facing and recommended actions. This plan
recommended that the NFF ascertain feedback from farmers on the potential for a seasonal
worker scheme (NFF 2005). In October of that year, the Pacific Islands Forum was held in
Papua New Guinea. Despite the issue of labor mobility being high on the agenda for several

                                              4
Forum members, the Pacific islands were offered the Australia-Pacific Technical College
(APTC) instead – a regional technical college with the primary intention of creating skills
(Clemens and others 2014).1 The horticulture industry was offered greater access to
backpackers through an amendment to the Working Holiday Maker visa, which allowed for
a second-year visa extension conditional on carrying out 88 days of specified work in
regional Australia (DIBP 2013).2

In the face of firm opposition, multilaterals and academics continued to pursue the case for
seasonal migration, with the World Bank releasing its seminal ‘At Home and Away’ report
shortly thereafter. This report examined the economic arguments – analytically and
empirically – in favor of a seasonal worker program for the Pacific. In December 2005, the
Government launched an inquiry into the potential of a seasonal worker program titled
‘Perspectives on the Future of the Harvest Labor Force’ (Senate Employment 2006).

The inquiry received submissions from a wide array of industry bodies, independent
growers, labor hire companies, unions, domestic and regional governments as well as
NGOs. The majority of these submissions suggested widespread labor shortages in the
horticulture industry were the underlying justification for such a scheme, but according to
the Committee, evidence of these purported shortages was largely anecdotal. As a result
the Committee was not ‘prepared to recommend that such a scheme should proceed’
(Senate Employment 2006, p. 7).

In New Zealand, the debate around seasonal workers had taken a distinctly different turn.
By October 2006, the Cabinet had ‘agreed to a temporary seasonal work policy called the
Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) work policy’ (McKenzie and others 2008, p. 4). The
policy set a limit of 5,000 workers to match seasonal labor shortages in the horticulture
and viticulture industries. Encouraged by the progress across the Tasman, several Pacific
Island governments continued to pressure the Australian Government by ‘pursuing the
issue of labor mobility at every opportunity in regional and bilateral meetings’ (Senate
Employment Committee 2006, p. 45).

Following the 2007 Australian federal election, the newly elected Government of Prime
Minister Kevin Rudd said ‘it will closely monitor New Zealand’s experience of seasonal
employment of workers from the Pacific, to decide whether Australia should create its own
seasonal worker program’ (Maclellan 2008). A paper released by the NFF suggested an
implementation framework, which would start with a pilot program (NFF 2008b). This

combined with the early success of the RSE in New Zealand led the Australian Government
to decide in favor of trialing a seasonal worker program for the Pacific.

2.2 Pacific Seasonal Worker Pilot Scheme

  “Australia’s Pacific Seasonal Worker Pilot Scheme will operate on a smaller scale than the
  New Zealand RSE scheme, but we are determined to ensure it works well from the outset,
                                        in the hope that it will be expanded in future years.”

               Duncan Kerr, former Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs; 2008

The Pacific Seasonal Worker Pilot Scheme (PSWPS) was announced in the lead up to the
Pacific Islands Forum in August 2008. It was trialed over three years, from February 2009
to June 2012 in the horticulture industry, initially being confined to Swan Hill-Robinvale in
Victoria and Griffith in New South Wales. The Pilot was divided into two phases. Phase I
was from 2008-09 and had a cap of 100 workers. Phase II was from 2009-12 with a cap of
2,400 workers (Gibson and McKenzie 2011b). Initially one Pacific country from each of
Micronesia, Polynesia and Melanesia was selected based on prior experience in New
Zealand’s RSE (Luthria and Malaulau 2013).

In November 2008, the Australian Government signed Memoranda of Understanding
(MOU) with the governments of Kiribati, Tonga and Vanuatu (TNS Social Research 2011).
Whilst Papua New Guinea was invited at the outset, it joined the PSWPS later in July 2010
(Luthria and Malaulau 2013). In September 2011, at the Pacific Islands Forum in Auckland,
Prime Minister Julia Gillard announced that Nauru, Samoa and Solomon Islands and Tuvalu
would also be invited to participate in the final stages of the PSWPS (Maclellan 2012).

The design of the PSWPS designated Approved Employers (AEs) as responsible for the
recruitment of Pacific seasonal workers. In order to become an AE, an expression of
interest needed to be submitted to the Department of Education, Employment and
Workplace Relations (DEEWR, now the Department of Employment). Initially this
opportunity was reserved for labor hire companies. If found suitable to become an AE,
labor hire companies were offered a Special Program Agreement from the Department of
Immigration and Citizenship (now the Department of Immigration and Border Protection)
and a Deed of Agreement from DEEWR. In turn, they were able to contract out the recruited
Pacific seasonal workers to growers. The costs and requirements borne by AEs under the
PSWPS are shown in Table 2.1 below.

Despite earlier complaints of labor shortages from the NFF (estimated at 22,000 workers),
the first two years of the PSWPS saw only 123 arrivals (NFF 2005; NFF 2008a). The limited
scope of the PSWPS and lack of flexibility proved to be a deterrent. In addition to this,
growers voiced concerns about the need to hire through labor hire companies and the
associated mark-up on labor costs. The Chief Executive of the Horticulture Australia
Council highlighted this as ‘the most significant issue constraining demand’ (Robinson
2010). In late 2009, the first of several parameter changes aimed at lifting employer
demand was introduced.

                                    Employers provided three options for minimum amount of work required to
                                     guarantee Pacific seasonal workers (1. Six months at 30 hours per week,
                                     2. Five months work at 35 hours per week, 3. Four months’ work at 38

                                    Domestic transfer costs reduced by allowing employers to recoup up to
                                     $100 from the point of entry to the place of employment

  December, 2011                    Reduction in the tax rate for Pacific seasonal workers from 29% to 15% for

These reforms gradually helped improve take-up the following year, but the PSWPS still
had a low participation rate. In 2010, an Interim Evaluation Report was released. It
outlined some of the design features that continued to affect the take-up of Pacific seasonal
workers. Largely as a result of this evaluation, three key sets of reforms to the Pilot
parameters were introduced aimed at improving take-up in the PSWPS (Table 2.2). These
changes had a marked effect on demand for Pacific seasonal workers (Figure 2.1). Whilst
demand had flat-lined in the first two years, FY 2010-11 witnessed an increase in arrivals
to 392. FY 2011-12 saw a similar increase with 1,074 arrivals (DIAC 2012b). Despite the
reforms to existing cost-sharing arrangements and improvements in flexibility, the PSWPS
was still falling consistently short of the cap (Table 2.3).

Hay and Howes (2012) found that a key reason for this shortfall was the lack of an
aggregate labor shortage. They also found a distinct lack of information about the PSWPS in
the horticulture sector. Whilst it was initially anticipated that employers would take
ownership of the pilot, as the PSWPS progressed, it became increasingly apparent that
government-led marketing would be required to increase industry awareness and interest
(TNS Social Research 2011).

Finally, there was the perceived level of cost and risk associated with the PSWPS (Hay and
Howes 2012). As the final evaluation of the PSWPS highlighted, convincing growers of the
value of seasonal workers and encouraging acceptance of the higher cost per hour balanced
with other savings remained a considerable barrier to participation in the PSWPS (TNS
Social Research 2011).

2.3 Seasonal Worker Program

The final evaluation of the Pacific Seasonal Worker Pilot Scheme was completed in
September 2011. Despite the considerable barriers the PSWPS faced, the evaluation
suggested that it had demonstrated ‘it can meet the needs of the horticulture industry for
seasonal labor’ (TNS Social Research 2011). It recommended the roll out of a low-skilled
seasonal labor mobility program as preferable to extending the PSWPS, as this would
‘generate a lack of confidence and inhibit uptake by industry’ (TNS Social Research 2011).

On 18 December 2011, the Government announced their decision to introduce an ongoing
fully-fledged scheme, the Seasonal Worker Program or SWP (FMFA 2011). Whilst most of
the existing cost-sharing arrangements and requirements carried on from the PSWPS,
there were changes to both the structure and scale of the SWP. Three new sectors were
added for a three year trial: aquaculture, cotton and cane. Furthermore, the cap on the
number of workers was expanded to 12,000 workers over the four year period, 2012-13 to
2015-16.

Annual caps were also put in place. These increase year-on-year with 80 percent of places
allocated to the horticulture sector and 20 percent to the four trial sectors. In FY 2012-13,
the cap was 1,600 in horticulture and 400 for the trial sectors. In 2013-14, this increased to
2,000 for horticulture and 500 for the trial sectors; and, in 2014-15 to 2,600 for
horticulture and 650 for the trial sectors. The 2015-16 cap is 4,250. The three-year trial for
the expansion sectors comes to an end in 2014-15. These sectors have attracted few takers,
and it is not expected that a separate reservation for these sectors will continue after 2014-
15. This slowly expanding cap is in stark contrast to the RSE in New Zealand – its cap


                                              9
started at 5,000 workers in 2007-08, immediately expanded to 8,000 in 2008-09 and is
now at 9,000 workers.

There were two reforms implemented with the introduction of the SWP aimed at reducing
the administrative requirements of AEs. The first was dropping AE reporting requirements
from monthly to twice (on-arrival and pre-return) over the duration of a Pacific seasonal
worker’s stay. The other was providing a single point of contact in Government for AEs.

Arrivals under the SWP have been increasing steadily. In 2012-13 there were 1,473 visas
granted. In 2013-14 there were 2,014 visas granted (DOE 2014). The figures are a steady
improvement on the PSWPS, but the number of visas granted under the SWP have still been
below the cap (Table 2.3). It should also be noted that the cap is small relative to both the
number of other workers in the horticulture industry and to the RSE in New Zealand. For
the horticulture sector, many of the factors constraining demand in the PSWPS continue to
affect the SWP. These will be discussed in detail in Section 4.

The election of the Coalition Government in September 2013 has led to a new impetus for
reform, with an election undertaking to examine the case for expanding the SWP (Coalition
2013a) and a more general focus on reducing regulation (Coalition 2013b). The
Department of Employment (formerly the Department of Employment, Education and
Workplace Relations) and the Department of Immigration and Border Protection (formerly
the Department of Immigration and Citizenship) have been in the process of identifying
further options to reform the administrative requirements within the program.

3. Survey

To identify and evaluate reasons why employers are not participating in the Seasonal
Worker Program, a survey of both horticultural employers and industry bodies was
undertaken. The survey was carried out between February and April 2014. It covered
growers from all states and territories, including all of the major horticultural regions
across Australia. Given the minimal take-up in the four expansion sectors, they were not
included. There was a great deal of variation in the farm sizes of survey respondents
ranging from family-run farms with less than a hectare and one seasonal worker, to
corporate holdings with 1,700 hectares and over one thousand seasonal workers. All of the
major crop types were covered including bananas, berries, canned fruits, citrus, dried
fruits, flowers, melons, nuts, pome fruits, stone fruits, table grapes, vegetables and wine
grapes.3

The total size of the survey was 217 employers and 43 industry bodies (Table A.1). This
compares well with any previous survey of horticultural employers. 183 out of the 191
employers who participated in the 2011 survey were re-contacted. Many were unavailable,
but 101 answered the survey. They are referred to as the primary sample. A secondary
sample of 200 randomly selected horticultural employers from across Australia were also
contacted. 76 of those responded. In addition, 40 Approved Employers and participating
employers were surveyed. Finally, the horticultural industry bodies representing various
crops and regions across Australia were surveyed. Given there is no single horticultural
peak body in Australia, a wide array of 43 industry bodies were surveyed to gain an
overarching reflection of the industry. More information about the sample can be found in
Appendix A, and the survey instruments in Appendixes D and E.



4. Results and discussion

This section summarizes the results, and presents a few key graphs. The full set of results
can be found in Appendix B. To maximize comparability over time, we sometimes compare
only the same growers from the primary sample. Analysis utilizing the 2014 survey only
uses the full sample.

Lack of awareness

The underlying lack of awareness of the SWP across the horticulture industry is an ongoing
source of concern. Half of the growers surveyed in 2011 (48 percent) were unaware of the
PSWPS (Figure 4.1). Recognizing this issue, the final evaluation of the PSWPS

                                                         11
recommended ‘funding a specialist agency to deliver a targeted communications campaign
to comprehensively and consistently market a low-skilled seasonal mobility program to the
horticulture industry and other community based stakeholders’ (TNS 2011, p. 69).

Despite this recommendation, the government-led approach was continued. The results of
this method have delivered modest improvement with only two in three (68 percent)
growers now aware of the SWP (Figure 4.1). A larger increase was expected, given those
who were previously unaware should at least have found out through the 2011 survey. By
contrast, in New Zealand 84 percent of non-participating growers had heard of the RSE in
the last employer survey that covered awareness (DOL 2011).

Amongst those who had heard of the SWP there were also misconceptions about both the
costs and requirements that AEs are responsible for. Several growers thought it was still
compulsory to recruit through labor hire companies. Others believed that six months was
the minimum period of time that Pacific seasonal workers could be recruited for. This was
possibly due to a lack of information – many growers felt the SWP had not been clearly
communicated to them by Government. Of those that were interested in receiving
information about the SWP, ‘e-mail’ and ‘through industry bodies’ were cited as the most
effective means of communication.

The Government’s marketing approach thus far focused predominantly on the larger
regional and national bodies such as the National Farmers Federation, the Victorian
Farmers Federation, and Growcom. For certain horticultural industry bodies they have sent
out detailed information packs on the SWP for each member. For other industry bodies,
there has been little or no contact. A total of 28 out of the 43 associations surveyed had not

                                             12
received any information about the SWP from Government. Collectively, these 28
associations represent 8,364 members. This is an opportunity missed.

Lack of an aggregate labor shortage

The key factor deemed to be preventing higher take-up of Pacific seasonal workers under
the PSWPS was the lack of an aggregate labor shortage. A clear majority (60 percent) of
growers suggested the reason they were not using the PSWPS was because there was ‘no
need’ (Figure 4.2). This trend largely continues to affect the SWP with 67 percent of
growers saying they had ‘no need’ for it in 2014. A higher percentage of growers said that
they had experienced difficulties finding sufficient seasonal workers, but this figure still
remains low at 18 percent, compared to 9 percent in 2011 (Figure B.4). As expected, these
difficulties were particularly acute in more remote horticultural regions, such as those in
the Northern Territory.

The prevalence of illegal workers and practices in the industry continues to weaken
prospects for Pacific seasonal workers. Four out of five (79 percent) growers recognized
that undocumented workers were used to at least some extent in the horticulture industry,
much higher than the 16 percent in 2011 due to a change in question wording (Figure B.5).
Awareness of the presence of illegal workers in the horticulture sector was particularly
acute amongst AEs and participating growers – 60 percent suggested that illegal workers
were either used ‘to a moderate extent’ or ‘to a large extent’, whilst only 3 percent believ ed
that they were ‘not used at all’ (Figure B.22).

The majority of AEs and participating growers indicated that the prevalence of illegal
workers was having an impact on demand for legal workers, such as those from the Pacific.
There is no reliable estimate of the number of undocumented workers in the horticulture
sector. However, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection does collect data
on the number of unlawful non-citizens located annually. These have increased steadily
since the introduction of the PSWPS, along with the number removed (Table 4.1).

This is contrast to New Zealand, where a crackdown on illegal labor was initiated before
the introduction of the RSE. In order to create labor demand for the RSE from the outset,
‘the New Zealand government conducted immigration raids to deport undocumented
workers’ (Ball 2009, p. 116). According to Immigration New Zealand (2014a), as a result of
these actions immigration fraud in the horticulture and viticulture sectors has fallen
significantly.

Despite the prevalence of illegal workers, many growers suggested that the larger issue at
hand was the underpayment of documented workers. This involves both growers who are
recruiting directly and knowingly underpaying workers, as well as those using dishonest
contractors. This further undermines prospects for Pacific seasonal workers. For FY 2012-
13, the Fair Work Infoline received over 6,000 enquiries in relation to agriculture, forestry
and fishing. There is no disaggregation on the proportion of these enquiries that were in
the horticulture sector.

The most common complaints received related to ‘wages and conditions, non-payment for
time worked and underpayment matters’ (FWO 2014). The widespread availability of
backpackers from developed countries on Working Holiday (subclass 417) visas also
continues to plug any potential shortages of seasonal workers. This is a result of the 2005
amendment allowing for a second-year visa extension, conditional on undertaking 88 days
of specified work in a rural area (DIBP 2013b).




                                                            14
For FY 2013-14, there were 45,950 second-year visa extensions in Australia, up from zero
prior to the introduction of this option in 2005 (Table 4.2). Nine out of ten (90 percent) of
second-year visa holders had obtained the extension by working in agriculture, forestry
and fishing, which incorporates horticulture. 7 percent obtained it through work in
construction, 1 percent through the mining industry, and 2 percent were unclassified. The
survey results accord with these figures – across all samples nearly half (46 percent) of
growers indicated that backpackers were the main category of worker employed (Table
B.2), though note that this is down from 73 percent in 2011.

Source: DIBP (2014b); Immigration NZ (2014b)


In New Zealand the same extension is available for backpackers who undertake seasonal
work in the horticulture or viticulture industries (Immigration NZ 2014c). However,
successful applicants are only to stay for an additional three months. The shorter extension
period makes it a less attractive option with only 2,911 backpackers being granted the
extension in FY 2013-14. As a result, it does not pose a threat to take-up in the RSE.

The widespread availability of backpackers in Australia undermines prospects of
employment for Pacific seasonal workers. Many of the growers surveyed complained that
there were too many backpackers contacting them in search of work. Despite these
complaints, it was evident that the overabundance of backpackers was preferable to not
having enough.

The majority of industry bodies surveyed said they would actively oppose any reform to
the second-year visa extension for backpackers. This is widely recognized as a crucial
element of the industry. In 2013, the tourism sector attempted to join those qualifying for
‘specified work’, but the horticultural industry bodies lobbied strongly against it and
ultimately prevented its inclusion.

Whilst the abundance of illegal workers and backpackers appears to have become a
structural feature of the industry, not all growers were satisfied with the quality of their
existing workforce. From the primary sample, 12 percent of growers suggested they were
dissatisfied, slightly lower than the 21 percent that held the same view in 2011 (Figure



                                                    15
4.3). Of those growers who were dissatisfied the majority employed backpackers and cited
frustration with a lack of dependability, lack of enthusiasm and poor productivity.

Additional costs

The costliness of the SWP remains a key barrier to entry. It was the second most cited
reason (14 percent) for not hiring Pacific seasonal workers after having ‘no need’ (Figure
4.2). The higher costs incurred for Pacific seasonal workers make them uncompetitive
against backpackers and other categories of workers. The main cost concerns revolve
around transporting and accommodating the workers, and administration. Non-
participating growers were generally unable to suggest specific changes to the SWP that
would make it more attractive, given their lack of knowledge of the program parameters.
However, 17 percent suggested ‘reducing the cost’ would make it more attractive, whilst 9
percent stated that ‘removing the accommodation requirement’ would achieve this end
(Figure B.15).

For AEs and participating growers, the costs involved also continued to determine the
viability of the SWP. The majority of AEs involved (53 percent) with the SWP said that it
was not financially attractive (Figure B.21). The key changes that AEs and participating
growers felt would make the SWP more attractive revolved around reducing the cost.
Three out of four (75 percent) cited the international travel cost, which included both
having to pay the international airfare upfront and also the need to make a $500
contribution (Figure 4.4). Many were content to cover the airfare for first time workers, but
complained about having to cover it for returning workers.



                                             16
Half of AEs and participating growers (48 percent) cited the need to change the domestic
travel cost arrangements (Figure 4.4). At present, AEs are only able to recoup $100 of this
cost from the closest port of entry. For AEs in close proximity to airports with direct routes
to Pacific Island countries, this was not an issue. However, for those employers situated in
remote areas, particularly of Western Australia and South Australia, this arrangement
increased costs significantly. Some of these growers have been paying more for the
domestic travel component than the international.

Furthermore, 35 percent suggested that the cost of organizing accommodation is currently
a deterrent (Figure 4.4). This was of particular concern for growers in more remote areas
where accommodation is scarce and costly to set up. In New Zealand, RSEs are also
responsible for covering a proportion (50 percent) of the return international airfare,
domestic travel costs and the costs associated with organizing suitable accommodation
(Immigration NZ 2012). Despite having to cover similar costs as AEs, in the 2012 employer
survey all RSEs suggested that the ‘benefits of participating in the RSE outweighed the
costs’ (MBIE 2012, p. 4).

Excessive risk

The perceived level of risk involved with the SWP has decreased, possibly as a result of
reforms to program parameters. For the PSWPS, 20 percent of non-participating growers

                                                                   17
cited risk as the key reason for not participating. For the same primary sample in this
survey the figure had decreased to 13 percent (Figure 4.2). There are many sources of risk
that stem from the SWP. Those outlined by growers included needing to guarantee a
minimum period of work, not being able to directly select the workers in the same way as
backpackers, and having to pay upfront costs before testing them out.

The largest perceived risk for AEs and participating growers was the need to provide a
minimum period of work. This is despite reforms reducing this period to an average of 30
hours per week for a minimum of 14 weeks. This concern was particularly acute for
growers of fruit and vegetables with harvest seasons that lasted for less than or close to the
14 weeks, though it extended right across the board. Horticulture is an inherently volatile
industry where labor needs are often determined on a day to day basis. By comparison, in
New Zealand the minimum period of work that Recognised Seasonal Employers need to
guarantee Pacific seasonal workers is 6 weeks at 40 hours per week (Immigration NZ
2012).

The second largest risk for growers was not having the same degree of control in worker
selection. Initially, the responsibility of selecting workers lay largely with labor-sending
countries. Potential workers were selected and placed in a work-ready pool. More recently,
sending countries have also offered the option of direct recruitment. Despite the fact that
employers can choose the recruitment method, many still feel that the SWP affords them
less control over the workers they hire compared with other types of workers. In New

Zealand, this perceived risk is minimized through a trial period agreement where if the
worker is dismissed before 90 days they cannot take a personal grievance for unfair
dismissal (DOL 2014).

The upfront costs in the SWP also magnified the risk of taking on untested workers. These
costs included visas, health insurance, airfares, domestic travel, cash advances and
allowances for appropriate work clothes. Growers suggested these costs could range from
$1,500 - 3,000 per Pacific seasonal worker. The majority of upfront costs can be recouped
through wage deductions; though in the case that workers are unsuitable or abscond, this
may not be possible.

Reputation of the SWP

The reputation of the SWP continues to affect demand for Pacific seasonal workers. For the
PSWPS, 27 percent believed it had a good reputation, 23 percent felt it had a poor
reputation, and the remaining 50 percent were unaware of its reputation (Hay and Howes
2012, p. 29). This survey revealed large differences between the attitudes of non-
participating growers and participating growers. 62 percent of non-participating growers
who were aware of the scheme suggested its reputation was either ‘average’ or ‘below
average’ and 7 percent suggested it was ‘poor’ (Figure 4.5). Just one-in-five (19 percent) of
non-participating growers thought the SWP’s reputation was ‘above average’ and only 2
percent believed it was ‘excellent’ (Figure 4.5). On a more positive note, one-in-four (24
percent) non-participating growers suggested that they were willing to take on Pacific
seasonal workers in the coming 12 months (Figure B.14). This suggests that there is
significant potential for the SWP to expand if the conditions are right.

AEs and participating growers held the SWP in higher regard with 66 percent of growers
stating that its reputation was either ‘above average’ or ‘excellent’, compared to just over
20 percent for non-participants. However, 10 percent of AEs and participating growers
thought that the reputation of the scheme was ‘average’, 15 percent ‘below average’ and 5
percent ‘poor’ (Figure B.18). The fact that 30 percent of those involved with the SWP are
not impressed is unfortunate.

AE’s and participating grower’s perceptions of Pacific seasonal workers were also positive.
They were viewed as significantly more dependable (mean 8.7 out of 10), enthusiastic
(mean 8.5) and productive (mean 8.7) than other categories of seasonal workers (Figure
B.20). These findings are echoed in the RSE Employers’ Survey in New Zealand where
Pacific seasonal workers were also rated as more dependable (mean 9.1 out of 10),
enthusiastic (mean 8.8) and productive (8.9) than other categories of seasonal workers
(MBIE 2012). A 2013 study carried out by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and
Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) supports their views. The study estimated the
relative efficiency of workers under the SWP against backpackers using payroll data. The
results of the analysis indicated that Pacific seasonal workers were on average 22 percent
more efficient than backpackers (ABARES 2013).

It is clear that there is a significant gap between participating and non-participating
growers’ perceptions of both the SWP and Pacific seasonal workers themselves. Bridging
this gap will require eliminating widespread misconceptions about the SWP and further
promoting the gains of hiring Pacific seasonal workers. In order to achieve this end, the
Department of Employment may need additional resources to be allocated to the SWP,
which will be difficult in the current funding environment.

Administrative requirements

The high administrative costs continue to affect the reputation of the SWP. In relation to
the PSWPS, 88 percent of AEs said ‘the red tape is too cumbersome and costly’ and there
were complaints of ‘repetitive paperwork, reporting and monitoring’ (Hay and Howes
2012, p. 31). These concerns have carried over to the SWP. The average amount of time
taken for the Government to process the paperwork required to become an AE was 4.6
months.

For the majority of AEs (67 percent), the processing time was less than six months.
However, for 13 percent of growers it took longer than half a year for the paperwork to be
processed. This reflects the fact that several growers had their initial application rejected
and hence experienced significant delays (Figure 4.6).

The three administrative requirements of most concern for AEs and participating growers
were ‘reporting to government’, ‘superannuation’, and ‘labor market testing’ (Figure 4.4).
Reporting to government incorporated the need for a recruitment plan, on-arrival and pre-
departure briefings, along with other periodic paperwork requirements. In New Zealand,
whilst many of the same reporting requirements are in place, the Department of Labor has
been commended for taking a more facilitative approach and ‘only using compliance as a
measure of last resort’ (DOL 2012, p. 66).

The paperwork associated with Pacific seasonal workers’ superannuation was also a
source of discontent. Many growers highlighted the efficiency gains that could be realized if
the administrative requirements around the 9.25 per cent super contribution could be
streamlined. In New Zealand, RSEs are not required to make superannuation contributions.
Finally, the labor market testing requirement was suggested as a potential area for reform.
Participating growers wasted significant periods of time responding to e-mails from
applicants, who were only applying to ensure they would receive their unemployment
benefits. In New Zealand, the labor market testing requirement is also in place and RSEs
appear to be experiencing many of the same issues (DOL 2012).

It should be noted that whilst administrative requirements were a concern amongst AEs
and participating growers, they were of minimal concern to non-participating growers.
Only 2 percent stated reforms to administrative requirements would make the SWP more
attractive (Figure B.15). This result suggests that though reforms in this area may satisfy
existing AEs and participating growers, they are unlikely to have a large impact on bringing
non-participating growers into the SWP.

What type of growers use the SWP?

Understanding why AEs and participating growers are involved with the SWP is as
important as determining the factors constraining demand. The most pronounced
difference between growers that employ Pacific seasonal workers and those who continue
to rely on backpackers and foreign contractors is size. The average property size of AEs and
participating growers is 385 hectares, compared to 68 hectares for non-participating
growers (Table 4.3). The average number of Pacific seasonal workers employed per season
was 142 for those involved with the SWP, compared to 26 for non-participating growers
(Table 4.3).

The majority of AEs and participating growers (79 percent) are in either Queensland,
Western Australia or Victoria, states that are only home to 45 percent of non-participating
growers (Table 4.3). Labor shortages are reported to be especially high in Victoria (Figure
B.4). These states are also ones where clusters of AEs have formed (Figure 4.7).

In the cases of Mildura/ Robinvale in Victoria and Mundubbera/ Gayndah in Queensland,
many growers have taken on Pacific seasonal workers as a result of learning of the positive

                                                  22
experiences of others involved with the SWP. A large portion (38 percent) of AEs and
participating growers first found out about the SWP through other employers, which
suggests that the positive experiences of those involved with the SWP has a large impact on
take-up more broadly (Table 4.3).

The type of crop grown is also a determining factor for participation. The three primary
crops amongst AEs and participating growers all have harvesting seasons that, reliably last
longer than the minimum 14 weeks required in the SWP (Table 4.3). Communication also
matters. The majority of AEs and participating growers (68 percent) felt that the SWP had
been clearly communicated to them. By contrast, most non-participating growers did not
feel the Government had achieved this end (Table 4.3). A final difference is the payment
method. AEs and participating growers have mainly adopted piece rates (63 percent),
whereby seasonal workers are paid per bucket or bin picked, as opposed to a flat hourly
rate (Table 4.3). For non-participating growers, only 36 percent are using piece rates.

   “The private sector has to be at the heart of it [the SWP] to ensure that it is operating the
  way that it is intended. If there are bottlenecks, if there’s an excess of regulation around it
            that’s preventing it from achieving its purposes, well then we certainly want the

                                     The Hon Julie Bishop MP, Minister for Foreign Affairs; 2014

Despite various changes to the Seasonal Worker Program, it appears many of the key
factors constraining demand remain unchanged. There are a clear set of reforms that, if
implemented would lift employer demand in the Seasonal Worker Program. These are
discussed in this section and explored in greater detail in Appendix C.

The main constraint remains the lack of an aggregate labor shortage due to the prevalence
of illegal workers and backpackers in the industry. Whilst compliance activities by the


                                                       24
Department of Immigration and Border Protection have led to the removal of up to 10,585
illegal workers from Australia annually, the use of illegal labor still seems to be widespread
in the horticulture sector. Four out of five growers (82 percent) recognized that it was
prevalent to at least some extent in the industry. The number of backpackers pursuing a
second-year extension has also increased substantially since the PSWPS and the vast
majority of these continue to work in horticulture (Table 4.2).

Increasing funding for the compliance activities undertaken by both the Department of
Immigration and Border Protection and the Fair Work Ombudsman would help remove the
remaining illegal workers in the horticulture industry. Furthermore, eliminating the
second-year visa extension for Working Holiday (subclass 417) visa holders would remove
up to 45,950 backpackers from rural areas, who predominantly work in horticulture. A
softer option would be to adopt the New Zealand practice of providing only a three-month
extension or broadening it to incorporate all sectors (Figure 5.1).

Additional costs that currently make Pacific seasonal workers uncompetitive against other
categories of workers are another key constraint. The main parameters that need to be
altered are the upfront costs, along with employer contributions to international and
domestic travel costs. These could be removed for returning workers and covered by a
revolving fund for new workers (Figure 5.1). The reforms would help to level the playing
field for Pacific seasonal workers and allow them to compete on a cost basis with
backpackers and other categories of workers.

The level of risk incurred by AEs and participating growers could also be reduced. The
largest risk AEs currently face is the need to guarantee Pacific seasonal workers a
minimum of 14 weeks work. Horticulture is an inherently volatile industry and growers
need flexibility. The minimum 14 week work requirement could be reduced and new
measures introduced that allow Pacific seasonal workers greater flexibility to shift between
AEs. Growers could also be given a greater role in worker selection for all participating
countries, instead of having to use licensed agents or recruit through work-ready pools for
certain countries (Figure 5.1).

Awareness of the SWP could be raised. Despite Government’s best efforts, more than one in
three growers still remain unaware of the existence of the SWP (Figure 4.1). Whilst the
current Government’s marketing approach focuses predominantly on the larger regional
and national horticultural bodies, their engagement could be targeted more effectively
through some of the smaller crop-specific industry bodies. Targeted advertisements
through rural and social media could also help reach those growers that are currently
unaware of the SWP (Figure 5.1).

Figure 5.1 Suggested reforms


                                   • Increase funding for compliance activities;
                                   • Remove or reduce the second-year visa extension for Working
 1. Lack of an aggregate labor       Holiday (subclass 417) visa holders; or
            shortage               • Expand the second-year visa extension to other sectors beyond
                                     agriculture, mining and construction.



                                   • Cover new workers’ costs through a revolving fund;
                                   • Remove the $500 employer contribution to international airfare for
                                     returning workers;
       2. Additional costs         • Remove employer contributions to domestic travel; and need for
                                     employers to cover upfront costs for returning workers.




                                    • Reduce the minimum 14 week work requirement and allow Pacific
                                      seasonal workers greater flexibility to shift between AEs; and
        3. Excessive risk           • Give AEs a greater role in worker selection for all participating
                                      countries.



                                    • Advertise the SWP through a targeted group of horticultural industry
                                      bodies;
      4. Lack of awareness          • Advertise the SWP through rural media; and
                                    • Expand the existing social media platform.



                                    • Promote the gains of hiring Pacific seasonal workers using the
                                      results from existing studies (ABARES efficiency paper);
                                    • Implement a targeted public information campaign correcting
          5. Reputation               common misconceptions, using current AEs as spokespeople; and
                                    • Hold SWP Conferences in horticultural regions instead of
                                      metropolitan areas.


                                    • Quicken processing time for the AE application;
                                    • Streamline reporting requirements to Government;
         6. Administrative          • Allow AEs to pay superannuation contribution directly into wage;
                                      and
           requirements             • Remove labor market testing requirements for postcodes that
                                      qualify for the Working Holiday (subclass 417) second-year visa
                                      extension.



Improving the reputation of the SWP is another area that could be addressed
simultaneously. There is currently a large divide between non-participating growers’
perceptions of the SWP and those of AEs and participating growers. Bridging this gap
would serve to bring more employers into the scheme. There are several measures that
could be taken. The business case for hiring Pacific seasonal workers could be made more
effectively and promoted using the proof of efficiency gains (ABARES 2013). Current AEs
could be used as spokespeople to correct common misconceptions about the scheme. The


                                            26
annual SWP Conferences could also be held in horticultural regions rather than
metropolitan areas to encourage attendance from non-participating growers (Figure 5.1).
These efforts should be focused on those types of growers most likely to use the SWP, that
is, on larger growers, with longer harvesting cycles.

A final area of consideration could be reforming the existing administrative requirements.
The Government is already considering measures in this area. Reforms that could serve to
lessen the administrative burden could include: quickening the processing time involved
with the AE application; streamlining the reporting requirements and paperwork around
superannuation; and easing the labor market testing requirement. As the SWP is a
temporary migration scheme, all returning workers claim their superannuation upon
return. Streamlining the associated paperwork, by allowing employers to pay workers their
super directly, would deliver efficiency gains for both AEs and Pacific seasonal workers.
Meanwhile, removing the labor market testing requirement for postcodes that qualify for
the Working Holiday (subclass 417) second-year extension would also be an efficiency
driver. Pacific seasonal workers should not be subject to different restrictions than
backpackers, especially given the justification for this requirement is preventing the
displacement of Australian workers.

As highlighted by growers across the horticulture industry, these reforms have the
potential to transform the SWP. The four trial sectors face their own set of constraints. As
it stands, take-up of the SWP, though increasing steadily, remains very low. The biggest risk
the SWP faces is one of irrelevance. The implementation of these reforms would remove
the Seasonal Worker Program from the periphery, and make it central both to the future of
horticulture in Australia and to the development of the Pacific.

Appendix A. Survey Respondents

The survey was carried out between February and April 2014 and covered growers from
all states and territories, including all of the major horticultural regions across Australia.
There was a great deal of variation in the farm sizes of survey respondents ranging from
family-run farms with less than a hectare and one seasonal worker, to corporate holdings
with 1,700 hectares and over one thousand seasonal workers. All of the major crop types
were covered including bananas, berries, canned fruits, citrus, dried fruits, flowers, melons,
nuts, pome fruits, stone fruits, table grapes, vegetables and wine grapes.

The employers who participated in the 2011 survey were the primary sample for this
survey. 183 out of the 191 employers who participated in the 2011 survey were re-
contacted. Of these 101 answered; 25 declined; 45 were either no longer in the telephone
directory, had an invalid phone number or had sold the farm; and 12 were unable to be
contacted (Table A.1).

A secondary sample of 200 randomly selected horticultural employers from across
Australia was also contacted. These employers were randomly sourced from the telephone
directory and mailed the survey with reply-paid envelopes. For those who did not return
the survey, follow-up telephone calls were made. Of the group of 200 employers from the
secondary sample; 76 answered; 27 declined; 58 either had an invalid address, invalid
phone number or had sold the farm; and 39 were unable to be contacted (Table A.1). In
addition, 40 Approved Employers and participating growers were surveyed. The size of the
full sample of employers was thus 217.
Finally, the horticultural industry bodies representing various crops and regions across
Australia were surveyed. Given there is no single horticultural peak body in Australia, a
                                             33
wide array of 43 industry bodies were surveyed to gain an overarching reflection of the
industry.

Overall, there were 260 survey respondents incorporating all growers, AEs and
horticultural industry bodies. This number compares favorably with surveys of
horticultural employers that preceded the SWP – Peter Mares’ 2006 survey in the Murray
Valley received 176 valid replies (Mares 2006). It also compares well with the number of
respondents in the RSE’s annual employer surveys across the horticulture and viticulture
sectors in New Zealand, which received 214 replies in 2010, 251 in 2011, and 262 in 2012
(DOL 2010; DOL 2011; MBIE 2012). Finally it compares favorably with Hay and Howes’
(2012) survey, which had 191 respondents in total.
