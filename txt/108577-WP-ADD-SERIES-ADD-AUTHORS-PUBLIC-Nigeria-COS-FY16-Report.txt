I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in Nigeria perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues Facing Nigeria
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Nigeria
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information

II. Methodology
From April to May 2016, 520 stakeholders of the WBG in Nigeria were invited to provide their
opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion survey.
Participants were drawn from the Office of the President/Prime Minister; office of a minister;
office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments; Project Management Units
(PMUs) overseeing implementation of WBG projects; consultants/contractors working on WBG-
supported projects/ programs; local governments; bilateral/multilateral agencies; private sector
organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks; non-profit
organizations/community based organizations; the media; independent government institutions;
trade unions; faith-based groups; youth groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; the
judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 510 stakeholders participated in the survey
(98% response rate).

Respondents received and completed with the presence of a representative of the independent
fielding agency. Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Nigeria; their overall
attitudes toward the WBG; the WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work
and activities; working with the WBG; the WBG’s future role in Nigeria; and the WBG’s
communication and information sharing.

Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.

The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY’13 (response rate is 97%, N=835). Data were weighted to reach the same
stakeholder composition in two years, which allows for year comparisons. Stakeholder groups
which were not present in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents
who belonged to the “other” stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, means of
the FY’16 data and the total number of respondents in both years are slightly different from those
of the original data reported in appendices A, B, C, D, and F. For the weighted stakeholder
breakdown and year comparison results, please see appendix E (page 98).

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
       Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s Country Survey are significantly less
        familiar with the WBG than respondents in the FY’13 Country Survey (weighted mean in
        FY’16 = 5.5; weighted mean in FY’13 = 5.9)1.
       Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
        with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Nigeria, and significantly,
        moderately correlated with the extent to which the WBG plays a relevant role in
        development in Nigeria and the extent to which the WBG contributes to the country’s
        development results.

V. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
Attributing Failed/Slow Reform Efforts
      Year comparison: Respondents in the previous FY’13 Country Survey indicated that

       (24%).”
      Stakeholder groups: Among this year’s respondents, consultants working on WBG
       projects and respondents from PMU and the office of President/Prime Minister/Minister
       were significantly more likely to attribute failed or slow WBG assisted reform efforts to
       that “reforms are not well thought out in light of the country challenges” compared to
       respondents from other stakeholder groups.

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Nigeria, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty three specific areas
of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Nigeria. The areas
       determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at environmental sustainability; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at regulatory framework.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Nigeria, suggesting that ratings of
       effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
       analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at information and communications technology;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at urban development; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at food security.

Appendix E: Responses to Selected Questions by Year22
*All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means of the FY 2016 data and the total number
of respondents each year will be slightly different from those in FY 2013 appendices.

FY ‘13 Number of comparable respondents = 802  FY ’16 Number of comparable respondents = 500

By weighting, FY 2013 and FY 2016 have the same stakeholder composition and thus are comparable.
The weighted percentage of a stakeholder group is determined by the extent to which the World Bank
Group interacts with them in the country and the percentage this group usually makes up in the past
aggregated annual global data. The weighted stakeholder breakdown is presented below:
