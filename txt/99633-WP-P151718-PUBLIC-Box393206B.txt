     local government actors. Reporting lines were clear from        that it presented in a private facility that did not have
     the start, and twice-daily supervision meetings allowed         clear channels of communication with the public health

  Box 1:  Key Conclusions for Health Sector Reform and Service Delivery Systems

  Effective leadership. The unexpected policy response to the Ebola outbreak reveals strong political and technical
  leadership in Nigeria, which can be spurred to act if sufficiently motivated. In addition, despite systemic weaknesses,
  Nigeria can organize systems to be responsive and efficient. In the absence of an immediate public threat, the key
  to eliciting this leadership may lie in the packaging of narratives and findings on global health issues.

  Timely action. The timeliness of Nigeria’s Ebola response was critical to containing the spread of the disease. From
  an individual doctor’s quick thinking and strength in the face of pressure, to the federal government’s immediate
  declaration of a national public health emergency, the timely actions of key figures allowed Nigeria to put in place
  the systems needed for an effective response. This points to the importance of ownership and close ties between
  technical processes and government oversight.

  Meaningful autonomy. Giving mid-level managers control over their operations circumvents unwieldy bureaucracy
  that can throttle a rapid response. It allows them to find innovative solutions and can catalyze the efficient
  decentralization of functions. This is consistent with the findings of performance-based financing interventions,
  which show that health care results are achieved not by policy makers but by technical cadres at operational levels,
  particularly when they are granted autonomy.

  Well-designed incentives. Incentives can help motivate health care workers, but they must be packaged and offered
  in accordance with the broader economic, political, sectoral, and cultural context. Understanding situations where
  financial incentives can work alone and those where they need to be integrated with other nonfinancial incentives
  is central to the success of any such strategy.

  Existing assets. Identifying existing assets and resources—whether organizational, infrastructural, human, or
  fiscal—and quickly harnessing these techniques, technologies, and processes can yield rapid results while ensuring
  policy continuity.

  Data-driven decisions. Data should not merely be generated, but utilized. Making information available, if properly
  generated and adequately used, fosters the potential for real-time learning and application of lessons, which could
  prevent catastrophic mistakes and guide corrective actions.

  Relevant technical assistance. Technical assistance must be timely and provided by people who have an
  understanding of local systems, organizational culture, and sectoral and political dynamics. This is best achieved
  in collaboration with competent and highly motivated local experts.



                                                                                                                            vii
