The 2010 Constitution aims to move Kenya towards a more equitable and inclusive future. As
a key step in achieving this, the Constitution lays out the right of all Kenyans to social protection.
In order to put this right into practice, the Government of Kenya has worked to develop the social
protection sector with a particular focus on social assistance through five cash transfer programmes.

In recognition of the need to improve the social assistance sector, the Government of Kenya
created the National Safety Net Programme (NSNP) in 2013 as a way to deliver these
improvements. The NSNP acts as a mechanism to: (i) coordinate fragmented programming;
(ii) strengthen implementation systems; and (iii) finance the scaling up of these programmes
to ensure greater coverage. In the past few years, the NSNP has made considerable progress
on increasing access to social assistance as well as increasing the effectiveness and efficiency
of the cash transfer programmes. Further, as the NSNP has developed, the government has
continued to identify further potential areas for improvement as well as other potential cash
transfer programmes that might serve Kenya’s vulnerable populations. This report discusses in
detail the specific aims of the NSNP and the progress that it has made in securing a more
efficient and effective safety net in Kenya.
