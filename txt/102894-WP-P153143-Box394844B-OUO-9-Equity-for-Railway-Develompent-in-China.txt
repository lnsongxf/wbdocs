Stakeholder contributions and
Other Impacts
Customers. PKP Cargo customers have
benefitted from improvement in PKP’s
service and from strong rail market
competition within Poland and the European
Union.

Employees. PKP Cargo employment has
declined from 51,400 in 2001 to 22,000 in
2014. This was accomplished through
retirement, attrition and a variety of
voluntary programs.                             .

Local communities: Communities benefit
from PKP Cargo employment and provision
of transport to local communities and
experience negative impacts such as noise,
blockage of level crossings, and risk of
accidents. They have seen reductions in
employment and benefitted from efforts to
improve safety.

The Futakotamagawa station redevelopment
project, as one of the largest redevelopment
projects in Tokyo, is progressing near
Futakotamagawa station on a 11.2 hectare
block at the site of the former
Futakotamagawa amusement park.

It targets well-defined groups. The inner-city
office space included in this mixed-use
development targets innovative industries
and creative workers, distinguishing itself
from other office buildings for conventional
white-collar businesses in Tokyo’s central
areas.                                            Source: Financing Transit-Oriented Development with Land Values (World Bank 2015)
