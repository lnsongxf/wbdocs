    PHILIPPINES FINANCIAL INCLUSION AND CAPABILITY SURVEY
                                        SUMMARY OF RESULTS
    About 10 million adults report saving money but do not have an accounts with a formal financial
     institution. Significant opportunities for expanding inclusion exist among low income group - 98% of
     those reporting that they save money but do not have an account earn less than PhP50,000.

    23 million adult Filipinos or 55% report that their households run out of money for food and other
     necessary items. Even among those earning more than PhP50,000 – 23% state that they run short of
     money for basic necessities. Among the households that report that they run short of money for basic
     necessities the use of credit is near universal - 94% borrow to cover costs.

    Those who plan their expenditures or budget are more likely to report that they have money left after
     paying for basic necessities and less likely to say that they have borrowed more than they can afford.
     All relationships are significant after controlling for income and other socio-economic characteristics.
     59% of Filipinos report that they plan how they will spend the money they receive, and 86% of those
     responding positively state that they stick to the plan.

    Filipinos are more likely to use informal credit and saving services than formal financial services. Only
     4% of respondents report having a mortgage, 5% a credit card and 10% a credit product from a formal
     financial institution. At the same time more than a third rely on informal savings and credit.

    Those with higher financial literacy scores are more likely to report that they have money left over
     after paying for basic necessities and less likely to say that they have borrowed beyond their means.
     Higher financial literacy scores are strongly correlated with the level of education. There are no
     consistent patterns between levels of financial literacy and income, gender, rural or urban location,
     employment and age.

PLANNING
Those who plan their expenditures or budget and those who are more financially literate are more likely
to report that they have money left after paying for basic necessities, less likely to say that they have
borrowed more than they can afford and less likely to buy things they cannot afford. All relationships
are significant after controlling for income and other socio-economic characteristics.

 correct. All relationships are statistically significant.
