EXECUTIVE SUMMARY



Since the Asian Financial Crisis in the late 1990s and through the Global Financial Crisis of the last decade,
commendable progress has been made by the member states of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN)
in improving economic and human development outcomes both within each country and across countries. Since
1997, the economies of the poorest countries in the ASEAN—Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Viet Nam—have
generally grown faster than the richer economies, which has reduced gaps in per capita incomes. Overall, child
mortality rates have been cut by two-thirds across the ASEAN. And significant reductions have occurred even in
some of the poorer member countries such as Cambodia and Lao PDR. Net primary school enrolment rates have
risen in most countries, but particularly in the poorest ones, meaning that the gap between the countries with the
lowest and highest rates has been reduced from 26 percentage points in 1998 to about eight percentage points in
2012. Finally, more than seven in ten Cambodians and Laotians now have access to clean water, compared to less
than four in ten in 1998. The gap in living standards across the ASEAN community is being bridged, albeit gradually.

However, this report—The ASEAN Equitable Development Monitor (henceforth referred to as The Monitor)—also
shows that much remains to be done to ensure that the poorest members of the ASEAN community—within
countries and across countries—are not left behind as the countries of the ASEAN integrate further. In both policies
and development outcomes, differences across the countries of the ASEAN remain large. For instance, while the
World Bank Group’s Doing Business 2014 report judged Singapore to be the easiest country in the world to do
business, Myanmar was judged to be the sixth most difficult country in the world. Differences in access to financial
services—98 percent of Singaporeans have a bank account, compared to just four percent of Cambodians—imply
large gaps in the extent to which citizens can save earnings and protect themselves from economic shocks. And
large differences still persist in education and health outcomes. While net secondary enrolment rates in Indonesia
and Thailand are close to 80 percent, they are about half that level in Cambodia and Lao PDR. A baby born in Lao
PDR is still more than twenty times as likely to die in his or her first month of life than one born in Singapore. And,
even within countries, socioeconomic status and location are the biggest determinants of the quality of medical care
available to mothers and children. In the Philippines, for instance, only 26 percent of deliveries by mothers from the
poorest wealth quintile are attended to by a skilled medical professional, compared to 94 percent of deliveries for
the richest fifth.

In this context, the Monitor is designed to facilitate further discussion on policies and programs that can promote
inclusive growth within ASEAN member countries and across the ASEAN community. It presents a number of
indicators that are intended to provide a summary of development outcomes across and within the ten ASEAN
countries and over time. On this basis, the Monitor is intended to help policymakers in ASEAN member states to
identify areas of concerns and prioritize national and regional interventions.

The Monitor tracks indicators across two broad sets of development outcomes and policies: (i) Economic Development
and (ii) Human Development. Each is described below in greater detail.

Economic Development indicators cover four aspects:

Economic Growth and Macroeconomic Stability: Over the past 15 years, faster growth in the poorest countries
of the ASEAN has enabled limited convergence in living standards. However, gaps across member countries remain
large. The average income in the richest ASEAN member state is more than 45 times that of the poorest, even
adjusting for differences in purchasing power. Countries’ macroeconomic policies have also generally been sound,
stabilizing fiscal positions, limiting inflationary pressures, and managing external debt sustainably. Finally, most
ASEAN economies have increased their integration with the global economy since the late-1990s, particularly the
lower-income countries and Singapore.

Enterprise Development: Data available on the performance of individual enterprises indicate that, during the
period covered by individual surveys, firms in Indonesia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet Nam were generally successful
in growing their workforces. In Viet Nam, firms were especially successful during the surveyed period (2006–09) at
achieving labor force growth. However, firm performance in Myanmar lags, with the ability of firms to participate in
international markets an area of particular concern.

Business Regulation and Facilitation: ASEAN member states have generally eased regulations on private
businesses. Particularly noteworthy is the progress made by Cambodia and Lao PDR. Nonetheless, the ease of doing
business varies substantially across ASEAN economies. In Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar, for instance, it still
remains very cumbersome to start, operate, expand, or close a business through official channels. Singapore, on the
other hand, outperforms all other high-income economies in its ease of doing business.

Access to Finance: Gaps in access to finance remain large across the ASEAN. Whereas the average proportion of the
population holding an account at a financial institution is 17 percent in the four poorest countries of the ASEAN, it is
57 percent in the middle- and high-income countries of the ASEAN. Disparities exist in the ability to save earnings as
well, with Singaporeans and Thais more likely to have saved money compared to people in Cambodia and Viet Nam.

Human Development indicators cover four areas:

Education: Substantial progress has been made over the past 15 years in closing gaps in educational enrolment
and attainment across the ASEAN, especially at the primary level. Nonetheless, significant gaps still remain across
countries at higher levels of education as well as in the quality of education. Up to 60 percent of children in some
countries do not attend secondary school. In the relevant age groups, a higher proportion of youth attend university
and other tertiary institutions in Thailand than attend secondary school in Lao PDR. And quality deficiencies in
many ASEAN countries mean that their youth enter adulthood still being unable to read or write.

Health: Health outcomes have also registered impressive improvements in most countries. Nevertheless, gains have
been slow to reach poorer families and those in rural areas, even where there has been overall progress. Within Lao
PDR, which has the highest rate of infant mortality in the ASEAN, a child afflicted with diarrhea in a poor household
is half as likely as a child in a rich household to get adequate and timely treatment. In many low- and middle-income
ASEAN countries, poor women in rural areas also generally have limited access to skilled birth attendants.

Nutrition: Progress achieved by ASEAN member states in improving child nutrition indicators—which are a key
determinant of performance later in life—has been mixed. Reductions in the proportion of babies born with low birth
weight have been modest in many countries and while rates of stunting and of underweight children have generally
declined, the prevalence of wasting generally has not. Poorer children in many countries are overwhelmingly more
likely to suffer from malnutrition and thus are less likely to enjoy healthy and productive lives.

Water, Sanitation, and Electricity: Access to improved water and sanitation facilities has substantially improved
across the ASEAN over the past two decades, although persistent between- and within-country disparities remain
in sanitation. Large disparities also persist in access to electricity and the use of solid fuels, particularly between
rural and urban areas in Cambodia and Lao PDR.

Despite the utility of these indicators in providing a summary snapshot of the development gap among the member
states of ASEAN as a guide for policy priorities, they are imperfect. Apart from their obvious limitation that they leave
out significant facets of development, there is also the issue of measurement. Data coverage for many indicators


                                                                                                            e x eC Ut I Ve sU M M A Ry      xi

is often far from complete, with many countries missing some time periods and some countries not covered at
all. Moreover, the quality of the data is also variable across countries and time. For instance, in the absence of
comprehensive systems of life event registration, the formulation of indicators such as infant mortality necessitates
extrapolations that are susceptible to various statistical biases and other errors. Where these imperfections exist,
this report makes note of them, both to calibrate the interpretation of the indicator and to underscore the priority
that ASEAN member states need to place on improving the quality and availability of data on development outcomes
and their determinants.

Equitable Development in the ASEAN

2015 will mark the creation of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) and with it a new freedom for goods, services,
capital, and skills to move across the borders and seas that separate ASEAN’s ten member states. These changes
will undoubtedly enhance the economic opportunities available to those with the skills, capital, or market position
to benefit, but the effects that the AEC will have on the poorest members of the ASEAN community are less clear.

In recognition of the importance of ensuring that all ASEAN community members benefit equitably from the AEC, in
2011 the ASEAN member states established the ASEAN Framework for Equitable Economic Development (AFEED).
The Framework commits the ten member states to working together to promote a narrowing of development gaps
within and between member states; to improve access to opportunities for human development, social welfare and
justice; and to increase participation in the process of ASEAN integration and community building (ASEAN [2011]).

recently published by the World Bank to provide for
more accurate comparisons across time and countries,
as of 2002, 39 percent of the population of Viet Nam eked out a living on less than US$1.25 per day (World Bank
[2014b]), while 69 percent lived on less than US$2 per day. By 2008, these proportions had been reduced to 15 and
44 percent, respectively. Poverty in Cambodia, one of the poorest countries in the ASEAN, has also fallen dramatically
over a short time period, with a 23 percentage point reduction in the proportion of the population living on less
than US$1.25 per day recorded between 2004 and 2011. Reductions in poverty have been also observed in all six
ASEAN member states for which comparable poverty estimates are available (Figure 2 and Figure 3).

Despite the progress achieved over the past decade, large differences in poverty levels continue to persist across the
ASEAN. As of 2012, Lao PDR has the highest incidence of poverty in the ASEAN, with 30 percent of the population
subsisting on less than US$1.25 per day and 62 percent of the population subsisting on less than US$2 per day. In
Thailand, which has the lowest incidence of poverty of any of the six ASEAN countries for which data are available,
only 0.1 percent of the population subsists on less than $1.25 per day and 12 percent subsists on less than $2 per
day.

As is the case elsewhere in the world, the substantial reductions in poverty observed in the ASEAN have been
strongly correlated with rapid economic growth (Figure 4).1 However, growth does not always mean that there
is also more equality in incomes or expenditures. One way to look at this question is to examine the evolution of
the Gini coefficient for expenditures (or incomes) over time. In Cambodia, the Gini coefficient in 2011 (0.28) was
lower than in 2004 (0.33), implying that economic growth over the period went along with greater equality in the
distribution of incomes and spending (Figure 5). Economic growth in Thailand also appears to have had the same
effect over the past decade. However, the opposite has been the case in Indonesia and Lao PDR, with the distribution
of income and spending becoming relatively more skewed.

The persistently high levels of inequality in Indonesia and the Philippines underscore the relatively small extent to
which economic growth in these countries has, over recent years, benefited the poor. In particular, rates of poverty
reduction in Indonesia and the Philippines have been slower than those recorded in Cambodia or Viet Nam. As
of 2012, the incidences of both US$1.25 and US$2 poverty in Indonesia and the Philippines were higher than in
Cambodia and Viet Nam. As a result, the poor in the ASEAN are now increasingly concentrated in middle-income

1    In the case of Thailand, the income of the poor increased more than the national average income between 1992 and 1999 and 1999 and 2004. This was also the case in
     Indonesia between 1984 and 1990. On the other hand, the income growth of the poor was lower than the national average during 1990 and 1996 and 2002 and 2009 in
     Indonesia. Such differences underscore the importance of not just focusing on increasing economic growth, but on ensuring that economic growth brings with it equitable
     increases in living standards.

Philippines lived on less than $1.25 per day.

With the rapid growth and poverty reduction observed among ASEAN’s poorer countries, the gaps in living standards
across the ASEAN have been narrowing over recent years. Nonetheless, these gaps remain extremely large (Figure
7). Adjusting for purchasing power parity (PPP), the average per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2013 of
the four poorest countries in the ASEAN was US$3,722; that of the three middle-income countries was $10,161; and
that of the three richest countries was $57,934. Even within these broad groupings, there are substantial differences.
Incomes among the four poorest ASEAN countries range from US$1,740 in Myanmar to $5,293 in Viet Nam; incomes
in the middle-income group range from $6,533 in the Philippines to $14,390 in Thailand; and incomes in the higher-
income group range from $23,298 in Malaysia to $78,744 in Singapore.




Monitoring Equitable Development in the ASEAN

To facilitate the development of policies and programs that increase the extent to which poor members of the
ASEAN community are able to benefit from economic growth, the ASEAN Secretariat and the World Bank Group
have developed the ASEAN Equitable Development Monitor. The Monitor reports the levels and trends of a series of
outcome and policy indicators, which may in turn be used to identify areas of concern for individual member states
or the ASEAN community and thereby set priorities for action.

Indicators tracked by the Monitor are grouped according to two broad categories: (i) Economic Development, which
assesses the performance of ASEAN economies in achieving economic growth and macro stability, promoting private
enterprise development, easing the business environment, and improving access to financial services; and (ii)
Human Development, which assesses the extent to which ASEAN member states are ensuring that their citizens are
equipped to contribute productively to economic activity and to enjoy improvements in non-monetary dimensions
of welfare, such as access to education and health, nutrition, and access to clean water, sanitation and energy.

Indicators tracked by the Monitor have been selected to ensure broad coverage across the ASEAN member states,
comparability across time and space, and to collectively present a broad picture of the success of the ASEAN
community in achieving a range of development outcomes and policies, which are either intrinsic to equitable

Economic Growth and Macroeconomic Stability

A growing economy is fundamental to the improvement of well-being. Notwithstanding recent concerns about
increasing levels of inequality worldwide, solid empirical evidence continues to underscore the mantra that ‘growth
is good for the poor’. For developing economies, in particular, rates of economic growth are among the most powerful
determinants of rates of poverty reduction and of improvements in human development outcomes.

Years of economic progress can be quickly erased, however, by macroeconomic instability, a fact acutely demonstrated
by the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. Sound macroeconomic policy—prudent management of external liabilities,
restraint of inflationary pressures, and the holding of precautionary reserves—is critical both to preventing such
crises and to stimulating growth by reassuring investors of the economy’s stability.

Integration with regional and global economies is ordinarily a critical element in the pursuit of economic growth
and macroeconomic stability. The economic interdependence achieved through integration allows countries to
pool resources to tackle crises when they arise, while also fueling increases in living standards through enabling
exploitation of gains from trade and transfer of productive technologies.

The success of the ASEAN community in promoting economic growth and macroeconomic stability since the Asian
Financial Crisis is assessed by examining differences over time and between member states in four groups of
indicators: (i) Economic Growth, which measures how the intensity of production and living standards are changing
over time and in comparison with other countries; (ii) Fiscal Balances and Debt Sustainability, which tracks whether
ASEAN member states are practicing sustainable budgetary policies and debt management consistent with reducing
the risk of financial crises; (iii) Inflation and Financial Deepening, which tracks changes in the consumer price index
and the money supply; and (iv) Integration, which reports ratios of exports to GDP and flows of foreign direct
investment (FDI).

Growth in the three economies of the ASEAN with higher levels of per capita income—Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia,
and Singapore—has also been volatile over the past 15 years (Figure 10). Economic growth in Brunei Darussalam
was relatively low throughout the period. Malaysia and Singapore, on the other hand, reported strong growth after
1998, steep declines in 2001, and then robust growth again in the lead-up to the Global Financial Crisis, followed
by a steep decline. Since 2008, both the Malaysian and Singaporean economies have recovered strongly. In 2013,
Malaysia and Singapore reported real economic growth rates of 4.7 percent and 3.9 percent, respectively.

capita GDP in Singapore increased 59 percent between
1999 and 2013 and, in Malaysia, by 53 percent. In
Brunei Darussalam, however, real output per capita in
2013 was actually 6 percent lower than in 1999.

Over the past 15 years, the high rates of economic growth achieved by Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet
Nam relative to other member states have narrowed the gap in per capita incomes across the ASEAN (Figure 11).
Thus, while per capita incomes in Singapore and Malaysia have, on average, grown faster over the past 15 years
than some of the poorer middle-income countries, such as the Philippines, living standards in the poorer ASEAN
countries have, on average, gotten closer to living standards in the richer ASEAN countries. In spite of this general

phenomemon of convergence in incomes, however, the gulf in per capita incomes across the ASEAN community
remains very large, even when differences in price levels between countries are taken into consideration (Figure
12). As of 2013, citizens of the richest country in the ASEAN, Singapore, earned incomes that, on average, had
45 times higher purchasing power than those earned by citizens of the poorest country in the ASEAN, Myanmar.

Since the Asian Financial Crisis, the management of external debt stocks and debt servicing has generally improved
across the ASEAN (Figure 14 and Figure 15). Particular improvements were reported by Cambodia (which reduced
its external stock from 240 percent of exports in 1998 to 66 percent in 2012), Indonesia (from a debt stock of
267 percent of exports in 1998 to 119 percent in 2012 and from servicing costs of 37 percent of exports to 17 percent
of exports), Lao PDR (from a debt stock 496 percent of exports in 1998 to 218 percent in 2012), Myanmar (from
a debt stock of 323 percent of exports in 1998 to 91 percent in 2011), Thailand (from a debt stock of 152 percent
of exports in 1998 to 47 percent in 2012 and servicing costs from 18 percent of exports to 4 percent over the
same period), and Viet Nam (external debt fell from 185 percent in 1998 to 48 percent in 2012, while the cost of
servicing fell from 9 percent to 2 percent over the same period). Malaysia and the Philippines achieved relatively

The recent economic histories of Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet Nam have been marked
by periods of high inflation (Figure 16). In 1998, Indonesia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar reported increases in their
respective consumer price indices (CPI) of 58 percent, 91 percent, and 51 percent, respectively. Since then, however,
Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar have successfully tamed inflationary pressures, with all reporting CPI
increases of less than 7 percent in 2013. Inflationary pressures have been building in Viet Nam, however, with the
average annual CPI increase over the 2008–12 period (13.4 percent) being substantially above that observed in the
late 1990s and early 2000s.

Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand all have experienced relatively low inflation
rates over the past 15 years (Figure 17). While pressures built with the onset of the Global Financial Crisis in 2008,
these have been successfully resolved and, as of 2013, all five countries reported annual CPI increases of 3 percent
or less. Overall, the management of wage and price increases has improved substantially across the ASEAN in the
past 15 years.

Lower income countries in the ASEAN—principally, Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam—have achieved financial
deepening over the past 15 years, as measured by the 'near' money supply (M2), which captures savings deposits,
money market funds and other time deposits, and thus reflects the development of country financial systems and

Rates of economic integration have historically varied enormously in the ASEAN, with the entrepôt of Singapore
standing alongside states that until recent decades, existed in virtual economic isolation. The past 15 years has seen
a general integration of the ASEAN with the global economy. Large increases have been achieved by Cambodia and
Viet Nam (Figure 19), providing these economies with access to productivity-enhancing technologies and capital
which are not available locally. Whereas Cambodia's export-to-GDP ratio stood at just 29 percent in 1998, by 2012,
total annual exports had reached 85 percent of GDP. Viet Nam's increase was similar, with exports-to-GDP rising
from 29 percent in 1998 to 79 percent in 2012. Singapore, which has established itself as the world's foremost
transshipment hub, had integrated even further since 1998, increasing its export-to-GDP ratio to 226 percent by
2012 (Figure 20).

to-GDP ratio of 95 percent, the economies of Brunei Darussalam (56 percent in 2012), Indonesia (36 percent), Lao
PDR (36 percent), and the Philippines (45 percent) are all poorly integrated with the world economy.

Increases in inflows of FDI to ASEAN countries have generally not matched those of exports, indicating that
deepening integration is being driven mostly by indigenous firms rather than foreign multinationals. Among
low- and middle-income countries in the ASEAN, Cambodia and Viet Nam have experienced the most success in
attracting foreign direct investment, with FDI-to-GDP ratios of 11 percent and 5 percent respectively as of 2012
(Figure 21). The involvement of foreign investors in the economies of Indonesia, Lao PDR, the Philippines, and
Thailand, remains relatively small, however, at 2 percent, 3 percent, 1 percent, and 3 percent respectively. Foreign
investment is particularly important to the Singapore economy, with net inflows reaching 21 percent of GDP in 2012
(Figure 22). FDI is appreciably lower in Brunei Darussalam and Malaysia, at 5 percent and 3 percent respectively.

Note: The sample of firms represented here surveyed firms that were in existence at least three fiscal years prior
                                                                                                                   questionnaires.3 Surveys were administered in
to the survey. Size classifications are based on the same years.
                                                                                                                   Indonesia, the Philippines, and Viet Nam in 2009, and
                                                                                                                   in Lao PDR in 2012, and in Myanmar in 2014, enabling
insights into enterprise development processes in these countries (Figure 23), but with the limitation that these
insights may not potentially be applicable to periods beyond the years covered by the survey.

Enterprise development in Indonesia, Myanmar, the Philippines, and Viet Nam is assessed through examining
differences within and between these countries in the following firm-level indicators: (i) Sales Growth, assessed over
the three fiscal years prior to the administration of the survey; (ii) Employment Growth; the rate of (iii) Graduation
of micro, small-and-medium sized enterprises into large enterprises of 100 employees or more over the previous
three years; and (iv) Export Orientation, measured by the share of firms with at least 10 percent of sales in foreign
markets.



                                                                                                     Sales Growth

Measured by sales volume, enterprises in Viet Nam and Lao PDR grew appreciably faster over the respective time
period covered by the individual surveys, as compared to firms in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Myanmar (Figure
24). On average, sales of Vietnamese firms grew more than 150 percent per annum in the three years prior to 2009.

2    Microenterprises are defined as those consisting of between 5 and 19 employees; small and medium enterprises (SMEs) as those employing between 20 and 99 people,
     and large enterprises consisting of those employing 100 or more people. See also Kushnir et al. (2010).

Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with between 20 and 99 employees grew the fastest, more than tripling
sales volume every year on average. Enterprises in Lao PDR reported annual average sales growth in excess of
100 percent in the three years leading up to 2012. Microenterprises achieved especially large growth, more than
doubling sales every year. Sales growth among firms in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Myanmar was, on average, at
16 percent, 12 percent, and 11 percent per annum in the three years prior to the survey year (2009, 2009, and 2014,
respectively). Firms experiencing rapid sales growth in Lao PDR and Viet Nam were concentrated in manufacturing
(Figure 25).

Reflecting strong sales growth, firms in Viet Nam grew the largest in employment over the three year period
preceding the survey (2006–09), with average rate of increase in workforces of 6.3 percent per annum (Figure 26).
Surveyed firms in Lao PDR grew, on average, 1.8 percent per annum over 2009–12. Firms in Myanmar (3.4 percent)
expanded relatively rapidly despite the anemic growth in sales over the surveyed period. Employment growth was
very weak during the 2006–09 period among firms surveyed in the Philippines and Indonesia, with only 0.4 percent
and 0.1 percent annual average growth in workforces.

Within countries, there are large differences in employment creation based on firm characteristics. Specifically,
microenterprises (less than 20 employees) were more likely to expand, while large enterprises contracted on
average in Indonesia, Lao PDR, and the Philippines. Employment growth was relatively evenly spread across sectors
(Figure 27). The retail sector was the predominant contributor to employment growth in Viet Nam, while other
services led employment growth in Lao PDR.

Firms in Viet Nam were the most successful in transitioning to large enterprises (Figure 28). Over 2006–09, 7 percent
of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises graduated into large enterprises employing over 100 workers. Among
SMEs specifically, the graduation rate was 12 percent. Graduation rates in Indonesia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and the
Philippines were similar, with between 1 and 2 percent of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises graduating.
Across all five countries, enterprises in the manufacturing section were more likely than firms in other sectors to
graduate into large enterprises (Figure 29). 8 percent of manufacturing firms with under 99 employees in Lao PDR
and 11 percent in Viet Nam made the transition.

At the time of the respective surveys, Viet Nam had the biggest share of exporting firms, followed by Lao PDR,
the Philippines, Indonesia, and Myanmar (Figure 30). Unsurprisingly, manufacturing firms were more likely than
service sector firms to export. Lao PDR had the highest share of manufacturing firms exporting, followed by Viet
Nam, while Indonesia had the lowest.

Business Regulation and Facilitation

The ability of firms to contribute to economic development can be either facilitated or constrained by business
regulation and supporting services. Good regulations establish predictable and inexpensive means for firms to
resolve disputes and for investors to recover assets from a failed firm and facilitate business finance by supporting
the availability of credit information and protecting investors from misuse of corporate assets. Poor regulations,
on the other hand, burden entrepreneurs with significant costs—in both money and time—to start and operate
business, expand operations, pay taxes, and import and export goods. The World Bank Group's Doing Business
Report provides measures of the quality of business regulations and their effects on domestic small and medium-
size companies throughout their life-cycle.

To assess how enabling environments for businesses in the ASEAN have evolved and how they currently compare,
the report tracks ten areas of business regulation: (i) Starting a Business quantifies procedures required to register a
firm and the associated time and cost; (ii) Construction Permits gauges the number, time, and cost of procedures for
obtaining construction permits; (iii) Getting Electricity assesses the number, time, and cost of procedures to obtain
an electricity connection for a business; (iv) Registering Property reports the number, time and cost of procedures
required for an entrepreneur to purchase property; (v) Getting Credit quantifies the extent to which laws protect the
rights of borrowers and lenders and the coverage of public credit registries and bureaus; (vi) Protecting Investors
measures legal protections of minority shareholders from the misuse of corporate assets; (vii) Enforcing Contracts
assesses the complexity, time, and cost of enforcing a commercial sale dispute over the quality of goods; (viii)
Resolving Insolvency accounts for the average time to close a business and cost of bankruptcy proceedings, as well
recovery rates by claimants; (ix) Paying Taxes measures the time it takes to prepare, file and pay business taxes;
and (x) Trading Across Borders reports the complexity, time, and cost of compliance with procedures to clear a
standardized cargo of goods for export or import.



                                                      Starting a Business

Procedures for registering new businesses—which include submission of documentation, payment of fees, and
the depositing of paid-minimum capital—can, if burdensome, dissuade entrepreneurs from entering the formal
sector. Since 2003, progress has been made in reducing the complexity, time, and costs of such procedures across
the ASEAN. Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand all substantially reduced the number of procedures required to
register a business over the period (Figure 32). Malaysia, for instance, simplified procedures in 2012 by merging
company, tax, social security and employment fund registrations at a ‘one-stop shop’. Business registration remains
cumbersome, however, in Brunei Darussalam (15 procedures), Cambodia (11), Indonesia (10), Myanmar (11), the
Philippines (15), and Viet Nam (10).

The time it takes to register a business (Figure 33) has been reduced substantially between 2004 and 2013 in
Indonesia (from 151 to 48 days) and Lao PDR (from 153 to 92 days), but remains high in Brunei Darussalam
(101 days) and Cambodia (104 days). In contrast, registration takes only two and a half days in Singapore and six
days in Malaysia.

The costs of starting a business (Figure 34) have fallen in Indonesia from an estimated 140 percent of gross national
income (GNI) per capita in 2004 to 21 percent in 2013. These reductions primarily came about through the cutting
of fees for company deeds, legalization, publication, registration, and licensing in 2010. Cambodia has also reduced
registration costs from a staggering 540 percent of GNI per capita in 2003, but increased fees for the approval and
stamping of registration documents and for completing incorporation in 2013. At 151 percent in 2013, costs remain
second only to Myanmar (177 percent). Costs in all other ASEAN countries fall below 10 percent of GNI per capita.

Procedures for securing approvals for the construction of commercial and industrial buildings can impose
additional costs on the establishment of new firms and the expansion of production by existing firms. Since 2006,
the complexity of procedures required to construct buildings in ASEAN countries have not changed substantially
(Figure 35). The time necessary to complete such procedures has also remained relatively constant (Figure 36),
although Malaysia has managed to simplify and expedite procedures through the establishment of a one-stop center
for new buildings. Procedures are most burdensome in Cambodia, where it takes some 652 days to obtain necessary
permits through regular channels.

The financial costs of these procedures, however, have fallen across the board (Figure 37). Indonesia, for instance,
reduced the estimated costs of procuring permits through official channels from 277 percent of GNI per capita in
2005 to 87 percent in 2013. Likewise, Viet Nam reduced costs from 212 percent to 56 percent over the same period.
Costs, however, remain especially high in Myanmar at 567 percent of GNI per capita (not shown).

Obtaining an electricity connection remains a barrier to starting and expanding businesses in the ASEAN, particularly
in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar. Obtaining a connection in Indonesia and Viet Nam requires no less than six
procedures (Figure 38), a wait of some 168 days in Cambodia (Figure 39), and a fee equal to over 3,000 percent of
GNI per capita in Myanmar (Figure 40).

The time and cost of obtaining a connection is also very high in Lao PDR (a wait of 134 days and fees equal to
1,900 percent of GNI per capita), Indonesia (101 days and 371 percent of GNI per capita), and Viet Nam (115 days
and 1,700 percent of GNI per capita). By way of contrast, obtaining a connection takes only 32 days in Malaysia,

The process of purchasing and registering a business property can be cumbersome, deterring entrepreneurs and
diverting firm resources. Procedures for registering property generally have not been simplified at all in ASEAN
member states over the past 10 years (Figure 41). The only exception to this is Lao PDR, which moved to a title
system in 2010.

While the amount of time required to register property has also remained static in a number of ASEAN countries
(Figure 42), Malaysia dramatically reduced wait times from 144 days in 2009 to just 14 days by 2013 through the
introduction of online stamping. Indonesia also introduced time limits for standard procedures at the Land Registry,
achieving a moderate reduction. Lao PDR achieved a modest reduction (from 135 to 98 days) and Singapore
expedited its procedures from 20 to 5½ days by moving to an online system. The costs of registering property have
largely remained unchanged (Figure 43), although a notable reduction was achieved in Lao PDR as a result of its
move to a title system.

Singapore. Cambodia improved legal rights in 2008
(moving from 0 to 8), when it enacted a new secured transactions law enabling moveable property to be used as
collateral and which ensured secured creditors have priority in case the debtor defaults.

The depth of credit index, which measures the appropriateness of rules and practices affecting the coverage,
scope and accessibility of credit information available through either a public credit registry or a private credit
bureau, varies from 0 in Myanmar to a perfect 6 in Malaysia. There is further wide variation in the coverage of
public credit registries and private credit bureaus with information on borrowing histories. There are currently no
public registries in Cambodia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand, and non-existent private bureau
coverage in Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet Nam. Indonesia and Viet Nam both set up
legal frameworks for the establishment of credit bureaus in 2013 and have been successful in increasing public
registry coverage from near zero levels in 2004 to approximately 40 percent in 2013 through extending access to
historical credit information. Private bureau coverage has also expanded rapidly over the past ten years in Malaysia,
Singapore, and Thailand.

Since 2005, Indonesia, Thailand, and Viet Nam have all improved investor protections. Indonesia and Viet Nam have
specifically strengthened requirements on the disclosure by directors of information affecting minority investors
and director liability; while Thailand has significantly strengthened measures to hold directors accountable.

(from 479 to 400 days). Nonetheless, large variation
remains. In Singapore, it takes a mere 150 days to
resolve a dispute through official channels, compared
to over three years in Myanmar.

The complexity of legal enforcement of contracts has remained relatively constant in ASEAN member states over
the past ten years. Singapore requires the fewest procedures (21), while Brunei Darussalam has the most (47).
The cost of contract enforcement, as a percentage of the claim, also remained relatively constant over the period,
preserving high variation across the ASEAN. Thailand is the least expensive place to resolve a contract dispute in
the ASEAN, with resolution only costing 15 percent of the claim. Indonesia, meanwhile, is the most expensive, where
resolving a claim is estimated to cost a full 39 percent more than the value of the claim, on average.



                                                      Resolving Insolvency

Effective bankruptcy procedures are important to help prevent the premature liquidation of sustainable businesses
and, in the event of insolvency, enable the efficient recovery of owed capital. However, little progress has been made
over the past ten years in reducing differences across the ASEAN in the strength of bankruptcy procedures (Table 5).

Among the nine ASEAN countries with bankruptcy proceedings, the recovery rate—which measures how much
claimants, such as creditors, tax authorities, and employees, can recover from an insolvent firm—varies from a high
of 89 cents on the dollar in Singapore to just 8 cents in Cambodia. Over the past ten years, the recovery rate fell in
Cambodia (from 12 cents in 2003 to 8 cents in 2013), rose in Indonesia (from 9 cents to 18 cents), rose in Malaysia
(from 38 cents to 49 cents), increased sharply in the Philippines (from 4 cents to 30 cents) as a result of the new
insolvency law, and decreased slightly in Viet Nam (from 19 cents to 16 cents).



                                                                                     Paying Taxes

Commercial tax regimes that impose high costs of compliance—in payments and time—can discourage
entrepreneurs and firms from entering the formal sector. Relatively little progress has been made over the past ten
years in reducing the dispersion in the complexity of tax regimes across the ASEAN. Medium-sized companies in
Indonesia, for instance, must make 52 payments per year, compared to just 5 for Singaporean companies (Figure 44).
Malaysia simplified its regime in 2007, reducing the number of payments from 35 to 12 and introducing electronic
filing procedures. Electronic filing also helped the Philippines simplify procedures in 2013.

The time it takes companies to prepare, file, and pay taxes also varies substantially (Figure 45). In Viet Nam, it takes
companies 872 hours per year, on average, to prepare, file, and pay their tax obligations, compared to 82 hours
per year for Singaporean firms. Notable reductions in the time burden of corporate tax regimes was achieved in
Lao PDR, with consolidation of taxes reducing the average time spent from over 670 hours in 2007 to a little over
360 hours in 2010. The time necessary to file taxes was also cut in Indonesia in 2007, achieving a reduction from
576 to 266 hours.

The financial burden of tax regimes (Figure 46) is highest in the Philippines, where tax consumes 45 percent of
commercial profit, and Myanmar, where it consumes 49 percent. At the other end of the spectrum, corporate tax
consumes just 16 percent of firm profits in Brunei Darussalam and 21 percent in Cambodia. Brunei Darussalam has
achieved the most success in cutting the financial burden of taxes through the reduction of the corporate rate from
30 percent in 2008 to 22 percent in 2010, combined with cuts in the profit tax rate and the introduction of a lower
tax rate for small businesses.

ranges from a low of 3 in Singapore to a high of 10 in Lao PDR (Figure 47).4 The complexity of import requirements
in Lao PDR was reduced by two documents in 2007 and by four documents in Thailand between 2007 and 2008 as
a result of the implementation of an e-Customs system. Cambodia, however, required more documents in 2013 than
it did in 2005.

The minimum amount of time necessary to comply with all procedures required to import goods also varies (Figure
48), although much less than it did ten years ago. Procedures have become much less time-consuming in Lao PDR
(from 55 days in 2005 to 23 days in 2013), Cambodia (43 days to 22 days), and Thailand (24 to 14 days) as a result of
the rationalization of inspection procedures and the introduction of provisions for electronic filing. However, there
has been no true convergence in costs associated with procedures to import goods (Figure 49).5 Notable reductions
were achieved by the Philippines (from US$755 per container to $585) and Thailand (from $848 to $595), but costs
rose in Brunei Darussalam ($515 to $705), Cambodia ($736 to $795), Indonesia ($486 to $615), Lao PDR ($1,420 to
$1,950 [not shown]), Malaysia ($432 to $450), Singapore ($416 to $460), and Viet Nam ($468 to $610).

The complexity of export procedures was reduced in Cambodia between 2006 and 2010 (from 11 to 9 documents),
Lao PDR in 2007 (from 15 documents to 10), the Philippines in 2010 (from 8 documents to 7), and Thailand
between 2006 and 2009 (from 12 to 5 documents). Currently, Lao PDR has the most complex export documents in
the ASEAN, while Singapore has the simplest, with just 3 documents required (Figure 50).

Cambodia and Lao PDR also substantially reduced the time burden of complying with customs procedures between
2005 and 2013, from 54 days to 24 days and from 65 days to 26 days, respectively. Singapore has the most efficient
procedures, which take only 4 days to complete, while those in Myanmar are the most cumbersome, taking 27 days
to complete (Figure 51). Substantial variation remains, however, in the cost of complying with procedures required
to export goods (Figure 52). Costs are highest in Lao PDR ($1,910 per container) and lowest in Singapore ($440 days
per container). Costs were reduced substantially in the Philippines (from $800 in 2005 to $660 in 2013) and in
Thailand ($1,042 to $760) as a result of increased use of electronic customs systems, but rose in many other ASEAN
countries.

Access to Finance

Access to personal finance is critical to enabling the poor to benefit from economic growth.6 Financial systems
provide citizens with the ability to smooth consumption through savings and borrowing, facilitate access to the
credit required to exploit business opportunities, and enable the management of risks that might otherwise have
devastating effects on household income. Without free and unfettered access to such services, the poor are limited
in their ability to exercise entrepreneurship, severely restricted in their opportunities to earn a reliable return
on what assets they do hold, and are left exposed to the effects of adverse economic shocks. A failure to provide
equitable access to financial services thereby not only constrains the extent to which poor people can participate in
economic growth, but also aggravates economic inequalities as some citizens are left less able than others to protect
themselves from the unexpected.

To assess progress across the ASEAN in providing inclusive access to financial products and services, indicators are
drawn from the 2011 Global Financial Inclusion (Global Findex) database (World Bank, 2013). This public database,
created by the World Bank’s Development Research Group, is the first broad-based effort to provide consistent cross-
country measures of the use of financial products. The report specifically examines the following four indicators: (i)
Financial Accounts, which measures the proportion of residents that hold an account at a financial institution and
what they use that account for; (ii) Borrowing, which compares the proportion of residents who obtained a loan in
the past year and in the sources of those loans, whether formal or informal; (iii) Savings, which compares the extent
to which residents of ASEAN countries have had an opportunity to save money in the past year and, if so, which
vehicle was used to save money; and (iv) Insurance, which gauges ownership of agricultural and health insurance.



                                                                                                 Financial Accounts

Large variation exists between ASEAN countries in the proportion of the population that hold an account at a
financial institution (Figure 53). Singapore is the most financially connected of the eight ASEAN countries surveyed.
Financial connectedness is also high in Thailand and Malaysia. Cambodia is the least connected, with only 4 percent
of the population possessing an account. Connectedness is also low in Indonesia, Lao PDR, the Philippines, and Viet
Nam. Across all surveyed ASEAN countries, urban residents are more likely than their rural counterparts to hold
an account, as are residents with higher levels of education and higher levels of income. On the hand, differences in
account ownership between genders are relatively small in most ASEAN countries.

Obtaining an account at a financial institution has been made easier within the ASEAN by increases in the number
of commercial bank branches (Figure 54). The number of commercial bank branches grew particularly quickly

Data on whether sampled respondents took a loan in the past year reveals substantial differences between
ASEAN countries in access to finance (Figure 55). Respondents in Cambodia, Indonesia, and the Philippines were
relatively more likely to have taken out a loan in the past year compared to respondents in Lao PDR, Malaysia,
Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam. In Cambodia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Viet Nam, funds were borrowed
predominantly from family or friends. Even in Singapore, more borrowers reported accessing funds from friends
and family than through a formal financial institution. Among the eight countries surveyed, only in Thailand did a
plurality of borrowing respondents source funds from a financial institution.

Some surprising differences exist in formal borrowing behavior within ASEAN countries. In Cambodia, Indonesia,
Lao PDR, Thailand, and Viet Nam, rural residents are more likely than their urban counterparts to borrow from
formal financial institutions. In all eight countries except Cambodia and the Philippines, men are more likely than
women to borrow from financial institutions. Interestingly, in Cambodia, Thailand, and Viet Nam, less educated
individuals are more likely than more educated individuals to borrow from financial institutions. Finally, in Thailand,
poorer individuals are more likely than their richer counterparts to borrow from the formal sector. The situation is
reversed, however, in Malaysia, the Philippines, and Singapore.

In addition to a means of transacting, credit cards also can represent a source of borrowed funds. Credit card
ownership across the eight ASEAN countries for which data is available is highest in Singapore, where 37 percent
of the adult population owns at least one credit card. Credit card ownership is relatively low in all other ASEAN
countries, however. Even in Malaysia, only 12 percent of the adult population has a card. Credit card ownership
among the adult population in the other six countries for which data is available is 5 percent or less.

There is wide variation in savings behavior across the ASEAN (Figure 57). Residents of Singapore and Thailand
are more likely to have saved money in the past year than those in the other eight ASEAN countries surveyed. In
contrast, savers were relatively rare in Cambodia and Viet Nam. Residents of Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand are
more likely to have saved at a financial institution in the past year. In contrast, residents of Cambodia and Viet Nam

Thailand, urban residents are more likely than people
living in rural areas to have saved money at a formal
financial institution. Gender differentials in rates of formal saving are negligible in all countries except Malaysia,
where women are 11 percentage points less likely than men to have saved at a formal institution in the past year.
More educated and richer individuals are more likely than poorer individuals to have saved at a formal institution.

Education

Education outcomes are vital signs of a country’s economic well-being. Disparities in educational attainment
translate into future disparities in the skills of adult citizens. Differences in education outcomes between countries
thus give rise to differences in the sophistication of goods and services that economies can generate which, in turn,
contribute to differences in living standards. Inequalities in education outcomes within countries mean that some
citizens are less able than others to command productive employment, which can produce substantial inequalities
in incomes.

To assess the progress of ASEAN member states in ensuring equitable access to education, the following indicators
are tracked: (i) Pre-Primary Enrolment, which reports the number of children enrolled in official pre-primary
education programs as a percentage of the total number of children of official pre-primary school age; (ii) Primary
School Enrolment and Completion, the latter of which measures the proportion of students enrolled in first grade
which reach fifth grade; (iii) Literacy rates for youth, adult, and elderly generations; (iv) Secondary School Enrolment;
and (v) Tertiary School Enrolment, which measures enrolment in post-secondary institutions as a percentage of the
total population of the five-year age group that follows the official secondary school leaving age.



                                                                           Pre-Primary School Enrolment

Pre-primary education is an important determinant of attainment at latter stages of education and, since 1998,
pre-primary enrolment rates have increased in all of the nine ASEAN countries for which data is available (Figure
59). Thailand and Viet Nam achieved particularly significant increases. Thailand’s gross pre-primary enrolment
rate rose from 77 percent in 1998 to 119 percent in 2013, while Viet Nam’s increased from 39 percent in 1998 to
77 percent in 2012. Indonesia’s rate also more than doubled over the period.

Despite the improvements made in the past 15 years, there are large differences in enrolment rates across the ASEAN
(Table 6). Thailand has the highest level of pre-primary enrolment in the ASEAN, with 93 percent of children in the
3–6 age bracket enrolled in pre-school. Pre-school enrolment rates are, however, very low in Cambodia (14 percent
in 2012) and Myanmar (9 percent in 2010).

Pre-primary education policies vary substantially between ASEAN countries (Figure 60). There is also substantial
diversity in the volume of investments made in pre-primary education by ASEAN countries. Thailand and Viet
Nam invest 14 and 11 percent, respectively, of education expenditure in pre-primary education. This compares

                                       Primary School Enrolment and Completion

Over the past 15 years, the ASEAN member states have made substantial progress towards universal primary
enrolment (Figure 61). Net enrolments in Cambodia and Lao PDR increased substantially, although marginally
declined in the Philippines between 1998 and 2009. Primary enrolment rates in Indonesia and Viet Nam fluctuated,
but relatively little progress appears to have been made in increasing overall enrolment rates in these countries.

For five ASEAN countries, data is available that shows how primary school attendance correlates with household
wealth (Figure 65). In Thailand and Viet Nam, differences are relatively small—children from poorer households
are almost as likely to attend school as those from richer households. However, in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar,
there are substantial differences. In Lao PDR, only 71 percent of children from households in the poorest quintile
attend school, compared to 97 percent of children from households in the richest quintile.



                                                      Literacy

As a result of the progress made in increasing access to primary education, gaps across the ASEAN in self-reported
literacy among the youth cohort are relatively minimal (Table 9). With the exception of Cambodia and Lao PDR, both
youth and adult literacy in all ASEAN countries are above 90 percent.

relative gender parity that exists in literacy rates
among the youth cohort contrasts strikingly with the
gender gaps in literacy that persist among older generations. In Cambodia and Lao PDR, for instance, gender gaps
in literacy among the elderly are 74 and 72 percentage points respectively. Only in the Philippines is there relative
gender parity in elderly literacy rates.

The gaps in access to secondary education across the
ASEAN are confirmed by data on net secondary school attendance collected by household surveys.7 Cambodia (45
percent) and Lao PDR (45 percent) have the lowest levels of secondary school attendance of the seven ASEAN
countries for which data is available. Indonesia (58 percent), Myanmar (58 percent), and the Philippines (63
percent) have moderate levels of secondary school attendance, while attendance levels in Thailand (80 percent)
and Viet Nam (81 percent) are relatively high. According to data on attendance, girls are more likely than boys to

As with primary education, substantial differences exist between ASEAN countries in the level of investments in
secondary education (Table 11). Malaysia and Thailand report relatively high levels of funding per enrolled student,
even in spite of their high enrollment rates. Funding levels in Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and
the Philippines are lower. Differences in funding levels map onto differences in pupil-teacher ratios, which range
from lows of 10 in Brunei Darussalam, 14 in Malaysia, and 15 in Singapore to 29 in Cambodia, 34 in Myanmar, and
35 in the Philippines.

Differences in secondary school funding levels and pupil-teacher ratios produce differences in student attainment.

ASEAN member states have generally made progress over the past 15 years in increasing access to tertiary education.
Thailand almost doubled gross enrolment between 1998 and 2012. Cambodia and Lao PDR also increased enrolment
from minimal levels in 1998 to 16 percent and 17 percent in 2012, respectively. Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia,
Malaysia, and Viet Nam reported a doubling or near-doubling of tertiary enrolment rates. No increase was observed,
however, in the Philippines between 1998 and 2012.

Students from a number of ASEAN member states are increasingly heading abroad for tertiary education (Figure
70 and Figure 71). Between 1998 and 2012, the number of outbound international students from Lao PDR and Viet
Nam increased dramatically. Despite these increases, the share of students studying abroad remains much higher
for Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia and Singapore than for other ASEAN countries.

9   Where vital registration systems are insufficient, rates are derived by the United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (IGME) from data collected
    by household surveys. A statistical model is fitted to data points that meet quality standards established by IGME and used to extrapolate trends (Hill et al. [2012]).
10 Maternal mortality refers to the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy
   or its management. Rates are estimated using a regression model using all available national-level maternal mortality data and data on GDP, general fertility rate, and the
   proportion of births that are attended by skilled personnel (Wilmoth et al. [2012]).
11 While impressive, this rate of progress is less than prescribed by the fourth MDG, which committed to a two-thirds reduction over 1990–2015.

In all ASEAN countries, boys are appreciably more likely to die before their fifth birthday than are girls (Figure 76).
In Thailand and Viet Nam, for instance, girls are 24 percentage points less likely to die before their fifth birthday
than are boys. Among ASEAN member states, the gender gap in child mortality is smallest in Brunei Darussalam, but
still sizeable at 16 percentage points.

Diarrhea—along with pneumonia—is among the leading causes of child death, accounting for 9 percent of all
deaths among children below the age of five worldwide.13 Diarrhea in children can be inexpensively and effectively
treated, however, by the simple administration of oral rehydration salts (ORS), together with continued feeding.
This approach has been advocated since the 1970s,14 but to date only 40 percent of children under the age of five
with diarrhea receive the recommended treatment.15

While child and infant mortality has decreased dramatically across the ASEAN over the past two decades, the rate
of reduction in deaths which occur in the first month of life (‘neo-natal’) has not matched the rate of reduction in
deaths that occur in older stages of infancy and childhood (Figure 79). As a result, the share of child deaths that
occur in the neo-natal phase has been increasing. As of 2012, neo-natal deaths made up 49 percent of child deaths
in the ASEAN.

While all ASEAN member states have made progress in reducing neo-natal mortality rates, there is large variation
across the region in the extent to which rates have fallen (Figure 80). As with child and infant mortality, Cambodia

has achieved the largest reductions in neo-natal mortality. Thailand, Singapore, and Indonesia also achieved
substantial reductions. Among ASEAN countries with neo-natal mortality rates above 10 in 1998, reductions were
more modest in Lao PDR, Myanmar, the Philippines, and Viet Nam.

While the gap among ASEAN member states in neo-natal mortality rates has appreciably narrowed since 1998,
differences remain. Babies born in Lao PDR, which had an estimated neo-natal mortality rate of 27.2 deaths per
1,000 live births in 2012, are more than twenty two times as likely to die in their first month than babies born in
Singapore, where the neo-natal mortality rate was a mere 1.2 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2012. Myanmar (26.3),
Cambodia (18.3), Indonesia (15.0), the Philippines (14.0), and Viet Nam (12.4) all have relatively high neo-natal
mortality. Neo-natal mortality is relatively low by contrast in Brunei Darussalam (4.4), Malaysia (4.5), and Thailand
(8.1).

Many deaths during pregnancy and childbirth can be prevented by access to well-trained and equipped medical
professionals. Improved access to care has enabled declines in estimated rates of maternal mortality across the
ASEAN over the past two decades. As of 1990, it estimated that, within the ten countries that are now ASEAN

pregnancy or its management. As of 2013, it is estimated that under 16,000 mothers or mothers-to-be died from
such causes (Figure 81).

Since 1995, maternal mortality ratios are estimated to have declined in all ASEAN countries but one (Figure 82 and
Figure 83). Consistent with its progress in reducing child mortality, Cambodia is estimated to have achieved the
largest fall in maternal mortality. Lao PDR is also estimated to have achieved a similarly large reduction. Indonesia,
Myanmar, and Viet Nam are estimated to have achieved more modest reductions in mortality ratios. Maternal
mortality ratios in the Philippines are estimated to have fallen only slightly over the period.

Even with the substantial progress achieved in reducing rates of maternal mortality in Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao
PDR and Myanmar, substantial differences in health risks associated with pregnancy persist across the ASEAN
(Table 16). Expectant mothers in Lao PDR, for instance, are 36 times more likely to die during pregnancy than those
in Singapore.

Similarly, large variation exists in the lifetime risk of maternal death, an indicator which incorporates information
from maternal mortality and fertility rates. A 15 year-old girl in Singapore has only a 1-in-13,900 chance of dying
from complications of pregnancy or childbirth in her lifetime. Women in Lao PDR, however, face a 1-in-130 risk.
Lifetime risk of maternal death is also high in Cambodia (1:180), Indonesia (1:220), Myanmar (1:250), and the
Philippines (1:250).

Substantial differences in access to prenatal and delivery care also exist within member states. Access to skilled birth
attendance correlates strongly with socioeconomic status (Figure 85). In Lao PDR, only 11 percent of deliveries by
mothers from the poorest wealth quintile are attended, compared to 91 percent of deliveries by mothers from the
richest quintile. The corresponding figures for the Philippines are similar: 26 percent compared to 94 percent.
Thailand represents an exception, with skilled birth attendance rates that are high regardless of the socioeconomic
status of the mother. Skilled birth attendance rates also differ markedly by location (Figure 86), with rural deliveries
relatively unlikely to be attended. In Lao PDR, only 31 percent of deliveries in rural areas are attended, compared
to 80 percent in urban areas. Thailand again provides the exception, where some 97 percent of rural deliveries are
attended.

Childhood Nutrition

The access of children and pregnant women to adequate nutrition is a critical factor in reducing child and maternal
mortality, increasing educational attendance and enrolment, and ultimately improving economic productivity.
Globally, it is estimated that 45 percent of child deaths are attributable to poor nutrition.16 In addition to its effects
on mortality, poor nutrition during the first two years of life increases the frequency and severity of common
infections and lengthens recoveries from such infections and is also associated with suboptimal brain development,
with long-lasting adverse consequences on cognitive ability, school performance, and job performance.17

Poor nutrition is, of course, a highly preventable affliction. Proven interventions to reduce malnourishment include
improving the nutrition of pregnant women and new mothers; exclusive breastfeeding during the first six months of
life and the timely provision of complementary food; and appropriate micronutrient interventions.18 It is particularly
critical that nutrition-enhancing interventions are delivered prior to a child’s second birthday, with improvements
after this appearing to have little impact.

To assess the progress of the ASEAN in ensuring equitable access to nutrition, we track the following indicators:
(i) Low Birthweight Babies, as assessed by the proportion of newborns that weigh less than 2,500 grams; and (ii)
Child Malnourishment, which is measured by the prevalence among children under five of: stunting, underweight,
wasting, severe wasting and overweight.19



                                                                                         Low Birthweight

Low birthweight can result from inadequate dietary intake during pregnancy, disease, as well as environmental and
psychosocial stress affecting the mother.20 Low birthweight increases the risk of death in infancy and childhood and,
among those children that survive, results in increased risk of disease, continued undernourishment, and impaired
mental function. Globally, it is estimated that 15 percent of babies are born with low birthweight.

Progress across the ASEAN in reducing the proportion of low-birthweight babies has been uneven (Figure 87).
Myanmar has had the most success, reporting a reduction in the proportion of low-birthweight babies born from
15 percent in 2001 to 9 percent in 2010. Low birthweights also declined in Thailand from 9 percent in 2001 to
7 percent in 2009 and in Viet Nam from 9 percent in 2000 to 5 percent in 2011. The Philippines, which has the
highest reported level of low birthweight babies at 16 percent in 2011, had relatively little progress over the period,
with the proportion falling only by a single percentage point. Progress has also been minimal in Cambodia, Lao PDR,
and Malaysia. Differences across the ASEAN in the incidence of low birthweight thus persist (Table 18).



                                                                              Child Malnourishment

Approximately a quarter of children globally are stunted or have heights that fall well below international norms.
Children residing in rural areas and/or poor households are more likely to be stunted than counterparts in urban
areas and/or rich households. As of 2011, 16 percent of children around the world under five were underweight.21
Moderate and severe wasting represents acute malnutrition, with afflicted children suffering a markedly increased
rate of death.22 While the proportion of overweight children has been declining over the past two decades, there has
been a corresponding increase in the proportion of overweight children in developing countries.

The prevalence of child malnourishment—as manifested by height and weight that fall well below international
norms—has generally decreased across the ASEAN during the past 15 years (Figure 88 and Figure 89). Viet Nam, in
particular, has achieved substantial reductions in child malnourishment, with the prevalence of stunting decreasing
from 42 percent in 1998 to 23 percent in 2010 and the ratio of children that are underweight falling from 36 percent
in 1998 to 12 percent in 2010. Cambodia also achieved noteworthy success, with stunting falling from 54 percent
in 1998 to 41 percent in 2010 and the ratio of underweight children falling from 41 percent in 1998 to 29 percent
in 2010. Reductions in child malnourishment over the period were also achieved by Indonesia, Myanmar, and the
Philippines.

The prevalence of child malnourishment across the ASEAN, nonetheless, remains high (Table 19). The most recent
data indicates that 41 percent of children in Cambodia are stunted and 29 percent are underweight; 48 percent of
children in Lao PDR are stunted and 32 percent are underweight; 35 percent of children in Myanmar are stunted
and 23 percent are underweight; and 34 percent of children in the Philippines are stunted and 20 percent are
underweight.

The prevalence of wasting and severe wasting among children—which refers to levels of weight for height that are
far below international norms—has been reduced in a number of ASEAN countries over the past 15 years (Figure
92 and Figure 93). Among Cambodian children, wasting and severe wasting fell from 15 percent and 6 percent in
1998 to 11 percent and 3 percent in 2010. Among Laotian children, wasting and severe wasting fell from 18 percent
and 8 percent in 2000 to 7 percent and 2 percent in 2006. Viet Nam also reported a reduction in wasting, which fell
from 12 percent in 1998 to 4 percent in 2010. Both wasting and severe wasting increased, however, in Indonesia,

with wasting rising from 6 percent in 2000 to 12 percent in 2010 and severe wasting rising from 1 percent in 2000
to 5 percent in 2010.

As with other nutrition indicators, there remain substantial gaps across the ASEAN in the prevalence of wasting and
severe wasting (Table 20). Among ASEAN member states with relatively recent data, Indonesia has the highest levels
of wasting (12 percent as of 2010) and severe wasting (5 percent). At the other end of the spectrum, Singapore has
the lowest levels of wasting (4 percent) and severe wasting (1 percent) among the ASEAN member states.

Water, Sanitation and Electricity

Access to modern amenities and services—such as clean drinking water, hygienic sanitary facilities, regular
electricity, and non-solid cooking fuels—are generally taken for granted by residents of high-income countries.
However, inadequate access to such amenities and services can be life-threatening for poor households in low- and
middle-income countries. The sourcing of drinking water from polluted rivers, streams, and ponds, for instance,
provoke bacterial and other water-borne infections and diseases—such as giardia, cholera, and dysentery—that
cause millions of deaths globally each year. Poor sanitation practices that result in the contamination of food and/or
water supplies by fecal matter have the same devastating effects. An overwhelming percentage of these deaths, due
ultimately to unsafe water supplies, poor sanitation, and/or inadequate hygiene practices, afflict children from poor
households.23 A lack of access to electricity and modern fuels also can fatal. The use of coal and wood-based biomass
fuels for cooking, for instance, leads to millions of premature deaths globally each year caused by the inhalation of
indoor air pollution, particularly by women and children.24

To assess the progress of the ASEAN in improving equitable access to amenities and services, we track the following
indicators: (i) Drinking Water, which assesses, via data provided the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme
on Water Supply and Sanitation (WHO & UNICEF, 2014), the proportion of the population that draws water from
‘improved’ sources which adequately protect water from outside contamination, as opposed to from ‘unimproved’
sources or ‘surface water’, which do not provide such protections; (ii) Sanitation, which assesses access to ‘improved’
facilities, which are defined as providing for hygienic separation of human excreta from human contact and include
flush latrines, septic tanks, pit latrines, and composting toilets; and (iii) Electricity and Modern Fuels, which measures
the proportion of the population that has access to electricity and which uses fuels other than biomass for cooking.

In developed urban areas, drinking water is ordinarily drawn from piped facilities that assure relative purity. Poor
households and particularly those residing in rural areas commonly do not have access to sources that offer a
similar level of protection. Rather, water may be sourced from open wells, unprotected springs, water tankers, or
even from rivers, dams, lakes, ponds, streams or irrigation channels.

in Cambodia and in Lao PDR drew water from unimproved sources such as rivers, lakes, canals, or unprotected
wells and springs. Access to improved sources in Indonesia, Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam, while
increasing, is still below universal levels.

In Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar, significant disparities in access exist between rural and urban
populations. As such, achieving universal access to improved water sources requires a particular focus on the
installation of protected facilities in rural areas.

Note: “surface water” refers to water drawn from rivers, dams, lakes, ponds, streams, canals, or irrigation channels. “other Unimproved” refers to water drawn from unprotected dug wells, unprotected springs, carts with small tank or
drum, or bottled water. “other Improved” refers to water drawn from public taps or standpipes, tube wells or boreholes, protected dug wells, protected springs, or rainwater collection. “Piped on Premises” refers to water drawn from a
piped household water connection located inside the user’s dwelling, plot or yard. (wHo / UnICeF Joint Monitoring Program (JMP) for water supply and sanitation).

Flush latrines have come to be taken for granted in developed urban areas, but nonetheless represent a life-saving
technology. Without access to latrines or other facilities that guarantee the separation of human waste from human
contact, there is a distinct probability of contracting an affliction that is at best immobilizing and, in the absence of
proper treatment, can be fatal.

The access of ASEAN populations to improved sanitation facilities—that is, a source that hygienically separates
human excreta from human contact—has improved during the past 15 years. Lao PDR, in particular, achieved a
substantial improvement, increasing access from 22 percent of the population in 1998 to 65 percent in 2012. Large
improvements were also observed in Cambodia (13 percent to 37 percent), Indonesia (45 percent to 59 percent),
Myanmar (58 percent to 77 percent), and Viet Nam (51 percent to 75 percent).

Despite this progress, large gaps exist across the ASEAN in access to improved sanitation. Whereas Malaysia,
Thailand, and Singapore have all but eliminated unhygienic sanitation practices, almost two-thirds of the Cambodian
population does not have access to an improved facility. Indonesia (59 percent), Lao PDR (65 percent), Myanmar

Note: “Open Defecation” refers to the disposal of human feces a in fields, forests, bushes, open bodies of water, beaches or other open spaces or disposed of with solid waste. “Other Unimproved” refers to practices that do not ensure
hygienic separation of human excreta from human contact and includes use of facilities such as pit latrines without a slab or platform, hanging latrines and bucket latrines. “shared” refers to the use facilities of an otherwise acceptable
type shared between two or more households. “Improved” facilities ensure hygienic separation of human excreta from human contact and includes use of facilities such as flush/pour flush to a piped sewer system, septic tank or pit
latrine; a ventilated improved pit latrine; a pit latrine with slab; or a composting toilet.

Electricity facilitates access not just to an ever-expanding variety of productivity-enhancing and life-broadening
package of technological innovations, but also is often a prerequisite for improving health and education outcomes.
Without access to electricity or other modern fuels, households are dependent on solid fuels for cooking which in
turn can lead to indoor pollution and a life threatening series of respiratory ailments. Household access to electricity
also serves an important role in enabling children to learn during the evening hours and in enabling citizens to keep
abreast of national political affairs and events.

Approximately 134 million people (22 percent of the region’s population) in the ASEAN do not have access to
electricity and 280 million people (47 percent of the region’s population) rely on biomass (such as wood, straw, or

charcoal) for cooking.26 As with other service areas, there is substantial variation within the region (see Table 24).
Access to modern energy services is nearly universal in Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia and Singapore.27 Access to
electricity is also nearly universal in Thailand and Viet Nam, although more than a quarter of Thailand’s population
and more than half of Viet Nam’s population rely on biomass for cooking. Access to energy is low in Indonesia, Lao
PDR and the Philippines and very low in Cambodia and Myanmar. Two-thirds of Cambodia’s population and a half
of Myanmar’s population lack access to electricity, while nine-tenths of the respective populations rely on biomass
for cooking. As shown in Figure 98, there are large differences in rural and urban electrification rates. In Cambodia,
for instance, only 18 percent of the rural population has access to electricity. Rural electrification rates are also low
in Myanmar (29 percent), the Philippines (60 percent), and Lao PDR (70 percent).

Despite the large variation that exists within the ASEAN in access to energy, substantial progress has been made
over the past decade. According to International Energy Agency (IEA) statistics, for instance, Indonesia and Viet
Nam’s electrification rate stood at only 53 percent and 80 percent, respectively, in 2002 (compared to 73 percent
and 96 percent in 2011).28 The IEA further reports that Lao PDR almost doubled its electrification rate between
2002 and 2011.29

The improvements made by some countries are also evident in available statistics on electric power consumption
per capita (Figure 99 and Figure 100). Cambodia and Viet Nam achieved 15 percent and 12 annual growth rates,

Key Findings

The ASEAN Equitable Development Monitor 2014 demonstrates that substantial progress has been made in reducing
development gaps across the ASEAN community. Over the past 15 years, the poorest countries of the ASEAN have
generally grown the fastest, meaning that the gaps that exist between ASEAN member states in living standards
have steadily narrowed. The integration of ASEAN member states into the global economy has increased, with many
of the poorest countries having integrated the most rapidly. Access to primary education has increased and progress
in improving health services and access to clean water and sanitation for citizens in the poorest ASEAN member
states has helped reduce child and infant mortality.

Yet even with this broad-based progress, development gaps across the community remain large in many areas. The
Monitor highlights key policy challenges that require continued attention if the ASEAN community is to continue to
succeed in ensuring that its poorest citizens are able to fully benefit from economic integration. These challenges
include:

 y Sustaining the pace of economic growth both among low-income ASEAN member states (Cambodia, Lao PDR,
   Myanmar and Viet Nam) and among middle- and high-income member states (Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia,
   Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand);

 y Reducing the burden placed by business regulation on the creation and successful operation of formal
   enterprises, particularly those in low- and middle-income member states;

 y Enabling poor citizens in low- and middle-income ASEAN countries to smooth consumption through savings
   and borrowing, exploit business opportunities, and manage financial risks by increasing their access to financial
   services;

 y Ensuring that all citizens in the ASEAN community possess the set of knowledge and skills necessary to
   participate productively in the economic community through increasing pre-primary, primary, and secondary
   school enrolment and completion rates and increasing the overall quality of educational instruction;

 y Sustaining recent gains in the reduction of child and maternal mortality by extending the access of poor citizens
   and those residing in rural areas to critical medical services such as pre-natal care and skilled birth attendance;

 y Doing more to provide all citizens of the ASEAN with an equal start in life through reducing the incidence of low
   birthweight and ensuring that children receiving adequate levels of nutrition during the first two years of life;

 y Eliminating gaps between the access of the rich and poor and between rural and urban residents in their access
   to clean water and sanitation and to electricity.

Each of these policy challenges is complex. Addressing them successfully will require: a firm commitment by
all ASEAN member states and their development partners; more resources directed to gaps of highest priority;
the development and implementation of innovative solutions; and the use of rigorous evidence regarding the
effectiveness of various interventions. Nevertheless, the past success of ASEAN member states in reducing poverty,
stimulating economic growth, and improving the delivery of basic services augur well for the future.

Suggestions Going Forward

The analysis in this Monitor also highlights three areas for further work.

First, while rich data exist for a number of indicators and for most ASEAN member states, there remain significant
gaps in the availability of data on key indicators necessary to monitor various facets of equitable development in
many countries. Without such data, the member states will be unable to set clear priorities for action both within
countries and across countries. Therefore, a key step in enhancing the ability of the community to monitor equitable
development and make progress towards this goal is for all member states to work together and with development
partners to enhance the availability, quality, and completeness of data on key development outcomes and their
determinants.

Second, based on the trends elaborated in the Monitor as well as other data, ASEAN member states may wish to
identify specific thematic priorities for narrowing development gaps within and between ASEAN member states.
This prioritization process could include the setting of specific benchmarks or targets for narrowing development
gaps across the ASEAN community, which build, for instance, on the Millennium Development Goals. These
benchmarks could then be reviewed periodically to assess progress, understand the factors underlying instances of
poor performance, and identify aspects that need renewed attention.

Third, along with setting these priorities and benchmarks, a process might be established for the community to
periodically review progress of the ASEAN member states in implementing policies and programs targeted at
reducing development gaps. The generation and dissemination of evidence on the effectiveness of relevant policies
and programs should be part of such a process. While a number of ASEAN member states have pioneered the
collection and use of rigorous evidence in policymaking and, as a result of which there is now more evidence on
the effectiveness of programs in many sectors, a renewed emphasis among all ASEAN member states to evaluate
development interventions rigorously and to share knowledge on good practices will contribute to the goal of an
ASEAN community that is able to develop both rapidly and equitably.
