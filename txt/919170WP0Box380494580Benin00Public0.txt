THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW

environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practic e or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at th e bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.

Benin is a set of specific procedures—the
bureaucratic and legal steps that an entrepreneur
must complete to incorporate and register a new                 Legal form: Limited Liability Company, Société à
firm. These are identified by Doing Business through            Responsabilité Limitée (SARL)

the study of laws, regulations and publicly available           Paid in minimum capital requirement: XOF

procedures are those that apply to a company                    Start-up Capital: 10 times GNI per capita

collecting the data (see the section in this chapter on
what the indicators measure).

       Have a notary public notarize the instrument of incorporation

       According to OHADA law, company statutes are executed by notary
       deed. In addition, entrepreneurs in Benin commonly use the services of
       notaries in practice in their business start-up formalities. For companies
       with a share capital over 1 million, the notary fees vary depending on
       the expertise and the services provided by the notary. The fees are           3 days         see comment

       approximately: 25,000 for the legal announcement in the newspaper;

      BuildCo completes the application form, while the architect compiles

      study, it is assumed that the plan and the dossier can be completed by
      a company architect, who in this case is registered with the National
      Order of Architects.

      The dossier comprises the following:
      • Technical plans
      • Property title
      • Cost proposal

      All permit applications are submitted to the Municipality. However, for
      construction projects deemed of ‘"national character,” applications are
      submitted to the Ministry of Environment and Housing and Urban
      Planning (Ministère de l’Environnement, de l’Habitat et de l’Urbanisme,

      Once the application is submitted to the Municipality, the Municipality
      is in charge of submitting the dossier to the different agencies. The
      dossier is reviewed by the following agencies:
      • Fire services
      • Health services
      • Urban planning (Direction de l’Urbanisme).

      Each agency has a week to review the dossier. Subsequently, a

ENFORCING CONTRACTS
Economies in all regions have improved contract                   reducing backlogs by introducing periodic reviews to
enforcement in recent years. A judiciary can be improved          clear inactive cases from the docket and by making
