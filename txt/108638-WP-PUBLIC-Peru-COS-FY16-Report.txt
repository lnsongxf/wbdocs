I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in Peru perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues Facing Peru
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Peru
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information

II. Methodology
From April 2016 to June 2016, 562 stakeholders of the WBG in Peru were invited to provide
their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion survey.
Participants were drawn from the Office of the President/Prime Minister; office of a minister;
office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments; Project Management Units
(PMUs) overseeing implementation of WBG projects; consultants/contractors working on WBG-
supported projects/ programs; local governments; bilateral/multilateral agencies; private sector
organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks; non-profit
organizations/community based organizations; the media; independent government institutions;
trade unions; faith-based groups; youth groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; the
judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 209 stakeholders participated in the survey
(37% response rate).

Most respondents received and completed the questionnaire online. A few others received and
filled out the questionnaire via email. Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Peru;
their overall attitudes toward the WBG; the WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s
knowledge work and activities; working with the WBG; the WBG’s future role in Peru; and the
WBG’s communication and information sharing.

Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.

The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY’14 (response rate is 42%, N=197). Data were weighted to reach the same
stakeholder composition in two years, which allows for year comparisons. Stakeholder groups
which were not present in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents
who belonged to the “other” stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, means of
the FY’16 data and the total number of respondents in both years are slightly different from those
of the original data reported in appendices A, B, C, and E. For the weighted stakeholder
breakdown and year comparison results, please see appendix D (page 91).

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
      For further analyses, respondents from the Office of the President/Prime Minister and the
       Office of Minister were combined. Respondents from the financial sector/private banks
       were combined with those from private sector organizations. Respondents from private
       foundations and NGOs/CBOs were combined into the “CSO” category. Few respondents
       from the office of a parliamentarian, the judiciary branch, and other organizations were
       included in the “Other” category. There were no respondents from local governments,
       trade unions, faith-based groups or youth groups.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
       Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s country survey and the FY’14 country
        survey had statistically similar levels of familiarity with the WBG (weighted mean in
        FY’16 = 7.2; weighted mean in FY’14 = 7.6)1.
       Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
        with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Peru, and significantly,
        moderately correlated with the extent to which the WBG plays a relevant role in
        development in Peru and the extent to which the WBG helps to achieve development
        results in the country.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Peru, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty one specific areas
of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Peru. The areas determined
       to be key drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at law and justice;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at transport; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at gender equity.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Peru, suggesting that ratings of
       effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
       analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at gender equity;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at information and communications technology; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at transport.
