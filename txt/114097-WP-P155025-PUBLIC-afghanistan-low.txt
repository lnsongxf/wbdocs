﻿FLOOD
F    looding is the most frequently
occurring natural hazard in Afghanistan.
The country is prone to river flooding T  K   1NISA
because of steep slopes in headwaters.
Flooding in rivers mainly occurs as a result
of heavy rainfall coupled with rapid
snowmelt; the sources of most of the rivers
lie in the mountains and are fed by snow and
glaciers. Lack of vegetation and denudation
of the mountain areas also contribute to the
occurrence of flooding. Urban flooding is a
problem in major cities, and is often caused
by intense local rainfall in combination with
inadequate drainage systems.
Hairatan (north) and the Helmand basin
(west) have high levels of flood hazard.
Kabul Province is most affected, population
wise: over 2,000 people on average per year
The majority of expected flood damages are
attributed to the commercial (40%) and
residential (33%) sectors.

Earthquakes during the last 30 years have
caused over 10,000 fatalities.
A major earthquake event in Kabul
Province is expected to cause
approximately 8,500 deaths and over
$500 million in damages. Kabul has the
highest average estimated damage of all
regions in Afghanistan, amounting to $17
million per year, due to the concentration
of assets and population located in the
province. Earthquakes also frequently
cause large landslides in mountainous
regions.

Recommendations
* Constructing new structures in
an earthquake-resistant way and
retrofitting existing buildings, can
strongly reduce building collapse and
resulting fatalities from earthquakes.
* Retrofitting schools throughout
Afghanistan to he earthquake resistant
would reduce potential economic
losses by 60%, and reduce fatalities
by 90%.
* School retrofitting would have a
net saving of between $1.2 and $1.5
million on average each year.
* It is more cost-effective to build new
earthquake resistant roads and to keep
money in reserve for damage repairs
than to retrofit or reconstruct existing
roads.

Recommendations
* More effective water management
could reduce water shortages during
droughts.
* Canals and irrigation systerns
could improve access to water for the
agricultural sector.
* Diversifying livelihoods, and
improving the effectiveness of
agricultural practices, for example by
using crops and irrigation methods
that waste less water, could increase
agricultural productivity, reducing
the reliance on water availability.

﻿AVALANCHE
In the Hindu Kush mountain range
of Afghanistan, snow avalanches affect
people, settlements and infrastructure.      K M L N I S TA
Avalanche hazardous areas are driven in
large part by topography and elevation and
are therefore located in the mountainous
regions of Afghanistan, spread from the
north-east to the western regions.
Difficulty in accessing and providing
aid to remote populations is a
common concern with avalanche events.
Badakhshan, Kabul, and Daykundi have
the greatest number of people and GDP
affected by avalanches.
Climate change may reduce risk
from avalanches in lower lying areas
due to rising temperatures. However
higher altitude areas such as the Salang
pass could experience more frequent
avalanches in mid-winter due to increased
snowfall.

Earthquake
Earthquake hazard is based on probabilistic analysis of a
stochastic hazard catalogue. The distribution of ground
shaking intensity (e.g., peak ground acceleration) is
produced on a gridded basis. The distribution of loss is
estimated using fragility and vulnerability models developed
using an analytical method.
Landslide
A spatial distribution of landslide susceptibility is defined
using a GIS-based, weighted scoring of contributing facto rs,
including slope angle, lithologya land cover, terrain curvature,
distance from geological anults, and distance from roads.
These source areas are combined with modelled flow (run-
out) and accumulation of debris areas to create landslide
hazard maps.
Avalanche
Avalanche hazard is defined by modelling avalanche
susceptibility areas from the analysis of meteorological
data and snow properties to determine likely starting
points and snow conditions on slopes. Snow avalanche
modelling is then performed to produce avalanche hazard
maps delineating the likely starting and transition zones of
avalanches, and in particular the runout areas of avalanche
deposits.
