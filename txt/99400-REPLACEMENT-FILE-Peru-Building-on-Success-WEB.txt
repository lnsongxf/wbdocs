      Background and acknowledgments

This report has been prepared at the request of the Government of Peru, as part of the Road to Lima process
leading to the Annual Meetings of the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Lima,
Peru, in October 2015. Other activities of the Road to Lima have been part of its preparation, as have intense
technical consultations.

The report, by design, is focused on diagnosing selected microeconomic constraints to accelerating productivity
growth, while acknowledging that the country may also have other development challenges that are not
covered. The report also tries to provide policy directions with the same focused approach.

The report was prepared by a World Bank team led by Ekaterina Vostroknutova (GMFDR) under the guidance
of Alberto Rodriguez (Country Director, LCC6C), Pablo Saavedra (Practice Manager, GMFDR), and John Panzer
(Director, GMFDR). It is based on 25 background papers written by multi-sectoral and multi-Global Practice
(GP) and Cross-Cutting Solutions Area (CCSA) teams (a full list of contributors is in the Annex). The following
team members led work on the specific topics and sections of the report. Leonardo Iacovone (T&C GP) led
a team working on firm-level and productivity analysis that included Trang Thu Tran, Roberto Fattal, Reyes
Aterido, and Siddharth Sharma. Thomas Farole (T&C JP and Jobs CCSA) coordinated the team working on
trade-related issues, which included Sebastian Saez, Denisse Pierola, Ana Fernandes, Guillermo Arenas, Bruce
Fitzgerald, and Erik Van Der Marel. David Robalino (Jobs CCSA) led the team working on labor market issues
that included Elizabeth Ruppert Bulmer, Reyes Aterido, Dino Merotto, Mathilde Perinet, Angela Elzir, Tamara
Arnold, and Adrian Garlati; the human capital section was based on inputs from Ines Kudo and Miguel Székely;       1
Jennifer Keller was responsible for the corresponding section. Martha Licetti (T&C GP) and Donato de Rosa
(MFM GP) led the work on competition and related regulatory policy issues; Alvaro Quijandria led the IFC team
working on business regulation; Rong Qian was the main author of the corresponding section; this team included
Lucía Villarán, Tanja Goodwin, Karina Rodriguez, Rachel Li Jiang, Congyan Tan, Ernesto Franco Temple, and
Jessica Michelle Victor. The innovation section was produced by Rong Qian based on inputs from Ha Nguyen
and Pluvia Zuniga; the team also included Patricio Jaramillo and Ekaterina Vostroknutova. The financial sector
section was prepared by Daniel Barco (MFM GP) under the guidance and inputs of Steen Byskov (F&M GP).
The macroeconomic and growth story was crafted by Ekaterina Vostroknutova and Faruk Khan drawing on
inputs from Cristina Savescu, Daniel Barco, and Harry Moroz. Research assistance was provided by Melanie
Laloum, Miguel Saldarriaga, and Teresa Peterburs. Administrative assistance was provided by Silvia Gulino and
Patricia Chacon Holt. Writing and editing support was provided by Bruce Ross-Larson, Bruce Fitzgerald, and
John Burgess.

The report has benefited greatly from comments, advice, guidance, and technical discussions with Norman
Loayza, Augusto de la Torre, Daniel Lederman, Carlos Silva Jauregui, Jorge Araujo, Marcelo Selowsky, Ivailo
Izvorski, Vinaya Swaroop, Edgardo Favaro, and many others. The report owes a lot to the government agencies
that supported the team with provision of data, comments, guidance, and advice; the list includes but is not
limited to the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the National Institute of Statistics and Informatics (INEI), the
Central Bank (BCRP), Ministry of Labor, Ministry of Production, and Ministry of Trade.

Conclusion

A third of Peru’s economic growth has been driven by
improvements in productivity, but in the next stage of
convergence, and under the new external conditions,
a larger contribution to economic growth will have
to come from productivity. The country emerged as                 11
one of strongest growth performers in the region and
accelerated its convergence to higher income levels.
Although the country’s productivity growth at the
company level is at par with similar middle-income
countries that aspire to avoid the middle-income
trap, the gap to the global productivity frontier
remains large. This report shows that enhancing
productivity growth remains the fastest way to close
it. There is strong firm-level evidence that Peruvian
markets tend to misallocate labor and capital into
less productive workplaces. This signals that some
aspects of product, factor, and intermediate goods
and services markets do not function properly. The
country’s services sector is a poor performer in this
regard. Eliminating these distortions could increase
overall productivity by up to 130 percent and double
Peru’s output per worker. But that in turn requires
deepening reforms in selected areas.

any commodity-exporting country, growth in the late
2000s relative to the late 1990s was significantly
supported by favorable external conditions (Figure 6).
However, it also benefited from a wave of structural
reforms initiated in the 1990s (Box 1). Structural and
external factors contributed an estimated 0.8 and 0.7
percentage points, respectively, to growth annually,
thus explaining 25 and 21 percent of the 3.5 percent
annual growth over this period. Growth in the early
2000s shows high contribution from “persistence”—
the likely lingering positive effect of past macro-
structural reforms. Growth from 2005 onward shows
a larger contribution of structural factors and the
highly favorable external environment (Figure 7).7

current income per capita in 12 years. Increasing
productivity is more important for Peru than for

       insufficient access to credit could prevent firms from
       innovating and growing.

     areas that are typically examined only in the context

        of productivity growth at firm level, through the

        abroad. Trade also is a good instrument to correct
        misallocation of factors of production, as shown by
        the Peruvian manufacturing sector.
     •	 Section 9 analyzes constraints to innovation
        since innovation is one of the strongest drivers of
        firm-level productivity growth in other countries.
        Innovation can also illustrate the benefits of
        removing distortions—especially if this means more
        equal access to inputs necessary for innovation.

and building skills

A         well-functioning labor market is important
          for supporting growth and productivity.
          There is evidence that restrictive regulations
impede the efficient allocation of labor to most
productive firms. In Peru, these relate mostly to firing

increased in recent years. The number of banks
increased from 11 in 2006 to 17 today, and return on
equity decreased from 30 percent in the late 2000s to
just above 20 percent now. Also, indexes of competitive
behavior have increased and financial margins have
fallen.65 Moreover, micro-finance and other non-bank
financial institutions (NBFI) providing banking services
have developed well in Peru, a fact not measured by
banking concentration. The still-high interest rate
spread, however, suggests that there is still room to
increase competition. Horizontal policies that promote
formality and growth of firms would naturally increase
access by enterprises as well as improve competition
in the banking system. More efficient financial
intermediation will lower the wedge between lending
and deposit rates and expand access. These horizontal
reforms would eventually help equalize access to credit
for small firms and increase productivity in the long
term. However, more targeted interventions might be
needed in the short to medium term to improve access
for small firms.

Given the complexity of the issues involved, further
research and analysis of the Peruvian financial
sector is needed, and it is beyond the scope of this                                   63
report. Deeper analysis would help to shed further
light on these issues and arrive at more detailed policy
recommendations and conclusions.




65  Cespedes and Orrego (2014) estimated the Panzar and Rose
index for competition in the banking industry and found that it
has been increasing since 2008. The Panzar and Rose index is
measured as the sum of elasticities of financial to factor prices
(expenditure on interest for loanable funds, personnel wages, and
capital depreciation expenditure). Moron et al. (2010) estimated
the residual elasticity of demand for seven financial products
and found that in five of them it increased since 2006. Residual
demand is the demand that a bank faces after the rest of the
banks have served the market.

aimed at correcting misallocation, such as easing
regulatory burden on start-ups (Section 5), elimination

technology spillovers (Section 8), would also positively
impact incentives to innovate and innovation

system to different forms of knowledge transfers and
collaboration with the private sector would also be
helpful. Moreover, enabling better use of knowledge
entails improving the governance and the legal rights
enforcement for institutions and companies to engage
in collaboration and innovative ventures.
