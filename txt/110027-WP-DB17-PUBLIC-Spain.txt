This year’s Doing Business report presents a gender
dimension in four of the indicator sets: starting a
business, registering property, enforcing contracts and
labor market regulation. Three of these areas are
included in the distance to frontier score and in the ease
of doing business ranking, while the fourth —labor
market regulation—is not.
Doing Business has traditionally assumed that the
entrepreneurs or workers discussed in the case studies
were men. This was incomplete by not reflecting
correctly the Doing Business processes as applied to
women—which in some economies may be different
from the processes applied to men. Starting this year,
Doing Business measures the starting a business process
for two case scenarios: one where all entrepreneurs are
men and one where all entrepreneurs are women. In
economies where the processes are more onerous if the
entrepreneur is a woman, Doing Business now counts the
extra procedures applied to roughly half of the
population that is female (for example, obtaining a
husband’s consent or gender-specific requirements for
opening a personal bank account when starting a
business). Within the registering property indicators, a
gender component has been added to the quality of
land administration index. This component measures
women’s ability to use, own, and transfer property
according to the law. Finally, within the enforcing
contracts indicator set, economies will be scored on

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2017 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name

       Obtain a certification of uniqueness of proposed company name
       (certificación negativa de la denominación social)

       The Certification of Uniqueness of the Company Name is typically
       requested through the website of the Central Commercial Registry. If
       the certificate is not requested online, the final document can be
       obtained by (i) certified mail, (ii) through a notary and the notarial
       platform SIGNO; (iii) visiting the Central Commercial Registry; or (iv)
       courier. In all cases, the certificate is issued the following day.
                                                                                                      EUR 13.52

       name will be reserved for a maximum of 6 months from the
       certification's date of issuance. Each certification of uniqueness of the
       corporate name is valid for 3 months from its date of issuance.
       Furthermore, once the certificate's validity has expired (3 months), the
       certificate can only be renewed once, after which a new certificate must
       be requested.

       Open a company bank account, deposit capital and obtain a
       deposit certificate

       In most cases, the entrepreneur deposits the amount of the
   2   contributions directly in the bank. Once this is done, the bank issues the    1 day           no charge
       relevant certificate evidencing the deposit has been done. However, the
       contributions can also be directly given to the notary public at the time
       of granting the deed of incorporation. In this scenario, the notary can
       deposit them in the company's bank account.

        The certificate of alignment is issued by the Municipality of
        Madrid which provides the exact limit of the private property
        with respect to public roads.

        The official cost is €62.15 per 10 linear meters in the front of the
        building. In the Doing Business case study, the front of the
        building is assumed to be 30 meters, so the total cost would be
        €186.45.

        Request and obtain a certificate of compliance (certificado
        de conformidad)

        Upon reception of alignment certificate, BuildCo must obtain a
        compliance certificate. This certificate is the provisional license
        which can be obtained from two agencies - Municipality or
        Entidades Colaboradoras Urbanisticas - ECU. According to the
        new Local Ordinance of the City Council of Madrid ("Ordenanza

        The ECU has 2 months to examine the documentation and grant
        the compliance certificate. Once the compliance certificate has
        been granted, it must be attached to the building permit
        application.

        The final construction permit is issued by the Municipality. Once
        the building license is issued by the Municipality of Madrid,

      Obtain approval of draft project proposal and
      implementation plan (Visado del proyecto básico y proyecto

      The College of Architects of Madrid must approves BuildCo’s
      draft project proposal and implementation plan. In particular, the
      College of Architects of Madrid verifies the professional
      qualifications of the individual in charge of the construction work
      and validates the correctness and completeness of the
      documentation provided for the project with respect to
      regulations.

      The following documentation must be provided:

      The procedure is legislated in "Real Decreto 1000/2010, de 5 de
      agosto, sobre visado colegial obligatorio".

      The basis of the cost is in "Precios del Visado de los Trabajos
      profesionales". The formula used is the following: Cost of
      approval = Módulo x C x S x Qv x F / 6000. For a warehouse such
      as the Doing Business case study: M = 497.43; C = 9.00; S =
      1300.6; Qv = 1.40; F = 0.85. Therefore, cost of approval is 497.43

      Receive initial inspection

      According to the building license, one on-site inspection must be
      carried out during construction and one at the end of the
      process.

      If, during the inspections, the committee detects any possible
      infringements of the building regulations or criminal law, a
      proposal on sanctions must be made, and a copy of the written
      record is given to the public prosecutor. At minimum,
      administrative proceedings are initiated.

      In each inspection report, a record is included that provides         1 day        EUR 375
6
      information on every person involved and their roles, as well as
      on the facts, circumstances, dates, and results of the inspection.
      The record is regarded as a public administrative deed. The
      record must be signed by the inspector(s) and by the person to
      whom the construction works have been attributed at the time
      of the inspection. The inspection can only be conducted once the
      construction has started, for that reason this procedure cannot
      be simultaneous with the previous one.

      Obtain completion certificate (visado del certificado final de
      obra -CFO) from College of Architects of Madrid

      Once construction works have been completed, the architect and
      surveyor must sign off a document certifying that the
      construction has followed the approved plans. Therefore, both
      individuals are responsible for the construction performed. This
      completion certificate must be approved by the College of
      Architects of Madrid.

      This procedure is legislated in "Real Decreto 1000/2010, de 5 de
      agosto, sobre visado colegial obligatorio".                           3 days       EUR 204

      This procedure can only be done when the consturciton is
      finalized, for that reason this procedure cannot be simultaneous
      with the previous one.


      The basis of the cost is in "Precios del Visado de los Trabajos
      profesionales". The formula used is the following: Cost of
      approval = Módulo x C x S x Qv x F / 6000. For a warehouse such
      as the Doing Business case study: M = 497.43; C = 9.00; S =
      1300.6; Qv = 1.40; F = 0.15. Therefore, cost of approval is 497.43
      *9*1300.6*1.40*0.15/6000 =203.79 EUR"

      Request final inspection in connection with the occupancy
      permit (licencia de primera ocupacion y funcionamiento)

      Private collaborating entities (ECU) carry out the inspection and
      issue the declaration of conformity at the end of the construction
      works.

      BuildCo must pay a fee to the collaborating entities. The amount
      is EUR 2600 for the first 500 square meters and additionally EUR
      1.25 for every additional square meter. The cost details to
8     request and receive final inspection is provided on the official      1 day        EUR 3,601
      website of the Municipality of Madrid, www.munimadrid.es. The
      legal basis is Agreement of the Local Government Board of the
      City Council of Madrid, dated September 26, 2013, setting the
      maximum price for services of the private collaborating entities

      Receive final inspection

      BuildCo. can receive a final inspection once the construction is
      finalized. For that reason this procedure cannot be simultaneous

      Obtain occupancy permit (licencia de primera ocupación y
      funcionamiento)

      As soon as construction is finished, in order to receive the first
      operating license (licencia de primera ocupación), the builder
      must submit the following documents to the ECU:
      • Final certificate of terminated construction (declaration of
      conformity), which must be signed by the technical director of
      the work. This certificate must declare that the constructed
      building is in accordance with the issued license. For               60 days       no charge

      detail these modifications.
      • If urbanization works have been carried out simultaneously
      with construction, and this urbanization was completed by the
      builder, the builder must present the final certification of these

      The purpose of the operating license is to verify that the
      construction and activities have been executed according to the
      project and the conditions under which the license had been
      granted, and that the construction has been completed and is
      adequate for urban determinations, the atmosphere and the

        Customers must submit an application for a new connection with the

        Obtain administrative approval for connection project

        For any kind of electrical project an administrative authorization has to
        be obtained from the General Directorate for Industry, Energy and
        Mining (Dirección General de Industria, Energía y Minas; Consejería de

        inspected for the purpose of the approval (Iberdrola will later on do an
        inspection to ensure that the project has been realized according to the
        plans approved by the General Directorate).

      For an installation project in low or medium voltage different types of
      approvals exist. An installation project that involves a medium voltage
      connection has to be registered directly with the General Directorate and
      the cost for the procedure is EUR 197.31, for the case of installations
      costing between 30,000 and 60,000 euros.

      Obtain license for external works from City Council

      Customers need to obtain a license for the external works from the
      municipality. The tax for this license is charged as 4% of the cost of the
      works, plus a fee for provision of urban services (‘Tasa por prestación de
      servicios urbanísticos’), and a fee for private use of public spaces (‘Tasa

      Customers have two choices: The external connection works can be done

      constructor.

      In most cases, for a connection with a capacity of 140 kVA, customers

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

       24 hours since such document was submitted to the Land Registry
       Office. This procedure is aimed at preventing any surprises or
       unexpected situations while the contract is being formalized. This
       scheme is supplemented with the electronic submission to the Registry
       of a Notarial Attestation covering the essential features of the contract in
       relation to which the Information was requested, sent by the Notary by
       electronic means at the time of the document’s signature, in order to
       secure the priority of that document right after being signed.

      ITP is paid at the relevant tax office within 30 working days after the date
      of granting of the notarial deed of transfer (a copy of the transfer deed is
      to be attached to the transfer tax liquidation form). In some autonomias,
      like Madrid, Catalunya, and Andalucia, the tax may be paid online,
      although the buyer needs to obtain a stamp from the tax authority
      confirming the payment.
      However, it has to be noted that under certain circumstances (e.g., that
      the acquisition of the property is within the scope of the usual activities
      of the acquiring company), the acquiring company can choose to make
      the transaction subject to transfer tax or VAT. The VAT paid would
      become a credit that the company would deduct from subsequent
      transactions, such as those related to the normal business of the
      company.

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2015 lending rates.

                                        The Insolvency Act provides a unitary form of insolvency proceedings

                                    outcomes: (i) reorganization (convenio de acreedores) or (ii) liquidation. The
                                   law will also set forth all assumptions on which the reorganization proceeding

                    new regulations also introduced out-of-court workouts.

                    allowing conversion from reorganization into liquidation at

                    continued operation.
                    Spain made resolving insolvency easier by introducing new

       Is a full-time employee.
       Is not a member of the labor union, unless

The business:
       Is a limited liability company (or the equivalent
        in the economy).
       Operates a supermarket or grocery store in the
        economy’s largest business city. For 11

rate has a smaller impact on the distance to frontier
score for the total tax rate—and therefore on the
distance to frontier score for paying taxes—for
economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in
figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2017 report). And for
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2017 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
