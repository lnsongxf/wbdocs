Child labour and educational marginalization represent major challenges
in the ECOWAS region.
Child labour rates in the region are among the highest in the world –
almost 21 million children aged 5-14 years, 25 percent of all children in this
age group, are in child labour. At the same time, an alarmingly high
number of primary school-aged children are out of school, often due to
the demands of work.
As part of the efforts to address this urgent situation, Governments and
regional institutions have developed the ECOWAS Child Policy and the
accompanying Strategic Plan of Action for the ECOWAS Child Policy, as
well as the West Africa Regional Action Plan to Eliminate Child Labour
(and especially its Worst Forms) and the Accra Declaration of the
ECOWAS-ILO Symposium on West Africa Regional Action Plan. These
plans signal the national intent to eliminate child labour and provide an
essential framework for efforts to achieve this goal.
The ILO has produced this Report to help translate these plans into
concrete actions. The Report is specifically aimed at building the
evidence base necessary for the design and targeting of specific
interventions against child labour.
It brings together the most recent available information from a variety of
national household surveys to provide a detailed picture of child labour
and the related challenge of educational marginalisation in the ECOWAS
region.

1.   INTRODUCTION
     1. Overcoming the twin challenges of child labour and educational
     marginalisation will be critical to progress towards the Millennium Development
     Goals in the ECOWAS region. Child labour rates in the region are among the
     highest in the world –almost 21 million children aged 5-14 years, 25% of all
     children in the age group, are in child labour. At the same time, an alarmingly
     high number of primary school-aged children are out of school, often due to the
     demands of work. The effects of child labour and educational marginalisation are
     well-documented: both can lead to social vulnerability and societal
     marginalisation, and both can permanently impair productive potential and
     therefore influence lifetime patterns of employment and pay. Child labour is also
     often associated with direct threats to children’s health and well-being.
     2. ECOWAS Ministers recognised the challenge of child labour, and signalled
     their commitment to addressing it, in developing the ECOWAS Child Policy and
     the accompanying Strategic Plan of Action for the ECOWAS Child Policy 2009-
     2013, as well as in adopting the West Africa Regional Action Plan to Eliminate
     Child Labour1, Especially its Worst Forms in December 20122 and the follow-up
     Accra Declaration of the ECOWAS/ILO Symposium on the West Africa Regional
     Action Plan in May 2013.3
     3. This Report promotes the translation of these plans into concrete action by
     helping build the evidence base necessary for the design and targeting of
     specific interventions against child labour. It brings together the most recent
     available information from a variety of national household surveys to provide a
     detailed picture of child labour and the related challenge of educational
     marginalisation in the ECOWAS region.
     4. The Report benefited from a wealth of contributions and inputs by a range of
     experts within and outside the ILO. The preliminary results of the study were
     presented for feedback and comment during the ILO-ECOWAS Symposium in
     Accra (May 2013) that gathered representatives of the 15 ECOWAS member
     states. Further discussions were held with expert statisticians from selected
     countries during a technical meeting held in Dakar (November 2013)
     5. The remainder of the Report is structured as follows. Chapter 2 discusses
     definitions and data sources as background for the descriptive statistics
     presented in the subsequent chapters. Chapter 3 reports both regional and
     country-specific estimates of children’s involvement in employment and child
     labour, and how these estimates differ across countries and across population
     subgroups within countries. Chapter 4 assesses factors associated with children’s
     employment. Chapter 5 looks at the characteristics of children’s employment in
     order to shed light on children’s workplace reality and their role in the labour
     force. Chapter 6 provides a more in-depth look at children’s employment in the
     agriculture sector, where the overwhelming majority of child workers in
     ECOWAS are found. Chapter 7 assesses the interplay between children’s
     employment and schooling, and in particular employment as a factor in
     educational marginalisation. Chapter 8 reports on out-of-school children, a

2.         DEFINITIONS AND DATA SOURCES
           6. Child labour is a legal rather than statistical concept, and the international
           legal standards that define it are therefore the necessary frame of reference for
           child labour measurement. The three principal international conventions on
           child labour – ILO Convention No. 138 (Minimum Age)(C138), United Nations
           Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), ILO Convention No. 182 (Worst
           Forms)(C182) together set the legal boundaries for child labour, and provide the
           legal basis for national and international actions against it (see Panel 2).


Panel 2. International legal standards relating to child labour

 The term child labour refers to the subset of children’s work that is injurious, negative or undesirable to children and that should
 be targeted for elimination. Three main international conventions – the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), ILO
 Convention No. 182 (Worst Forms) and ILO Convention No. 138 (Minimum Age) – provide the main legal standards for child
 labour and a framework for efforts against it.
 ILO Convention No. 138 (Minimum Age) represents the most comprehensive and authoritative international definition of
 minimum age for admission to work or employment. C138 calls on Member States to set a general minimum age for admission to
 work or employment of at least 15 years of age (Art. 2.3) (14 years of age in less developed countries), and a higher minimum
 age of not less than 18 years for employment or work which by its nature or the circumstances in which it is carried out is likely to
 jeopardise the health, safety or morals of young persons, i.e., hazardous work (Art. 3.1). The Convention states that national laws
 or regulations may permit the employment or work of persons from 13 years of age (12 years in less developed countries) on light
 work which is (a) not likely to be harmful to their health or development; and (b) not such as to prejudice their attendance at
 school, their participation in vocational orientation or training programmes approved by the competent authority or their capacity to
 benefit from the instruction received (Art. 7).
 ILO Convention No. 182 (Worst Forms of Child Labour) supplements C138 by emphasising the subset of worst forms of child
 labour requiring immediate action. For the purposes of the Convention, worst forms of child labour comprise: (a) all forms of
 slavery or practices similar to slavery, such as the sale and trafficking of children, debt bondage and serfdom, as well as forced or
 compulsory labour, including forced or compulsory recruitment of children for use in armed conflict; (b) the use, procuring or
 offering of a child for prostitution, for the production of pornography or for pornographic performances; (c) the use, procurement or
 offering of a child for illicit activities, in particular for the production and trafficking of drugs as defined in relevant international
 treaties; and (d) work which, by its nature or the circumstances in which it is carried out, is likely to harm the health, safety or
 morals of children (Art. 3).
 The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) recognises the child’s right to be protected from economic exploitation
 and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child's education, or to be harmful to the child's
 health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development (Art. 32.1). In order to achieve this goal, the CRC calls on States
 Parties to set minimum ages for admission to employment, having regard to other international instruments (Art. 32.2).




           7. Translating these broad legal norms into statistical terms for measurement
           purposes is complicated by the fact that ILO Convention No. 138 (C138) contains
           a number of flexibility clauses left to the discretion of the competent national
           authority in consultation (where relevant) with worker and employer
           organisations. In accordance with C138, for example, national authorities may
           specify temporarily a lower general minimum age of 14 years. C138 also states
           that national laws may permit the work of persons from age 12 or 13 years in
           “light” work that is not likely to be harmful to their health or development or to
           prejudice their attendance at school. Children who are above the minimum
           working age are prohibited from involvement in hazardous work or other worst
           forms of child labour, but the Conventions (C138 and C182) leave responsibility
           for the compilation of specific lists of hazardous forms of work to national
           authorities. This means that there is no single legal definition of child labour
           across countries, and concomitantly, no single statistical measure of child labour
           consistent with national legislation across countries.
           8. This point is illustrated in Table 1, which summarises key legislation relating to
           child labour in the ECOWAS countries. As shown, while all but Liberia have
           ratified ILO Convention No. 138, the minimum age specified at ratification
           ranges across countries from 14-16 years. Not all countries have provisions for


                                                                         10
                       light work, and, among those that do have such provisions, there are differences
                       in terms of the relevant age range and the make-up of light work. Similarly, not
                       all countries have specified national lists of hazardous work, and there are large
                       differences in contents among those that have drafted national lists.

Notes:
(a) The Government indication that the National Labour Council approved a draft order amending Order No. 371 of 26 August 1987 issuing exemptions from the minimum age
for admission to employment for children during its June 2010 session. According to the Government, this Order increases the minimum age for the admission of children to
light work. (Source: ILO NORMLEX http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:13100:0::NO:13100:P13100_ COMMENT_ID:2333585:NO).
 (c) Order sets the age for admission to light work at 13 years or over. Furthermore, the Order prescribes the length of the working day (not more than four-and-a-half hours per
day) and prohibits the performance of light work on Sundays and/or official or recognized holidays, and also at night between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m. Children may not perform light
work during the school term and may not be employed without the explicit permission of their parents or guardians. (Source: ILO NORMLEX
http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:13100:0::NO:13100:P13100_COMMENT_ID:3076201:NO)
(d) This Decree, which defines a child as any person under 18 years of age, determines the list of hazardous types of work prohibited for children. The Committee observes that
section 2 of the Decree specifically prohibits: work which, by its nature or the circumstances in which it is carried out, is likely to jeopardize the health, safety or morals of
children; work which exposes children to physical, psychological or sexual abuse; work performed underground, under water, at dangerous heights or in confined spaces; and
work performed with dangerous machinery, equipment or tools, or which involves the handling or carrying of heavy loads. Moreover, section 5 of the Decree establishes a list of
hazardous types of work prohibited for children by sector of activity, including agriculture, stock rearing, fishing, agro-forestry and hunting, industry, mining, quarries and small-
scale gold mines, construction and public works, the informal sector, craft industries, performing arts, transport, and the human and animal health sector.
(e) Section 3D 356 of Decree No. 67-265 of 2 June 1967 states that, under set conditions, exceptions are made to the provisions relating to the minimum age for admission to
employment or work with respect to children of either sex of at least 12 years of age for domestic work or light work of a seasonal nature, such as harvesting or sorting work in
plantations. It also notes that sections 3D 357 to 3D 361 of Decree No. 67-265 of 2 June 1967 lay down the conditions regulating the exception provided for in section 3D 356.
Hence, under section 3D 357 of Decree No. 67-265 of 2 June 1967, no exception may be allowed which would be likely to jeopardize the provisions in force concerning
compulsory schooling. Under section 3D 358, no child between 12 and 14 years of age may be employed without the express permission of his or her parents or guardian.
Furthermore, section 3D 359(1) of the Decree states that individual permission given to children attending school shall not result in the duration of work referred to in the first
article of the present chapter exceeding two hours per day, both on school days and during the holidays, or in the number of hours per day devoted to school and work
exceeding seven hours. Under section 3D 359(2), subject to observation of the provisions of section 3D 357(1), the employment of children between 12 and 14 years of age
may not exceed four-and-a-half hours per day. Section 3D 359(3) provides that, in all cases of employment of children between 12 and 14 years of age, work is prohibited on
Sundays and public holidays. The same kinds of work are also prohibited at night at least for the period of 12 consecutive hours between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m. (Source ILO
NORMLEX http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:13100:0::NO:13100:P13100_COMMENT_ID:2294908).
(f) Government has, in its declaration appended to its ratification, indicated the exclusion of family undertakings and small-scale holdings from the scope of application of the
Convention. Government has not yet adopted provisions permitting the employment of persons of at least 12 years of age on light work, in accordance with Article 7(1) and (4)
of the Convention.
(g) As per Section 43(1) of the Children’s Act, the minimum age for engaging a child for light work is 16 years. )
(h) Section 44 of the Children’s Act of 2005 states that a child shall not be engaged in hazardous work which poses a danger to his or her health, safety or morals. Section 44(2)
further lists the following types of work considered as hazardous: going to sea; mining and quarrying; carrying heavy loads; work in manufacturing industries where chemicals
are used and produced; work in places where machines are used, and work in bars, hotels, and places of entertainment where a child may be exposed to immoral behaviour.

(i) As per Section 91.3 of the Children’s Act No. 560 of 1998 hazardous work includes – (a) going to sea; (b) mining and quarrying; (c) porterage of heavy loads; (d)
manufacturing industries where chemicals are produced or used; (e) work in places where machines are used; and (f) work in places such as bars, hotels and places of
entertainment where a person may be exposed to immoral behaviour. The Government has indicated that it envisages reviewing and updating as necessary section 91 of the
Children’s Act, including the list of types of hazardous work, so as to be in compliance with the Convention. (Source ILO NOR MLEX
http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:13100:0::NO:13100:P13100_COMMENT_ID:3083622).
(j) Section 5 of the Child Labour Order provides that the age of admission to apprenticeship, which is set at 14 years, may, with the authorization of the labour inspector, be
reduced to 12 years for the following types of work: light domestic tasks forming part of the work of a scullion, assistant cook, “small boy” or child minder; picking, gathering or
sorting work performed in agricultural undertakings; light work of a non-industrial nature. Section 6 of the Child Labour Order allows the employment of young workers from 12
to 14 years of age, if the work is carried out in accordance with section 5 referred to above, and that a list must be submitted to the labour inspector within eight days, specifying
the name of each worker, the nature of the work and the corresponding remuneration. Furthermore, section 7 of the Child Labour Order requires the written consent of the
parent or guardian in the case of the employment of children aged from 12 to 14 years.
(k) Section 189-35 of Decree No. 96-178/P-RM of 13 June 1996 allows exceptions from the minimum age for admission to employment in the case of boys and girls of at least
12 years of age for domestic work and light work of a seasonal nature. The Government has indicated undertaking to raise the minimum age for domestic work and light work of
a seasonal nature from 12 to 13 years. It is also preparing a draft order to determine light work activities and the conditions for their performance. (Source: ILO NORMLEX
http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:13100:0::NO:13100:P13100_COMMENT_ID:3147102)
(l) The Government declared in conformity with Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Convention that the provisions of the Convention do not apply to traditional pastoral or rural work
without remuneration carried out in a family setting by children of less than 15 years of age and which aims at better integrating them in their social surroundings and the
environment.
(m) As per Child Right Act of 2007, Sect. 128, work is hazardous when it poses a danger to the health, safety or morals of a person. (3) Hazardous work includes: (a) going to
sea; (b) mining and quarrying; (c) porterage of heavy loads; (d) manufacturing industries where chemicals are produced or used; (e) work in places where machines are used;
and (f) work in places such as bars, hotels and places of entertainment where a person may be exposed to immoral behaviour.
(n) Togo initially specified a minimum age for admission to employment or work of 14 years when it ratified the Convention, but section 150 of the Labour Code of 2006 provides
that, “subject to the provisions respecting apprenticeship, children of either sex may not be employed in any enterprise or p erform any type of work, even on their own account,
before the age of fifteen (15) years”.
(o) National Steering Committee on Child Labour validated the National Hazardous Child Labour list for Nigeria in 2013.



                       9. In view of these measurement challenges, and in order to facilitate cross-
                       country comparisons, the Report uses two methods to approximate child labour.
                       It first presents child labour estimates based on the methodology employed by
                       ILO in its global child labour estimates. Following this, it relies on the broader
                       concept of employment as an approximation of child labour. Children in
                       employment are those engaged in any economic activity for at least one hour
                       during the reference period.4 Economic activity covers all market production and
                       certain types of non-market production (principally the production of goods and
                       services for own use). It includes forms of work in both the formal and informal
                       economy; inside and outside family settings; work for pay or profit (in cash or in
                       kind, part-time or full-time), or as a domestic worker outside the child’s own
                       household for an employer (with or without pay). It is worth repeating that these
                       child labour approximations are not necessarily consistent with child labour as
                       defined in legal terms in individual countries.
                       10. The Report focuses primarily on the 5-14 years age group, although it should
                       be noted that international legal standards relating to child labour also extend to
                       15-17 year-olds.5 The main reason for setting the upper age bound at 14 years
                       relates to data shortcomings - data from the MICS/DHS survey instrument, used
                       for ten of the 14 countries included in the study for child labour estimates, are
                       limited to children up to the age of 14 years. In addition, even in countries where
                       data for older children are available, it is very difficult to obtain information
                       relating to the occupations included in the hazardous work lists from national
                       survey datasets.

                       4 The concept of employment is elaborated further in the Resolution concerning statistics of work, employment and labour
                       underutilization, adopted by the Nineteenth International Conference of Labour Statisticians (October 2013). The resolution
                       is available at:
                       http://www.ilo.org/global/statistics-and-databases/standards-and-guidelines/resolutions-adopted-by-international-
                       conferences-of-labour-statisticians/WCMS_230304/lang--en/index.htm

                       5The stipulations contained in ILO Conventions Nos. 138 and 182 relating to hazardous work, excessively long work hours
                       and unconditional worst forms, also extend to children aged 15-17 years. Likewise, the Convention on the Rights of the
                       Child applies to all persons under the age of 18.

          11. The Report is based on the most recent available data from national
          household surveys in a total of 14 ECOWAS countries, as summarised in Table 2.
          Data for Cabo Verde were not available when the current study was conducted.
          Data for ten of the countries (i.e., Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana,
          Guinea Bissau, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal and Sierra Leone) are from the
          UNICEF Multiple Cluster Indicator (MICS) or the USAID Demographic and Health
          Survey (DHS) programmes, which share a common questionnaire on children’s
          involvement in employment within or outside the household for the 5-14 years
          age group. As these surveys do not contain detailed information on the nature
          and characteristics of children’s employment, they are augmented where
          possible with information from other (sometimes earlier) surveys in order to
          provide this information.
          12. The ILO Statistical Information and Monitoring Programme on Child Labour
          (SIMPOC) surveys are the source for information on the extent and nature of
          children’s employment in two countries (i.e., Guinea and Togo) and for
          information on the nature of children’s employment in two others (i.e., Burkina
          Faso, Niger). The SIMPOC survey programme provides more detailed
          information on the extent, nature and hazardousness of children’s employment
          across the entire 5-17 years age range. Data for Liberia is from a general labour
          force survey that collects information on labour force participation for persons
          from the age of five years onwards. Data for Gambia are from a general
          household survey, which is not explicitly designed to measure labour force
          participation, but collects this information alongside a range of other household
          and labour force characteristics.
          13. The different survey instruments (as well as different survey reference
          years), mean that cross-country comparisons of children’s employment should
          be interpreted with caution. It is worth also noting that the availability, reliability
          and timeliness of data on child labour is generally poor in the ECOWAS countries
          and more needs to be done to improve it. Better data to inform and guide policy

3.1             Involvement in child labour based on ILO global estimates methodology
                14. Child labour as measured in accordance with the ILO global estimates
                methodology7 remains very common in the ECOWAS region. The share in the 5-
                14 years age group in child labour is 25 percent, or 20.6 million in absolute
                terms. Differences in child labour by sex are small for this age group - the
                percentage of boys in child labour exceeds that of girls by less than two
                percentage points. As reported in Figure 1, the incidence of child labour among
                5-14 year-olds in the ECOWAS countries is highest of all regions in the world.
                Child labour for this age group in the ECOWAS region is three percentage points
                higher than that for the Sub Saharan region as a whole, and more than three
                times that in the Asia and Pacific, Middle East and North Africa and Latin
                America and the Caribbean regions.

                15. The proportion of older, 15-17 year-old, children in child labour is also very
                high in the ECOWAS region. An estimated 11% of this age group, 2.2 million in
                absolute terms, are in child labour based on the ILO estimation methodology.
                Differences by sex in child labour incidence for this age group are very
                pronounced. The percentage of female 15-17 year-olds in child labour is only
                about one-third that of 15-17 year-old males.

            rates across countries. Country-specific child labour estimates are provided in
            Table 4, again based on the methodology utilised by the ILO in its global child
            labour estimates.8 As discussed above, they do not necessarily reflect child
            labour as defined by national legislation in each of the ECOWAS countries, but
            rather reflect a standardised approximation of child labour for comparative
            purposes.9

Notes: (a) Estimates based on this methodology provide an international statistical benchmark for comparative purposes but do not
necessarily reflect child labour as defined by national legislation in each of the ECOWAS countries. For details on the methodology, see ILO-
IPEC, Making progress against child labour – Global estimates and trends 2000-2012/ International Labour Office, International Programme
on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC) – Geneva: ILO, 2013; (b) Data are not available for Cabo Verde; and (c) The lower age boundary
for Gambia estimates is seven years.

            17. The estimates nonetheless provide an indication of the very high levels of
            child labour across almost all of the ECOWAS countries. At least one-fifth of all 5-
            14 year-olds are in child labour in all countries except Benin, Liberia and
            Senegal.10 Child labour rates are highest in Guinea Bissau (39%), Togo (38%),
            Burkina Faso (36%), Guinea (35%), Niger (34%) and Ghana (33%). This ranking
            changes considerably when expressed in absolute terms, however. Populous
            Nigeria is host to by far the largest number of child labourers (10.5 million),
            followed by Ghana (2.1 million), Niger (1.9 million) and Burkina Faso (1.8
            million).


            8For details, see ILO-IPEC, Making progress against child labour – Global estimates and trends 2000-2012. Geneva, ILO,

            9 As discussed earlier, child labour is a legal rather than statistical concept, and the international legal standards that define
            it are therefore the necessary frame of reference for child labour measurement. However, translating these broad legal
            norms into statistical terms for measurement purposes is complicated by the fact that international legal standards contain
            a number of flexibility clauses left to the discretion of the competent national authority in consultation (where relevant) with
            worker and employer organisations (e.g., minimum ages, scope of application). This means that there is no single legal
            definition of child labour across countries, and concomitantly, no single statistical measure of child labour consistent with
            national legislation across countries.
            10It is not possible to estimate child labour in Mali owing to a lack of information needed to identify light work among 12-14
            year-olds.



                                                                          16
            18. Consolidated estimates for the entire 5-17 years age group are not possible
            because of data limitations, and specifically because of a lack of country-specific
            information on hazardous work among 15-17 year-olds. These data limitations
            constitute an important constraint to informed policy making and again point to
            the need for additional investment in the regular collection of information on
            child labour in the ECOWAS region.


3.2         Involvement in children’s employment
            19. Child labour as approximated by children’s employment11 is also very high
            across the ECOWAS countries. Incidence of children’s employment exceeds 40%
            in Guinea Bissau, Mali, Togo, Ghana, Niger and Burkina Faso and exceeds 30% in
            all but Benin, Liberia and Senegal (Figure 2a). Even in the best-performing
            countries children’s employment levels substantially exceed the world average
            for the 5-14 years age group (of 12%). Again, the picture differs considerably
            when presented in absolute terms. Nigeria is host to by far the largest number
            of 5-14 year-olds in employment (14 million), followed by Ghana (2.7 million),
            Niger (2.5 million) and Burkina Faso (2.1 million) (Figure 2b).

            11Recall that children in employment are those engaged in any economic activity for at least one hour during the reference
            period. Economic activity covers all market production and certain types of non-market production (principally the
            production of goods and services for own use). It includes forms of work in both the formal and informal economy; inside
            and outside family settings; work for pay or profit (in cash or in kind, part-time or full-time), or as a domestic worker outside
            the child’s own household for an employer (with or without pay).

 4.         FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH CHILDREN’S EMPLOYMENT
            20. Children from poorer countries are more to be found in employment. But it is
            interesting to note that while there is a negative correlation between children’s
            involvement in employment and national income, this correlation is imprecise at
            best. As illustrated in Figure 3, levels of children’s employment are low relative
            to national income in some countries while in others the opposite is true. The
            existence of countries doing better with fewer resources suggests significant
            scope for policy intervention against child labour. Policies promoting quality
            education as an alternative to child labour can be particularly important in this
            context.

different reference years and are derived from different survey instruments.

            21. Children’s employment in the ECOWAS countries is much more common in
            rural areas. The large rural-urban gap extends to all 14 ECOWAS countries. In
            eight of the countries, the share of rural 5-14 year-olds in employment is at least
            twice that of urban children in the same age group. The relative rural-urban gap
            is highest in Liberia, where 27% of rural children work in employment against
            seven percent of urban children, in Burkina Faso (47% versus 20%) and in
            Gambia (53% versus 23%). Why are rural children more prone to involvement in
            employment? Differences in the rural and urban economies, and in particular
            the key role of informal family-based agriculture in rural areas, is undoubtedly
            one important factor. Higher levels of poverty, poorer basic services coverage,
            and less access to schooling, particularly at the post-primary level, in rural areas
            also likely play an important role influencing relatively more rural households to
            send their children to work. As discussed further in the next section, the nature
            of the work children perform also differs considerably between urban and rural
            areas.

            22. Gender factors appear relevant in determining the extent of children’s
            involvement in employment. For the ECOWAS region as a whole, male children in
            employment outnumber their female counterparts by about 1.1 million for the
            5-14 years age group (Table 3). At the country level, the share of boys in
            employment exceeds that of females in nine of the ECOWAS countries (i.e.,
            Guinea Bissau, Mali, Togo, Ghana, Niger, Burkina Faso, Gambia, Liberia and
            Senegal) while in no country does the opposite pattern hold. The gender gap in
            employment in “favour” of boys is particularly marked in Mali (51% versus 41%)
            and Burkina Faso (47% versus 38%). It is worth recalling, however, that these
            figures do not capture the performance of household chores, the burden for
            which falls disproportionately on females in most contexts. It is also worth
            underscoring that girls are often disproportionately represented in less visible
            and therefore underreported forms of child labour such as domestic service in
            third party households. Employment estimates alone, therefore, may understate
            girls’ involvement in child labour relative to that of boys.

            23. Involvement in employment is consistently higher among children from
            poorest households. As shown in Figure 6, the correlation between poverty and
            children’s employment is positive and strong across all of the ECOWAS countries.


                                                                                   19
           In Guinea Bissau, for instance, 61% of children from poorest households are in
           employment compared to 20% from their peers from the richest ones. These
           results are consistent with a wide body of international evidence indicating that
           poverty (approximated by income, consumption, wealth index, etc.) is an
           important factor in child labour. The poverty-child labour link is straightforward
           – poverty makes it more likely that households have to rely on their children’s
           income or production to help make ends meet, particularly when they are faced
           with an unforeseen shock. Former child labourers are themselves more likely to
           be poor and reliant on child labour as adults, thereby continuing the vicious
           cycle of poverty and child labour.
           24. It is worth noting, however, that children’s employment is by no means
           limited to poorest households. Indeed, as also shown in Figure 6, the share of
           children in employment even in the richest households is far from negligible in
           most ECOWAS countries. This suggests that while poverty reduction is an
           important part of the answer to child labour, it is not, in and of itself, a complete
           answer.

           25. Orphanhood appears to increase vulnerability to child labour in the ECOWAS
           countries. Orphanhood is common in the ECOWAS region and the effect of
           orphanhood on children’s involvement in employment is therefore of
           considerably policy interest. Figure 7 indicates that a higher share of orphans
           compared to non-orphans are in employment in all countries where data are
           available except Guinea Bissau and Mali. These simple correlations do not of
           course offer insight into why this is the case, i.e., whether it is orphanhood per
           se that increases children’s risk of work or whether is it factors associated with
           orphanhood, such as household poverty, driving the correlation.

            26. The link between orphanhood and work appears to depend in part on
            whether the deceased parent is the mother or the father, or whether both
            parents are deceased (Figure 8). Patterns in this regard differ across countries,
            however. In Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, Mali and Senegal, children who have lost both
            their parents face the greatest risk of work. In Ghana, Guinea Bissau and Nigeria,
            employment is highest among children who have lost only their fathers while in
            Burkina Faso and Niger it is highest among children who have lost their mothers.
            Again, explaining these correlations requires further research, although they are
            likely in part driven by the efficacy of traditional and State support systems,
            including systems for fostering.

            27. Migration does not appear to consistently increase children’s risk of
            employment. Indeed, if anything, the opposite pattern appears to hold. In four of
            the six countries where data are available, there is a smaller share of migrant


                                                                                         21
           compared to non-migrant children in employment (where migrant children are
           defined as those who have changed location during the last five years). Mali is
           the only one of the six countries where migrants are at greater risk of
           employment. But there are important distinctions within the child migrant
           population that may be relevant to their susceptibility to involvement in
           employment. Evidence from Senegal, for instance, indicates that the subgroup
           of children that migrate unaccompanied and that migrate to urban areas are at
           greater relative risk of child labour and educational marginalisation.12 Also of
           concern are the group of children left behind by migrating parents, whose family
           support systems are disrupted and whose vulnerability therefore may be
           increased.13

5.           NATURE OF CHILDREN’S EMPLOYMENT
             28. Information on the various characteristics of children’s employment is
             necessary for understanding children’s workplace reality and their role in the
             labour force. This section presents data on broad work characteristics that are
             useful in this context. For children’s employment, the breakdown by industry is
             reported in order to provide a standardised picture of where children are
             concentrated in the measured economy. A breakdown by children’s status in
             employment is also reported to provide additional insight into how children’s
             work in employment is carried out. Average working hours and exposure to
             dangerous conditions are reported to provide an indirect indication of the
             possible health and educational consequences of children’s work.
             29. The agriculture sector accounts for by far the largest share of children’s
             employment. The agriculture sector accounts for at least two of every three
             children in employment in all countries (Figure 10). The predominance of
             agriculture is a particular concern in light of the fact that this sector is one of the
             three most dangerous in which to work at any age, along with construction and
             mining, in terms of work-related fatalities, non-fatal accidents and occupational
             diseases.14 Children working in agriculture can face a variety of serious hazards,
             including operation of dangerous equipment, pesticide exposure, excessive
             physical exertion and heavy loads.

             30. The sectoral composition of children’s employment differs considerably
             between rural and urban areas. This is a reflection of the important underlying
             differences in the rural and urban economies (Figure 11). Agriculture work not
             surprisingly predominates in rural areas, while the composition of children’s
             employment in urban areas tends to be more varied, with the services,
             commerce and agriculture sectors all playing important roles. Employment in
             the services sector includes domestic service in third-party households, a form of

            31. Children’s employment is heavily concentrated within the family unit in most
            of the ECOWAS countries. The share of children in employment who work for
            their own families is highest in Burkina Faso (93%), Guinea Bissau (92%) and Cote
            d’Ivoire (87%) (Figure 12a). Non wage employment outside the family, in self-
            employment or in other work arrangements, is also important in some of the
            ECOWAS countries, involving, for example, 64% of all children in employment in
            Niger and 54% in Sierra Leone. Children’s status in employment also varies
            somewhat between urban and rural places of residence, with wage and
            non-wage employment playing a relatively larger role in urban contexts (Figure
            12b).

                32. Many children in employment work long hours with obvious consequences for
                time for study and leisure. Children’s total working hours vary considerably
                across the ECOWAS countries, and between rural and urban areas within
                countries. Average weekly working hours range from almost 34 hours in Mali 15
                to a little under seven hours in Sierra Leone. Differences in children’s weekly
                hours between rural and urban areas are largest in Mali (where urban children
                work longest) and Burkina Faso where rural children work longest). In
                interpreting these figures on working hours, it is worth noting that many
                children in employment, and especially girls in employment, also spend a non-
                negligible amount of time each week performing household chores in their own
                homes, adding significantly to the overall time burden posed by work. It is also
                important to note that working hours can be affected by seasonality. Children in
                agriculture, for instance, may work for very different amounts of time each week
                in different agricultural seasons. Estimates of working hours, it follows, can be
                influenced by when during the year a survey is fielded.




                15   Although it should be recalled that the estimate for Mali refers to the 10-14 years rather than to the 5-14 years age group.

                                      33. Children’s employment is frequently dangerous in nature for younger and
                                      older children alike. Information from the ILO SIMPOC surveys, conducted in four
                                      of the ECOWAS countries, permit a more detailed look at the actual conditions
                                      faced by children in the workplace. These surveys suggest that children have an
                                      alarmingly high rate of exposure to dangerous conditions in the workplace
                                      (including heavy loads; work with gas, fire, flames, chemicals, explosives or toxic
                                      substances; work in environment with excessive noise or vibration; work in a
                                      dusty or smoky environments; underground work or work at heights; work in
                                      dark or confined spaces; work in insufficiently ventilated spaces; and work
                                      during the night). Exposure to these dangerous conditions among working
                                      children in the 5-14 years age range varies from 91% in Burkina Faso to 53% in
                                      Niger (Figure 14a). It is worth noting that the employment of 5-14 year-olds does
                                      not appear safer than that of older children. Indeed, the proportion of 15-17
                                      year-old working children exposed to the same set of dangerous conditions
                                      closely mirrors that of their younger counterparts in the four countries (Figure
                                      14b).

6.       CHILDREN’S AGRICULTURAL EMPLOYMENT
         34. As most working children in the ECOWAS region are found in the agriculture
         sector, it is worth looking in more detail at the nature and characteristics of
         children’s work in this sector.
         35. Almost all children in agriculture work within their own families. Figures for
         the seven ECOWAS countries where data on status in employment are available
         make clear the children’s agricultural work takes place overwhelmingly on the
         family farm (Table 5). At least nine in ten child agricultural workers are found on
         family farms in Burkina Faso, Guinea, Niger, Nigeria and Togo. In Mali, 87% of all
         children in agriculture work for their families while in Liberia the figure is 81%.
         The only other significant work modality in the agriculture sector is self-
         employment, which accounts for 19% and 10 percent, respectively, of child
         agricultural workers in Liberia and Mali. Very few children in agriculture work for
         wages in any of the seven countries.

         36. Most children in agriculture work in crop and animal production. Children are
         heavily concentrated in crop production in Guinea, Mali and Togo, whereas both
         crop and animal production are important in Burkina Faso, Liberia, Niger, and
         Nigeria (Table 6). Guinea is the only country where an appreciable share of child
         agricultural workers is found in logging (six percent); only a small share of
         children in agriculture work in fishing in the seven ECOWAS countries where
         data are available. Children are involved in the production of a variety of specific
         crops. Cereals appear most important in this regard, although vegetable
         production is also relevant in Niger (Table 7, Table 8 and Table 9).

          37. Children in Mali and Liberia are more likely to work on farms with relatively
          small-sized workforces. In both Mali and Liberia (the two countries where these
          data are available) most children are located on farms with from two to 10
          workers (Table 10 and Table 11). In Liberia, a comparatively larger share of the
          adult agricultural workforce is found at both ends of the farm size spectrum. In
          Mali, a comparatively greater share of the adult agricultural workforce is found
          on smallest (one worker) farms.

          38. Children and youth in Nigeria are more likely to work on larger smallholder
          family farms, where farm size is measured in terms of land area. Figure 15, which
          reports the distribution of workforce and total hours in harvest work by farm
          size (quintile),16 illustrates this point. Over one-third of 6-14 year-olds in harvest
          work are found on farms in the largest size quintile (i.e., over nine acres) against
          16Farm size quintiles are as follows: Q1=0-0.3 acres, Q2=0.3-1.5 acres, Q3=1.5-4 acres, Q4=4-9 acres, and Q5= >9+
          acres.



                                                                                28
                   only 13% in farms in the smallest-sized quintile (i.e., 0.3 acres or less) (Figure
                   15a). Looking at the distribution of total working hours does not alter the picture
                   – a similar proportion of total hours in harvest work for this age group are logged
                   on largest farms (Figure 15b). These results suggest that families with more land
                   to work have greater need for their children’s farm labour. Children aged 15 -17
                   in harvest work are also less likely to be found on farms in the smallest size
                   quintile, but are distributed more evenly across the other sized farms. Young
                   adults aged 18-29 years and other adults are more evenly split across the farm
                   size quintiles, especially when measured in terms of the workforce (rather than
                   the working hours) distribution.

                   39. Children play an important role in overall agricultural production in most
                   ECOWAS countries. Not answered in the statistics presented above is the
                   question of the relative importance of children’s labour agriculture. In other
                   words, what is the “child labour content” of agriculture in the ECOWAS
                   countries? These questions are taken up below by looking at the share of the
                   total agricultural workforce (Table 12) and of total working hours (Table 13) in
                   agriculture accounted for by child workers. Children account for 29% of the
                   overall agricultural workforce in Togo, for around one-quarter of the workforce
                   in Burkina Faso, Guinea and Niger and for one-fifth of the workforce in Nigeria
                   (Table 12). The role of children is also important when measured in terms of

                   Guinea, where children account for about one-fifth of total agricultural working
                   hours (Table 13).

          40. Children appear to play an especially important role in livestock production.
          Table 12 and Table 13 also report children as percentage of the workforce and of
          total working hours in specific agriculture subsectors. This breakdown suggests
          that livestock production is especially dependent on children in many of the
          ECOWAS countries. Children account for almost half (47%) of all workers in
          livestock production in Burkina Faso, 41% of livestock workers in Niger and for
          about one-third of livestock workers in Guinea and Togo. It is interesting to note
          that children play an important role even in forestry and logging. Over one-third
          of all forestry/logging workers are children in Burkina Faso and Guinea, and over
          a quarter of all workers in this subsector are children in Liberia.17




          17Statistics from other sources offer further insight into the forestry/logging sector and its environmental consequences in
          these countries and are available at http://www.fao.org/forestry/fra/fra2010/en and http://www.illegal-logging.info/regions.
          An estimated 38% of Sierra Leone is covered by forests, 86% of which is owned by local and indigenous communities.
          While only 4% of Sierra Leone’s forest areas are primary forest, the vast majority is naturally regenerated, with only 1%
          comprising plantations Some 27% of Guinea’s land is forested, and just 0.3% of this land is covered by primary forest.
          Much of Guinea’s rainforests have been destroyed by fires or cleared for agriculture. All of the country’s forests are state -
          owned, and 4% are designated as protected areas . Guinea experienced an average annual rate of deforestation of about
          0.5% over past twenty years . Forests cover 45% of Liberia’s land, though these forests have been disappearing at an
          annual rate of between 0.6% and 0.7% over the past twenty years Only 4% of Liberia’s primary forests remain, and illegal
          logging has long been a significant problem in the country.

  7.         CHILDREN’S EMPLOYMENT AND EDUCATIONAL MARGINALISATION
             41. Not discussed up to this point is the interaction between children’s
             employment and their schooling in the ECOWAS countries. Does employment
             make it less likely that children attend school? And, for those children combining
             schooling and employment, to what extent does employment impede learning
             achievement? These questions are critical for assessing the extent to which child
             labour is linked to the issue of educational marginalisation in the ECOWAS
             region. This section looks at evidence of the educational impact of children’s
             work.
             42. One way of viewing the interaction between children’s employment and
             schooling is by decomposing the child population into four non-overlapping
             activity groups – children in employment only, children attending school only,
             children combining school and employment and children doing neither. This
             decomposition, reported in Table 14 and Figure 16, varies considerably across
             the ECOWAS countries. Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger stand out as having very
             high shares of children in employment only (over one-quarter) and very low
             shares of children in school only (less than one-third). Senegal, Niger and Mali
             stand out as having especially large share of children neither in employment nor
             in school (over one-quarter). Many of these ostensibly inactive children are likely
             performing household chores in their own homes, a form of work falling outside
             the formal definition of employment. Others may be in worst forms of child
             labour beyond the scope of standard household surveys. Those inactive children
             who are not currently in child labour are at increased risk of future child labour
             involvement, and therefore also constitute an important policy priority.

             43. Differences by sex are pronounced (Table A2) in many of the countries. Male
             children are more likely to combine school and employment whereas female
             children are more likely to be inactive. These statistics highlight the need for
             policy responses to child labour that take into account the important gender
             dimensions of the phenomenon.

                     44. Work and schooling are mutually exclusive activities for many working
                     children in the ECOWAS region. Figure 17 reports working children that do not
                     attend school as a percentage of total working children in each of the ECOWAS
                     countries. It suggests that children in employment are not able to attend school
                     in many instances. At least one-half of all working children in Mali, Burkina Faso,
                     Niger and Senegal, and at least one-third in Guinea Bissau, Guinea and Cote
                     d’Ivoire are out-of-school and therefore educationally marginalised. Why these
                     children are unable to attend school is a key question for policy and requires
                     further investigation. In many cases it is undoubtedly the demands of work on
                     children’s time and energy that directly preclude schooling. In other instances a
                     lack of access to adequate school services can mean that families do not have
                     the option of choosing school over work because the former is not available (see
                     also discussion in next section). Decisions concerning children’s education can
                     also be influenced by the value given to education by families and by family
                     perceptions of the returns to education in the labour market.

                          Whatever the cause, it is this group of working children not in school whose
                          long-term prospects are likely to be most compromised. Clearly, if children are
                          denied schooling altogether then they have little chance of acquiring the human
                          capital necessary for more gainful employment upon entering adulthood.
                          45. Children in employment are much less likely to attend school than their non-
                          working peers. Comparing the school attendance of working and non-working
                          children is a way of assessing the relative educational disadvantage of the former
                          group. This comparison, reported in Figure 18, indicates that working children
                          lag substantially behind their non-working peers in almost all of the ECOWAS
                          countries. The attendance gap between working and non-working children is
                          especially pronounced in Guinea (22 percentage points), Côte d’Ivoire and
                          Senegal (17 percentage points) and Burkina Faso (16 percentage points).
                          Attendance, however, is far from universal even among those not burdened with
                          work responsibilities. Data are not available on the regularity of school
                          attendance, i.e. the frequency with which children are absent from or late for
                          class, but attendance regularity is also likely adversely affected by involvement in
                          employment.

                         46. The attendance gap between working and non-working children is higher in
                         urban areas. This point is illustrated in Figure 19, which reports the percentage
                         point difference in attendance rates between working and non-working children
                         in rural and urban areas. The gap between working and non-working children in
                         Senegal, for example, is 20 percentage points in urban areas compared to nine
                         percentage points in rural areas. A similar pattern prevails in all but one country
                         (Ghana).18 In other words, urban working children face a greater attendance
                         disadvantage vis-à-vis their non-working peers than is the case in rural areas.
                         School attendance, on the other hand, is lower in rural areas, but the difference
                         between working and non-working children in this regard is smaller. This lends
                         credence to the argument that factors beyond work itself – including access to
                         adequate schooling facilities – may also be important in explaining absence of
                         rural working children from school.

                         47. A large share of working children do in fact attend school in the ECOWAS
                         countries, so a key question is how work affects their school performance. Data
                         on the highest grade completed show that children in employment lag behind
                         their non-working counterparts in terms of grade progression in all 14 ECOWAS
                         countries (Figure 20). Moreover, because child workers are more likely to drop
                         out after primary school, and because drop outs are presumably those with
                         higher accumulated delay, the gap in grade-for-age reported in Figure 20 is likely
                         to underestimate the true gap in completed grades between working and non-
                         working children, i.e., the gap that would be observed in the absence of selective
                         drop out. The difference in grade-for-age is likely in large part a reflection of
                         higher repetition arising from poorer performance, but information on learning
                         achievement scores is needed to obtain a more complete picture of the impact
                         of work on children’s ability to benefit from their time in the classroom. It stands
                         to reason, however, that the exigencies of work limit the time and energy


                         18It is worth noting that in four countries, the attendance of rural working children is actually higher than that of rural non-
                         working children. The reasons for this require further investigation, but one possibility is that children’s income or
                         production from work makes it easier for the household to bear the costs associated with schooling.

                                          children have for their studies, in turn negatively impacting upon their academic
                                          performance.

8.             OUT OF SCHOOL CHILDREN
               48. Out of school children constitute an important related policy priority in the
               ECOWAS region. The share of out-of-school children in the 7-14 years age group
               stands at 56% in Mali, at around one-half in Niger and Burkina Faso, and at least
               one-third in Senegal, Guinea Bissau and Guinea. At least one-fifth of children are
               out of school in all countries except Ghana and Togo, underscoring the distance
               the region must still travel to reach universal primary enrolment (Figure 21).
               Some of these out-of-school children are simply late entrants, i.e., children who
               will eventually enter school but have not yet done so. But even when the
               reference group is limited to the 10-14 years age group to exclude most
               potential late entrants the share of out-of-school children is very high in most of
               the ECOWAS countries.

               49. The demands of work are not the only reason for children’s absence from
               school. It is interesting to note that large shares of out-of-school children are
               not in employment in most ECOWAS countries (Figure 22). This result suggests
               that while work is undoubtedly an important barrier to children’s schooling it is
               by no means the only barrier keeping children out of the classroom. What are

                    some of the other barriers? Figure 23, which reports reasons cited for never
                    entering school, suggests that school-related factors, and specifically school
                    access and school costs, are especially important. Large shares of respondents
                    across all countries (e.g., 45% in Liberia) cite lack of nearby school facilities
                    and/or high school costs as reasons for being out of school. Attitudes towards
                    school are another important factor. A significant proportion of respondents
                    (e.g., 28% in Guinea) indicate not being in school because they saw it as
                    unimportant or uninteresting, or were not allowed by their parents. The
                    demands of housework or employment, on the other hand, together were cited
                    by only a minority of respondents in most countries.

                    50. Birth registration is also relevant as a barrier to schooling in some contexts. In
                    Côte d'Ivoire, for instance, other reports indicate that many children displaced
                    by violence were never registered at birth, meaning that they have no proof of
                    nationality and are unable to enrol in preschool.19 In all, UNICEF estimates that
                    more than half (53%) of children below the age of five are not registered in West
                    and Central Africa. This figure rises to 96% in Liberia and to 76% in Guinea
                    Bissau.20 In addition to being a barrier to schooling, low birth registration rates
                    also hamper efforts to protect children from child labour.
                    51. The share of out of school children is especially high in rural areas. As reported in
                    Figure 24, there is a much larger percentage of children out of school in rural
                    compared to urban areas in all ECOWAS countries. The percentage of out-of-school
                    rural children in the 10-14 years age range is almost five times that of urban children
                    in Nigeria, is three times that of urban children in Guinea and Guinea Bissau and is
                    more than twice that of urban children in Niger, Burkina Faso, Senegal, Ghana and
                    Togo. Clearly, the effort to increase school enrolment must therefore place
                    particular emphasis on extending schooling in the underserved rural regions of the

                        goal in itself, but is also important to providing children with an alternative to work.

                        52. Many of those who are out of school have very limited education and
                        therefore are in need of “second chance” learning opportunities. As reported in
                        Figure 25, a very high share of out-of-school children suffer what UNESCO terms
                        “education poverty”, i.e., possess less than four years of education, the
                        minimum amount of school time considered by UNESCO as necessary for
                        acquiring basic literacy skills. It is likely that the education poverty indicator
                        actually underestimates the second chance learning needs of out-of-school
                        children, as basic literacy skills alone are less and less an adequate skills floor for
                        successful entry into the labour market. Rather, higher-order technical,
                        vocational and reasoning skills, requiring education well beyond the primary
                        level, are increasingly needed. Reaching the group of out-of-school children with
                        second chance educational opportunities is important to ensuring that these
                        children do not enter adulthood lacking the basic skills needed for work and life.

9.     RESPONDING TO CHILD LABOUR
       53. There are no simple answers to the alarming numbers of West African
       children who remain trapped in child labour. As underscored in the Roadmap for
       Achieving the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour by 2016 adopted at
       The Hague Global Child Labour Conference of 2010,21 child labour – in the
       ECOWAS countries and elsewhere – is a complex phenomenon requiring a
       response that is comprehensive in nature and that involves simultaneous action
       across a range of policy sectors. In keeping with a comprehensive approach, the
       document calls for the “mainstreaming” child labour elimination in broader
       policy frameworks at national and sub-national levels and for mechanisms to
       coordinate policy efforts against child labour.
       54. As part of the searching for comprehensive solutions, ECOWAS members
       states adopted the Decent Work Agenda in Africa 2007-2015 (DWAA) at the 11th
       African Regional Meeting of the ILO (Addis Ababa, 24-27 April 2007). The DWAA
       calls on all countries in the region to implement National Action Plans (NAPs) to
       eliminate the worst forms of child labour by 2015.22 NAPs are practical,
       comprehensive and time-bound programmes for dealing with child labour by
       addressing its causes and direct consequences. In response to the DWAA, the
       number of countries designing such NAPs has been increasing steadily. The
       ECOWAS Child Policy and its Strategic Plan of Action23(now the Child Protection
       Monitoring and Evaluation Framework24), the ECOWAS Regional Action Plan on
       Child Labour and the Regional Policy and Plan of Action for Child Protection and
       Child Trafficking also provide important frameworks for policy measures against
       child labour in the ECOWAS countries.
       55. These global and ECOWAS-specific policy frameworks as well as the evidence
       cited in the previous sections of this Report, point to the following policy pillars
       as being of particular relevance to the fight against child labour in the ECOWAS
       region: (a) Improving education access and quality; (b) Expanding second chance
       learning opportunities; (c) Expanding social protection; (d) Awareness raising
       and social mobilisation; (e) Expanding direct actions aimed at removal and
       recovery; (f) Strengthening the policy and legislative frameworks; (g) Building
       institutional capacity; and (h) Improving the evidence base. These key policy
       pillars for responding to child labour in the ECOWAS region are discussed further
       below.

     Improving education access and quality, in order that families have the
     opportunity to invest in their children’s education as an alternative to child
     labour, and that the returns to schooling make it worthwhile for them to
     do so.
       56. There is broad consensus that the single most effective way to prevent child
       labour is to extend and improve schooling as its logical alternative. Despite
       progress, ensuring that children have access to quality education remains a

major challenge in the ECOWAS countries.25 We saw earlier that the share of
children in the 7-14 years age range who are out of school is still alarmingly high
in the ECOWAS countries, underscoring the distance the region must still travel
to reach universal primary enrolment. An important share of out-of-school
children are not in child labour but are at heightened risk of future child labour
involvement. These children also constitute an important policy concern.
Feedback on reasons for being outside of school highlights the importance of
factors relating to the school system itself (e.g., school distance and out-of-
pocket costs) and of perceptions concerning its importance and relevance.
These results underscore the need to address the school access and quality
issues influencing parents’ decisions to enrol and keep their children in school.
57. Many families in the ECOWAS region, and particularly those who are poor or
who live in outlying rural areas, indicate not sending their children to school
because there is no school available or it is too far away. This underscores the
importance of continued efforts towards school expansion using needs-based
criteria to ensure that the most disadvantaged and under-served groups are
reached. Community schools that are integrated with the formal school system
offer one model for reaching outlying rural communities with schooling in a cost-
effective manner. Feedback from families also points to the importance of out-
of-pocket costs as an access barrier, pointing to the need for measures such as
the provision of educational materials (e.g., exercise books, pencils and
uniforms) for free or at subsidized rates and for those who cannot afford them
and the elimination of all formal and unofficial school fees.
58. A growing body of evidence26 also indicates that incentive schemes that
provide cash or in-kind subsidies to poor families conditional on school
attendance offer another promising route to extending participation in school,
although such programmes remain in their infancy in the ECOWAS region. These
schemes can increase schooling directly by providing poor families with
additional resources as well as indirectly by compensating parents for the
foregone economic product from their children's labour and thus reducing child
work. The benefits of providing free school meals each day are also well-
documented.27 They function both as an incentive to keeping children in school
and as a means of ensuring that children have the necessary nutritional basis for
effective learning. Various school meal programmes already exist in ECOWAS
countries, but these efforts need to be expanded to progressively reach all
children. Finally, measures are needed to address the special access barriers
faced by female students; ensuring that curricula are gender sensitive, ensuring
appropriate hygiene facilities and raising awareness of the importance of female
education are all relevant in this context.
59. Access to schooling matters but in many ECOWAS countries it is only a part
of the answer. There is also general need to improve school quality in order that
schooling is seen by parents as a worthwhile alternative to child labour. Again
feedback from those out of school points to widespread perceptions of school

  being either unimportant or uninteresting, both suggestive of underlying quality
  concerns. At present, schooling standards vary considerably across and within
  the ECOWAS countries and quality is undermined by factors such as incomplete
  school buildings, teacher shortages, inconsistent teaching standards and poor
  curriculum relevance. There is an overarching need for inclusive education
  strategies, including girl- and child-friendly schools, which are adaptive to and
  supportive of the differing learning needs of children. There is also a need to
  continue and intensify on-going curriculum reform efforts aimed at ensuring that
  schooling is relevant and provides an appropriate foundation for higher level
  learning and skills acquisition. Introducing into curricula issues of relevance to
  children’s lives, such as child labour, HIV/AIDS and other social concerns in an
  age-appropriate manner is especially important in this context. The promotion
  of good quality education also means the absence of bullying and corporal
  punishment, and the introduction of methods of learning that encourage
  questioning and children’s participation rather than learning by rote.

Providing second chance learning opportunities, in order to compensate
for the adverse educational consequences of child labour.
  60. “Second chance” policies are needed to reach former working children and
  other out-of-school children with educational opportunities as part of broader
  efforts towards their social reintegration. They are critical to avoiding large
  numbers of children entering adulthood in a disadvantaged position,
  permanently harmed by early work experiences. Children with little or no
  schooling will be in a weak position in the labour market, at much greater risk of
  joining the ranks of the unemployed and the poor. If left alone, these children
  and youth are likely to be in need of other (more costly) remediation policies at a
  later stage of their life cycle. Second chance programmes are based on the
  premise that working children are often difficult to insert directly (back) into the
  formal education system because of their age, different life experiences and lack
  of familiarity with the school environment. Second chance education
  programmes offer out-of-school children a “bridge” to successful integration or
  (re-integration) in the formal school classroom.
  61. Empirical evidence presented above on educational attainment indicates
  that such policies are particularly relevant in the West African context: many
  students leave the system prior to the end of the compulsory education cycle
  and many of those out of school lack the minimum amount of school time
  considered by UNESCO as necessary for acquiring basic literacy skills.
  Programming experience elsewhere points to two main options for reaching
  disadvantaged, out-of-school children with opportunities to ease their transition
  back to the formal school system: mainstreaming, providing returning children
  with special remedial support within the regular classroom context; and
  “bridging” education, involving separate intensive courses, delivered within or
  outside the formal school system, designed to raise academic proficiency prior
  to returning to the regular classroom. There are examples of both options
  already in place in the ECOWAS region, but these are mainly pilot scale efforts
  that need to be evaluated and, on this basis, progressively expanded to
  ultimately include all children in need.

Expanding social protection to help prevent child labour from being
used as a household survival strategy in the face of economic and social
vulnerability.
  62. The importance of social protection to the fight against child labour has been
  well established. Social protection makes it less likely that families have to pull
  their children out of school and send them to work as a coping strategy when
  faced with economic vulnerability or shocks. At present, only an estimated one-
  fifth of all Africans benefit from some type of publicly provided social
  protection28 and coverage is especially low in the West Africa region.29 Those
  covered are limited to a small share of number of workers in the formal sector;
  the large number of people working in agriculture and in other informal sectors
  of the economy are largely excluded. At the same time, social and economic
  risks in region are growing, owing to demographic trends, climate change,
  political instability, governance challenges, globalisation and a range of other
  factors, while traditional support systems to deal with these risks are breaking
  down.30
  63. In this context, establishing adequate social protection floors (SPFs)
  constitutes a critical priority, both for child labour elimination efforts and for
  broader poverty reduction and social development goals. The ILO Social
  Protection Floors Recommendation (No. 202) of 2012 provides a key framework
  for efforts in this regard. The Recommendation sets out that SPFs should
  contain basic social security guarantees that ensure that all in need can afford
  and have access to essential health care and have income security at least at a
  nationally defined minimum level over the life cycle.31
  64. A wide range of policy measures are relevant in this context, including
  conditional and unconditional cash transfers, public employment schemes,
  family allowances, school feeding schemes,              social health insurance,
  unemployment protection and old age pensions.32 The Cabo Verde Minimum
  Social Pension (Pensão Social Mínima) and Social Solidarity Pensions
  programmes, the Ghana Livelihood Empowerment against Poverty (LEAP)
  Programme,33 the Sierra Leone National Safety Net programme and Nigeria’s In
  Care of the Poor (COPE) programme are examples of cash transfer programmes
  being undertaken in ECOWAS region that offer a starting point for establishing
  basic SPFs. These efforts need to be systematically evaluated and their potential
  for broad-scale replication assessed.

  cash and health insurance to extremely poor households across Ghana to alleviate short-term poverty and encourage long
  term human capital development.



                                                                42
  65. Developing and strengthening community-based social safety mechanisms
  will also be important. Micro health insurance plans, community savings groups,
  and micro-credit initiatives, should be promoted and expanded in this context,
  again building on existing pilot initiatives, and targeting especially poorest
  households, agricultural households and other unserved groups. Small-scale
  mutual health organisations (MHOs) and community health organisation (CHOs)
  have been gaining momentum in this context in countries such as Benin, Ghana,
  Mali and Senegal as a means for communities to provide their own health
  insurance, although the coverage of these efforts remains low, especially among
  the poor who need them most.34
  66. Ensuring the social protection floors reach the specific groups of children
  most at risk of child labour generally, and of worst forms of child labour in
  particular, should be a particular priority. Especially vulnerable groups include
  children orphaned or affected by HIV/AIDS, other children without parental care,
  children from marginalised ethnic minorities and indigenous groups, children
  affected by migration and other socially- or economically-excluded persons. The
  special circumstances that make these groups more vulnerable to child labour
  need to be given particular attention in the design, implementation and
  monitoring of social protection schemes.

Awareness raising and social mobilisation, to build a broad-based
consensus for change to engage civil society and social partners in
achieving change.
  67. Awareness raising is needed as part of efforts to build a broad consensus for
  change. Child labour is a clear example in which both social norms and economic
  considerations are important, and strategic communication efforts need to be
  designed with this in mind. At present, public awareness of child labour issues in
  West Africa is low, particularly outside of urban areas. Households require
  information concerning the costs or dangers of child labour and benefits of
  schooling in order to make informed decisions on their children’s time
  allocation. Cultural attitudes and perceptions can also direct household decisions
  concerning children’s schooling and child labour, and therefore should also be
  targeted in strategic communication efforts. We saw earlier that perceptions of
  schooling as uninteresting or unimportant are common in many ECOWAS
  countries, and that some children in these countries are out of school because
  they are not permitted to attend, pointing to the need to address school quality
  concerns (see above) and public attitudes towards education.
  68. Communication efforts are needed at both national and local levels. A mix of
  conventional (e.g., radio, television and print media) as well as of non-
  conventional communication channels (e.g., religious leaders, school teachers,
  health care workers, chiefs and other opinion-formers) is important in order to
  achieve maximum outreach. Additional baseline information on local knowledge
  and cultural attitudes towards child labour is needed to tailor communication
  messages, and to evaluate changes in awareness and attitudes following
  communication activities. The urgent need to address worst forms of child
  labour, including child trafficking and child commercial sexual exploitation,
  should be a particular focus of communication efforts. The importance of birth

  registration is another important communication message. Providing
  information on national child labour legislation, presented in terms that are
  understandable to the populations and communities concerned, is a third
  communication priority.
  69. Achieving sustainable reductions in child labour requires social consensus
  well beyond the level of the household. Policy responses to child labour are also
  unlikely to be effective in the absence of the active participation of civil society
  and of social partners in implementing them. Similarly, laws to protect children
  from child labour are unlikely to be effective if they are not backed by broad
  social consensus. Building on efforts being undertaken with support from ILO-
  IPEC, UNICEF and other groups, religious organizations, educational institutions,
  teachers’ organisations, NGOs, the mass media, community-based organizations,
  trade unions, employers’ organizations and numerous other groups need to be
  actively engaged in the societal effort against child labour. Care providers in
  direct contact with children, including teachers and health workers, are in an
  especially good position to identify and refer child labourers, and therefore
  constitute particularly important allies in protecting children from child labour.
  Initiatives such as community-based child protection networks provide useful
  vehicles for bringing together a wide variety of stakeholders to combat child
  labour.

Expanding direct actions, to remove children from child labour, and in
particular from extreme forms of child labour, and support their
recovery and reintegration.
  70. Direct action is needed to remove children from child labour and provide
  them with the support and follow-up needed for their recovery and
  reintegration. Such action is relevant to child labourers generally, but is
  especially relevant in cases of trafficked children, children subjected to
  commercial sexual exploitation, and children facing hazard or exploitation in the
  workplace. While information on these worst forms is beyond the scope of the
  surveys used for this report, information from ILO SIMPOC studies and other
  sources suggest that they remain urgent policy concerns in the ECOWAS
  region.35 Further targeted research utilising specialised survey instruments is
  needed in order to generate more complete information on especially
  vulnerable groups of child labourers and to inform interventions aimed at
  addressing them.
  71. The effective identification and follow-up of worst forms of child labour
  depends, first and foremost, on mobilising and capacitating the local State and
  non-governmental actors and structures that operate closest to where these
  frequently-hidden forms of child labour occur. Examples in this context include
  teachers, local police officers, community-level child protection committees and
  community-based child labour monitoring systems for ensuring that individual
  cases are followed up with adequate social support. Follow-up actions ensuring

                that removed children are provided a full range of needed social services (e.g.,
                emergency shelter, needs assessment and referral, medical care, psycho-social
                counselling, legal support, family tracing and assessment, post reintegration
                follow-up, etc.) are also critical. Regulatory frameworks need to define minimum
                standards of care for former child labourers and other vulnerable children, and
                to specify the respective roles of the various State and private actors in meeting
                these care needs.

            Strengthening legislative and policy frameworks, as a foundation and
            guide for action against child labour.
                72. Achieving sustainable reductions in child labour requires a supportive policy
                and legislative environment which is in line with international standards and
                effectively mainstreamed into national development plans and programmes.
                This has the important effect of signalling national intent to eliminate child
                labour and providing a framework in which this can be achieved. All 15 ECOWAS
                countries have ratified ILO Convention No. 182 (Worst Forms) and all but Liberia
                have ratified Convention No. 138 (Minimum Age) (Table 15). All but Liberia36
                have also ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the
                Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography.

                73. As highlighted in the ECOWAS Regional Action Plan on Child Labour (RAP),37
                the critical next step on the legislative front is to ensure that these Conventions
                are effectively domesticated into national legislation. Domestication should
                include the elaboration of national lists of hazardous work that is prohibited for
                all persons below the age of 18 years.
                74. An adequate policy framework is necessary to guide the effective
                operationalisation of national legislation and broader efforts towards child
                labour elimination goals. The RAP in this context calls for the ECOWAS countries

  to develop National Action Plans for the elimination of the Worst Forms of Child
  Labour that fix “priorities for action, involving all government departments,
  social partners and stakeholders, and establish systems to implement it with
  sufficient budgetary provisions.” While the number of countries with National
  Action Plans is increasing, Table 15 shows that the ECOWAS region is still lagging
  in this regard; only seven of the 15 countries have national action plans adopted
  by ministerial councils.
  75. The effectiveness of legislation in protecting children from child labour also
  depends on the establishment of mechanisms for monitoring and enforcing
  laws, including provisions for inspections and for the removal child labourers to
  safe places (see also previous discussion on direct actions). Effective community
  based child labour monitoring systems (CLMS) are especially needed as a
  mechanism for identifying children who are involved or at risk of engaging in
  child labour, referring them to labour inspectorates and appropriate social
  services, and tracking them to ensure a positive outcome.
  76. Such monitoring systems are particularly beneficial in the agricultural and
  informal sectors – where the vast majority of child labour in West Africa is
  concentrated – in supporting State institutions in monitoring and follow up.
  School inspectors, school teachers and agriculture extension workers are among
  the groups that have important potential roles to play in addressing child labour
  in rural contexts within a broader community-based child labour monitoring
  system. A number of CLMS initiatives have been implemented on a limited scale
  with support from ILO-IPEC and other groups, offering a foundation of
  experience for expanded efforts in this area.

Building institutional capacity, to ensure that policy and legislative
frameworks are effectively operationalised.
  77. Strengthening institutional capacity at all levels of government is another
  important priority in the ECOWAS countries for continued progress towards
  child labour elimination goals. Institutions require strengthening in a number of
  areas, including using data for strategic planning, policy and programme design,
  programme monitoring and evaluation, and the mainstreaming of child labour in
  broader development plans, budgets and programmes.
  78. As child labour is a cross-sectoral issue, requiring close collaboration across a
  range of government bodies, the clear delineation of roles and the strengthening
  of coordination and information-sharing will be critical to the effective
  functioning of government institutions and their social partners in efforts
  combating child labour. Currently, assistance in the child labour field is often
  highly fragmented, with a large number of actors operating with little or no
  coordination or linkages. This leads to overlaps in assistance in some areas and
  to gaps in assistance in other priority areas.
  79. There is need for an integrated framework for intervention for a real impact.
  The National Action Plans (NAPs) called for in the Decent Work Agenda in Africa
  2007-2015 can play a particularly important role in this regard. The NAPs are
  comprehensive, tripartite, multi-sectoral, time-bound programmes for scaling up
  and accelerating action against child labour, with priority emphasis on its worst
  forms. NAPs are country-owned and country-led strategic frameworks
  addressing the root causes of child labour, based on broad mobilization of
  government departments, the social partners, civil society and local
  communities. They are designed to ensure that all major interventions essential



                                          46
  for addressing child labour are in place, but without unnecessary duplication.
  NAPs seek to capitalize on synergies between sectors and programme partners,
  strengthening existing interventions, if necessary, with new interventions
  developed essentially to fill identified policy and programme gaps or to add
  value to them.
  80. The National Action Plans are conceived as integral parts of broader national
  development programmes. It is particularly important that the NAPs are
  effectively linked to the development of broader national child protection
  systems, and that actions in the two areas are mutually reinforcing. Again,
  regional-level frameworks, including the Child Protection Monitoring and
  Evaluation Framework and the Regional Policy and Plan of Action for Child
  Protection and Child Trafficking, offer useful guidance in this regard.
  81. The NAPs require a coordination mechanism to ensure that identified actions
  are effectively implemented. The ECOWAS Regional Action Plan on Child Labour
  (RAP),38 in this context calls for the establishment of child labour units within an
  appropriate department of the national government, which would be a nodal
  point for all activities related to child labour in the concerned country. It also
  calls for the establishment of national steering committees to oversee broader
  monitoring and policy making on child labour issues in each ECOWAS country.

Improving the evidence base, to inform policy design and to ensure the
effective targeting of interventions.
  82. Effective and well-targeted responses to child labour demand a strong body
  of knowledge on the issue, including an understanding of how many child
  labourers there are, which sectors and geographical areas they work in, the
  demographic characteristics of the children involved, and the type of work that
  they carry out. Despite recent national household surveys in most of the
  ECOWAS countries, important information gaps remain in the area of child
  labour, affecting understanding of the phenomenon and the ability of policy-
  makers to address it. There is a general need in this context for regular systems
  for the collection, analysis and dissemination of child labour statistics, as well as
  more targeted research aimed at filling specific knowledge gaps.
  83. Research priorities include child labour in agriculture, in order to determine
  the specific agricultural sectors in which children work and the types of tasks
  which they carry out. While most children in employment are found in the
  agricultural sector, less is known about the characteristics of children’s
  agricultural work, its degree of hazardousness, or the extent to which it
  interferes with schooling. Worst forms of child labour constitutes another
  critical research priority. The worst forms of child labour are targeted for urgent
  elimination but the evidence base that is needed to achieve this goal is very
  weak across virtually all of the ECOWAS countries. Further, targeted research
  utilising specialised survey instruments is needed in order to generate more
  complete information on this highest-priority group of child labourers.
  Information on policy impact is a third area where more information is needed.
  While there has been a wide range of policy experimentation relating to child
  labour in the ECOWAS region, there remains very little robust evidence
  concerning the impact of these policy initiatives and their potential for
  replication on a broader scale.

84. The Regional Action Plan envisages the creation of a resource centre within
the ECOWAS Commission in support of efforts to improve the evidence base on
child labour. The resource centre would act as repository of data, bringing
together all information on the child labour situation in the ECOWAS countries in
one place. The centre would also coordinate with countries in identifying sectors
or subjects where studies should be conducted, commissioning studies,
identifying countries where national child labour surveys need to be conducted
and in disseminating research findings.

ANNEX 1. NEW GLOBAL ESTIMATES ON CHILD LABOUR FOR ECOWAS:
    TECHNICAL NOTE


                   A 1.       Measurement framework: Concepts and definitions

    The international standards define the target population for measuring child
    labour as “all persons in the age group from 5 to 17 years, where age is
    measured as the number of completed years at the child’s last birthday.”(para 9
    of the Resolution concerning Statistics of Child Labour).
    The measurement of child labour is schematically presented in the diagram
    below. It starts with the concept of children in productive activities: children, 5
    to 17 years old engaged in any activity falling with the general production
    boundary as defined by the System of National Accounts (SNA).39 Children in
    productive activities are then divided into those in employment and those in
    other productive activities.

    Child labour under the SNA production boundary is a subset of children in employment. It includes those in worst forms of
    child labour and children in employment below the minimum age. In fact, the ILO global estimation methodology was used
    to produce the new estimates on child labour for ECOWAS as follows.

                                                                52
      A 2.ILO Global estimation
For the purpose of global estimation, a specific sequential procedure for
measuring child labour has been adopted within the framework of the
international standards as schematically represented in the diagram below.
To maintain comparability with the earlier ILO global estimates, it was decided to
continue to measure child labour on the basis of the SNA production boundary,
and not on the general production boundary.
The starting point of the measurement of child labour for the purpose of global
estimation is therefore the population of children in employment. These are
children (5 to 17 years old) who were engaged in any economic activity during
the reference period of the survey, where economic activity includes essentially
all production of goods whether intended for sale on the market or not, and all
paid services.

Not all children in employment are considered as child labour. Among children in
employment, all engaged in designated hazardous industries are first sorted out.
Designated hazardous industries, referred to in paragraph 27 of the international
standards, are for the purpose of ILO global estimation the following two
branches of economic activity:40
            Mining and quarrying (ISIC Rev 3 codes 10-14)
            Construction (ISIC Rev 3 code 45)

Among the children engaged in other branches of economic activity, those
employed in designated hazardous occupations are then identified. Designated
hazardous occupations (paragraphs 25-26 of the international standards) are
defined for the purpose of global estimation by the following ISCO-88 codes:41

Next, among the children not engaged in either hazardous industries or
hazardous occupations, those who worked long hours during the reference week
are then sorted out. Long hours (paragraphs 28-29 of the international
standards) are defined for the present purpose as 43 or more hours of work
during the reference week. The 43-hour threshold was also used in earlier ILO


41ILO, International Standard Classification of Occupations, ISCO-88, http://laborsta.ilo.org. The occupational codes listed
here correspond to the hazardous occupations and processes found in national legislations reported in previous ILO Global
child labour trends. The correspondence table between ISCO-88 and the new occupational classification (ISCO-08) can be
found at the ILO website cited above. The present study uses the earlier version of the classification because essentially
most of country data available for the study were based on this earlier classification (ISCO-88).

global estimations. It corresponds to about the mid-point of normal hours of
work stipulated in national legislations, mostly in the range of 40 to 44.
The next step involves separating among the children not engaged in hazardous
industries or occupations, nor in long hours of work, those who were exposed
nevertheless to some hazardous work conditions not captured by the designated
hazardous industries or occupations, or by long hours of work.
In general, hazardous work conditions include night work and long hours of
work, exposure to physical, psychological or sexual abuse; work underground,
under water, at dangerous heights or in confined spaces; work with dangerous
machinery, equipment and tools, or which involves the manual handling or
transport of heavy loads; and work in an unhealthy environment which may, for
example, expose children to hazardous substances, agents or processes, or to
temperatures, noise levels, or vibrations damaging their health (paragraph 20 of
the international standard).42
As indicated in the diagram, the total of children in designated hazardous
industries, children in designated hazardous occupations, children with long
hours of work and children working in other hazardous work conditions make up
in aggregate the total number of children in hazardous work. For the purposes of
calculating the global and regional estimates, hazardous unpaid household
activities by children are excluded from the methodology.
The final estimate of child labour is then obtained by adding to the total number
of children in hazardous work, the number of other children aged 5 to 11 years
who were engaged in any economic activity during the reference period
(employment below minimum age), and the number of other children 12 to 14
years old who were engaged in an economic activity that could not be
considered as permissible light work during the reference period.
Permissible light work is defined in the present context as any non-hazardous
work by children (12 to 14 years) of less than 14 hours during the reference
week. The 14-hour threshold was also used in earlier ILO global estimations. The
choice was based on provisions in the ILO Convention, the Minimum Age (Non-
Industrial Employment) Convention, 1932 (No. 33), which sets two hours per
day, on either school days or holidays, as the maximum for light work from the
age of 12 years.43



      A 3.              National datasets
The ILO regional estimation of child labour for ECOWAS is based on the SIMPOC
assisted surveys on child labour and other data sources, such as the UNICEF’s
Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), certain national labour force surveys
and other relevant household surveys.




42 The measurement of children in these hazardous work conditions depends on the extent to which the appropriate
elements are covered by the national survey. Full comparability of national datasets has therefore not always been
possible in this respect.
43Article 3 (para. 1) of the Convention states that “Children over twelve years of age may, outside the hours fixed for
school attendance, be employed on light work (a) which is not harmful to their health or normal development; (b) which is
not such as to prejudice their attendance at school or their capacity to benefit from the instruction there given; and (c) the
duration of which does not exceed two hours per day on either school days or holidays, the total number of hours spent at
school and on light work in no case to exceed seven per day” (emphasis added).

           Coverage

In all, some 9 national datasets out of 15 countries have been compiled for the
ILO regional estimation of child labour for ECOWAS. The full list of the datasets is
given in Table A6 with information on the type of survey and its reference year.

           Full-sample

    The datasets of the 9 countries with available data are compiled as a group
and form the ‘full-sample’. The data are used to derive a direct estimate of child
labour for 2012 using the methodology described below. The available datasets
cover 72 million children 5-17 years old, corresponding to about 70% of the
regional population of children in that age group. The coverage rate is
significantly higher than the rate in the global estimation (53%).



     A 4.Harmonization of national datasets
The available national datasets for the regional estimation differ from each other
with respect to a number of critical elements. These are differences in types of
questions and response categories used in the survey questionnaire, and the
extent to which missing values are present in the raw data. For these reasons,
the national datasets need to be harmonized with respect to the key elements
before being processed further for regional estimation.
The first step in the harmonization process is the construction of a single
variable called Child Labour Status (CLS). The variable is composed of five
mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories into which each child must be
categorized. The structure of the child labour status variable is shown in Table
A5 below.
In practice because of missing values in the national datasets, the construction
of harmonized child labour status variables require imputation for missing
values.

Table A5. Child labour status: Structure of the harmonization variable CLS

1       Child labour, hazardous work                                         CLS = 1

2       Other child labour                                                   CLS = 2

3       Permissible light work                                               CLS = 3

4       Other employment, not child labour                                   CLS = 4

5       Not in employment                                                    CLS = 5

        Total number of children (5-17 years old)                            CLS = 1-5

        Children in employment                                               CLS = 1-4

        Child labour                                                         CLS = 1-2


The harmonization process consisted of imputing missing variables if the
national datasets did not include the relevant variable for assigning the children
in any of the CLS categories; and correcting for any missing values that may have




                                                      56
existed for some of the underlying variables used to classify children in one or
other CLS categories. The harmonization steps are in turn described below.



    A 5.Regional estimation of child labour for ECOWAS

The regional estimates of child labour are derived by extrapolations of national
data using a full sample estimation method. It consists of extrapolating the full
sample of harmonized national datasets to regional values by weighting each
country according to its relative share of children among the total in the region.
The weighting factors are calculated for each sex and each age group separately,
and are calibrated to conform to the 2012 UN population estimates and
projections which form the benchmark for all estimation procedures in this
report.

Specifically, the weight for a given country i, and specific sex and age categories,
j and k, with survey date t, is calculated as the product of three terms as follows.

w = w1 * w2 * w3

where

w1 = ( ∑i xijk2012 )/ n*xijk2012

w2 = xijk2012 / xijkt

w3 = xijkt / x’ijkt



where n is the number of countries covered by the full-sample for the region, ∑i
refers to the sum over all countries in the region, and xijkt denotes the number
of children in country i for sex and age categories j and k at time t according to
the UN population benchmark data, and x’ijkt the corresponding national survey
estimate.
In this system, w1 is the initial extrapolation factor, corresponding to the inverse
of the assumed probability of selection of the country, w2 is an adjustment for
the year of the national dataset in case it is different than 2012, and w3 is a
further adjustment for any difference between the estimate of the child
population for the given sex and age category against the UN benchmark
estimate and projection.
The adjustment factors w2 and w3 should generally be close to one. Any great
deviation from one would be an indication of a possible bias in the coverage or
the execution of the national survey, or an error in the UN benchmark data.
