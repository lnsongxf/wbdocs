2   IBRD MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: MARCH 31, 2016
I.       Overview
This document should be read together with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development’s (IBRD)
Financial Statements and Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015
(FY15). IBRD undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statements. Box 1 provides IBRD’s selected
financial data as of, and for the first nine months ended, March 31, 2016 and 2015, as well as for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2015.
Business Model
IBRD, an international organization owned by its 1891 member countries, is the largest Multilateral Development
Bank (MDB) in the world and is one of five institutions of the World Bank Group (WBG); the others are the
International Development Association (IDA), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the Multilateral
Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), and the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID).
Each of these organizations is legally and financially independent, with separate assets and liabilities. IBRD is not
liable for their respective obligations. The WBG’s two goals, to be achieved by 2030, are to end extreme poverty by
reducing the percentage of people living on less than $1.90 per day to no more than 3% globally, and to promote
shared prosperity in a sustainable manner by fostering income growth for the bottom 40% of the population in every
developing country. In October 2015, the WBG raised its extreme poverty line figure from $1.25 to $1.90 a day, to
reflect the increase in prices worldwide based on updated purchasing-power-parity data.
IBRD provides loans, guarantees, and knowledge for development focused projects and programs to middle-income
and creditworthy lower-income member countries. Its main business activity is extending long-term loans that can
have a final maturity of up to 35 years. Borrowers may customize their repayment terms to meet their debt
management or project needs. Loans are offered on both fixed and variable terms, and in multiple currencies; though
borrowers have generally preferred loans in U.S dollars and euros. IBRD also provides access to risk management
tools such as derivative instruments, including currency and interest rate swaps.
IBRD’s loans are financed through its equity, and from funds borrowed in the capital markets. IBRD is rated triple-
A by the major rating agencies and investors view its bonds as high quality securities. The annual funding volumes
vary from year to year. IBRD’s funding strategy is aimed at achieving the best long-term value on a sustainable
basis for its borrowing members. Its ability to intermediate the funds it raises in international capital markets for
developing member countries is important in helping it achieve its goals. IBRD issues its securities both through
global offerings and bond issues tailored to the needs of specific markets or investor types. This is done by offering
bonds to investors in various currencies, maturities, markets, and with fixed and variable terms, often opening up
new markets for international investors by offering new products or bonds in emerging-market currencies. This
strategy has enabled IBRD to borrow at favorable market terms and pass the savings on to its borrowing members.
Funds not immediately deployed for lending are held in IBRD’s investment portfolio to provide liquidity for its
operations.
Basis of Reporting
Financial Statements
IBRD’s financial statements conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(U.S. GAAP), referred to in this document as the “reported basis”. All instruments in the investment and borrowing
portfolios and all other derivatives are reported at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in the statement of
income. IBRD’s loans are reported at amortized cost, except for loans with embedded derivatives, which are
reported at fair value. Management uses the reported net income as the basis for deriving allocable income, as
discussed below.
Fair Value Results
In an attempt to address the asymmetry in the reported financial statements, in which not all financial instruments
are reported on the same measurement basis, IBRD reflects all financial instruments at fair value in Section III of the
MD&A. The fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market variables such as interest rates,
exchange rates, and credit risk. Management uses fair value to assess the performance of the investment-trading

portfolio; to manage certain market risks, including interest rate risk and commercial counterparty credit risk; and to
monitor the results of the Equity Management Framework (EMF).
Allocable Income
IBRD makes net income distributions based on allocable income, derived from its reported net income. The primary
differences between allocable income and reported net income are the unrealized gains/losses associated with its
non-trading portfolios, as well as the expenses associated with the Board of Governors-approved and other transfers,
which primarily relate to the allocation of the prior year’s net income.
IBRD makes extensive use of derivatives to manage its exposure to various market risks inherent in its trading and
non-trading portfolios. These derivatives are primarily used to economically align the interest rate and currency
bases of its assets and liabilities. U.S. GAAP requires that derivatives be carried at fair value with changes in mark-
to-market going through the income statement. Consequently, they introduce volatility in IBRD's reported net
income through the unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on these instruments.
In line with its financial risk management policies, IBRD intends to maintain its positions in the non-trading
portfolios. As a result, Management has consistently followed the practice of excluding unrealized mark-to-market
gains and losses on its non-trading portfolios to arrive at allocable income.

II.         Financial Performance and Risk Management
As part of IBRD’s lending, borrowing, and investment activities, IBRD is exposed to market, counterparty and
country credit risks. To manage these risks, IBRD has put in place a strong risk management framework, which
supports Management in its oversight functions. This framework is designed to enable and support IBRD in
achieving its goals in a financially sustainable manner.
Capital Adequacy
IBRD’s capital adequacy is the degree to which its equity is
                                                                           Figure 1: Equity-to-Loans Ratio Trend (%)

horizon.
At the beginning of the global financial crisis, the equity-to-
loans ratio stood at 38% as of June 30, 2008, significantly exceeding the then minimum of 23%. This allowed IBRD
to respond effectively to the borrowing needs of its member countries, resulting in the higher leveraging of its equity
and a corresponding decline in the ratio. Since 2008, IBRD’s portfolio credit quality has improved significantly, as a
result of which the capital adequacy framework was reviewed in FY14 and the minimum equity-to-loans ratio was
reduced to 20%.
The lowering of the minimum equity-to-loans ratio, together with the increase in paid-in capital from the General
Capital Increase (GCI) and Selective Capital Increase (SCI), has enabled IBRD to increase its lending capacity and
thereby support a larger volume of development lending.
As shown on Table 1, IBRD’s equity-to-loans ratio decreased from 25.1% at June 30, 2015 to 24.4% at March 31,
2016, while remaining above the minimum ratio of 20%. The decrease in the ratio was primarily due to the $9.8
billion of net positive loan disbursements, which included $2.5 billion of disbursements on Deferred Drawdown
Options (DDO’s). The decline in effective but undisbursed DDO’s of $2.5 billion, therefore did not have a net
impact on the total exposure.

    Other exposures include deferred drawdown options, irrevocable commitments, exposures to member countries’ derivatives, and
     guarantees.




4      IBRD MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: MARCH 31, 2016
Under its currency management policy, to minimize exchange rate risk in a multi-currency environment, IBRD
matches its borrowing obligations in any one currency (after derivative activities) with assets in the same currency.
In addition, IBRD’s policy is to minimize the exchange rate sensitivity of its capital adequacy as measured by the
equity-to-loans ratio. It implements this policy by periodically undertaking currency conversions to align the
currency composition of its equity with that of its outstanding loans, across major currencies. As a result, the impact
on IBRD’s equity-to-loans ratio from the exchange rate movements is negligible.

Financial Results
The primary sources of IBRD’s income are the equity contribution and the net interest margin on its loans funded by
borrowings. IBRD also earns revenue from other development activities, as well as the margin on its investment
portfolio.




                                              IBRD MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: MARCH 31, 2016 5
On a reported basis, IBRD had net income of $669 million for the first nine months of FY16, compared with a net
loss of $1,793 million during the same period in FY15. The net income during the first nine months of FY16
primarily relates to the unrealized mark-to-market gains experienced on the non-trading portfolios (See Table 2).
For the first nine months of FY16, IBRD’s allocable income was $255 million, compared with $528 million during
the same period in FY15. The lower allocable income was primarily due to the lower income from the equity
contribution and higher provision for losses on loans and other exposures, net, as compared to the same period in
FY15, as further discussed in this section.
The following is a discussion on the key drivers of IBRD’s financial performance, including a reconciliation
between IBRD’s reported net income and allocable income.

* Indicates amount less than $0.5 million

Unrealized mark-to-market gains/losses on non-trading portfolios
These mainly comprise unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on IBRD’s loan, borrowing, and EMF
portfolios. Since IBRD intends to maintain its positions in the non-trading portfolios, unrealized mark-to-market
gains and losses associated with these positions, are excluded from reported net income to arrive at allocable
income. As a result, from a long-term financial sustainability perspective, income allocations are made on the basis
of amounts which have been realized.
Loan Portfolio
On a reported basis, while the derivatives which convert IBRD’s loans to variable rates are reported at fair value, all
loans are reported at amortized cost, with the exception of one loan with an embedded derivative, which is reported
at fair value. As a result, while from an economic perspective, all of IBRD’s loans after the effect of derivatives
carry variable rates, and therefore have a low sensitivity to interest rates, this is not reflected in its reported net
income. In order to show the effect of its risk management policies, IBRD reflects its loans at fair value in the
MD&A. See Section III for more details.




6   IBRD MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: MARCH 31, 2016
Borrowing Portfolio
On a reported basis, all of the derivatives and the related underlying borrowings are at fair value, and therefore,
unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on the borrowing related derivatives are correspondingly offset by
unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on the underlying borrowings, with the exception of IBRD’s own credit.
Since IBRD does not hedge its own credit, the main component of the net unrealized mark-to-market gains and
losses relates to the impact of the change in IBRD’s own credit. See Section III for more details.
Equity Contribution and Equity Management Framework
Under its current interest rate risk management strategy, IBRD seeks to match the interest rate sensitivity of its
assets (loan and investment trading portfolios) with those of its liabilities (borrowing portfolio) by using derivatives,
such as interest rate swaps. These derivatives effectively convert IBRD’s financial assets and liabilities into
variable-rate instruments. Approximately 25% of IBRD’s net loans and other exposures are funded by equity, as
indicated by the equity-to-loans ratio of 24.4%. The interest revenue on the loans funded by equity, if left
unmanaged, would be highly sensitive to fluctuations in short-term interest rates. To manage this exposure, IBRD
uses the EMF, which allows the flexibility of managing the duration of IBRD’s equity within a range of zero to five
years based on market and macroeconomic conditions. It also allows IBRD to realize some of the unrealized mark-
to-market gains from the EMF positions
The regular interest revenue earned from the EMF and any gains which have been realized during the year as a
result of the termination of certain EMF positions, are included in allocable income. Additionally, equity
contribution includes revenue from the proportion of loans which are funded by equity and certain minor
adjustments including those relating to discontinued loan products.
For the first nine months of FY16, equity contribution was
$591 million compared with $824 million during the same             Figure 3: EMF Income
period in FY15 (See Figure 3). The main driver of equity            For the nine months ended March 31,
contribution is revenue from EMF. The interest revenue and          In millions of U.S. dollars
realized gains from EMF over the two periods are as follows:
       Interest revenue: For the first nine months of FY16,         Mar 16

        interest revenue from EMF was $526 million,                  Mar 15
        compared with $248 million during the same period
                                                                     Mar 14
        in FY15. The increase in interest revenue was due to
        the increase in the volume of EMF positions.                 Mar 13

       Realized Gains: For the first nine months of FY16,           Mar 12

        there were no realized gains from the terminations of                 0   200    400     600       800   1,000   1,200   1,400

        the same period in FY15.
As measured by duration, the interest rate sensitivity of IBRD’s equity was 4.6 years as of March 31, 2016 as
compared to 4.8 years as of June 30, 2015. Consistent with the decline in the U.S. interest rates, during the first nine
months of FY16, IBRD had unrealized mark-to-market gains of $1.1 billion from the EMF in its reported net
income, resulting in an increase in the market value of the EMF position to $2.0 billion as of March 31, 2016, from
$0.7 billion as of June 30, 2015.

Net Non-Interest Expenses
As shown on Table 3, IBRD’s net non-interest expenses primarily comprise administrative expenses, net of revenue
from externally funded activities. The allocation of administrative expenses between IBRD and IDA is based upon
an agreed cost sharing methodology which is driven by the relative level of lending activity between these two
institutions. The increase in administrative expenses during the period is in line with changes in the lending activity
of IBRD relative to IDA over the same period. This increase is partially offset by a decline in expenses relating to
grant making facilities during the period.
The staff costs and consultant and contractual services shown in the table below include costs related to IBRD
executed trust funds, which are recovered through reimbursable revenue – IBRD executed trust funds.

Net Other Income
Table 4 below provides details on the composition of net other income. The commitment fee income increased
during the first nine months of FY16 mainly due to the restoration of the 25 basis point commitment fee, which is
charged on undisbursed balances of new loans approved after September 30, 2014. The decrease in PEBP income is
due to negative investment returns experienced during the current period.

8   IBRD MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: MARCH 31, 2016
Balance Sheet Analysis
IBRD’s principal assets are its loans to member countries. These are financed by IBRD’s equity and proceeds of
borrowings from capital markets.

Loan portfolio
As part of its lending activities, consistent with its mandate, IBRD has exposure to sovereign (country) credit risk.
Country credit risk reflects potential losses arising from protracted arrears on payments from borrowers on loans and
other exposures. IBRD manages this risk by applying individual country exposure limits within an overall statutory
lending limit as prescribed in the Articles. These limits take into account the creditworthiness and performance of
borrowers. In addition, to ensure that the financial risks associated with its loans and other exposures do not exceed
its risk-bearing capacity, IBRD uses a strategic capital adequacy framework as a key medium-term capital planning
tool.
Lending Activities
As of March 31, 2016, IBRD’s net loans outstanding amounted to $165 billion, an         Figure 4: Net Loans
increase of $9.8 billion or 6.3% compared with June 30, 2015, mainly attributable       Outstanding
to $9.8 billion in net positive loan disbursements made in the first nine months of     In billions of U.S. dollars
FY16.                                                                                    200

In the first nine months of FY16, IBRD had new loan commitments totaling $23.8           150
billion, 24% higher than the same period in FY15 (Table 6). The increase in loan
                                                                                         100
commitments was primarily to the countries in the Latin America and the Caribbean
and the Middle East and North Africa regions.                                            50

Gross disbursements during the first nine months of FY16 were $16.9 billion, 15%          0
                                                                                               Jun 14   Jun 15   Mar 16
above the same period in FY15 (Table 7). The higher gross disbursement level in
FY16 is primarily due to higher disbursements to the countries in the East Asia and
Pacific and the Middle East and North Africa regions.

IBRD’s exposure to a single borrowing country is restricted to the lower of an Equitable Access Limit (EAL) and
the Single Borrower Limit (SBL). There are currently five countries subject to the SBL. The SBL effective on
March 31, 2016 was $20 billion for India and $19 billion for the other four SBL-eligible borrowing countries
(Brazil, China, Indonesia, and Mexico), lower than the EAL of $29 billion at March 31, 2016.
Exposure Exchange Agreement
Following approval by the Board, IBRD signed, together with the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the Inter‐
American Development Bank (IADB), an MDB EEA on December 15, 2015 (See Table 8).
Under the EEA, each MDB exchanges credit risk exposure of a reference portfolio supported by underlying loans to
borrowing member countries. For each MDB, EEAs, through diversification benefits, have the potential to help
reduce credit risk at the portfolio level; improve the risk-weighted capital ratios especially by addressing exposure
concentration concerns; and create lending headroom for individual borrowing countries where MDBs may be




10    IBRD MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: MARCH 31, 2016
constrained. These EEAs are treated as financial guarantees under U.S. GAAP. The EEA involves the receipt of
guarantee and the provision of guarantee for nonpayment in the reference portfolio by each MDB to the other. The
guarantee received and the guarantee provided are two separate transactions: (a) a receipt of an asset for the right to
be indemnified, and receive risk coverage (recoverable asset) and (b) the provision of a financial guarantee,
respectively (see Note D: Loans and Other Exposures to the Condensed Quarterly Financial Statements).

Provision on Loans and Other Exposures
IBRD records a provision to reflect the probable losses inherent in its loan portfolio and other exposures, including
guarantee provided under the MDB EEA. As of March 31, 2016, IBRD had an accumulated provision for losses on
loans and other exposures of $1,825 million, which was 1% of these exposures, ($1,593 million as of June 30, 2015
- 1% of exposures). The March 31, 2016 accumulated provision for losses on loans and other exposures excludes the
$51 million recoverable asset associated with the guarantee received under the MDB EEA. The recoverable asset is
included in other assets on the condensed quarterly balance sheet.
As of March 31, 2016, only 0.3% of IBRD’s loans were in nonaccrual status and were all related to Zimbabwe.
(Refer to Note D: Loans and Other Exposures in the Notes to the Condensed Quarterly Financial Statements).
For the first nine months of FY16, there was a net charge of provision for the losses on loan portfolio and other
exposure of $175 million. This amount includes $47 million of expense, offset by $51 million of income that related
to the guarantee provided and guarantee received under the MDB EEA transactions, respectively. The net charge
reflects an increase in net loan disbursements and the change in the credit quality of the loan portfolio during the
period. This compares with a charge of $65 million in the same period in FY15. The increase in provision for the
nine months of FY16, primarily reflects an increase in net loan disbursements during the period.
Interest Margin
As of March 31, 2016, IBRD’s equity to loans ratio was 24.4%, indicating that approximately 75% of IBRD’s loans
are funded by borrowings. For the first nine months of FY16, IBRD earned an interest margin3 of $673 million
compared to $632 million during the same period in FY15 (Table 2). The increase in income is primarily due to
higher net loans outstanding at March 31, 2016, consistent with the $9.8 billion net positive loan disbursements
made during the period. The portion of variable-spread loans is increasing driven by the preference of borrowers for
the lower rate variable-spread loans compared to the higher rate fixed-spread loans.
Investment Portfolio
Funds raised through IBRD’s borrowing activity which have not yet been deployed for lending, are held in IBRD’s
investment portfolio to ensure liquidity for its operations. IBRD restricts its liquid assets to high-quality investments
as its investment objective prioritizes principal protection over yield. Liquid assets are therefore managed
conservatively, and are primarily held for potential disruptions in IBRD’s access to capital markets.

FY16.
Commercial Counterparty Credit Risk
Commercial counterparty credit risk is managed by applying eligibility criteria, volume limits for transactions with
individual counterparties, and using mark-to-market collateral arrangements for swap transactions. The effective
management of this risk is vital to the success of IBRD’s funding, investment, and asset/liability management. The
monitoring and managing of this risk is continuous, given the changing market environment.
As a result of IBRD’s use of mark-to-market collateral arrangements for swap transactions, its residual commercial
counterparty credit risk is concentrated in the investment portfolio. As shown on Table 9, the credit quality of
IBRD’s portfolio remains concentrated in the upper end of the credit spectrum, with 68% of the portfolio rated AA
or above and the remaining portfolio primarily rated A. The A rated counterparties primarily consisted of financial
institutions (limited to short-term deposits and swaps) and sovereigns. Most of the BB or lower rated exposure
relates to IBRD’s investment in a debt security issued by the Hypo Alpe-Adria Bank.

12    IBRD MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: MARCH 31, 2016
In FY07, IBRD purchased for $190 million a debt security issued by an Austrian bank, Hypo Alpe-Adria, which was
fully guaranteed by the state of Carinthia. As of March 31, 2016, this debt security had a carrying value of $42
million. The loss in the value of the security was effected by the result of legislation passed in FY14 to cancel the
underlying debt and the related guarantee, as well as subsequent declines in the market value of assets held by
HETA ASSET RESOLUTION AG, the successor to Hypo Alpe-Adria. As a result of these factors, the investment
had a carrying value of $13 million as of June 30, 2015. In July 2015, the legislation at issue was ruled
unconstitutional and overturned by the Austrian Constitutional Court, and the security and the related guarantee
were reinstated. While the Court decision removed the legal impediment to recovery, the price of the security only
partially recovered, due to continuing concerns about the underlying asset value, resulting in unrealized mark-to-
market gains of $27 million during the first nine months ended March 31, 2016. IBRD will continue to monitor the
value of this investment and related market developments.
Investment Revenue
Investment revenue includes interest earned and mark-to-market gains and losses on the liquid asset portfolio, net of
funding costs. During the first nine months of FY16, investment revenue net of funding costs was $87 million,
compared to a loss of $4 million during the same period in FY15. The increase in investment revenue during FY16
was primarily due to lower unrealized mark-to-market losses on the portfolio, compared with FY15, primarily due to
the changes asset value related to HETA ASSET RESOLUTION AG. As discussed above, there were unrealized
mark-to-market gains of $27 million during the first nine months of FY16 compared with unrealized mark-to-market
losses of $54 million during the same period in FY15.

increase of $16.9 billion from June 30, 2015 (see Note E: Borrowings in the Notes        100

to the Condensed Quarterly Financial Statements). This increase was mainly due to         50
net new issuances of $16.8 billion to support the increase in loan disbursements.

III.     Summary of Fair Value Results
Fair Value Adjustments
An important element in achieving IBRD’s financial goals is its ability to minimize the cost of borrowing from
capital markets for lending to member countries by using financial instruments, including derivatives. The fair value
of these financial instruments is affected by changes in the market environment such as interest rates, exchange rates
and credit risk. Fair value is used mainly to assess the performance of the investment trading portfolio, to monitor
the results of the EMF, and to manage certain market risks, including interest rate and commercial credit risk for
derivative counterparties.
As shown in Table 10, on a fair value basis, if interest rates increased by one basis point, IBRD would experience a
net unrealized mark-to-market loss of approximately $25 million as of March 31, 2016.

Figure 8 provides a further breakdown of how the use of derivatives affects the overall sensitivity of the loan and
borrowing portfolios. For example, for the borrowing portfolio, a one basis point increase in interest rates would
result in net unrealized mark-to-market gains of $57 million on the bonds. These would be significantly offset by the
$53 million of net unrealized mark-to-market losses on the related swaps, resulting in net unrealized mark-to-market
gains of $4 million for the portfolio.

Effect of Interest and Credit
IBRD uses derivatives in its trading and non-trading portfolios to arrive at variable rate instruments, as part of its
risk management strategies. The sensitivity of these portfolios to interest rate movements, after the effect of
derivatives is therefore low, resulting in relatively small interest rate related unrealized mark-to-market gains/losses
in income (Figure 8).
For the first nine months of FY16, the unrealized mark-to-market gains on the EMF position of $1,137 million were
primarily due to the decrease in U.S. interest rates experienced during the first nine months of FY16.
For the first nine months of FY16, IBRD experienced $923 million of unrealized mark-to-market gains on the
borrowing portfolio, which is mainly comprised of $1.5 billion unrealized mark-to-market gains due to the widening




14    IBRD MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: MARCH 31, 2016
of IBRD’s credit spreads, partially offset by $0.6 billion of mark-to-market losses due to the decline in interest rates.
As shown on Table 10, the dollar value change corresponding to a one-basis-point upward parallel shift in interest
rates on IBRD’s own credit relative to LIBOR is about $57 million of unrealized mark-to-market gains.
For the first nine months of FY16, IBRD experienced $486 million of unrealized mark-to-market losses on the loans
portfolio, which is mainly comprised of $0.8 billion unrealized mark-to-market losses due to the widening of the
credit spreads for several of its borrowing member countries during the same period. As shown on Table 10, the
dollar value change corresponding to a one-basis-point upward parallel shift in CDS rates on the loan portfolio is
about $30 million of unrealized mark-to-market losses. See the June 30, 2015, MD&A for a detailed discussion on
how the credit risk of each portfolio is managed.
Fair Value Results
As non-financial assets and liabilities are not reflected at fair value, IBRD’s equity is not intended to reflect fair
value. Under the fair value basis, in addition to the instruments in the investment and borrowing portfolios, and all
other derivatives, loans are reported at fair value and all changes in AOCI are also included in fair value net income.
Tables 12-13 provide a reconciliation from the reported basis to the fair value basis for both the balance sheet and
income statement.

22      IBRD CONDENSED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: MARCH 31, 2016 (UNAUDITED)
NOTES TO CONDENSED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE A—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND RELATED POLICIES
Basis of Preparation
These unaudited condensed quarterly financial statements should be read in conjunction with the June 30, 2015,
audited financial statements and notes included therein. The condensed comparative information that has been
derived from the June 30, 2015, audited financial statements has not been audited. In the opinion of management,
the condensed quarterly financial statements reflect all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of IBRD’s
financial position and results of operations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (U.S. GAAP).
Management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed quarterly financial statements and the
reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in
making those estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. Areas in which significant estimates have
been made include, but are not limited to, the provision for losses on loans and other exposures, valuation of certain
instruments carried at fair value, and valuation of pension and other postretirement plan-related liabilities. The
results of operations for the first nine months of the current fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of results that
may be expected for the full year.
Certain reclassifications of the prior year’s information have been made to conform with the current year’s
presentation. In particular, the presentation for unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on the non-trading
portfolios and unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on the Investments-Trading portfolio on the Statement of
Income was changed to better reflect net interest revenue. These amounts were previously presented either as
separate lines within revenue and expenses related to individual portfolios (Loans, Borrowings, Equity management
and Other) or were included within revenues (Investments-Trading, net). As a result:
        On the Condensed Statement of Income, for the nine months ended March 31, 2015, revenue from Loans,
         net, Equity management, net and Other, net increased by $721 million, while expenses from Borrowings,
         net decreased by $307 million. This change was offset by Unrealized mark-to-market losses on non-trading
         portfolios of $1,028 million.
        Similarly, on the Condensed Statement of Income, for the nine months ended March 31, 2015, interest
         revenue from Investments-Trading, net increased by $139 million while the related unrealized mark-to-
         market losses increased by $139 million.
There was no net effect on net income (loss) for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2015 due to these
reclassifications.
Accounting and Reporting Developments
In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) became law. The Act
seeks to reform the U.S. financial regulatory system by introducing new regulators and extending regulation over
new markets, entities, and activities. The implementation of the Act is dependent on the development of various
rules to clarify and interpret its requirements. As the rules are being developed, IBRD continues to assess the impact
on its business. As of March 31, 2016, IBRD believes that the Act has not had any significant effect on its business.
In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of
the Effective Date. The ASU defers for one year the effective date of ASU 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with
Customers. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):
Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net). While the ASU clarifies the
implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations, it does not change the core principle of the
guidance in Topic 606. For IBRD, this ASU and ASU 2014-09 will be effective beginning from the quarter ending
September 30, 2018, with earlier application permitted. IBRD is currently evaluating the impact of these ASUs on
its financial statements.
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments—Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition
and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The ASU makes targeted amendments to existing
guidance on recognition and measurement of financial instruments that primarily affect the accounting for equity
investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for
financial instruments. The new guidance requires that changes in the fair value of financial liabilities measured
under the fair value option that are attributable to instrument-specific credit risk are recognized in Other
                  IBRD CONDENSED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: MARCH 31, 2016 (UNAUDITED)                          23
Comprehensive Income (OCI). For IBRD, the ASU will be effective from the quarter ending September 30, 2018.
Early adoption is permitted only for certain provisions. IBRD is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its
financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The ASU requires that a lessee recognizes on
the balance sheet the assets and liabilities that arise from all leases with a lease term of more than twelve
months. The recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows by the lessee will primarily
depend on the classification of the lease as finance or operating. The accounting applied by a lessor remains largely
unchanged from the current guidance, with some targeted improvements. For IBRD, the ASU will be effective from
the quarter ending September 30, 2019, with early adoption permitted. IBRD is currently evaluating the impact of
this ASU on its financial statements.

During the nine months ended March 31, 2016, there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2. As of June 30,
2015, $834 million of investments related to non-U.S. government obligations were transferred from Level 2 to
Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. This transfer was based on the outcome of the annual review of the inputs
used to measure fair value.
Valuation Methods and Assumptions
Summarized below are the techniques applied in determining the fair values of investments.
Investment securities
Investment securities are classified based on management’s intention on the date of purchase, their nature, and
IBRD’s policies governing the level and use of such investments. These securities are carried and reported at fair
value, or at face value or NAV, which approximates fair value. Where available, quoted market prices are used to
determine the fair value of trading securities. Examples include most government and agency securities, mutual
funds, futures contracts, exchange-traded equity securities and ABS and TBAs.

For instruments for which market quotations are not available, fair values are determined using model-based
valuation techniques, whether internally-generated or vendor-supplied, that include the standard discounted cash
flow method using market observable inputs such as yield curves, credit spreads, and constant prepayment rates.
Where applicable, unobservable inputs such as constant prepayment rates, probability of default and loss severity are
used. Unless quoted prices are available, time deposits are reported at face value which approximates fair value, as
they are short term in nature.
Securities purchased under resale agreements, Securities sold under repurchase agreements, and Securities lent
under securities lending agreements
These securities are of a short term nature and reported at face value which approximates fair value.
Commercial Credit Risk
For the purpose of risk management, IBRD is party to a variety of financial transactions, certain of which involve
elements of credit risk. Credit risk exposure represents the maximum potential loss due to possible non-performance
by obligors and counterparties under the terms of the contracts. For all securities, IBRD limits trading to a list of
authorized dealers and counterparties. In addition, IBRD receives collateral in connection with resale agreements as
well as swap agreements. This collateral serves to mitigate IBRD’s exposure to credit risk.
Swap Agreements: Credit risk is mitigated through the application of eligibility criteria and volume limits for
transactions with individual counterparties and through the use of mark-to-market collateral arrangements for swap
transactions. IBRD may require collateral in the form of cash or other approved liquid securities from individual
counterparties in order to mitigate its credit exposure.
IBRD has entered into master derivatives agreements which contain legally enforceable close-out netting provisions.
These agreements may further reduce the gross credit risk exposure related to the swaps. Credit risk with financial
assets subject to a master derivatives arrangement is further reduced under these agreements to the extent that
payments and receipts with the counterparty are netted at settlement. The reduction in exposure as a result of these
netting provisions can vary due to the impact of changes in market conditions on existing and new transactions. The
extent of the reduction in exposure may therefore change substantially within a short period of time following the
balance sheet date. For more information on netting and offsetting provisions see Note F—Derivative Instruments.
The following is a summary of the collateral received by IBRD in relation to swap transactions as of March 31, 2016
and June 30, 2015.

As of March 31, 2016, IBRD had received total cash collateral of $2,419 million ($2,729 million—June 30, 2015),
of which $1,507 million was invested in highly liquid instruments ($2,714 million—June 30, 2015).
Securities Lending: IBRD may engage in securities lending and repurchases, against adequate collateral, as well as
securities borrowing and reverse repurchases (resales) of government and agency obligations, and corporate and
ABS. These transactions have been conducted under legally enforceable master netting arrangements, which allow
IBRD to reduce its gross credit exposure related to these transactions. For balance sheet presentation purposes,
IBRD presents its securities lending and repurchases, as well as resales, on a gross basis. As of March 31, 2016,
amounts which could potentially be offset as a result of legally enforceable master netting arrangements were $517
million ($822 million—June 30, 2015).
Securities lending and repurchase agreements expose IBRD to several risks, including counterparty risk,
reinvestment risk, and risk of a collateral gap (increase or decrease in the fair value of collateral pledged). IBRD has
procedures in place to ensure that trading activity and balances under these agreements are below predefined
counterparty and maturity limits, and to actively manage net counterparty exposure, after collateral, through daily
mark-to-market. Whenever the collateral pledged by IBRD related to its borrowings under repurchase agreements
and securities lending agreements declines in value, the transaction is re-priced as appropriate by returning cash or
pledging additional collateral.

Transfers of securities by IBRD to counterparties are not accounted for as sales as the accounting criteria for the
treatment as a sale have not been met. Counterparties are permitted to repledge these securities until the repurchase
date.
At March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2015 there were no liabilities relating to securities transferred under repurchase or
securities lending agreements that had not settled at that date.
The following tables present the disaggregation of the gross obligation by class of collateral pledged and the
remaining contractual maturities for repurchase or securities lending agreements that are accounted for as secured
borrowings as of March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2015:

 repurchase or securities lending agreements


In the case of resale agreements, IBRD receives collateral in the form of liquid securities and is permitted to
repledge these securities. While these transactions are legally considered to be true purchases and sales, the
securities received are not recorded on IBRD’s Balance Sheet as the accounting criteria for treatment as a sale have
not been met. As of March 31, 2016, there were no securities purchased under resale agreements which had not
settled at that date ($252 million—June 30, 2015). For the remaining purchases, IBRD received securities with a fair
value of $2,096 million ($1,875 million—June 30, 2015). None of these securities had been transferred under
repurchase or security lending agreements as of that date (Nil—June 30, 2015).
NOTE D—LOANS AND OTHER EXPOSURES
IBRD’s loans and other exposures (exposures) are generally made to, or guaranteed by, member countries of IBRD.
In addition, IBRD may also make loans to the International Finance Corporation (IFC), an affiliated organization,
without any guarantee. Other exposures include: Deferred Drawdown Options (DDOs), Irrevocable Commitments,
Exposures to member Countries’ Derivatives, and Guarantees. IBRD’s loans are reported at amortized cost, with the
exception of one loan which is carried and reported at fair value, because it contains an embedded derivative.

IBRD uses derivatives to manage the currency risk as well as the repricing risk between its loans and borrowings.
For details regarding derivatives used in the loan portfolio, see Note F—Derivative Instruments.
Of the total loans outstanding as of March 31, 2016, 80% were to the Latin America and the Caribbean, Europe and
Central Asia, and East Asia and Pacific regions, combined.
As of March 31, 2016, only 0.3% of IBRD’s loans were in nonaccrual status and related to one borrower. The total
provision for losses on accrual and nonaccrual loans accounted for 1.0% of the total loan portfolio. Based on
IBRD’s internal credit quality indicators, the majority of loans outstanding are in the medium risk and high risk
classes.
Credit Quality of Sovereign Exposures
Based on an evaluation of IBRD’s exposures, management has determined that IBRD has one portfolio segment –
Sovereign Exposures. IBRD’s loans constitute the majority of the Sovereign Exposures.
IBRD’s country risk ratings are an assessment of its borrowers’ ability and willingness to repay IBRD on time and
in full. These ratings are internal credit quality indicators. Individual country risk ratings are derived on the basis of
both quantitative and qualitative analyses. The components considered in the analysis can be grouped broadly into
eight categories: political risk, external debt and liquidity, fiscal policy and public debt burden, balance of payments
risks, economic structure and growth prospects, monetary and exchange rate policy, financial sector risks, and
corporate sector debt and vulnerabilities. For the purpose of analyzing the risk characteristics of IBRD’s exposures,
these exposures are grouped into three classes in accordance with assigned borrower risk ratings which relate to the
likelihood of loss: Low, Medium and High risk classes, as well as exposures in nonaccrual status. IBRD considers
all exposures in nonaccrual status to be impaired.
IBRD’s borrowers’ country risk ratings are key determinants in the provision for losses. Country risk ratings are
determined in review meetings that take place several times a year. All countries are reviewed at least once a year,
or more frequently, if circumstances warrant, to determine the appropriate ratings.
IBRD considers loans to be past due when a borrower fails to make payment on any principal, interest or other
charges due to IBRD on the dates provided in the contractual loan agreement.

30        IBRD CONDENSED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: MARCH 31, 2016 (UNAUDITED)
Accumulated Provision for Losses on Loans and Other Exposures
Management determines the appropriate level of accumulated provision for losses, which reflects the probable losses
inherent in IBRD’s exposures. Probable losses comprise estimates of potential losses arising from default and
nonpayment of principal amounts due, as well as present value losses. Delays in receiving loan payments result in
present value losses to IBRD since it does not charge fees or additional interest on any overdue interest or charges.
These present value losses are equal to the difference between the present value of payments of interest and charges,
made according to the related instrument’s contractual terms and the present value of its expected future cash flows.
It is IBRD’s practice not to write off its loans. All contractual obligations associated with exposures in nonaccrual
status have eventually been cleared, thereby allowing borrowers to eventually emerge from nonaccrual status. To
date, no loans have been written off.
Notwithstanding IBRD’s historical experience, the risk of losses associated with nonpayment of principal amounts
due is included in the accumulated provision for losses on loans and other exposures.
Changes to the Accumulated provision for losses on loans and other exposures for the nine months ended March 31,
2016, and for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 are summarized below:

Guarantees
Guarantees of $5,287 million were outstanding as of March 31, 2016 ($1,432 million—June 30, 2015). This amount
represents the maximum potential amount of undiscounted future payments that IBRD could be required to make
under these guarantees, and is not included in the Condensed Balance Sheet. These guarantees have original
maturities ranging between 5 and 20 years, and expire in decreasing amounts through 2030.
As of March 31, 2016, liabilities related to IBRD's obligations under guarantees of $403 million ($42 million—June
30, 2015), have been included in Other liabilities on the Condensed Balance Sheet. These include the accumulated
provision for guarantee losses of $71 million ($17 million—June 30, 2015).
During the nine months ended March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015, no guarantees provided by IBRD were called.
On December 15, 2015, IBRD signed and executed two Exposure Exchange Agreements (EEA): one with the
African Development Bank (AfDB) for $1,588 million and the other with the Inter‐American Development Bank
(IADB) for $2,021 million. Under the EEA, each bank exchanges credit risk exposure of a portfolio supported by
underlying loans to borrowing member countries, by providing and receiving guarantees from each other, for the
amounts specified. The guarantee provided and the guarantee received are two separate transactions; namely (a) the
provision of a financial guarantee, and (b) the receipt of an asset, respectively. There was no exchange of cash
between the banks for these transactions.
For the guarantee provided under the EEA, IBRD records a liability equivalent to the fair value of the stand ready
obligation. This liability is included in Other liabilities on the Condensed Balance Sheet and is being amortized over
the life of the EEA. IBRD also records a liability, and corresponding expense, in recognition of the risk coverage

provided (provision). The value of this liability reflects the credit quality of the underlying portfolio and changes
over the life of the EEA as the credit quality of the underlying portfolio changes.
For the guarantee received under the EEA, IBRD records an asset equivalent to the fair value of the right to be
indemnified. This asset is included in Other assets on the Condensed Balance Sheet and is being amortized over the
life of the EEA. IBRD also records an asset, and corresponding income, in recognition of the risk coverage received
(recoverable asset). The value of this asset reflects the credit quality of the underlying portfolio and changes over the
life of the EEA contract as the credit quality of the underlying portfolio changes.
Information on the location and amounts associated with the EEA included in the Condensed Balance Sheet and
Condensed Statement of Income as of and for the nine months ended March 31, 2016, is presented in the following

Waivers of Loan Charges
IBRD provides waivers on eligible loans, which include a portion of interest on loans, a portion of the commitment
charge on undisbursed balances and a portion of the front-end fee charged on all eligible loans. Waivers are
approved annually by the Executive Directors of IBRD.
The reduction in net income for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015, resulting
from waivers of loan charges is summarized below:

Segment Reporting
Based on an evaluation of IBRD’s operations, management has determined that IBRD has only one reportable
segment since financial results are reviewed, and resource allocation decisions are made, at the entity level.
Loan revenue comprises interest, commitment fees, loan origination fees and prepayment premia, net of waivers.
For the nine months ended March 31, 2016, one country contributed in excess of 10 percent of total loan revenue;
this amounted to $200 million.

Fair Value Disclosures
The only loan carried at fair value is classified as Level 3. This loan has an embedded derivative and its fair value is
estimated on a matrix basis against the related bond. As IBRD’s loans are not traded, the yield which is used as a
key input to determining the fair value of this loan is not observable. The yield applied in determining the fair value
of the loan at March 31, 2016 was 4.7%. An increase (decrease) in the yield would result in a decrease (increase) in
the fair value of the loan.
The following table provides a summary of changes in the fair value of IBRD’s Level 3 loan during the three and
nine months ended March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015:

34        IBRD CONDENSED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: MARCH 31, 2016 (UNAUDITED)
Valuation Methods and Assumptions
All IBRD’s loans are made to, or guaranteed by, countries that are members of IBRD, except for those loans made
to IFC. IBRD does not currently sell its loans.
As of March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2015, except for one loan which is reported at fair value, all other loans are
carried at amortized cost. The fair value of these loans is calculated using a discounted cash flow method. This
method incorporates Credit Default Swap spreads for each borrower. Basis adjustments are applied to market
recovery levels to reflect IBRD’s recovery experience. IBRD’s loans, including the ones reported at fair value on a
recurring basis, are classified as Level 3, within the fair value hierarchy.

NOTE E—BORROWINGS
IBRD issues unsubordinated and unsecured fixed and variable rate debt in a variety of currencies. Some of these
debt instruments are callable. Variable rates may be based on, for example, exchange rates, interest rates or equity
indices.
Borrowings issued by IBRD are carried and reported at fair value. As of March 31, 2016, 99% of the instruments in
the portfolio were classified as Level 2, within the fair value hierarchy.
IBRD uses derivative contracts to manage the currency risk as well as the repricing risk between its loans and
borrowings. For details regarding the derivatives used in the borrowing portfolio, see Note F—Derivative
Instruments.

During the three and nine months ended March 31, 2016, IBRD’s credit spreads widened. For these periods, the
estimated financial effects on the fair value of the debt issued and outstanding were unrealized mark-to-market gains
of $542 million and $1,579 million, respectively.
During the three and nine months ended March 31, 2015, IBRD’s credit spreads tightened. For these periods, the
estimated financial effects on the fair value of the debt issued and outstanding were unrealized mark-to-market
losses of $80 million and $290 million, respectively. These amounts were determined using observable changes in
IBRD’s credit spreads.
IBRD’s Level 3 borrowings primarily relate to structured bonds. The fair value of these bonds is estimated using
valuation models that incorporate model parameters, observable market inputs, and unobservable inputs. The
significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of structured bonds are correlations and long-
dated interest rate volatilities. Generally, the movements in correlations are considered to be independent from the
movements in long-dated interest rate volatilities.
Correlation is the statistical measurement of the relationship between two variables. For contracts where the holder
benefits from the convergence of the underlying index prices (e.g. interest rates and foreign exchange rates), an
increase in correlation generally results in an increase in the fair value of the instrument. The magnitude and
direction of the fair value adjustment will depend on whether the holder is short or long the option.
36       IBRD CONDENSED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: MARCH 31, 2016 (UNAUDITED)
Interest rate volatility is the extent to which the level of interest rates change over time. For purchased options, an
increase in volatility will generally result in an increase in the fair value. In general, the volatility used to price the
option depends on the maturity of the underlying instrument and the option strike price. For IBRD, interest rate
volatilities are considered an unobservable input for maturities greater than ten years for certain currencies.
The following table provides a summary of the valuation technique applied in determining fair values of these Level
3 instruments and quantitative information regarding the significant unobservable inputs used.

Valuation Methods and Assumptions
Techniques applied in determining the fair values of debt instruments are summarized as follows:
Discount notes and vanilla bonds
Discount notes and vanilla bonds are valued using the standard discounted cash flow method which relies on market
observable inputs such as yield curves, foreign exchange rates, basis spreads and funding spreads, where available,
quoted marked prices are used to determine the fair value of short-term notes.
Structured bonds
Structured bonds issued by IBRD have coupon or repayment terms linked to the level or the performance of interest
rates, foreign exchange rates, equity indices or commodities. The fair value of the structured bonds is derived using
the discounted cash flow method based on estimated future pay-offs determined by applicable models and
computation of embedded optionality such as caps, floors and calls. A wide range of industry standard models such
as one factor Hull-White, LIBOR Market Model and Black-Scholes are used depending on the specific structure.
These models incorporate market observable inputs, such as yield curves, foreign exchange rates, basis spreads,

funding spreads, interest rates volatilities, equity index volatilities and equity indices. Where applicable, the models
also incorporate significant unobservable inputs such as correlations and long-dated interest rate volatilities.
NOTE F—DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

IBRD is not required to post collateral under its derivative agreements as long as it maintains a AAA credit rating.
The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk related contingent features that are in a liability
position on March 31, 2016 is $3,835 million ($4,230 million—June 30, 2015). IBRD has not posted any collateral
with these counterparties due to its AAA credit rating.
If the credit-risk related contingent features underlying these agreements were triggered to the extent that IBRD
would be required to post collateral on March 31, 2016, the amount of collateral that would need to be posted would
be $1,051 million ($1,709 million—June 30, 2015). Subsequent triggers of contingent features would require
posting of additional collateral, up to a maximum of $3,835 million ($4,230 million—June 30, 2015). In contrast,
IBRD received collateral totaling $3,504 million as of March 31, 2016 ($4,958 million—June 30, 2015), in relation
to swap transactions (see Note C—Investments).
The following table provides information on the location and amount of unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses

40        IBRD CONDENSED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: MARCH 31, 2016 (UNAUDITED)
Offsetting assets and liabilities
IBRD enters into International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) master netting agreements with
substantially all of its derivative counterparties. These legally enforceable master netting agreements give IBRD the
right to liquidate securities held as collateral and to offset receivables and payables with the same counterparty, in
the event of default by the counterparty.
The presentation of derivative instruments is consistent with the manner in which these instruments are settled.
Interest rate swaps are settled on a net basis, while currency swaps are settled on a gross basis.
The following table summarizes information on derivative assets and liabilities (before and after netting
adjustments) that are reflected on IBRD’s Condensed Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2015. Total
derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally
enforceable master netting agreements. The net derivative asset positions have been further reduced by the cash and
securities collateral received.

Transfers between level Level 3 and Level 2 are due to changes in price transparency.
The fair value of IBRD’s Level 3 borrowings related derivatives is estimated using valuation models that
incorporate model parameters, observable market inputs and unobservable inputs. The significant unobservable
inputs used in the fair value measurement of these derivatives are correlations and long dated interest rate
volatilities. See Note E—Borrowings for details on these unobservable inputs.
The following table provides a summary of the valuation technique applied in determining fair values of these Level
3 instruments and quantitative information regarding the significant unobservable inputs used.

Valuation Methods and Assumptions
Derivative contracts include currency forward contracts, TBAs, swaptions, exchange traded options and futures
contracts currency swaps and interest rate swaps. Currency swaps and interest rate swaps are either plain vanilla or
structured. Currency forward contracts and plain vanilla currency and interest rate swaps are valued using the
standard discounted cash flow methods using market observable inputs such as yield curves, foreign exchange rates,
basis spreads and funding spreads. For structured currency and interest rate swaps, which primarily consist of
callable swaps linked to interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity indices, valuation models and inputs
similar to the ones applicable to structured bonds valuation are used. Where applicable, the models also incorporate
significant unobservable inputs such as correlations and long-dated interest rate volatilities.

NOTE H—PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
IBRD, IFC and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) participate in a defined benefit Staff
Retirement Plan (SRP), a Retired Staff Benefits Plan (RSBP) and PEBP that cover substantially all of their staff
members.
All costs, assets and liabilities associated with these pension plans are allocated between IBRD, IFC and MIGA
based upon their employees’ respective participation in the plans. Costs allocated to IBRD are then shared between
IBRD and IDA based on an agreed cost sharing methodology. The net periodic pension cost for the SRP, RSBP and
PEBP is included in Pension expenses, in the Condensed Statement of Income.
The following table summarizes the benefit costs associated with the SRP, RSBP, and PEBP for IBRD and IDA for
the three and nine months ended March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015:

Loans and other exposures
IBRD has a Local Currency Loan Facility Agreement with IFC which is capped at $300 million. At March 31, 2016,
the loan balance under this facility amounted to $13 million ($17 million—June 30, 2015) and carried a fixed
interest rate of 3.96% and maturity of 0.7 year. This loan is not eligible for interest waivers.
IBRD has another facility with IFC under which IFC can borrow up to $197 million. At March 31, 2016, the balance
of this loan was $196 million ($196 million—June 30, 2015). This loan is at LIBOR less 25 basis points (0.50% as
of March 31, 2016) and is not eligible for interest waivers.
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, IBRD entered into an exposure exchange agreement with MIGA under
which IBRD and MIGA exchange selected exposures, with each divesting exposure in countries where their lending
capacities are limited, in return for exposure in countries where they have excess lending capacity. Under the
agreement, IBRD and MIGA have each exchanged $120 million of notional exposure as follows: MIGA assumes
IBRD's loan principal and interest exposure in exchange for IBRD's assumption of principal and interest exposure of
MIGA under its Non-Honoring of Sovereign Financial Obligation agreement. As of March 31, 2016, assets related
to IBRD’s right to be indemnified under this agreement amounted to $3 million ($3 million—June 30, 2015), while
liabilities related to IBRD’s obligation under this agreement amounted to $3 million ($3 million—June 30, 2015).
These include an accumulated provision for guarantee losses of less than $1 million (less than $1million—June 30,
2015).
Administrative Services
Expenses jointly incurred by IBRD and IDA are allocated based on an agreed cost sharing methodology, and
amounts are settled quarterly. For the three and nine months ended March 31, 2016, IBRD’s administrative expenses
are net of the share of expenses allocated to IDA of $336 million and $1,022 million, respectively ($369 million and
$1,139 million, respectively—three and nine months ended March 31, 2015).
Other Revenue
Revenue jointly earned by IBRD and IDA is allocated based on an agreed revenue sharing methodology. Amounts
are settled quarterly. For the three and nine months ended March 31, 2016, IBRD’s other revenue is net of revenue
allocated to IDA of $54 million and $155 million ($72 million and $188 million, respectively—three and nine
months ended March 31, 2015).
For the three and nine months ended March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015, the amount of fee revenue associated
with services provided to affiliated organizations is included in Revenue from externally funded activities on the
Condensed Statement of Income, as follows:

NOTE J—COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
Comprehensive income consists of net income and other gains and losses affecting equity that, under U.S. GAAP,
are excluded from net income. Comprehensive income (loss) comprises currency translation adjustments, the
cumulative effects of a change in accounting principle related to the implementation of guidance on FASB’s
derivatives and hedging, pension-related items, and net income. These items are presented in the Condensed
Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The following tables present the changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCL) balances for the nine
months ended March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015:

Valuation Methods and Assumptions
As of March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2015, IBRD had no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring
basis.
For valuation methods and assumptions as well as additional fair value disclosures regarding Investments, Loans,
Borrowings and Derivative assets and liabilities, refer to Note C—Investments, Note D—Loans, Note E—
Borrowings and Note F—Derivative Instruments, respectively.
Due from Banks: The carrying amount of unrestricted and restricted currencies is considered a reasonable estimate
of the fair value of these positions.
