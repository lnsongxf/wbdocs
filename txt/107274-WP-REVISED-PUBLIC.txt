Overview
About the Evaluation
Self-evaluation—the formal, written assessment of a project, program, or policy by an
entity engaged in that activity—lies at the heart of the World Bank Group’s results
measurement system and has been used to assess the outcomes of investments for 40
years. This evaluation seeks to assess how well the World Bank Group’s self-evaluation
systems serve their expected purposes.
The Bank Group’s self-evaluation systems cover most operational activities and include
the:
      ICR (Implementation Completion and Results Report) for Bank lending at closing
      ISR (Implementation Status and Results Report) for Bank lending in
       implementation
      Country Partnership Framework Completion and Learning Reviews for country
       programs
      XPSR (Expanded Project Supervision Report) for IFC investments
      PCRs (Project Completion Reports) for IFC advisory projects
      PERs (Project Evaluation Reports) for MIGA guarantee projects
These systems should be able to support:
      Performance management via data for evidence-based decision-making about
       projects, portfolios, policies, and strategies
      Reporting on project and portfolio results to support internal and external
       accountability
      Learning that leads to enhanced operational quality
Evaluation systems can be understood and analyzed at various levels; three levels are
considered in this report:
      Templates and guidelines
      Business processes and data streams
Behaviors influenced by motivations that are both extrinsic (incentives) and intrinsic
(norms and values) as well as organizational culture. The report also examines the
interfaces between self-evaluation and the Independent Evaluation Group’s (IEG)
validation and evaluation functions, recognizing that these influence behaviors.
The evaluation aims to support ongoing efforts to enhance effectiveness, promote
learning, foster the move toward a “Solutions Bank,” and simplify processes. It
complements and builds on other IEG reports, most notably Learning and Results in World
Bank Operations: How the World Bank’s Learns and Learning and Results in World Bank
Operations: Toward a New Learning Strategy.

OVERVIEW


Main Findings
The World Bank Group’s self-evaluation systems have expanded since they started
40 years ago, and compliance with requirements is mostly strong. The systems mesh
well with the independent evaluation systems for which they provide information
and the systems have been emulated and adapted by other development agencies.

However, the self-evaluation systems primarily focus on results reporting and
accountability needs and do not provide the information necessary to help the
World Bank Group transform into a “Solutions Bank” or develop learning to
enhance performance as emphasized in its 2013 strategy. Information generated
through the systems is not regularly mined for knowledge and learning except by
IEG, and its use for project and portfolio performance management can be
improved. The systems produce corporate results measures but need to produce
value to staff and line management and to the primary beneficiaries of the
“Solutions Bank”—client governments, implementing agencies, firms, and
beneficiaries and citizens.


Performance Management through Self-Evaluation
Bank management has put processes in place to monitor and manage operational
quality and portfolio performance using a comprehensive system of cascading
indicators, some of which draw on information from Implementation Status and
Results Reports (ISRs) and Implementation Completion and Results Reports (ICRs).
The information produced by this system is used in regular processes for
performance management. Thus, management has access to, and makes use of, data
that can track performance, identify problem areas, and foster corrective action.

The Bank’s performance management system, built around the ISR, serves its
purpose but can be used better. When the ISR works as intended, warning flags are
raised at the right time, and teams and managers act on these flags, problem projects
can be turned around and deliver results. Yet ISR ratings and indicators derived
from them are not always precise because of weak project monitoring and optimistic
reporting. The ISR would be more effective for early warning if team leaders had
incentives to proactively acknowledge issues and raise risk flags. Better early
warning needs to be combined with timely action. Many mid-term reviews occur
late, as does remedial action to address identified problems because Bank and client
procedures complicate and delay restructuring of Bank projects. The Bank may want
to move toward more adaptive project management in which course corrections
occur as frequently as needed, informed by relevant and timely monitoring data.

 Evaluation Scope and Evidence Base
 The report covers self-evaluation of World Bank operations (investments, policy-based
 support, knowledge and advisory services, impact evaluations, trust funds, and
 partnerships); International Finance Corporation (IFC) investment and advisory services;
 country programs; and, very selectively, Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency
 (MIGA) guarantees.
 The evaluation relies on diverse data sources and methodological approaches geared to
 assess complex systems. Data collection and analyses aimed to generate perspectives on
 the architecture and history of the systems, review specific constituent parts, and analyze
 behaviors, motivations, and incentives.
 The team conducted semi-structured interviews with 110 Bank Group managers and staff,
 and 14 interviews with staff in partner agencies. Focus group discussions and game-
 enabled workshops also provided data for the evaluation. A number of background
 studies, including quantitative and content analyses of project performance data, a review
 of academic and evaluation literature, and institutional benchmarking, formed the
 backbone of the analysis.


The incentives in the World Bank’s and IFC need to shift so as to reward teams for
good M&E and identification and fixing of problems rather than pressuring teams
on rates of disconnect and other quantitatively tracked indicators.


Verifying Results and Promoting Accountability
Thanks to self-evaluation frameworks and data, the World Bank Group is able to
produce holistic and high-level corporate results reporting to the Board and
externally that are easy to compare across time, contexts, and sectors. The design
and operation of the systems adhere to relevant good practice standards, coverage is
comprehensive, and many evaluation experts consider the World Bank Group’s
systems to be as good as or better than those in comparable organizations.

Shortcomings remain in the project M&E systems that generate results evidence
despite various initiatives to strengthen M&E and results orientation. For example,
inadequate evidence on results is a factor in 70 percent of all downgrades, implying
that, for some projects, weak M&E affects the degree to which ratings are an
accurate measure of results.

Self-evaluation frameworks direct attention to impacts on citizens, but their
implementation often results in mechanical tracking of citizen “participation” and
gender “flags” but not of broader social outcomes and beneficiaries’ voices.

OVERVIEW


IFC has sought to reform and reduce the scope of its results measurement and self-
evaluation. Some stakeholders perceived a risk of erosion of the accountability
function under the proposed reforms and arbitrating between different positions
proved difficult in the absence of a policy or other guiding principles. There has
been only limited progress toward systems that better meet learning and business
needs yet maintain a credible level of accountability and the tone at the top of the
institution has not been supportive of self-evaluation.


Learning from Self-Evaluation
Having all operational units write substantive end-of-project reports is a noteworthy
accomplishment that not many other organizations afford themselves, opening a
vast potential for individual and organizational learning. In practice, however,
knowledge from the World Bank Group systems is rarely valued or used and there
is little effort to extract and synthesize evidence and lessons or to inform operations.
Staff are more likely to rely on tacit knowledge than on written information from the
self-evaluation systems. There is some individual learning but few benefits of this
learning accrue beyond the authors and, hence, the potential of the systems for
organizational learning is unfulfilled.

Learning has taken a backseat to accountability. The systems’ focus on
accountability drives the shape, scope, timing, and content of reporting and limit the
usefulness of the exercise for learning. If the self-evaluation systems had been set up
to primarily serve learning, they would have been more forward-looking (how can
we do better?), more selective (which projects offer the greatest learning
opportunities?), more programmatic (are there synergies across activities and
countries?), attuned to unintended positive and negative consequences, and more
often done in real-time.

Support and guidance on writing and learning lessons is missing. Lessons are
recorded but rarely used and too often of low quality: many of them are too generic,
not sufficiently based in evidence, fail to recommend what specifically should be
done differently in the future, or fail to address critical internal organizational
issues. In the World Bank Group’s face-to-face culture, dialogue formats would
likely help staff explore key findings and lessons and spur more learning.

Parts of the system not focused on corporate reporting, such as impact evaluations
and other voluntary self-evaluations, are more valued by respondents. Impact
evaluations are optional, seen as technically credible, invest in monitoring, are
undertaken when there is a specific interest in learning, and regarded as a valuable

tool to increase development effectiveness. Thus, when conditions are right, the
World Bank Group has strong demand for evaluative learning and a robust ability
to supply it.


Unleashing the Potential of Self-Evaluation
The main reasons for the observed shortcomings lie in incentives and behaviors
rather than templates and processes. Incentives created inside and outside systems,
including through ratings and validation processes, are not conducive to conducting
high-quality self-evaluation and most staff do not view the self-evaluation systems
as a source of timely, credible, and comprehensive information. Staff engage with
the systems with a compliance mindset where candor and thoughtful analysis of
drivers of results and failures suffer.

The external panel review of IEG, which also reflected on larger systems beyond
IEG’s control, concluded “the current overall system and processes are broken….
Learning is not prioritized, accountability is mechanical and does not support
necessary learning or continuous improvement…. Improving the self-evaluation
system is key for the success of [Bank Group’s] new strategy and for strengthening
the basis for IEG’s validation and review...” IEG has worked collaboratively with
management in designing and operating the systems and must therefore share in the
responsibility for the state of affairs.

This evaluation identifies three broad causes of misaligned incentives for writing
and using self-evaluations: excessive focus on ratings, attention to volume that
overshadows attention to results, and low perceived value of the knowledge
created. The evaluation proposes five recommendations to address these issues.


First Loop: Excessive Focus on Ratings
The planned reform of the ICR process, template, and guidelines is an opportunity
to correct the incentives and signals surrounding self-evaluation, building on the
heightened attention that management has started to pay to results frameworks.
Staff perceive that the prevailing interpretation of the IEG/OPSC harmonized
objectives-based approach to rating and validating ICRs limits the appetite for
innovation and causes inflexibility for project management. Adaptability can be
promoted through increased flexibility in project design that minimizes the need to
amend legal agreements as well as through simplified Bank and client restructuring
procedures. There is a need to promote more constructive interactions between IEG
and operational departments over project validations without losing sight of IEG’s

accountability function. Something that would help with this would be a mechanism
to flag up when unsuccessful outcomes are caused by major shocks outside the
control of the World Bank’s such as, for example, disasters, conflict, or economic
crises. The harmonized ICR rating and validation guidelines give insufficient
attention to beneficiaries’ views and to unintended positive and negative
consequences.

Recommendation 1: Reform the ICR system and its validation to make it more
compatible with innovation and course corrections. As the report explains, project
teams should be able to change course faster and more often. The ICR system should
better account for unintended positive and negative outcomes, beneficiaries'
perspectives, and unforeseeable shocks in how results are measured and projects are
rated (applies to the World Bank and to IEG’s role in validation).

Measuring and rating project outcomes at closing against objectives stated at design
years earlier has become a source of tension and perceived rigidity, given the quality
assurance of results frameworks at the time of project design is insufficient and that
the options of restructuring and adaptive project management have not taken root.

Recommendation 2: Help staff understand that project objectives pertaining to
innovating, piloting, and testing are feasible and that projects with such
objectives are rated appropriately, provided the project development objective
and indicators are set in the right way (applies to World Bank and IFC with
implications for IEG).


Second Loop: Attention to Volume Sometimes Overshadows Results
Demand from the World Bank Group Board and management for knowledge and
evidence to enhance development effectiveness has not been matched by a corporate
learning culture. Managerial signals emphasize business volume more than they do
results, performance, and good self-evaluation; tensions over ratings and
disconnects distract from learning; and there is room to more consistently infuse
existing learning, strategic, and planning processes with evaluative evidence. The
Board has a role also to reinforce these signals.

Recommendation 3: Strengthen rewards and leadership signals at all levels of the
organization to reinforce the importance of self-evaluation. For example, this can
be done by promoting use of the knowledge generated from self-evaluations by
teams, practices, and senior management, and by balancing the current excessive
focus on outcome ratings and disconnects with more deliberative use of monitoring

and self-evaluation information by teams and managers (applies to World Bank and
IFC).

Identification of problems and solutions could be strengthened by having more
reliable monitoring data and using that data more consistently in safe space
deliberative meetings aimed at identifying and discussing problems. The M&E
systems that generate the underlying evidence for results have long-standing
shortcomings, despite various initiatives to strengthen M&E and results orientation.
Strengthening M&E is especially important for projects with new or innovative
designs and will also require building client M&E capacity in collaboration with
partners.

Recommendation 4: Formulate a more systematic approach to improving M&E
quality. As the report explains, this would entail building staff and clients’ M&E
capacity, demonstrating to clients the value of M&E, and provisioning of specialized
M&E skills at key moments of the project cycle for targeted projects (applies to the
World Bank and IFC).


Third Loop: The Perceived Value of Knowledge from Self-Evaluation Is Low
Corporate requirements specify the scope, timing, and content of self-evaluations in
a way that supports reporting more than it does learning. For example, most self-
evaluations continue to be project-specific, with similar approach and depth,
regardless of the learning potential. Mandatory and voluntary self-evaluations are
not used strategically to meet knowledge gaps and approaches to using them for
lesson learning are fragmented, further fueling staff perceptions of low importance.
There is scope to strengthen Bank-wide oversight and the regional and thematic
selectivity of impact evaluations, the uptake of findings from impact evaluations,
and the use of information systems for capturing, classification, and availability of
Bank Group mandatory and voluntary self-evaluations. IFC lacks a framework for
capturing and acting on evaluative lessons.

Recommendation 5: Expand voluntary evaluations that respond to learning needs
of management and teams. These include impact and process evaluations,
retrospectives, and beneficiary surveys and need not be project-specific but can
cover multiple interventions in a given sector, country, or region, depending on
learning needs. Building on recent progress, further enhance the manner in which
impact evaluations respond to learning needs through greater regional and thematic
selectivity and enhance the uptake of findings from impact evaluations. Ensure that

Management Response
Management of the World Bank Group institutions welcomes the Independent
Evaluation Group (IEG) report, Behind the Mirror: A Report on Self-Evaluation Systems
of the World Bank Group, and the opportunity to respond with comments. The report
presents an extensive description of the evolution and structure of self-evaluation
systems in the World Bank Group. While the analyses are primarily focused on
selected major self-evaluation tools, the report provides an informative diagnostic of
the challenges related to learning from the use of self-evaluation metrics.

Management would like to recognize IEG’s responsiveness to the comments it made
during the December 2015 ReACT workshops on the draft report. The workshops
proved to be a rich experience and a valuable way for IEG, Operations Policy and
Country Services (OPCS), International Finance Corporation (IFC), Multilateral
Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), Global Practices, and Regions to deepen
their dialogue on self-evaluation systems. Management also appreciates IEG’s
consideration of the comments from the World Bank, IFC, and MIGA in finalizing
the report.

Management appreciates IEG’s recognition that the World Bank Group institutions
have comprehensive self-evaluation systems that “adhere to relevant good practice
standards,” are regarded “as good as or better than those in comparable
organizations,” and are “emulated and adapted by other development agencies.”
Management agrees with many of the report’s observations and the directions
suggested by the recommendations.


World Bank Management Comments
GENERAL COMMENTS

Learning versus accountability. The report highlights the tension inherent in using
one instrument for both accountability and learning, and notes that the current
system focuses more on meeting accountability needs and less on learning. Both
objectives are equally important for the institutions and need to be pursued. While
there may be room for more balanced achievement of both objectives, it may not be
feasible or realistic to expect one instrument to equally serve all the objectives (e.g.,
accountability, performance management, and learning). The Implementation
Completion and Results Reports (ICRs) serve a critical accountability function that
cannot easily be replaced by other tools. The effectiveness of the projects against


                                                                                       xvii
MANAGEMENT RESPONSE


what was intended is self-evaluated by staff and validated by IEG, and the ratings
are closely monitored by Management, reported to the Board, and shared with the
public. This function of the ICRs is critical, but at times it is in conflict with the
learning objective. While learning can be enhanced through the ICRs, it can also be
accomplished with other activities. Hence, in reforming the ICR approach,
Management will explore ways to maximize learning while maintaining the
accountability function.

IEG’s influence on self-evaluations. The report rightly points out the critical roles of
incentives and behaviors in the use of self-evaluation tools for learning, but IEG’s
role in and influence over such incentives and behaviors cannot be understated. The
report acknowledges that IEG is a stakeholder in the World Bank Group’s self-
evaluation process and notes how it has managed this potential “conflict of interest”
(p. 13). However, IEG’s influence over self-evaluations goes beyond such a conflict
of interest. The validation process itself significantly influences behaviors and
incentives and affects the content, candor, and usefulness of self-evaluations.
Despite the effort to harmonize the methodologies for ICRs and Completion and
Learning Reviews (CLRs) with IEG validations of their ratings, there is always room
for judgement and interpretations, so that Management and IEG occasionally agree
to disagree on final ratings (normally resulting in downgrading). This in turn affects
the behaviors and perceptions of staff and managers toward the self-evaluation
system. In our effort to reform the ICR and strengthen learning from evaluations, we
look forward to working closely with IEG in also taking a look at IEG’s validation
methodology and its application in practice.

Other processes that promote learning. The report positively acknowledges some of
the best-practice learning from self-evaluation practices, such as the “boot camp”
organized by the Governance Global Practice for in-depth reviews of ICRs, the use
of deliberative meetings to reflect on experiences in public-private partnerships, and
MIGA seminars to present project self-evaluations to MIGA staff. However, the
report notes that only IEG systematically mines the information generated by
current systems for learning, and that corporate results reporting for accountability
has sidelined use of these systems for other purposes. The report does not
sufficiently take into account other processes that promote learning such as reviews
at various stages of project preparation including Quality Enhancement Reviews
and peer reviews. Various portfolio reviews at the country, Regional, Global
Practice, or corporate levels often involve reviews of ICRs to extract lessons.
Additionally, Management is expanding resources and tools for staff to enhance
learning from operations, for example, in-depth case studies on adaptive
implementation, and an evidence-based system called Delivery Challenges in
Operations for Development Effectiveness that leverages data from ICRs to help

teams make better informed decisions. For implementation support, the report
focuses only on the Implementation Status and Results Report (ISR), which is the
main instrument for standardized reporting and is used primarily for monitoring
and accountability purposes rather than learning. It does not take into account the
opportunity for learning embedded in other complementary tools such as the aide-
mémoire and back-to-office reports, and the deliberations that go on along with
implementation support.

COMMENTS ON RECOMMENDATIONS
Management welcomes the report’s approach in formulating a limited number of
focused, directional recommendations, with specific actions listed as possible
options or suggestions for Management’s consideration. Since the report covers one
of the World Bank Group’s core processes as well as broader monitoring and
evaluation (M&E) systems and incentive mechanisms, any effort to make substantial
improvements will require long-term commitment and phased implementation. In
that regard, Management and IEG have discussed taking a more flexible approach in
defining and implementing a Management Action Record action plan for this
evaluation. This approach will be proposed as one of the pilots to be implemented as
a follow-up to the IEG’s External Panel Review recommendations.

Recommendation 1: Reform the ICR system and its validation to make it more
compatible with innovation and course corrections. Management welcomes this
recommendation and the inclusion of IEG’s validation as part of the reform process.
The ICR reform is an opportunity to improve this important self-evaluation tool and
enhance its role in learning. Management has already initiated the process, aiming to
make the evaluation approach clearer and more straightforward, with a simpler
format and stronger results focus. It will provide strengthened guidance on better
capturing relevant lessons learned and more effectively evaluating pilots and
innovative projects. OPCS is planning to hold extensive consultations with the
World Bank’s operational staff and IEG to address the weaknesses identified in the
report and to better balance the ICR’s learning and accountability aspects. Since the
evaluation methodologies for the ICR and IEG’s validation are closely linked,
Management looks forward to working with IEG in reviewing and further
harmonizing the evaluation approach and guidelines.

Recommendation 2: Help staff understand that project objectives pertaining to
innovating, piloting, and testing are feasible and that projects with such
objectives are rated appropriately, provided the project development objective
and indicators are set in the right way. Management supports this recommendation
and agrees with a need to promote a flexible and more “adaptive project
management” approach in which course corrections occur as frequently as needed.


                                                                                  xix
MANAGEMENT RESPONSE


In recent years Management has made substantial changes to its restructuring
requirements to simplify the restructuring process. While the current policy
framework permits flexible project designs, including piloting and innovative
approaches, the rigid interpretation and application of the objective-based
evaluation approach have not been conducive to innovation or risk-taking.
Management will explore ways to make this approach more common and practical.
There is also a need to revisit the way the “success” of a project is defined for certain
projects and to encourage project designs that would allow continuous adaptation
without a need for restructuring. The projects pertaining to learning, innovations,
and piloting may have different objectives that do not align with the current
guidelines on what a project development objective should be for an investment
project financing operation. In reforming the ICR, Management will discuss ways to
tailor the evaluation of such projects—for instance, by emphasizing the validity and
relevance of lessons learned from the pilot rather than the measurable outcomes that
the pilot had intended to achieve.

Recommendation 3: Strengthen rewards and leadership signals at all levels of the
organization to reinforce the importance of self-evaluation. The report rightly
indicates that a less-than-optimal use of knowledge and learning can result from
institutional incentives and behaviors—for example, explicit or implicit signaling
that affects incentives and institutional culture, such as a focus on business volume
rather than on results and learning. Management will explore ways to rebalance the
messaging and signals that cascade down to operational staff (e.g., through
corporate review meetings and annual Memoranda of Understanding for
performance monitoring) to strengthen the institutional focus on results as well as
learning and adaptation throughout the project cycle. Such signaling should also
promote greater openness to discussing operations’ failures and shortcomings, and
should encourage using such learning to maximize development effectiveness.

Recommendation 4: Formulate a more systematic approach to improving M&E
quality. Management is committed to continue improving the quality of M&E and
agrees with a need for a more systematic approach to strengthening M&E and
results orientation. Over the past two years considerable effort has been made to
build M&E capacity.

        Since the responsibility of all operational learning was consolidated in OPCS
         in July 2015, the delivery of M&E training has been made regular and
         systematic. During FY16, a three-day module “Results Demystified” has
         been offered three times to staff members and delivered on demand to five
         country teams and government counterparts, reaching approximately 180
         staff members and clients. An M&E module was also added to the GA–GD

        Advanced Operations training, reaching 20 staff. The results and M&E
        modules of the Investment Project Financing Operational Core Curriculum
        Academy have been updated.
       Over 180 staff are now members of the Results Measurement and Evidence
        Stream (RMES), organized to cultivate a core group of staff with appropriate
        technical skills. Led by several World Bank Group-wide task forces of RMES
        members, the RMES, among other things, (i) established a repository of good
        practices and reference documents on the RMES Spark page; (ii) organized
        several wide-reaching learning and knowledge sharing activities, including
        annual learning and networking events—the “RMES Together” in March
        2015 and April 2016—to bring the community together to share knowledge
        and learn; and (iii) defined a technical training curriculum to inform capacity
        building for members.

In addition to efforts to strengthen learning and knowledge sharing, Management is
reviewing various options to better define competencies and provide support to
staff engaged in results measurements and M&E, under the World Bank’s new
career framework and governance structures. This activity, designed to strengthen
internal capacity in this area, is complementary to the parallel effort to provide more
systematic oversight and support to ensure the quality of M&E designs at entry and
throughout the implementation of projects.

Recommendation 5: Expand voluntary evaluations that respond to learning needs
of Management and teams. Management agrees that voluntary self-evaluations
such as impact evaluations (IEs) are an important way to assess the effectiveness of
interventions, and are often more valued by staff than (mandatory) self-evaluations
as a source for learning. Making IEs more easily accessible to staff through a
centralized repository would be a first important step to promoting the wider use of
this wealth of information. While the use of IEs has been increasing and there are
several initiatives to support IEs with a blend of sector, thematic, Regional, and trust
fund donor priorities (e.g., Strategic Impact Evaluation Fund, Development Impact
Evaluation Initiative, Africa Gender Action Lab, and Health Results Innovation
Trust Fund), application has been uneven across Global Practices and sectors. As the
report points out, most IEs are financed by trust funds. While it is neither feasible
nor necessary for every operation to have an embedded IE, there is a need for a
more systematic approach to and guidance on IEs to boost learning and
development effectiveness. Management will establish a working group to discuss
options and a way forward. Finally, good IEs require resources, and the reliance on
trust funds is of concern. It is important to strengthen clients’ capacity in and
awareness of IEs and to increase the number of projects in which IEs are embedded.

MANAGEMENT RESPONSE


IFC Management Comments
Management appreciates IEG’s effort in conducting a comprehensive evaluation of
the World Bank Group’s self-evaluation systems. IFC also wishes to recognize IEG’s
engagement with Management and technical staff throughout the process,
particularly through the ReACT Workshop during the preparation of the draft.
Management is also pleased with the report’s recognition that IFC’s self-evaluation
system remains in line with the good practice standards of the Evaluation
Cooperation Group. IFC largely agrees with the evaluation’s findings and
conclusions, particularly regarding the need to strengthen the focus on learning in
the World Bank Group M&E systems. Management looks forward to further
collaboration with IEG in the implementation of the recommendations.

Management has two specific comments that set the context for IFC’s responses to
the recommendations. First, Management has been making improvements to IFC’s
full results framework—beyond Expanded Project Supervision Reports (XPSRs) and
Project Completion Reports (PCRs)—over the last two years and has further
strengthened M&E functions and the professional staff working on this space.
Improvements, broadly endorsed by the Committee on Development Effectiveness
(CODE), were driven by meeting IFC clients’ needs and adding value to their
business, going beyond accountability. Key enhancements of the new framework are
under implementation, such as more strategic evaluations at the project and sector
levels, results frameworks at country and program levels, and greater client
orientation and support for clients’ development impact data. Signals so far have
been encouraging. New guidelines have been issued to teams preparing Board
papers for approval of investment projects to reinforce the emphasis on
development impact. Management has continued to enhance M&E functions and to
strengthen the roles of results measurement professionals by placing the staff in the
Chief Economist’s Office under the Global Client Services VPU, closer to operational
departments and IFC global research. To maintain close relationships with IFC
clients, about half of the unit’s staff is located in IFC regional hubs. Furthermore, IFC
Management strives to leverage IFC’s experience and lessons from the
professionalization of the M&E functions by co-managing the World Bank Group’s
RMES with OPCS, and by building partnerships with other international finance
institutions, such as through harmonizing key indicators.

Second, although the report focuses on IFC investment’s XPSRs and, to a lesser
extent, on IFC advisory services’ PCRs, Management wishes to point out that IFC
has other tools for self-evaluation: development and financial performance
assessments of operations using the Development Outcome Tracking System
(DOTS); Credit Risk Rating and Project Supervision Reports; periodic feedback from


xxii
                                                                   MANAGEMENT RESPONSE


investment and advisory clients using client surveys; knowledge generation
initiatives, such as Smart Lessons and knowledge management sessions, IEG’s
evaluations, and learning products; and accountability reporting activities, such as
IFC Monthly and Quarterly Management Reports to the Board, and Scorecards.

IFC Management’s response to the report’s IFC-applicable recommendations
follows. With respect to Recommendation 2, Management welcomes the
recommendation and appreciates IEG’s having included itself as part of the solution
to improve IFC’s self-evaluation system. The IFC team looks forward to working
with the IEG team on improvements to focus on learning rather than on ratings. The
recommendation is particularly applicable to IFC investments since these projects
are not allowed to make changes in business approaches, plans, or targets after
Board approval. One exception is a recently launched procedure that allows
investment projects in fragile and conflict situations (FCS) to change their targets up
to a year after approval—a procedure that is intended to help projects adapt to
rapidly changing circumstances. For both advisory services and investment projects
in FCS, adjustments are subject to Management approval. Management continues to
encourage operational teams to develop projects that innovate or pilot approaches.
Therefore, it believes that IFC could further explore adjustments in guidelines and
procedures to signal flexibility in setting targets and business plans.

Regarding Recommendation 3, Management supports the IEG recommendation
about increasing incentives for staff to use the results and knowledge generated by
self-evaluation to improve operations and strategies. In this regard, as noted above,
IFC has been enhancing its evaluations and feedback loops in line with business
needs as part of its enhancements to the results framework.

Management welcomes Recommendation 4 and the background analysis that
demonstrates the value of quality M&E in achieving results. In this respect,
Management remains committed to having a strong and specialized group of IFC
M&E staff that supports operational teams, teams working on Country Partnership
Frameworks and Japan Indonesia Presidential Scholarship Programs, and IFC’s
clients. IFC’s Development Impact Unit, in particular, and several of the industry
strategists play a key role in supporting project teams at appraisal, entry,
implementation, supervision, and completion on issues related to development
impact and M&E framework in setting, articulating, monitoring, and assessing
achievements, shortcomings, and lessons at different points of the project cycle.
Furthermore, Management continues to support the RMES, which aims at the
professionalization of M&E staff across the World Bank Group. All of these
initiatives have been approved by Management and discussed with CODE as part of



                                                                                   xxiii
MANAGEMENT RESPONSE


IFC’s proposal to enhance its results framework. CODE was most recently briefed
on progress on March 30, 2016.

Regarding support to IFC clients, over the last year IFC has been experimenting with
two distinct ways to add value to clients: (i) using M&E data to provide business
intelligence to operational teams and to clients for business development, and (ii)
supporting clients in articulating their development impact. In this area, IFC has
started to work with several clients in building their capacity to conduct evaluations
and in using data collected for IFC for the benefit of their business. The IFC team is
also working to better understand what data clients already produce and what data
would facilitate fuller analyses.

With regard to Recommendation 5, Management agrees that an evaluation program
should be developed in response to knowledge gaps identified by IFC business
specialists and operational teams or clients. The Development Impact Unit has
developed a framework for evaluations that has three objectives: (i) increase the
relevance of evaluations for IFC and its stakeholders; (ii) improve insights and
operational learning from evaluation; and (iii) improve the communication of
evaluation findings within IFC and among its stakeholders and relevant
communities of practices. A platform is being built to give operational teams access
to the most relevant and up-to-date lessons, and IFC is developing guidelines and
training on how to prepare such lessons.


MIGA Management Comments
MIGA welcomes IEG’s ROSES report. The report is interesting and timely, though
focused on the World Bank’s self-evaluation systems. IEG’s previous self-evaluation
systems reports covered IFC (Biennial Report on Operations Evaluation, 2008) and IFC
and MIGA (Biennial Report on Operations Evaluation, 2013). The report notes correctly
that MIGA’s systems are relatively new and evolving, and hence the coverage is
limited. Given the increased emphasis the World Bank Group is placing on learning,
the report provides a useful perspective in its discussion on learning from self-
evaluation (chapter 4). The report also comes at an important juncture relative to the
ongoing Independent External Review of IEG.

Learning from self-evaluations. The report refers to MIGA seminars that present
project self-evaluations to MIGA staff as an example of World Bank Group good
practice approaches to learning from self-evaluation. MIGA notes that since FY10,
when the self-evaluation function was reestablished in MIGA, there has been
significant progress, with widespread participation by MIGA staff. A key benefit of

MIGA self-evaluations—which are validated by IEG—has been organizational and
staff learning. In particular, self-evaluations have been used as a training tool to help
new and junior MIGA staff understand the dynamics of the full project cycle, from
assessment, underwriting, and monitoring to ex-post evaluation of development
results.

Chairperson’s Summary: Committee on
Development Effectiveness
The Committee on Development Effectiveness (CODE) discussed Behind the Mirror:
A Report on the Self-Evaluation Systems of the World Bank Group (ROSES) and the draft
World Bank Group Management response.

The committee welcomed the report and applauded Management and the
productive and collaborative engagement by the Independent Evaluation Group
(IEG) during the evaluation. Members expressed support for strengthening the
World Bank Group’s World Bank Group self-evaluation system to better measure
performance and results and better inform and enhance operational quality and
accountability. They supported IEG’s and Management’s effort to take a more
flexible approach in defining and implementing a Management Action Record to
address the recommendations of this evaluation. They noted that this pilot
approach, to be implemented as a follow-up to the IEG’s External Panel Review
recommendations, is a positive step toward enhancing the discussion on learning
and accountability. Members commented that a vigorous self-evaluation system
should feed into the development of the institutional evaluation framework. The
committee welcomed the report’s alignment to the Forward Look discussions in the
context of enhancing effectiveness, promoting learning, simplifying processes, and
fostering the move toward a “Solutions Bank.”

Members supported the report’s finding that the system, while strong, primarily
focuses on results reporting and accountability and does not go far enough to foster
learning to enhance overall performance. They welcomed Management’s
commitment to encourage continuous adaptation and “learning from failure,” to
close the “candor gap,” and to focus on course corrections. They cited misaligned
incentives that create tensions around business volume, results, learning, and
continuous improvement, and underscored the importance of the corporate culture
and signaling from senior management to effect change. Members asked how the
report’s recommendations would be operationalized and how to dovetail the
changes with a more strategic approach to learning. They also emphasized the
importance of capturing and assessing the impacts of innovative or
“transformational intervention models” to incentivize staff and promote more
informed development solutions. Members also encouraged amplifying learning
from self-evaluations by making information readily available to staff and to the
World Bank Group’s development partners.

                                                 COMMITTEE ON DEVELOPMENT EFFECTIVENESS
Members noted the report’s findings that World Bank projects with good-quality
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) tend to have substantially and statistically
significant better outcomes. They were pleased to learn that Management was taking
steps to improve M&E. They urged Management to review the incentives for
improving M&E and to develop targets on M&E quality that can be assessed and
incorporated into the World Bank Scorecard. Members supported Management’s
commitment to review quality-at-entry—which helps identify poorly designed
projects, their likelihood to succeed, and if they are measurable and evaluable—and
take into account, among other things, unpredictable external factors. Members were
pleased to learn that Management has begun undertaking an in-depth review of
Implementation Completion and Results Reports (ICRs) and looked forward to
discussing the results and implications for the validation process with IEG. They
underlined the importance of strengthening and coordinating the feedback loop on
project findings to connect effectively to the Systematic Country Diagnostic and
Country Partnership Framework.

Members supported voluntary self-evaluations. They welcomed the establishment
of a working group on impact evaluations and Management’s commitment to boost
the use of impact evaluations. Members noted the need to ensure impact evaluations
have a more integrated, systematic, and strengthened approach, particularly relative
to knowledge sharing.


Recommendations and Next Steps
The committee endorsed the report’s findings and recommendations. CODE looked
forward to discussing further issues related to impact evaluations, improving
quality at entry of M&E systems, and reforming the ICR in the context of the
Investment Project Financing retrospective.

ISSUES DISCUSSED
Learning. Members urged Management to focus on accelerating the knowledge
agenda in 2017. They congratulated the International Finance Corporation for its
contribution to the lessons-learned culture, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee
Agency for its use of self-evaluations as training tools, and the World Bank for its
work on the science of delivery. The committee also stressed the need to train
Management and task teams in the field to raise their sensitivity to risk and
promoting good practices, and to promote learning and knowledge sharing on the
ground, including by building in-country capacity. In response to members’
questions on data quality and availability, IEG noted its evaluation on data for
development was underway, which will assess country capacity and the World

CHAIRPERSON’S SUMMARY:

Bank Group’s work on statistical capacity building and separating performance
outcomes from changes in the environment.

Adaptive management. Members encouraged promotion of an adaptive
management approach, capturing innovation and including course corrections in
operations. This approach not only bolsters staff incentives, but also is fundamental
for the World Bank to become the “Solutions Bank” and identify and promote truly
effective development solutions. Members advocated cultural and behavioral shifts
that encourage learning from both failure and success, and strengthening internal
signals to reinforce the importance of self-evaluation and knowledge sharing.

 1. Assessing the World Bank Group’s Self-
 Evaluation Systems
Self-Evaluation in the World Bank Group
Self-evaluation, or the formal, written assessment of a project, program, or policy by
an entity engaged in that activity (see complete definition in the Glossary), has been
used systematically in the World Bank (the International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development, or IBRD, and the International Development Association, or IDA)
for 40 years and has recently been introduced in the International Finance
Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) as
well. For much of that period the systems used in the World Bank Group have been
at the forefront of efforts to improve the achievement of results by the world’s
development agencies (Appendix A).

Self-evaluation lies at the heart of the World Bank Group’s results measurement
system. Since its introduction in the World Bank’s in 1976, self-evaluation has
evolved to include a wide range of tools and approaches to measuring and
validating results. In the 1990s, the launch of results-based management in the
World Bank Group greatly expanded its systems, adding attention to country results
to an existing focus on project results. For a while, the results of Bank sector
strategies and policies were also assessed through retrospectives shared with the
Board. Efforts to aggregate corporate results and track corporate commitments over
the past 15 years have led to added demands on the self-evaluation systems, coming
in part from pressure from donor nations around IDA replenishments, as donors
need results measurement to make the case with their own governments,
parliaments, and citizens on the value of IDA.

This evaluation seeks to assess whether and how the World Bank Group’s systems
serve their expected purposes through a broad examination of the ways in which the
systems operate, including analysis of the behaviors, incentives, and organizational
culture surrounding the production and use of self-evaluation.


Self-Evaluation Purposes and Uses
The closest the World Bank comes to a statement of purpose for self-evaluation is in
Operational Policy 13.60, which frames the purposes of monitoring and evaluation
(M&E) as follows:



                                                                                       1
CHAPTER 1
ASSESSING THE WORLD BANK GROUP’S SELF-EVALUATION SYSTEMS
        “The Bank’s objective is to assist its borrowing member countries,
        individually and collectively, to reduce poverty and achieve
        sustainable growth. To assess the extent to which its efforts and those
        of borrowers are making progress toward that objective, the World
        Bank’s monitors and evaluates its operational activities. Monitoring
        and evaluation provides information to verify progress toward and
        achievement of results, supports learning from experience, and
        promotes accountability for results. The Bank relies on a combination
        of monitoring and self-evaluation and independent evaluation. Staff
        take into account the findings of relevant monitoring and evaluation
        reports in designing the World Bank’s operational activities.”

IFC’s “Operational Procedures—Portfolio and Supervision” stipulates three main
purposes of self-evaluation as performance measurement, accountability, and
learning.

In addition, the 2013 World Bank Group Strategy makes a number of statements
about the role of (self) evaluation (World Bank 2013):

       “supporting clients in delivering customized solutions that…encompass the
        complete cycle from policy design through implementation to evaluation of
        results lies at the heart of the…value proposition.” (para. 55)
       “the [Bank Group]…has made significant progress in helping clients focus
        on results [including] rigorous evaluations of program impacts.... [it] needs
        to focus more specifically on how its engagements contribute concretely to
        reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity, as well as how to monitor
        and measure results as a Group.” (para. 59)
       “The science of delivery centers on ensuring that the intended benefits of
        development solutions are realized in practice. [One facet to effective and
        efficient delivery is] evaluating whether [the promised] goods and services…
        benefit the targeted citizens and results in the intended outcomes.” (para. 60)
       “The [Bank Group] will…[d]Develop an internal…results framework, with
        the …Scorecard at the apex, and with the key elements being reflected down
        into [vice presidential unit] VPU/business unit and staff performance
        agreements….This framework is intended to strengthen the accountability
        for results.” (para. 61)
       “The [Bank Group] will establish a more evidence-based and selective
        country engagement model. [This model comprises three main elements
        including] Performance and Learning Reviews [that] will identify and
        capture lessons from implementation to determine mid-course corrections,

                                ASSESSING THE WORLD BANK GROUP’S SELF-EVALUATION SYSTEMS
        end-of-cycle learning, and accountability, as well as to help build the [Bank
        Group]’s knowledge base….” (para. 68).

Based on the elements of the systems as they exist today and as described in the
various cited documents, the implicit purposes of the World Bank Group’s self-
evaluation systems are to measure performance, verify progress toward the achievement of
results, promote accountability (including by providing information that supports the
Independent Evaluation Group’s [IEG] evaluations), and support learning that leads
to enhancements of operational quality. This compares quite closely with the
purposes as presented in the literature on evaluation according to which an ideal self-
evaluation system should be able to support:

       Performance management internally via data and information that can assist
        evidence-based project, portfolio, policy, and strategy decision-making
       Reporting on project and portfolio results suitable to support internal and
        external accountability mechanisms
       Learning about challenges to managing for and achieving results.


Self-Evaluation Coverage in the World Bank Group
The Bank Group’s self-evaluation systems cover many different operational product
lines and their scope, processes, and methodologies have important differences (box
1.1, figure 1.1). Some reports are validated by IEG and feed into organizational
scorecards and results measurement systems, others do not. An important distinction
can be made between the mandatory self-evaluation products and voluntary
evaluation studies such as impact evaluations and occasional programmatic
evaluations or retrospectives commissioned by business units.

THE WORLD BANK SELF-EVALUATION SYSTEMS
Project or program design documents should describe the expected results, and
monitoring systems should regularly collect data on those results. Self-evaluations—
written by or for the operational department in charge of the activity—use the
design documents, monitoring data, and other information to describe what
happened, what was achieved, identify lessons, pass evaluative judgments, and
assign ratings. The resulting report becomes an important permanent record of the
activity. Information from self-evaluations and IEG’s independent validation of
them is used to report aggregated results and for accountability purposes. Learning
from self-evaluation helps improve performance over time, at least in theory. Figure
1.1 shows what is covered by self-evaluation and how processes work.




                                                                                        3
CHAPTER 1
ASSESSING THE WORLD BANK GROUP’S SELF-EVALUATION SYSTEMS
The Bank began requiring all operating departments to prepare self-evaluation
project completion reports in 1976. Those early reports were subject to review by the
evaluation department (now known as IEG) before being submitted to the Board.
Their variable quality resulted in a tightening of evidentiary standards in the late
1970s. A brief attempt to mandate self-evaluation by borrowers in 1980 led to a
decline in report quality and timeliness and eventually Bank staff resumed
preparation of completion reports, with an option for borrowers to provide their
comments, which go on the record as an appendix to the reports (World Bank 2003).


    Box 1-1. Bank Group Self-Evaluation Instruments
    Self-evaluation in the World Bank Group covers most operational activities. Primary,
    mandatory self-evaluation systems include:
          ICR (Implementation Completion and Results Report) for Bank lending at closing
          ISR (Implementation Status and Results Report) for Bank lending in
           implementation
          Country Partnership Framework Completion and Learning Reviews for country
           programs
          XPSR (Expanded Project Supervision Report) for IFC investments at maturity
          PCRs (Project Completion Reports) for IFC advisory projects at closing
          PSRs (Project Supervision Reports) for active IFC advisory projects
          PERs (Project Evaluation Reports) for MIGA guarantee projects.
    There are also voluntary self-evaluations:
          Impact evaluations
          Evaluative studies, such as IFC’s program performance evaluations.
    Data from self-evaluations feed into corporate results measurement:
          World Bank Group corporate scorecard; IFC, MIGA, and World Bank scorecards
          IDA’s results measurement system
          The website of the President’s Delivery Unit
          Various internal portfolio monitoring reports.
    Some activities are not currently covered by self-evaluation, such as:
          Board operations
          Control and Treasury functions
          The Bank’s Reimbursable Advisory Services
          Country programs under country engagement notes
          Various assessment tools such the Country Financial Accountability Assessment.
    Figure 1.1 and the Approach Paper for this evaluation1 present a more detailed inventory.


A decline in the development effectiveness of Bank projects in the early 1990s
spurred a number of changes. The ICR was introduced with validation by IEG after

                                                                               CHAPTER 1
                                ASSESSING THE WORLD BANK GROUP’S SELF-EVALUATION SYSTEMS
submission to the Board rather than before, resulting in ratings differences between
the ICR and IEG’s validation (Appendix A). The Quality Assurance Group was
established (and later disbanded) to evaluate the quality at entry, quality of
supervision, and overall portfolio performance. Over time, the independent
evaluation function has worked closely with Operations Policy and Country
Services (OPCS) to harmonize rating systems, adjust ratings criteria, and introduce
new self-evaluation products.

Currently, World Bank carries out self-evaluations which IEG validates for all
IBRD/IDA operations regardless of funding size and all recipient executed trust
funds above $5 million (with a few exceptions).2 The evaluations assess the project
against the original project objectives and any subsequent formal revisions and rate
outcomes based on criteria for relevance, effectiveness, and efficiency. Risk to
development outcome, Bank performance, and borrower performance are also
assessed and rated. In addition, IEG separately assesses and rates project M&E and
the quality of the self-evaluation. IEG also writes Project Performance Assessment
Reports on a purposefully selected share of projects, currently around 15 percent.

THE IFC INVESTMENT AND MIGA GUARANTEE SELF-EVALUATION SYSTEMS
IFC uses self-evaluation to assess performance, results, and effects on private sector
development. It and started conducting formal self-evaluations of its projects in 1987.
The system changed a number of times, and, in response to a 1995 review, was
modified to focus on accountability for corporate objectives and identification of
lessons.3 IFC began preparing XPSRs in 1999 for a random representative sample
selected by IEG (recently lowered to 40 percent) of investment projects, all of which
are then validated by IEG. The evaluation criteria cover project or program effects on
stakeholders and include financial, economic, environmental and social, and private
sector development dimensions, along with IFC’s investment return, work quality,
and additionality. The evaluation standards and guidelines, developed in
collaboration with IEG, reflect a combination of benchmarks, qualitative criteria, and
performance standards. To protect commercially sensitive client information, IFC self-
evaluations are restricted and are not shared with the Board. IFC also runs various
quality assurance programs such as the Development Outcome Tracking System
(DOTS), client surveys, credit risk rating, research, and knowledge management
activities most of which fall outside the scope of this report.

MIGA started selective ex post self-evaluations in 1996, and, after a period in which
IEG evaluated MIGA projects, resumed self-evaluations of projects in 2010 on a pilot
basis and using an approach that resembles that of IFC in many ways.4 MIGA has
collaborated with IEG on the development of its self-evaluation system, which is
now fully operational but still at an early stage.

                                  ASSESSING THE WORLD BANK GROUP’S SELF-EVALUATION SYSTEMS
ADVISORY AND KNOWLEDGE SERVICES
The Bank has put in place a reporting infrastructure for advisory and knowledge
services but has yet to develop a reliable way to evaluate the effectiveness of this
work. It does, however, collect client feedback through a new World Bank
Satisfaction Survey, the results of which are used in different ways. Creating a
system to reliably measure results of Bank knowledge work has proved difficult for
two reasons. First, the number of products and their relatively small size make an
elaborate, activity-level results architecture impractical, unless done on a selective
basis.5 Second, it has proven difficult to establish the necessary conditions for
evaluability.6

Corporate guidelines for Bank ASA require statements of a development objective
and intermediate outcomes. A large number of guidance documents and intranet
pages are available to lead users through the process. IEG’s review of the guidance
indicates there is greater attention to the transactions involved (for example, how to
enter the required information in the Operations Portal) than to the design of ASA
and the attendant planning for data or observations that would signal that an ASA
has been successful in achieving its objectives. Assessing results of ASA is made
complicated by the dynamic nature of policy dialogue and policy change: results
may not have materialized when the ASA closes, and attribution of results is often
not possible.

IFC pays closer attention than the World Bank’s to demonstrating results in its
advisory services using a centralized results-monitoring system that has been in
place since 2005. It has a comprehensive self-evaluation system, designed in
consultation with IEG, that assesses all projects and is embedded in the project cycle
from design to completion. M&E specialists sign off on results frameworks and
M&E plans, and, on completion, review reported results and evidence, a sample of
which are then validated by IEG. Advisory Services generally involve IFC helping to
implement IFC-funded investments, resulting in more comprehensive depth and
coverage of PCRs than the Activity Completion for Bank knowledge products.

IMPACT EVALUATION
The World Bank Group has expanded and deepened its impact evaluation work
over the past decade. Between 2004 and 2008, the number of Bank Group–supported
impact evaluations increased sevenfold, starting with the creation of the
Development Impact Evaluation Initiative (DIME) in 2005, followed by the Africa
Gender Lab, the Strategic Impact Evaluation Fund (SIEF), and the Health Results
Innovation Trust Fund. At the IDA replenishment in 2010, donors called on World
Bank management to further strengthen the World Bank’s impact evaluation



                                                                                         7
CHAPTER 1
ASSESSING THE WORLD BANK GROUP’S SELF-EVALUATION SYSTEMS
program, which management subsequently scaled up.7 In FY15, 82 impact
evaluations went through concept review at the World Bank’s. Impact evaluations
are financed mostly by trust funds provided by donors for this purpose
(Appendixes C and F). The fact that the selection of projects for impact evaluations is
not carried out according to transparent rules and depend on the team’s self-
selection and the interest of trust fund donors makes this instrument less suited for
corporate accountability purposes. It also cannot be used for aggregated reporting,
and is more akin to research. For these reasons, IEG does not validate impact
evaluations.

COUNTRY PROGRAMS
The Bank Group strengthened its focus on strategic country-level engagements in
the late 1990s as aid perceptions changed and as part of the evolving results agenda.
Self-evaluations of country strategies started in 2003. Today, Country Partnership
Frameworks are prepared jointly where relevant and the Completion and Learning
Reviews assess and rate achievement of program objectives and the World Bank
Group’s contributions. They evaluate Bank Group performance with regard to
program design and implementation and attempt to separate the efforts of the
World Bank Group from exogenous factors. They are meant to fulfill a learning
function through lessons and findings to guide future country programs. The
assessments are also validated by IEG.

THE CORPORATE SCORECARDS
The Bank Group corporate scorecard, created in 2011 and under continuous
revision, is a major element of the organization’s external accountability framework.
The stated purpose of the scorecard is to “provide a high-level and strategic
overview of the World Bank Group’s performance toward achieving the institution’s
goals. It is the apex from which indicators cascade into the monitoring frameworks
of the three World Bank Group institutions.”8 There are three tiers:

    1. Development context—Reports the long-term development outcomes that
       countries are achieving.
    2. Client results—Reflects the results of clients implementing Bank Group–
       financed operations.
    3. Performance—Covers operational and organizational effectiveness.

THE MANAGEMENT ACTION RECORD
The Management Action Record (MAR) is a tool that tracks follow-up on the
adoption of recommendations made by IEG in its major evaluations. It was most
recently reformed in 2012. For each IEG recommendation to which it agrees, Bank

                                                                               CHAPTER 1
                                ASSESSING THE WORLD BANK GROUP’S SELF-EVALUATION SYSTEMS
Group management formulates an action plan. It then reviews and rates its adoption
status annually, a form of self-evaluation. IEG also comments and rates the status of
adoption. The MAR is updated annually. Recommendations are tracked for four
years, after which they are retired.


Costs of Producing Self-Evaluation
There is no consistent method of budgeting for self-evaluations and tracking expenses
involved in producing them. Expenditures on World Bank ICRs are charged against a
general project budget code, and mission and other work done for ICR activities could
be mixed with other purposes, limiting the ability of this evaluation to accurately
measure costs. ICRs on average cost $40,000-$50,000 each to produce, according to
interviews with resource management staff, and around 300 are done each year,
yielding a total cost of approximately $13 million. This is a highly imprecise and
lower-bound estimate and does not include monitoring, ISRs, quality reviews,
interaction with IEG during validation, IEG’s own costs, and the costs to clients to
provide data and their own responses. Considering also Country Completion and
Learning Reviews, XPSRs (of which 76 were done in 2015), PCRs, and PERs brings the
estimated total cost of producing self-evaluations to at least $15 million or around 0.6
percent of the World Bank Group’s total annual administrative budget (excluding
quality reviews and IEG’s budget). See Appendix C for details.


Evaluating Self-Evaluation
WHY EVALUATE NOW?
The ongoing reform of the World Bank Group is a good time to assess how well the
self-evaluation systems support the mission of the institution. This report links
closely to ongoing efforts to enhance operational and organizational effectiveness,
promote a learning and “development solutions” culture, simplify internal
processes, and promote evidence-based decision-making. Strong M&E is closely
associated with high performance and contributes to the learning and mid-course
correction emphasized by the 2013 Bank Group strategy and the results focus of
IDA. Further, the recent external review of IEG has noted that IEG is only one
component of a broader system that is not well-articulated or working optimally.

EVALUATION SCOPE
The report covers self-evaluation of Bank and IFC projects (and, very selectively,
MIGA guarantees), as well as knowledge and advisory services, country programs,
and impact evaluation. While “appraising the World Bank Group’s operations self-



                                                                                       9

evaluation…and attesting to their adequacy to the Boards” has long been part of
IEG’s mandate, and earlier reports did this separately for the World Bank’s and for
IFC and MIGA, this is IEG’s first review of the entire self-evaluation system.9 The
report complements or builds on other IEG reports, most notably:

        The annual Results and Performance Report; where trends in results are
         assessed. In contrast, this report reviews how results are measured.
        Learning and Results, Volumes I and II; where the ways in which Bank staff
         learn are assessed. This report reviews how self-evaluation fosters learning.
        IEG’s Biennial Report on Operations Evaluation (BROE), which covered IFC
         (up to 2008) and IFC and MIGA in 2013. This report pays closer attention to
         Bank systems and more selective attention to certain aspects of IFC’s systems
         (because MIGA’s systems are still relatively new and evolving, their
         coverage is limited) (IEG 2013).

Evaluation systems can be analyzed at various levels. Three levels are considered in
this report: (a) templates, guidelines, and information technology; (b) business
processes, data streams, reporting lines, and roles and responsibilities; and (c)
behaviors influenced by motivations that are both extrinsic (incentives) and intrinsic
(norms and values) as well as organizational culture. The report also examines the
interfaces between self-evaluation and IEG’s independent validation and evaluation
functions, recognizing that IEG validation influences processes, behaviors, and
incentives.

The report focuses on the production and use of mandatory self-evaluation and
impact evaluation. One limitation of this report is that it does not cover occasional
voluntary self-evaluations apart from World Bank impact evaluation such as
retrospectives because no inventory or database tracks them (in the World Bank’s)
and they can be hard to distinguish from broader studies.10 IFC impact evaluations
are also outside the scope. The report selectively assesses how monitoring
information feeds into the production and use of self-evaluation. The report does not
cover self-evaluation of the Program-for-Results and the MAR and does not consider
whether there should be (self) evaluation of areas such as governance arrangements
and Board functions, human resources, and back office functions.11

EVALUATION QUESTIONS
The report seeks to answer the following questions:

        Are the World Bank Group self-evaluation systems adequate to inform
         decision-making as it relates to operational performance management? See
         chapter 2.

                                ASSESSING THE WORLD BANK GROUP’S SELF-EVALUATION SYSTEMS
       Are the World Bank Group self-evaluation systems adequate to verify
        achievement of results and promote accountability for results? See chapter 3.
       Are the World Bank Group self-evaluation systems adequate to support
        learning from experience? See chapter 4.
       How are organizational incentives, norms, culture, and practices shaping the
        production and use of self-evaluations? This is discussed in chapters 2-5.


Methodology and Data Sources
This evaluation relied on diverse methodological approaches targeted to answer
particular evaluation questions. Data collection methods were purposefully eclectic
to match particular questions and to triangulate information. The report integrates
findings that have been triangulated across all of these approaches. A range of
information sources was used:

       A study of the constituent systems’ historical evolution based on a desk
        review of relevant documents.
       A study of self-evaluation in five multilateral and bilateral development
        agencies, joint initiatives assessing the development effectiveness of the
        World Bank Group and comparator organizations; and good practice
        standards for self-evaluation. This was based on a desk review of
        documentary evidence from comparator organizations supplemented with 14
        interviews with staff from the African Development Bank (AfDB), Asian
        Development Bank (ADB), United Kingdom Department for International
        Development (DFID), the European Commission, and Inter-American
        Development Bank (IADB).
       Analyses of how gender and citizen engagement—both areas with prominent
        corporate goals—are covered in self-evaluation reports and how that
        information is used, based on a review of a sample of reports and key
        informant interviews.
       A study of how impact evaluation is produced and used by the World Bank’s
        based on academic studies, IEG’s 2012 evaluation, databases, and
        triangulated interviews.
       A review of country program self-evaluations based on experience validating
        them, a desk review of key documents, and interviews with authors.
       A study of systems for learning lessons in IFC based on interviews, a review
        of lessons and related architecture, and an electronic survey of IFC staff to

         evaluation.
        An assessment of the quality of ICR lessons based on a random sample of
         ICRs and qualitative analysis of ICR review sections on lessons quality.
        Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the quality of project M&E, including
         econometric analysis of the links between project M&E and outcomes based
         on IEG’s ICR reviews and the ICR review database.
        An estimate of the costs of running the systems.
        Reviews of: (a) IEG reports on learning, project M&E, the matrix organization,
         impact evaluation, self-evaluation, and select similar evaluations from other

         indicators tracked by the President’s Delivery Unit and by regular business

         ASA; (f) select Board documents and presentations related to results
         measurement and M&E; and (g) correspondence between IEG and the Global
         Practices.
        Semi-structured interviews with 110 Bank Group managers, staff, and
         consultants.12 Interviewees were stratified among self-evaluation authors;
         managers, directors, and regional chief economists (representing both the
         Regions and the Global Practices/Cross-Cutting Solutions Areas); M&E,
         gender, and social specialists involved in self-evaluation; operational quality
         staff; and key informants with knowledge in specialized fields such as gender
         or impact evaluation (see table 1.1 and Appendix F). Respondents were
         selected using a mix of random sampling (self-evaluation authors) and
         purposeful stratified sampling (most other categories). Seventy-eight of these
         interviews had the broad purpose of gathering data from people with first-
         hand experience of using or producing self-evaluations from diverse roles and
         perspectives (the remainder had more narrow purposes). The 78 broad
         interviews were semi-structured, used templates tailored to the role of the
         interviewee, and focused on specific systems, barriers to producing good self-
         evaluation, use of self-evaluation information, incentives, and more. The
         interview transcripts were coded using content analysis software (MaxQDA),
         resulting in a dataset that the team used to write this report.

      Four professionally facilitated user-centric design workshops drawing on
       design thinking and aiming to diagnose user experiences, motivations, and
       perceptions, and to develop prototypes of highly functional systems were
       held. The 32 participants were self-selected in that they chose to sign up after
       being invited.13
      Three game-enabled workshops were held with about 45 participants, also
       self-selected, and were followed by a facilitated discussion on incentives,
       motivations, and challenges underlying self-evaluation. The game simulated
       project planning, implementation, and evaluation.
      One focus group was held with eight experienced IEG validators,
       complemented by interviews and conversations with other IEG staff.
The findings on behaviors, motivations, incentives, and culture were triangulated
using systems thinking (box 1.2) to diagnose the various pressure points and how
they relate to each other (including pressure points associated fully or partly with
IEG validation). Using an iterative process of analysis, mapping, and calibration, the
team produced a simple analytical representation of how systems operate that this
report draws upon extensively.


Addressing Potential Biases and Conflict of Interest
IEG is an actor and stakeholder in Bank Group self-evaluation. It confirms or
overrules ratings (see figure 1.1), has contributed to the design of systems, and is a
frequent user of data from systems in its macro-evaluations and learning products.14
This creates a perception of potential conflicts of interest that the team managed by:



                                                                                        13
CHAPTER 1
ASSESSING THE WORLD BANK GROUP’S SELF-EVALUATION SYSTEMS
        Being clear from the outset that this evaluation examines self-evaluation by
         operational staff and is not an evaluation of IEG or how IEG performs its
         validation functions (an external review of IEG commissioned by the
         Committee on Development Effectiveness [CODE] was released in August
         2015).15
        Paying close attention to IEG’s role in all its data collection and examining
         the interfaces between self-evaluation and IEG to mitigate any real or
         potential concerns that IEG in this evaluation would be blind to how its own
         work shapes incentives.
        Employing outside consultants for certain roles, such as analysis and coding
         of interview data and facilitation of focus groups.
        Presenting only findings that could be triangulated from multiple
         independent sources and did not appear to represent bias or self-serving
         positions by individuals.

Summing up, the methodologies used in this evaluation were geared to assess
complex systems, their history and evolution, how they compare to systems in other
development agencies, how they are being used, the quality of data, and to
understand the perspectives and concerns of a wide range of people using or
interfacing with those systems.


 Box 1-2. Applying Systems Thinking
 Systems thinking and complexity science have made their way into evaluation
 approaches and methodologies with the realization that linear ways of thinking about
 processes of change have little relevance for assessing dynamic systems (Williams and
 Hummelbrunner 2011; Forss and others 2011; Befani and others 2015; Bamberger and
 others 2015). Complex systems are made up of numerous components and animated by
 the interactions of many actors. As practices of monitoring, self-evaluating, and
 validating have become commonplace in the World Bank Group, these practices have
 become embedded in organizational processes, norms, routines, and belief systems. Self-
 evaluation systems in the World Bank Group qualify as complex systems and
 understanding how they work and diagnosing why requires a systems perspective
 (Leeuw and Furubo 2008; Rist and Stame 2006; Hojlund 2014).
 Bob Williams (2015) recommends looking at three aspects of complex systems:
        How the relationships between people engaged in a system affect behaviors and
         how these relationships are affected by context.
        How the range of perspectives that people bring to a particular system promote
         behaviors that influence how a situation unfolds.
        How people draw boundaries between what they consider valuable and what
         they consider invaluable and therefore tend to marginalize.

                                     ASSESSING THE WORLD BANK GROUP’S SELF-EVALUATION SYSTEMS

 Peter Senge (2006) underscored that the voice of the practitioner is central to
 understanding complex systems. Jody Kusek and Ray Rist (2004) emphasized
 organizational, political, and cultural factors, and the imperative of understanding the
 need of end-users when building and sustaining results-based M&E systems. This
 evaluation was designed to elucidate some of the fundamental issues related to norms,
 implicit and explicit rules, values, and incentives. To this end, the evaluation engaged
 users and producers of self-evaluation through:
        Semi-structured interviews to discuss specific issues in-depth. Separate interview
         templates were used for team leaders/authors; quality reviewers/M&E
         specialists; and managers/directors geared to their respective roles.
        Games to engage users in a low-stakes, dynamic environment where their
         behaviors and attitudes could be observed in action, rather than discussed in the
         abstract (as in interviews).
        User-centric workshops to understand users’ experiences and motivations and
         brainstorm with them on how to craft elements of highly functioning systems.

 2. Managing Performance with Self-
 Evaluation
 Highlights
  Management has access to, and makes use of, data that can track performance, identify
    problem areas, and foster corrective action but some prominently tracked indicators are not on a
    suitable timescale.
  When the World Bank’s Implementation Status and Results Report (ISR) system works as
   intended, when flags are raised at the right time, and when teams and managers act on these
   flags, problem projects can be turned around.
  The Bank has room for earlier and more periodic mid-term project reviews and for more
   adaptable project design and simpler restructuring procedures.


Quality assurance of the operational portfolio is a major purpose of the World Bank
Group’s performance management. A self-evaluation system that supports
performance management should measure performance well, generate the right
responses, and be supported by the right incentives and an environment that
enables change where change is needed (box 2.1). The World Bank, International
Finance Corporation (IFC), and Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)
use very different tools and approaches to manage performance and this chapter is
mainly concerned with World Bank lending while making comparisons to IFC
(IFC’s systems are more fully discussed in chapter 3). The chapter assesses the extent
to which self-evaluation systems are used to identify challenges and spark necessary
course corrections and identify the factors that influence their use and effectiveness.


Monitoring Performance
KEY INSTRUMENTS AND PROCESSES
In the World Bank’s, ISRs are filed by team leaders every six months for all active
projects. Together with Aide Memoires and back-to-office reports, ISRs help manage
active projects. ISRs contain a brief narrative, report on outcome indicators, and
assign ratings, including on progress toward the achievement of outcomes,
implementation progress, risks, safeguards, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E).
Like ICRs, ISRs receive attention from management on both sides of the matrix. The
indicators and ratings feed into corporate databases. Together with other
information, ISR ratings form the basis for “flags” of issues and projects and help
identify “problem projects” in need of management attention. The ISR template has

been reformed and simplified twice in the past five years by Operations Policy and
Country Services (OPCS) in consultation with the Board and operational staff,
resulting in a concise and focused reporting tool. ISRs are made public, with the
exception of a specific confidential section.


 Box 2-1. Framework for Assessing Self-Evaluation for Performance Management
 The literature points to three aspects of a successful performance management system:
         Measure performance well. The system tracks performance regularly, identifies
          challenges to achieving targets, keeps implementation processes in check, and
          warns teams and managers if projects or programs are not on track to achieving
          their objectives. The following criteria of quality performance information should
          be met: relevance, timeliness, credibility, and comprehensiveness.
         Generate the right responses to the observed performance. Managers and staff need to
          learn from the data and take appropriate action; they build on data to make small
          or large adjustments to the implementation plan, if warranted. The system allows
          people to propose changes and try out alternative scenarios to put the plan back
          on course. Processes such as after-action reviews, quarterly business reviews, and
          data-driven meetings can help.
         Be supported by the right incentives and an environment that enables change where
          change is needed. The active use of self-evaluation for performance management
          depends on organizational factors, such as attitudes to risk, incentives, leadership
          signals, and trust in the system. Goal displacement—individuals changing
          behavior in areas where they are being measured so as to improve a particular
          performance measure—may occur: “unfortunately, and to the detriment of the
          program, focusing on improving the wrong behavior can happen at the expense of
          the more desirable program outcomes.” A performance culture and the right
          signals from leadership teams can mitigate goal displacement.

 others 2000; Newcomer 2007; Radin 2006.


Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs) are filed after project completion and
aim to “provide a complete and systematic account of the performance and results
of each operation,” according to guidelines. The Independent Evaluation Group
(IEG) validates ICRs but not ISRs.

There is a parallel approach for country programs. Country Learning Reviews
(CLRs) assess the performance of country programs at the end of the country
strategy period, with a progress report in the middle of the cycle. IEG validates the
CLRs but not the progress reports.

Bank management has created and is actively relying on a comprehensive, cascading
monitoring system. Regular (currently monthly) meetings between senior Bank

CHAPTER 2
MANAGING PERFORMANCE WITH SELF-EVALUATION
management and operational units review results and portfolio performance,
including problem projects, supported by data systems and processes, some of
which draw on information from ISRs and ICRs. These data systems aim to track
performance, alert management to problem areas, and enable corrective action. The
management dashboard is a useful tool for accessing operational data cascading
down from the corporate scorecards (and in some instances also the website of the
President’s Delivery Unit) with good ability to drill down on specific indicators,
Regions, and Global Practices. There is also the Quarterly Portfolio and Pipeline Quality
Report, and operational updates are presented at the ABCDQ meetings which are
chaired by a Managing Director.

IFC has separate systems for monitoring and for self-evaluation.

        IFC monitors its portfolio based on the triple bottom line: Financial (credit
         risk, profitability) indicators are tracked through separate systems.
         Development results are monitored annually (for investment) and semi-
         annually (for advisory) through DOTS, which uses a number of standard
         and non-standard indicators (not all mandatory) that are filled in by IFC
         staff. Environmental and social issues are managed by monitoring
         compliance with performance standards through the environmental and
         social risk system, updated annually.
        For self-evaluation of investment, IFC relies on Expanded Project
         Supervision Reports (XPSRs), which are different from the monitoring
         systems and are used for a representative sample of mature projects. IEG
         samples and validates all XPSRs. These systems are discussed in chapter 3.
        IFC advisory services are assessed more like Bank projects with results
         frameworks focused on development outcomes, semi-annual supervision
         reports, self-evaluation of all projects at completion (the Project Completion
         Reports [PCRs]), and a strong role for M&E officers. IEG selects a sample of
         PCRs for validation. Hence, much of the discussion about self-evaluation of
         Bank investments applies equally to IFC advisory services.

MONITORING QUALITY AND RESULTS OF THE WORLD BANK’S PORTFOLIO
Management has scaled up the use of internal and external client satisfaction
surveys for portfolio monitoring purposes (the 2-Minute Feedback Survey and the
World Bank Satisfaction Survey). These short surveys cover all lending and all ASA
with a country client and are fielded to clients and Bank staff in relevant roles at
project milestones. Results are available in real time and are used by Senior
Management and as performance indicators for Regions and Global Practices. Other
key indicators of operational quality and results tend to have issues with timeliness
or reliability:

                                                                               CHAPTER 2
                                               MANAGING PERFORMANCE WITH SELF-EVALUATION
       Projects and commitments at risk and proactivity (monitoring actions to
        deal with flagged projects in the preceding 12 months). These are useful and
        timely indicators for performance management, but they rely on ISRs for the
        correct identification of problem projects.
       Projects with baseline data available in the first ISR. Recently added, this
        is a useful but also partial indicator of M&E quality. Having baseline data is
        good, but the indicators in the results frameworks also need strengthening.
       Satisfactory outcomes, Bank performance at entry, and Bank performance
        during supervision. These indicators draw on IEG’s ICR reviews of projects
        exiting the portfolio and hence cannot assist with management of the active
        portfolio, although they help identify issues in need of attention.
       Net disconnect (the difference between the percentage of projects rated as
        unsatisfactory on outcomes by IEG and the percentage rated in the final ISR
        as unsatisfactory in achieving their development objectives. Because it relies
        on ICR reviews, this indicator has a lag time. It is also somewhat imprecise:
        the ISR measures the likelihood of achieving project outcomes, whereas IEG
        rates a combination of relevance, efficacy, and efficiency, a subtly different
        concept.
       Candor gap compares recent exits to the current portfolio and is hence more
        timely, but the term is problematic because it implies that the disconnect is
        caused by teams being less than fully open, honest, or sincere in their ISR
        ratings when, in fact, divergent ratings could be caused by a number of
        factors, including excessive optimism.1

Some indicators on cross-cutting priorities are captured at project or program design
or closing and are not tracked during implementation and hence cannot assist with
ongoing performance management:

       A “gender flag” is used by both the World Bank’s and IFC to identify
        gender-informed projects, but the flag assesses project design at entry and
        does not track or help manage gender-related action during the
        implementation and completion phases. (Efforts are underway to improve
        gender tracking during implementation.)2 Since the gender flag does not
        ensure that attention is paid to gender after the design phase, it may reflect a
        relatively superficial integration of gender into project design, such as
        consulting with women during preparation, or disaggregating the number of
        expected beneficiaries by gender. There is as yet no clear guidance on what
        “gender-informed” means, and many projects that should have been flagged
        were not (IEG 2016). The risk is that easily quantifiable metrics can
        overshadow more complex challenges of achieving long-term, transformative
        impact.3 The eight interviewed gender coordinators in the World Bank and


                                                                                      21

MANAGING PERFORMANCE WITH SELF-EVALUATION
         IFC all said that current systems do not adequately support their work and
         can lead to pro-forma, “box ticking” approaches to gender.
        Likewise, indicators of gender-informed country strategies and projects and
         commitments with climate co-benefits are captured only at design and do
         not support ongoing management of these issues.
        The safeguards section in the ISR is updated, but nothing ensures that this is
         done by the safeguard specialist on record. The Bank is reportedly setting up
         a new Environmental Performance Tracking System that is separate from the
         ISR and from the Integrated Safeguard Data Sheet, though a unified system
         would be preferable.


When the System Generates the Right Responses, Project Performance Can
Improve
THE ROLE OF M&E
Good M&E can significantly boost the performance of operations. The reverse is also
true: shortcomings in project monitoring systems hinder performance management.

Regression analyses of Bank projects based on ICR and ICR review data developed
for this evaluation show that Bank projects with good-quality M&E tend to have
substantially and statistically significant higher outcome ratings than similar
projects, controlling for other factors. Establishing causality between M&E quality
and outcomes is complicated by the fact that, since 2006, IEG downgrades projects
with weak evidence of outcomes, and these are projects that also have weak M&E
ratings. The analysis accounts for potential endogeneity in two different ways and
also controls for project size, identity of the team leader, expected duration, sector,
and borrowers’ performance (Raimondo 2016). First it uses propensity score
matching to compare IEG’s outcome ratings for projects with good M&E to
otherwise similar projects with weak M&E. The estimated effect of an increase in
M&E quality from “modest” to “substantial” is comparable in magnitude to a one-
step jump in ratings on the six-point scale. Second, the analysis uses the outcome
rating measured by the ICR. The effect of M&E on outcomes remains statistically
significant, but of lower magnitude in this specification.

A detailed analysis of IEG’s ICR reviews for a stratified random sample of 144
investment projects that closed between FY12 and FY14 finds that commonly
occurring implementation issues are more prevalent among unsuccessful projects
(those rated marginally unsatisfactory [MU] and below) than among successful
projects (those rated marginally satisfactory [MS] and above). The results are shown
in table 2.1.4

Note: MU = marginally unsatisfactory; MS = marginally satisfactory.

A recent review by the Internal Audit Department (IAD 2015) finds that 85 percent
of problem projects that have a satisfactory M&E rating end up being rated
satisfactory by IEG compared to 45 percent of problem projects with unsatisfactory
M&E ratings.

Given the association between M&E and outcome rating, depicted also in figure 2.1,
it would be beneficial to identify M&E shortcomings early and address them, but
teams do not often use the ISR to do so. In the ISR, teams can flag M&E issues but
they only do so in 18 percent of active projects whereas IEG rates 74 percent of
projects negligible or modest on M&E quality and use.5 Box 2.2 offers one example
of a project with strong M&E design and use.

 Box 2-2. Example of High-Quality M&E Design, Implementation, and Use: The Kazakhstan
 Moinak Electricity Transmission Project
 The project aimed to increase and improve the supply of electricity to business
 enterprises and households in southern Kazakhstan in an economically and
 environmentally sustainable manner. IEG rated the project high on quality of M&E for
 the following reasons:
      The project used a simple, measurable, and outcome-oriented M&E framework.
         The outcome indicators reflected well the project objectives without being overly
         complicated. The intermediate outcome indicators helped monitoring
         implementation progress by focusing on timely completion of tender documents,
         timely contract awards, and exact items of equipment delivered, installed, and
         commissioned in accordance with the plan.
      The project had baseline data in place at the time of project design for the four
         quantitative measures that it tracked and which were mostly available through
         the existing management information system (reduction of power deficit, load
         shedding, wholesale price of electricity, and CO2 emissions).
      The project used progress indicators to keep track of progress and identify
         implementation challenges. Implementation support missions used this data to
         identify procurement and other slippages and reach agreement on efforts needed
         to speed up the process.
      The implementing agency made active use of the information and found some of
         the indicators so useful that it adopted them for use in future work and integrated
         them into its regular monitoring activities.

THE ROLE OF FLAGS AND PROBLEM PROJECT STATUS
The IAD study finds that when the World Bank’s ISR system works as intended,
flags are raised at the right time, and teams and managers act on these flags,
problem projects can be turned around and ultimately obtain a satisfactory rating.
This finding is in line with an earlier study by Cevdet Denizer and others (2013) who
found that projects flagged as a problem in the first half of their implementation
period and turned around and no longer a problem during the second half of their
cycle, had an 83 percent chance of yielding satisfactory results—compared to 75
percent for projects that were never flagged as problem projects.

The ISR system could be improved as an early warning mechanism if team leaders
were quicker to raise risk flags and assign cautious ratings once issues surface.
Approximately 20 percent of the active Bank investment portfolio is designated as
problem projects and these are often identified during the first half of the project life.
In interviews, managers and directors described a heightened attention to problem
projects driven by periodic senior management reviews. Yet around 23 percent of
projects that end up with unsatisfactory IEG outcome ratings were never identified

                                                                                CHAPTER 2
                                                MANAGING PERFORMANCE WITH SELF-EVALUATION
as problem projects (IAD 2015). Further, only 1 percent of projects that closed in the
FY09–14 period and were flagged as problem projects have been flagged as
“potential problem project”.6 As one interviewee put it “what this means, if we do
an analogy with a traffic light, is that we have green and then we go directly to red,
there is no yellow in the system.”

The poor ability of the ISR to predict project success was also analyzed by Patricia
Geli and others (2014), who concluded that “opportunities to take mid-course
corrective actions on projects in difficulty are missed due to overly optimistic ISR-
DO [development outcome] ratings.” They found that the ISR-DO is a poorer
predictor of unsuccessful projects than a simple model made up of project
characteristics that are observable early in project life.7 Their model can anticipate
between 40 and 46 percent of projects with IEG unsatisfactory outcomes, whereas
the ISR-DO ratings in the first quarter of the life of a project anticipates 3 percent of
those, and those in the second quarter do so correctly only 17 percent of the time.

Bank management is fully aware that more accurate ISR ratings would improve the
early identification of projects in need of attention. To improve the early flagging of
issues, two things need to change:

       Projects need to have reliable monitoring data. Obtaining data on project
        indicators is a major challenge, according to staff.
       Team leaders need incentives to report and rate accurately and flag up
        issues. According to interviews, some team leaders are hesitant to raise flags
        because it might generate pointed questions and lead to additional work
        without additional support to resolve issues.

REMEDIAL ACTION AND RESTRUCTURING OF BANK PROJECTS
While remedial actions are not necessarily decided upon during a formal mid-term
review (MTR), the MTR is nevertheless a key decision moment in the World Bank’s
project lifecycle. The IAD study shows that the timing of the remedial action is
critical to whether a problem project can be turned around; this suggests that MTRs
are more useful when they take place early in the project cycle. The World
Development Report 2015 found evidence of sunk cost bias among Bank staff (sunk
cost bias is the human tendency to continue pursuing activities that have already
received substantial investment, even if these activities are no longer likely to be
successful). This reinforces the importance of conducting early MTRs or similar in-
depth reviews aimed at identifying critical issues.

There is room to conduct the MTRs earlier. As of June 2015, 95 Bank projects had
gone more than three years since effectiveness without an MTR, despite guidance to


                                                                                        25
CHAPTER 2
MANAGING PERFORMANCE WITH SELF-EVALUATION
the contrary.8 A review of MTR occurrences conducted for this evaluation showed
that, among all investment projects that closed in the past three years, about 8
percent (42 projects) had an MTR well before the midpoint. The majority (65 percent)
conducted the MTR right around the midpoint, while 27 percent held the MTR in
the third quarter of the project life, measured from the date of effectiveness.
Consistent with this, a pattern emerging from game-enabled simulations was that,
for the fictional projects that had problems in their design or early implementation
steps, the MTR appeared too late in the process: there would have been
opportunities for course correction earlier in the project’s lifetime, but by the time of
the MTR, when people realized the problem existed, it was too late and the
opportunity was gone. Team leaders found themselves stuck with bad trajectories
that could have been corrected if learning had occurred earlier. For this reason, a few
Global Practices in certain Regions already attempt to restructure projects before the
MTR.

Regardless of when the MTR is done, changing course to improve results is difficult
when it involves formal restructuring, especially “level 1” restructuring of project
objectives which need Board approval. Not only are internal Bank processes lengthy,
many client countries also take a long time to approve restructuring which in some
countries may involve ratification by Parliament or approval by the Presidency.
Analysis of IEG’s ICR reviews for a stratified random sample of 144 investment
projects that closed between FY12 and FY14 found that 22 percent of unsuccessful
projects (those rated MU and below) missed the opportunity for or delayed
restructuring (at any level). The same was true for 13 percent of projects rated MS
and above (see box 2.3). IAD also found that the responsiveness to flags and alerts
raised by the system can be improved. The indicator of proactivity has declined
from 81 percent in FY08 to 66 percent at present, in part because some pro-active
measures, such as restructuring, are difficult, time consuming, and depend on
borrowers’ capacity and commitment to take actions.9

 Box 2.3. Examples of Delayed Restructuring
 The Bank-supported “Market-Led Smallholder Development in the Zambezi Valley”
 project (in Mozambique) incurred a delay of over two years between the MTR and the
 final approval of project restructuring, the key action recommended by the MTR. The
 restructuring was formally requested by the government over a year after the MTR, and
 preparation of the restructuring could only start once the request was made. There were
 protracted discussions about what changes to make, and most of the eventually agreed
 changes required formal approval to be in place. In another project (in Zambia), the ICR
 review noted that performance problems were identified quickly, but the restructuring
 took almost two years to complete and Bank management gave little guidance on how to
 address the issues flagged by the ISRs.
 Source: IEG ICR Review, P098040 Mozambique: Market-Led Smallholder Development in the Zambezi Valley


The situation is very different in IFC investment projects. There, changes to projects
occur more frequently due to changing market conditions and are considered
business decisions that need not get Board approval and therefore can be processed
quickly. The lesson is that simpler procedures promotes adaptable project
management.


Incentives Affecting Performance Monitoring and Management
Low quality and use of M&E is a cross-cutting finding of this report and can be
traced to a lack of rewards and incentives for results-based management. Interviews
and focus group discussions made it clear that the self-evaluation systems are not
consistently seen as a source of relevant, timely, comprehensive, and credible
information that help team leaders, investment officers, and underwriters manage
projects. It thus becomes a perfunctory exercise.

Partly, the signals come from outside the systems with pressure for lending volume
and a perception that individual success depends more on obtaining new deals and
ensuring timely disbursement than on quality implementation and, ultimately,
results. This view was particularly frequent among IFC interviewees. Out of 17
interviews with IFC staff and managers where this topic was discussed, seven
mentioned the drive for volume and closing new deals as the primary motivator and
12 thought that there was no incentive to take self-evaluation seriously. Reaching
targets and complying with reporting requirements was often perceived as getting
in the way of pursuing results. The Bank’s heavy reliance on consultants to write
ICRs also sends a signal about the lack of importance.




                                                                                                        27
  CHAPTER 2
  MANAGING PERFORMANCE WITH SELF-EVALUATION
  Yet part of the signals also come from the acute focus on outcome ratings. Staff and
  management are concerned with obtaining good ratings and avoiding disconnect
  with IEG. Thus, the validation process has significant influences over behaviors and
  incentives, and affects the content, candor and usefulness of the self-evaluations
  (figure 2.2).

  Across the World Bank Group, there is room for managerial signals to more
  consistently emphasize excellence in implementation support geared toward
  development results. IEG’s 2014 Results and Performance Report analyzed the scope
  to improve the quality of implementation support for both the World Bank’s and
  IFC. The ability to solve implementation problems is a key factor, and determined in
  part by the frequency and quality of client contact (IEG 2015). However, out of 41
  interviewees who specifically discussed rewards and incentives, 31 stated that staff
  do not get rewarded for fixing problem projects or for doing an honest and quality
  evaluation.

Figure 2.2. The Incentive Signals Underlying Performance Management




  In both the World Bank’s and IFC, prestige was perceived as coming from peer
  recognition of successes, particularly through getting new projects approved. Fear of
  damage to one’s reputation and concerns about reputational risks attached to poor
  results was a recurrent theme in both the World Bank’s and IFC and linked to limits
  in candor: acknowledging that a project is not performing well was described as
  “exposing one’s dirty laundry” and best avoided. Safe space for trial-and-error was
  missing.10 Systems were often used defensively (for example, to manage indicators
  of disconnect), more than as a source for data on how to boost results. This creates

                                              MANAGING PERFORMANCE WITH SELF-EVALUATION
goal displacement, where the internal needs of team leaders and teams are not well
served by the system.

A number of staff and managers mentioned getting important information from
alternative sources that they deem more useful and credible than the self-evaluation
system, such as conversations with colleagues, clients, or implementing agencies;
letters from civil society organizations; and operational systems that focus on
procurement and financial transactions (this information may or may not be reflected
in ISRs and back-to-office reports). In instances where self-evaluation information was
deemed useful, it was because it had sparked further discussion within a team (for
example, prompted by a country or practice director who picked up on an issue
flagged in an ISR). The Public-Private Partnership team started conducting transaction
review meetings half way through project implementation, tapping into lessons from
PCRs and other platforms to address emerging challenges.

All 34 interviewees, including 12 managers, with whom the use of self-evaluation
for strategic decision-making was discussed, reported that information from the
systems was not used to make strategic change at the level of the portfolio (as
opposed to addressing implementation issues in specific projects). Even if not
entirely accurate, this perception is one reason that staff and line managers are
demoralized about the value of systems.


There is Opportunity to Do Better
The success of self-evaluation for performance also lies in being able to change
course as often as necessary, informed by a continuous flow of information about
how a project is performing. The data revolution has transformed a number of
industries and may have the potential to transform development and boost
performance, including via rapid data flows (World Bank 2016). The practice of
adaptive management—small but frequent course corrections—is better suited to
capitalize on the data revolution than the prevalent model in the World Bank Group,
which concentrates the bulk of the effort in the design phase. As one interviewee put
it, “implementation and evaluation remain afterthoughts to design.” Some
development agencies have begun to rely more on adaptive management (box 2.4).

MANAGING PERFORMANCE WITH SELF-EVALUATION

 Box 2.4. The United Kingdom’s Department for International Development’s (DFID)
 Experience with Adaptive Management
 Since 2011, DFID has done a comprehensive reform of its project design and results
 reporting systems. However, DFID’s self- and external assessments suggest that
 strengthening project design and M&E does not automatically translate into the effective
 transfer of knowledge, project management, and delivery of results. Rather, tighter rules
 increased the pressure to comply and drifted the staff’s attention and time away from
 effective delivery and self-reflection. In response, DFID shifted toward “adaptive
 management” to bring greater flexibility, timeliness, and simplicity to the project
 management cycle and to allow more innovation and adaptive learning. DFID is also
 preparing a Learning Strategy that is expected to address many of the organizational
 barriers to learning. DFID’s example shows that deliberate systemwide efforts are needed
 to promote an organizational culture of learning that encompasses incentives, systems, and
 processes to facilitate learning along with loosened compliance pressures in areas where
 that is possible.
 Source: DFID (2013); Independent Commission for Aid Impact, (2014); (2015). See also Appendix B.


Embedding impact evaluations in projects is not only useful for measuring results
and allowing for attribution, it also has potential to add value by enhancing the
quality of logic chains, results frameworks, and data collection, with positive
spillover for other M&E activities that are not necessarily related to the impact
evaluation. Additionally, while the first generation of impact evaluations focused on
rigid evaluation of implementation of the project as initially designed, there are
current efforts to test variations around intervention design and incorporate quick
feedback loops that allow for adaptive management.


Summing Up
A self-evaluation system that supports performance management is a system that:
tracks performance using relevant, credible, and timely information and allows the
managerial team to use that data to reflect on progress and challenges. It is a system
that is supported by incentives to acknowledge issues and make course corrections.
If the self-evaluation systems of the World Bank Group more consistently embodied
these critical elements, they would more effectively facilitate early warning and
course correction.

There is active management of a number of prominently tracked aggregated
performance indicators. Indicators aggregated from the World Bank’s ISRs and IFC’s

engagement indicators, and outcome ratings, are often not on a timescale where they
can support ongoing management of the performance of projects and portfolios.
MTRs sometimes take place late, as does remedial action to address identified
problems. Restructuring of Bank projects is complicated because of lengthy Bank
and client procedures. Incentives and managerial signals need to more often reward
teams for good M&E and identification and fixing of problems and for reduced
pressure around quantitatively tracked indicators.

1Candor gap is defined as the difference between percent of projects with ISR satisfactory (MS+) DO in
the current portfolio and IEG satisfactory (MS+) outcome based on projects evaluated in the past 18
months.
2The current World Bank corporate scorecard indicator “Projects with gender monitoring at design
reporting on it during implementation (%)”, the IDA 17 commitment “to strengthen learning and results
through an assessment and rating of gender performance at project exit”, and the renewed emphasis on
results in the forthcoming Gender Strategy seek to address this shortcoming.
3As argued by the United Kingdom’s Independent Commission on Aid Effectiveness (ICAI), “ The results
agenda has helped to bring greater discipline in the measurement of results and greater accountability....
These achievements have, however, involved some important trade-offs. As highlighted in the ICAI
report, some of DFID’s tools and processes for measuring results have had the unintended effect of
focusing attention on quantity of results over their quality. This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as
goal displacements.

MS+, and, within the MU- category, also between large ($25 million and above) projects and small
projects ($5 million–$25 million).

from these last two variables.
8 According to Monthly Business Report, June, 2015. The Implementation Support Guidance Note from
OPSPQ (December 2014) states that “the optimum timing of the mid-term review would fall not too early
in the implementation stage — such that not enough information regarding the project track record or its
likelihood of success is available (for instance, at least 24 months after effectiveness) — but not too late so
that any decision made is no longer implementable or relevant (for instance, before disbursements reach
40 percent or not later than 3 years after effectiveness). “

 3. Verifying Results and Promoting
 Accountability
 Highlights
  Systems produce corporate results measures that are easy to report externally. Many evaluation
    experts consider the World Bank Group’s self-evaluation systems to be as good as or better
    than those in comparable organizations.
  The underlying M&E data is weak.
  The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has sought to reduce the scope of its results
   measurement and self-evaluation but progress toward more learning-oriented systems has been
   slow. The XPSR system is seen as imposed and ownership of it is weak.
  Trust and ownership of self-evaluation systems by staff and management is weak, the
   interpretation of the objectives-based approach causes inflexibility, and staff engage with
   systems with a compliance mindset where candor and thoughtful analysis suffer.

This chapter assesses whether Bank Group self-evaluation systems are adequate to
verify achievement of results and promote accountability (see box 3.1 for some
definitions of accountability.) The chapter starts by reviewing how corporate results
are externally reported and proceeds to discuss the underlying data that come from
project monitoring, the ways in which results are assessed, and what incentives
surround results measurement.


Corporate Results Reporting
The aggregated indicators and their targets presented in the World Bank Group’s
corporate scorecards and on the website of the President’s Delivery Unit provide a
broad, holistic perspective on the results achieved and communicate overall
performance in an easily understood way—a noteworthy achievement of the
systems. There is also IDA’s results measurement system which has played an
important role in driving change and focusing attention on strategic subjects in
results management and is still the framework for measuring progress and the
World Bank’s contributions in IDA countries. The corporate scorecards’ presentation
is a step forward from earlier, more fragmented and anecdotal approaches used to
communicate results to the Board and external audiences. This corporate reporting
is made feasible by self-evaluation systems that use ratings to produce information
that can be aggregated across diverse contexts.

VERIFYING RESULTS AND PROMOTING ACCOUNTABILITY
The systems get strong marks in various comparative reviews, including on
transparency. For example, the latest (2012) assessment of the World Bank by the
Multilateral Organizations Performance Assessment Network (MOPAN), based on a
survey of donors and clients in eight countries, ranks the World Bank’s as a strong
performer on several counts, including evaluating results and promoting
transparency (MOPAN 2013). Because of confidentiality of information originated
from clients, IFC and MIGA disclose far less information than the World Bank’s. The
Bank Group’s self-evaluation policies and processes are in line with the Evaluation
Cooperation Group (ECG) guidelines and with good practices of multilateral
development banks. Box 3.2 offers examples of how external results reporting is
used.


 Box 3-2. Uses of External Results Reporting
         International Development Association (IDA) replenishment discussions have
          drawn extensively on the IDA results measurement system, which inspired the
          development of the World Bank scorecard.
         Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRs) and Implementation Completion
          Reports (ICRs) are publicly disclosed and generate considerable web traffic,
          around 7 percent of all page views.
         Some research draws on ICR ratings—recent examples were quoted in chapter 2.
         IEG’s sector and thematic evaluation reports draw on self-evaluations and the
          annual Results and Performance Report analyzes trends in ratings. These are
          discussed by Committee on Development Effectiveness (CODE) and the full
          Board, respectively.
 *Note: In calendar year 2014, there were 343,465 page views of ISRs and 146,933 of ICRs which is equivalent to 7.5
 percent of all page views net of page views of nonreports such as search and frequently asked questions pages.


The corporate results measures also have inherent limitations, none of which are
unique to the World Bank Group. Causes behind trends in aggregated indicators
cannot be easily discerned and are sometimes disputed. Imposing common metrics
that facilitate aggregation (for example, core sector indicators in the World Bank’s)
crowds out the ability of teams to use context-specific indicators because, in practice,
there are limits to the total number of indicators. Interviews indicate that operational
staff often understand only vaguely the purposes of corporate results measurement
and how it is used by the Board and others.


Monitoring Systems
Weak project monitoring has been a long-standing issue and IEG macro evaluations
have uncovered many weaknesses in M&E, which is of concern because data from

                                                                LEARNING FROM SELF-EVALUATION
monitoring systems are the foundation of all evaluation, including self-evaluation.
For example, IEG’s evaluation of the World Bank’s food crisis response
recommended better monitoring of nutritional and welfare outcomes of programs
that seek to mitigate the food crisis (IEG 2013a).1 The evaluation of small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) found that projects’ results and M&E frameworks
often failed to include indicators of the impact of the project on the targeted group
and on the market failures justifying the project (IEG 2014 a). IEG’s report on avian
flu responses found that “the use of too many indicators overwhelmed the M&E
capacity of project management units. Data was sometimes not collected, and when
it was collected it was usually used only for reporting purposes and was not utilized
for project management” (IEG 2014b).

There has been improvement over time in the use and understanding of indicators
and results frameworks but still, one in five active recommendations in the
Management Action Record database (a compilation of all formal IEG
recommendations since 2011) concern M&E (IEG 2014c).2

CHAPTER 3
VERIFYING RESULTS AND PROMOTING ACCOUNTABILITY
MONITORING OF WORLD BANK PROJECTS
There is substantial room to improve M&E for World Bank projects and the tracking
of M&E quality. Since 2006, when IEG started rating M&E quality, the share of
closed Bank investment projects rated “substantial” or “high” on M&E quality (a
composite of M&E design and M&E implementation) has remained fairly constant
at around 30 percent (figure 3.1). The share rated “negligible” fell from 18 percent
for FY06 exits to 10 percent for FY14 exits (resulting in more projects rated “modest”
on M&E quality). The abolition of the Quality Assurance Group (QAG) in 2010
means that the World Bank’s no longer has a mechanism for monitoring the quality
at entry of development objectives and results frameworks in real time nor does it
conduct evaluability assessments. Instead, the World Bank scorecard monitors the
share of projects with reported baseline data for all development objectives in the
first ISR: this indicator improved from 69 percent in FY13 to 80 percent in FY15.3
This is a relevant but partial indicator of M&E implementation, but not of its design.

Only 3 percent of World Bank projects are rated high on M&E quality. The
characteristics of successful project M&E are intuitive: these projects have clear results
frameworks and a plan to collect data that receives timely follow-through with M&E
activities that are computerized, quality controlled, aligned with client systems, and
integrated into the operation rather than an ad hoc process, according to systematic
content analysis of IEG validation of ICRs done for this report (see also box 2.2).
Conversely, projects with negligible M&E quality (15 percent of the total) often have
overly ambitious or complicated data collection plans, unclear results frameworks,
and weak institutional arrangements, resulting in delayed baseline data, irregular
reporting, and information that lacks credibility (see appendix I). This squares with
analysis of IEG’s Project Performance Assessment Reports (PPARs) done for the 2014
Results and Performance of the World Bank Group report and analysis of ICR reviews
done in collaboration with the forthcoming 2015 Results and Performance report.
Issues related to M&E design and institutional capacity are prevalent and tend to
more commonly affect projects with ultimately unsuccessful IEG outcome ratings, as
table 3.1 makes clear. For example, unclear, inappropriate or overly ambitious
indicators affected 65 percent of projects rated Marginally Unsatisfactory and below.4

data. Staff in IEG, research, and operations offered a number of examples of
instances of inaccurate data. It is outside the scope for IEG’s validations and PPARs
to systematically audit or quality control data. It is not known how many projects
conduct their own data assessments, but analysis by the evaluation team finds this
practice to be positively associated with M&E quality. In interviews, some staff
emphasized the need for more Bank efforts in ensuring reliable data.

MONITORING AT IFC
For IFC, the 2013 Biennial Report on Operations Evaluation (BROE) finds that the
quality of evidence on the outcomes of IFC’s advisory services is weak, but has
improved over time. There are no equivalent statistics for IFC’s investment services,
but the quality of financial data from audited statements is markedly stronger than
other data, according to the BROE. The report finds that “data quality control has
been driven by the external reporting cycle and the annual report. The checks are
mainly desk based, and there is no data verification at the source” (IEG 2013b, 22).

Even as some improvements are under implementation, there is ample room to
improve IFC data. The external assurance conducted for IFC’s Annual Report do not
contact clients to validate data supplied by them and reported in the report. Data
supplied by companies and staff can also be improved to enhance credibility and
reliability. For example, data on SMEs are based on simple assumptions and
constant multipliers applied regardless of underlying conditions. The external
assurance pointed out in IFC’s Annual Report 2015 that IFC’s “control should be
further enhanced: at project level, by ensuring that the controls are consistently
applied across industries and regions; at corporate level, by reviewing the quality of
the checks performed and reliability of the data source used.” (p. 96). Further, the
Development Outcome Tracking System (DOTS ) has limited information on end-

VERIFYING RESULTS AND PROMOTING ACCOUNTABILITY
beneficiaries of IFC investment; gaps in use of indicators for private sector
development; and trade-offs between standardization of indicators (which facilitates
aggregation) and relevance to the context of the project.

MONITORING AT MIGA
MIGA does not have a monitoring system due to the nature of its business model—
because it has an arms-length relationship with project companies, it does not have
ready access to project information. Since 2011, MIGA has tracked compliance with
environmental and social performance standards and has used a Development
Effectiveness Indicator System to collect sector-specific indicators and standard
development impact indicators for each project.

COUNTRY PROGRAM EVALUATIONS
Country program evaluations have improved with the introduction of results
frameworks in 2005, but shortcomings remain (World Bank 2015). Of the 25 country
program strategies (CPSs) approved in FY14, 90 percent had measurable indicators,
although less than 50 percent were fully aligned with the objectives (IEG 2014).
Plausible association between Bank Group contributions and final country-level
outcomes is hard to establish. The results frameworks are primarily based on Bank
project-level M&E frameworks and in many cases lack country-level indicators. This
results in a substantial gap between Bank Group strategic objectives and the
indicators to measure program impact.

IMPACT EVALUATIONS
Impact evaluations address capacity issues through specialized teams for evaluation
design and data collection providing support on the ground (and, obviously,
requiring additional expenses) (Legovini, Di Maro, and Piza 2015). There is much
more quality assurance of the data. Although the process is not without tensions,
interviewees noted that the procedures for setting up monitoring systems to gather
impact evaluation data tend to result in credible data and evidence, as well as
counterfactuals that, in turn, strengthen the credibility of impact evaluation results.
Analysis from the Development Impact Evaluation Initiative (DIME) has found that
Bank projects with a formal impact evaluation attached are more likely to be
implemented on time than are those that do not, probably because of the extra
attention that is given to results chains and monitoring (Legovini, Di Maro, and Piza
2015). Importantly, impact evaluations are a complement, not a substitute, for solid
monitoring because they measure outcomes at discrete points in time while
monitoring systems are best at continuous measurement of process and progress.

WHAT FACTORS DRIVE M&E PERFORMANCE?
Staff and managers recognize weaknesses in M&E, but incentives and managerial
signals divert effort to other, more pressing issues. Difficulty in finding the
necessary data was frequently mentioned as an obstacle to writing self-evaluations
and 58 percent of interviewees observed at least one fundamental challenge with
data, results frameworks, or measuring. Low team capacity for and attention to
M&E, budget and time constraints, and weak client country data systems were often
cited by staff.

Despite increased awareness and various ongoing and promising initiatives, the
World Bank Group has yet to formulate a coherent approach to strengthening M&E
and, unlike support functions such as procurement and financial management, M&E
lacks a clear profile and career track. The Results Measurement and Evidence Stream
is an effort to strengthen M&E skills and professionalization.5 Most results staff have
been absorbed into the Global Practices after repeated changes in recent years.
Capacity building in select areas is also offered by the World Bank’s impact
evaluation hubs and by the Regional Centers for Learning on Evaluation and Results
(CLEAR) Initiative. Reasonably adequate guidance exists on results frameworks (box
3.3). Many interviewed staff understand that better project M&E is key to achieving
results, but no concerted effort has emerged and the internal “market” for M&E skills
could be better organized.

One unresolved issue is how to balance M&E between a compliance and a value-
added role. The compliance role of M&E leads to a demand for generalists who
know enough to advise on the basics and a “just enough” approach to all projects.
The compliance role prevails for most tasks associated with mandatory self-
evaluations, which are often written by staff without specialized M&E skills who,
according to interviews, can find it challenging to understand what is required and
who have little or no career pay-off from this task. The value-added role currently
prevails for impact evaluations, IFC’s thematic and programmatic evaluation
activities, and the CLEAR Initiative. It leads to demand for more specialized skills
and a selective approach to investing in good M&E where it makes the most sense,
such as in pilots, new business areas, and previously unevaluated project designs.

 Box 3-3. Guidance on Results Frameworks
 The World Bank’s guidance on results frameworks and monitoring is clear, and the most
 recent version launched in November 2014 is an improvement, with recommendations for
 a reduced number of indicators, and a requirement for indicators of citizen engagement.
 The guidance calls for a thorough consideration of numerous criteria for indicators and
 for the task team to assess the M&E capacity of implementing agencies. These high
 standards set in the guidance may be difficult for task teams to meet without additional
 resources. Likewise, borrowers are responsible for actually doing the M&E and their
 ownership of the results framework is crucial, but may be difficult to acquire. The
 guidance calls for updating results frameworks during project implementation, but
 doesn’t mention how complicated that is in practice.

Assessing Results
ASSESSING WORLD BANK’S RESULTS
Attribution

The system is supposed to measure outcomes, which, by definition, are results that
can be attributed to the interventions supported by the World Bank Group, but most
ICRs do not rule out alternative, non- project related factors that may have affected
outcomes. A study done for IEG’s evaluation of learning and covering a
representative sample of investments exiting in 2012 found that ICRs lack rigorous
evidence to allow attribution of observed outcomes to Bank interventions.
Attribution requires ruling out alternative factors that may have affected project
outcomes using either: (i) experimental or quasi-experimental design to establish a
counterfactual, which is not always feasible or practical; or (ii) a rigorous
contribution analysis that establishes a results chain, assembles evidence for every
step in the results chain, and rules out alternative factors to plausibly attribute
results. However, in the majority of ICRs, no effort is made to rule out alternative
factors. Among those ICRs that have at least some outcome evidence the most
prevalent evaluation design, used 58 percent of the time, was a simple before-after
(data on outcome measures at the beginning and end of the project) with no control
group (IEG 2015). There is limited consideration of information that could shed light
on alternative factors that might have affected the achievement (or not) of outcomes.
These ICRs hence do not establish whether development gains were caused by
project interventions or by other factors.

Ratings and Their Validation

IEG, in its ICR reviews, sometimes            Figure 3.2. Weak or Missing Evidence as a
downgrades Bank project ratings               Factor in ICR Ratings Downgrades
because of the absence of evidence on
results, not necessarily because of
evidence of weak results (34 percent of
Bank projects were downgraded in FY12-
14). This evaluation reviewed a random
sample of 105 ICR reviews for projects
where IEG downgraded the outcome
rating. Weak or missing evidence was
explicitly cited as a contributing factor to
IEG’s decision to downgrade in 70
percent of downgrades (figure 3.2).6          Note: Based on a sample of 105 downgraded projects.
Consistent with this, the Jobs Cross-
Cutting Solutions Area traced all instances of recent IEG downgrades in its area back
to data challenges. Most staff engage in formal self-evaluation very infrequently
(apart from ISRs) and find it counter-intuitive that projects that lack strong evidence
on outcomes are rated low. The lack of evidence on results also affects a substantial
number of projects (the precise number is not known) where operational staff
propose what they consider a relatively low rating to avoid a downgrade.7

The implication is that a weak rating can mean two very different things: weak
achievement of development objectives or weak or absent evidence of results (or
some combination of the two). Many stakeholders do not seem to be aware of this
subtle but important point, which also affects the interpretation of project outcome
ratings reported in the corporate scorecards.

ASSESSING IFC’S RESULTS
IFC has established a comprehensive M&E system that compares favorably to
systems in other multilateral development banks with respect to measuring and
assessing the development results of private sector operations. DOTS, the main
tracking tool, records uniform monitoring indicators on development expectations
and results across all ongoing operations annually. IFC’s corporate annual report
presents development results captured in DOTS alongside its financial results.
XPSRs, sampled by IEG, are the only instruments for in-depth evaluation of
evidence, since IFC stopped conducting annual supervision reviews of projects
because they duplicated its quarterly credit risk rating. XPSRs are conducted on a
sample of less than half of IFC’s projects at early operating maturity (that is, when
project activities are completed and early commercial results emerge). IFC


                                                                                              43
CHAPTER 3
VERIFYING RESULTS AND PROMOTING ACCOUNTABILITY
eliminated the lessons section of its investment review document, meant to ensure
feedback from past to new projects.

Starting in FY14, IFC has sought to reform how it measures results. In response to
the 2013 BROE, IFC did an internal review of the XPSR instrument, which found
that IFC staff use XPSRs little or not at all. The review proposed updating the XPSR
to better reflect “evolving business needs” (such as focusing on fragile states and
transformative engagements), strengthening learning (through more selective and
clustered M&E), and be easier to write (for example using credit risk and other data
to pre-populate certain sections). Senior IFC management, also citing the need for
efficiency gains and greater relevance, had requested that self-evaluation be further
streamlined, including the elimination of some work quality ratings and abridging
of lessons. IFC also proposed revising DOTS and relying more on data already
collected by its private sector clients and to move toward M&E at higher-level
(country, thematic, programmatic, and client groups). IEG and CODE members
expressed concern that the proposed reforms risked weakening the credibility of
IFC’s results measurement and not all the proposed changes were implemented. IFC
and IEG have subsequently jointly developed a streamlined XPSR template and
workflow, which is currently being tested. The number of DOTS indicators was
reduced to core indicators agreed by international financial institutions and the
sampling rate was reduced.

The signal from the top of the organization has not been supportive of self-
evaluation. IFC emphasized value to clients and staff through the use of existing
client data and higher-level M&E. IFC also sought cost savings from reducing the
number of process steps associated with writing, controlling quality, and engaging
with IEG on the XPSR, which it justified with reference to the low perceived added
value of the XPSRs. Interviews done for this evaluation confirm that many staff and
managers “do not use XPSRs or their lessons in their daily business and there is no
incentive or interest from Management in this product,” as noted in IFC’s internal
review. Many IFC staff view DOTS and the self-evaluation system in general as a
compliance exercise that adds no value and is not useful for performance
management.

Yet IFC should not lose sight of the accountability needs of the Board, member
countries, and the public. IEG and some CODE members perceived a risk of
accountability erosion through selective “cherry-picking” of successful operations
under the proposed reforms. Given IFC’s development mandate, a credible level of
reporting on development results should be expected: any organizations’ M&E
system needs to be aligned to its mandate (Kusek and Rist 2004). Reporting
economic and financial returns does not offer meaningful assessment of

                                                            LEARNING FROM SELF-EVALUATION
development outcomes. There is also concern that existing client data may not allow
for standardization, aggregation, and quality consistency given that private sector
companies rarely collect credible data on development outcomes but focus on
outputs and the number of clients. Finally, DOTS is a monitoring system and cannot
be expected to assess development outcomes and attribution as would an
evaluation.

Progress toward a more learning-oriented M&E system for IFC has been slow and
the XPSR system is seen as imposed and ownership of it is weak. IFC has established
procedures for its own evaluation work and for disclosing evaluative findings while
protecting clients’ proprietary information (few are disclosed). There is room to
improve the evaluation function, training, oversight of IFC’s M&E framework, and
the quality of XPSRs (IEG 2013b). Unvalidated ratings for advisory services are
reported in the World Bank Group corporate scorecard even though validated ones
are available in the same manner as they are for IFC investments, World Bank, and
MIGA.8 There are also inconsistencies between sources of indicators reported in the
corporate scorecard and in the IFC scorecard. IFC lacks a champion for self-
evaluation and its Development Impact department, which oversaw many M&E
functions (though not the XPSR), was integrated with the Client Services Vice-
Presidency and the functions of results measurement staff were repositioned.
Interviews done for this evaluation found that management interest and ownership
of M&E for investment is low in IFC and there is a sense that the XPSR system is
imposed (given also IEG’s roles in designing, sampling, and validating) which
translates into adverse incentives for staff doing XPSRs and other M&E tasks. For
advisory services, interest and ownership of M&E and PCRs is mixed but better than
for investment, in part because of donor interest. As with most self-evaluation
processes, some advisory staff welcome the opportunity to reflect on experience and
improve future performance, while others mainly seek to achieve good ratings.

Given trade-offs between M&E objectives, some guiding principles would be
helpful. Little learning and use of lessons occurs in practice (see chapter 4) and it is
unrealistic to expect systems to fully meet both accountability and learning needs.
Yet no policy helps arbitrate between the diverging perspectives of different
stakeholders and to make decisions about what constitutes an adequate scope and
coverage for accountability-focused M&E. ECG good practice has been important to
ensure that IFC’s systems remain in line with broadly accepted standards. The
mandate for the Director-General of IEG is also important. That mandate provides a
responsibility for “Appraising the World Bank Group’s operations self-evaluation
and development risk management systems and attesting to their adequacy to the
Boards.” But the mandate does not define “adequacy” or provide principles for
balancing between performance management, accountability, and learning when

CHAPTER 3
VERIFYING RESULTS AND PROMOTING ACCOUNTABILITY
these are in conflict. A policy would do this, and, had it been in place, could
potentially have helped the World Bank Group navigate the issues around the
evolution of IFC’s results measurement (box 3.4).


 Box 3-4. External Panel Identifies Need for Evaluation Policy
 An external panel review of IEG commissioned by CODE found that the World Bank
 Group needs an overarching evaluation policy because it “lacks a framework that
 outlines the principles, criteria and accountabilities for evaluation across the organization,
 that provides clarity to all staff on the merits of robust, high quality and credible
 evaluation, and that clearly delineates the respective roles of all parties.” It urged “real
 dialogue about what needs to change, how to do it, and the cycles of learning and
 accountability that follow.” It argued for a coherent approach to evaluations’ contribution
 to learning without losing sight of accountability. In the view of the panel, an evaluation
 policy would delineate roles and responsibilities; clarify evaluation principles, processes,
 and methodologies; continue the work to strengthen the evaluability of operations;
 specify incentives for staff learning and the creation, application, and sharing of
 independent evaluation knowledge.

ASSESSING MIGA’S RESULTS
MIGA has scaled up self-evaluation since 2010, but still has some way to go. It
conducts seven to eight Project Evaluation Reports (PERs) annually of mature
guarantees, which is around half of the load (IEG conducts project evaluations on
the remainder in addition to validating MIGA’s PERs). The emphasis has been on
learning for operational staff, helping them understand first-hand the development
effects of MIGA’s operations. There is active participation of MIGA underwriters,
economists, and environmental and social specialists (as opposed to being
contracted out) in self-evaluation with site visits and stakeholder consultations. This
arrangement seems to benefit learning while increasing the cost per PER (even as
templates and processes have been streamlined) and thereby constrains the capacity
to conduct a large number of self-evaluations. The dilemma going forward is
whether IEG will continue to cover cancelled projects, or whether MIGA will be able
to increase its self-evaluation production even as it has already streamlined its
approach and template and achieved cost reductions; otherwise coverage may not
be sufficient to assess MIGA’s overall performance, as is done in the corporate
scorecard. At stake is also the balance between accountability (which requires a
certain coverage) and learning (which calls for staff involvement and site visits).

GENDER AND CITIZEN ENGAGEMENT IN RESULTS MEASUREMENT
Self-evaluation frameworks direct attention to impacts on citizens, but in their
implementation there is room to better assess gender and social aspects in Bank
Group self-evaluations. Gender and citizen engagement are major areas of corporate
commitments, and tracking actions and results in these areas is an important
mandate for the systems.

Gender results are not adequately covered or tracked, especially when projects do
not have a specific gender component.9 Analysis done for IEG’s forthcoming Results
and Performance 2015 finds that the current gender flag approach fosters
compliance with process-oriented requirements but does not support project teams
to develop a clear rationale for how to address gender issues, and the alignment
between diagnostics, actions, and indicators is inconsistent. The same analysis
concludes that IFC’s selective approach to gender integration is more focused but
has lower coverage. There are exceptions. The India Country Management Unit has
been catalytic in including gender in the project portfolio and in tracking gender
results.

The 2013 World Bank Group Strategy cited the importance of engaging with citizens
as critical for inclusion and promised to “actively engage with civil society and listen
systematically to citizen-beneficiaries to enhance the impact of development
programs, provide insights on the results ordinary people most value, and collect
feedback on the effectiveness of [Bank Group]-supported programs” (World Bank
Group 2013, 23). President Kim has further committed to include beneficiary
feedback in 100 percent of projects that have “clearly identifiable beneficiaries.”

Given the corporate mandate of mainstreaming citizen engagement across projects,
this evaluation reviewed the extent and quality of reporting on citizen engagement
in ICRs of investment project financing. The review covered ICRs of investment
projects that closed in FY14 before the commitment to have beneficiary engagement
in all relevant projects was made and indicates how the World Bank’s has been
operationalizing citizen engagement in the recent past, providing a useful baseline
for assessing progress against new benchmarks and requirements put in place in
2014/2015. The review defines “clearly identifiable beneficiaries” as the subset of
citizens that are expected to benefit from a project, directly or indirectly. Four
findings emerge (see also appendix E).

First, 45 percent (70 out of 156) of the projects with clearly identifiable beneficiaries
included at least one citizen engagement indicator in the ICR’s results framework.
However, achieving the corporate target may not enhance participation in
meaningful ways, let alone improve development results. This is because citizen


                                                                                            47
CHAPTER 3
VERIFYING RESULTS AND PROMOTING ACCOUNTABILITY
feedback indicators usually capture citizen-beneficiaries’ views at the end of the
project, too late to inform iterative learning and course correction. There is an almost
mechanical tracking of “participation” but not of its outcomes or whether it was
meaningful and valued by citizens. There is room to capture the voices of citizens in
more timely and meaningful ways—something that would require a less
perfunctory approach.

Second, beneficiary surveys are used in less than half of the projects with clearly
identifiable beneficiaries that exited the portfolio in FY14 (66 out of 156). In most cases,
the survey results are not well integrated into the body of ICRs and their findings are
not included as part of the justification for ICR’s ratings nor reflected in lessons.

Third, a high percentage of projects trigger safeguards that require mandatory citizen
engagement, yet ICRs do not systematically report on citizen engagement activities
related to these safeguards or on their outcomes. IEG’s review found that only 38
percent (55 out of a random sample of 145) of the ICRs reported on whether during
the environmental assessment process the borrower consulted affected citizens on the
project’s environmental aspects. Out of these 55 ICRs, 44 percent (24 out of 55) talked
about the stakeholders consulted, 32 percent (18 out of 55) reported on whether
citizens’ views were taken into account as part of the environmental assessment, and
only 3 offered details on how the feedback had been incorporated. Finally, only 8
percent of the ICRs (12 out of 145) reported on complaints registered.

Fourth, citizen engagement guidance is not clear and requirements are frontloaded at
the design stage with little or no guidance on how to report, reflect, and act upon
citizen engagement activities during implementation and self-evaluation.

ENGAGING CLIENTS
The shared feeling across the different systems is that clients have little appetite for
engaging in evaluation of projects and do not see its value (ICRs and other self-
evaluations are not translated into national languages). Staff perceive that the World
Bank Group does not contribute enough to building clients’ M&E capacity, which
varies considerably from country to country and was often deemed weak.10 This
matches findings in IEG’s evaluation of the poverty focus of the World Bank’s
country programs (IEG 2015), which identified insufficient capacity and government
budget as key obstacles to collecting poverty data and concluded that client demand
for support with data capacity building is strong, and the World Bank’s is well
positioned to help meet that demand.

IFC and MIGA rely on client companies for monitoring and these companies do not
always have incentives or means to measure private sector development impacts

                                                           LEARNING FROM SELF-EVALUATION
beyond the products and services they produce themselves. A number of interviewed
IFC investment officers said that clients already generate the type of information they
need for their business and that self-evaluation information does not support IFC’s
own information needs. IFC clients perceive self-evaluation as a bureaucratic exercise
that represents a “pure tax” on their business, according to interviews.

TEMPLATES
Around half of interviewees in IFC and the World Bank’s thought that self-
evaluation templates were adequate, while others said that they do not provide a
venue for self-reflection and intellectual thinking, and that the ICR template leads to
repetitive reports. Views on their length were diverging: authors thought that page
limits restrict their ability to tell the story while managers, directors, and oversight
staff often complained about documents that are too long and detailed and lack
strategic focus. Further, templates do not capture the analysis and results of any
internal safe space discussions, for example of how to enable course-correction for
problem projects. However, template design is not a main obstacle to good self-
evaluation and adjustments to templates would not suffice to alleviate system
weaknesses.

IMPACT EVALUATIONS
The use of impact evaluation to assess the causal effects of development
interventions and complement other evaluation approaches has expanded rapidly
over the past 15 years, spurred by innovations in statistical and econometric
techniques. Evaluators, key informants, and operational team leaders collectively
prefer impact evaluations’ current status as mainly a tool for learning and do not
believe that they should be made mandatory or used mainly for accountability. They
are concerned that doing so could create biases, a “box ticking” mentality, or
otherwise reduce learning. They often focus on a specific outcome indicator and do
not assess projects in their entirety, making them complementary to ICRs. Quality
assurance measures enacted in 2012 are not universally applied to impact
evaluations done outside the impact evaluation hubs and while most impact
evaluations are of good quality (the 2012 IEG study found that 94 percent of
completed World Bank IEs met medium or high quality standards), some inferior
ones have been embraced and later crumbled under scrutiny.

Even as the number of impact evaluations continues to increase, strategic selection
of what impact evaluations to conduct by Region and sector is still not evident, and
the World Bank’s has no overarching selection strategy for impact evaluations
(individual impact evaluation hubs may have it). IFC has its own selection criteria
and database for impact evaluations of its projects. Strong imbalances persist despite

efforts to increase impact evaluations in sectors other than human development. The
Health, Nutrition, and Population Global Practice has had more than two and a half
times more impact evaluation concept reviews in the past five years than the
Energy, Finance, Transport, Poverty, and Environment Global Practices and the
Fragility, Conflict and Violence Cross-Cutting Solutions Area combined. In the same
period, the Africa Region accounted for 55 percent of impact evaluation concept
reviews while the Middle East and North Africa Region has had very few (figures
3.3 and 3.4).

Relying predominantly on external financing for impact evaluations as the World
Bank’s currently does comes with the potential opportunity cost of leaving major
knowledge gaps. This challenge of trust-funded and fractured spending was
highlighted in the 2012 IEG evaluation of impact evaluations (IEG 2013c), and
although the Impact Evaluation to Development Impact (i2i) trust fund established
at DIME in 2013 has the potential to even out some of the current sectoral imbalance,
parity is not yet observable in new impact evaluations and the risk of underfunding
understudied areas remains. This risk could be resolved by allocating more of the
World Bank’s own resources to impact evaluations in those areas and via more
flexible and pooled trust funds. Box 3.5 presents a list of suggestions on how to
further strengthen the World Bank’s impact evaluations.


 Box 3-5. Suggestions on How to Strengthen the World Bank’s Impact Evaluations
    Impact evaluations (IEs) are resource-intensive and difficult to do, and should
     therefore be deployed strategically and cover a broader range of Global Practices and
     Regions.
    The Bank should work with IE trust fund donors to achieve greater flexibility in their
     funding, and to explicitly target understudied areas. It should consider allocating
     Bank resources in areas still not covered.
    To foster stronger synergies between IE and operational professionals, the global
     practices should be encouraged to think strategically about which challenges could be
     illuminated by IEs, which projects could provide the best input for future operations
     and policy, and where IEs might help improve the evaluation capacity of client
     agencies.
    In addition to collecting outcome data on project-specific goals and metrics, IEs
     should also estimate impacts on outcomes that directly service the World Bank’s twin
     goals of eliminating poverty and boosting shared prosperity.
    Efforts should be made to incorporate the knowledge from the large body of IEs that
     have now been undertaken. This might include a determination of how the
     knowledge can be acted upon and a knowledge management system that collects IEs
     and makes their findings easily accessible and collates them in ways operational staff
     find useful (e.g. by region, intervention type, sub-population, and outcome).
    As IEs become increasingly aligned with projects and project objectives, the World
     Bank’s should emphasize IE findings in ICRs and other project reporting documents,
     and IEG should emphasize IE findings in its validations.
    IE findings should be disseminated to project teams in a timely fashion, irrespective of
     implication on academic publishing considerations.

TRUST FUNDS AND PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS
Self-evaluation and reporting requirements for trust funds and partnership
programs have been established but are not consistently enforced by the World


                                                                                            51
CHAPTER 3
VERIFYING RESULTS AND PROMOTING ACCOUNTABILITY
Bank. The Bank’s trust fund handbook states that “the World Bank’s is responsible
for a systematic and objective assessment of the ongoing or completed programs,
projects and/or activities financed by the trust fund(s) including design,
implementation and results (outputs and outcomes).”11 Reporting for recipient-
executed trust funds are fully aligned with procedures for investment projects.
Reporting for Bank-executed trust funds provide less accountability than the ICRs
because of lack of results frameworks, data on outcomes and outputs, and
assessments of Bank and recipient performance, something which ongoing efforts
aim to address.

For partnership programs in which the World Bank’s participates, the trust fund
handbook requires the World Bank’s representative to advocate for an independent
evaluation to be carried out every three to five years. This requirement is also
unevenly enforced, and many partnership programs housed in the World Bank’s or
elsewhere have gone many years without being evaluated. Many partnerships IEG
has reviewed lacked clear goals and indicators. The Bank should promote clear goals
and indicators in the programs it participates in and should promote periodic
independent evaluation, which should be independent of program secretariats.


Incentives Around Ratings
In assessing the incentive framework around self-evaluations, this evaluation finds
that staff engage with the self-evaluation systems with a compliance mindset and an
excessive focus on ratings that obstructs positive engagement and use of systems.
Fear of repercussions from a bad rating was a frequent theme in the World Bank’s.
In IFC and MIGA, ratings are not disclosed and staff are less sensitive to bad ratings
on projects they have worked on.

First, validation does, as intended, serve to keep reporting honest and timely.
Consider the parts of the systems not validated by IEG such as activity completion for
Bank knowledge products—with 92 percent satisfactory achievement of objectives,12
some ratings are unrealistically high. They are also more likely to be overdue.13

Second, staff and managers are prone to presenting information in such a way that
proposed ratings can be defended against IEG, often referred to as “gaming the
system.” Some critical issues may be ignored or evidence presented selectively to
support ratings. Said one Bank staff: “Team leaders have to be very careful about the
wording they use in the ICR, so they are not fully candid, for fear that IEG will pick
up on something and misjudge it; IEG can take a line out of the ICR and spin it.” The
tendency to not be fully candid also affected IFC and country program evaluations,

                                                           LEARNING FROM SELF-EVALUATION
according to interviews. Other interviewees appreciated IEG’s role in keeping the
system honest but, on the whole, the evaluation team encountered defensiveness
and frustration all around (figure 3.5).

Third, in the World Bank’s there are strong managerial signals to aim for at least
“marginally satisfactory” and to reduce the ratings disconnect (self-evaluation
ratings that differ significantly from IEG’s ratings). These signals likely stem from
the prominent manner in which the share of successful projects and the shares of
downgrades are tracked and reported in the World Bank’s (more so than in IFC and
MIGA).14 To avoid downgrades, managers sometimes advise ICR authors to set
ratings lower than what teams judge to be appropriate.

Figure 3.5. Incentives around Ratings and Reporting




Fourth, trust and ownership in the systems is less than ideal and the interpretation
of the objectives-based approach has become a source of frustration and causes
inflexibility for project management. Focus groups and workshops showed that
Bank Group staff and managers care deeply about contributing to development
results but do not trust the systems to give a fair picture of these results and their
own contributions to them. In the words of a country manager: ratings tend to be
“too negative: projects are often extremely successful, but the World Bank’s is too
conservative with its own assessment.” In the inevitable focus on summary outcome
ratings, the fact that some components of a project may have done well are easily lost.
Interviewees found IEG’s approach rigid for projects aiming to build
“sustainability” or “social cohesion,” both of which are hard to measure and
attribute to project interventions. Workshop participants also found it hard to write
project objectives around innovation, piloting, and institutional strengthening. IEG




                                                                                     53
CHAPTER 3
VERIFYING RESULTS AND PROMOTING ACCOUNTABILITY
was characterized as “rigid” or “mechanistic” in its application of ratings guidelines
and requirements to demonstrate attribution.

Fifth, staff do not have a good understanding of how information from the systems
is used by the Board and others and how it serves accountability. One-third of
interviewees who discussed the theme of accountability had a positive view and
expressed a need for honesty and acceptance of the need for IEG to validate. Two-
thirds thought that the systems do not enhance internal accountability, which they
characterized as “diffused” or “diluted.” Staff did not distinguish between
accountability for results at the aggregate, corporate level (for which systems are
intended) and accountability for the performance of individuals and units (for which
systems are not suitable). Staff have an understandable desire for good ratings for
projects they have worked on and tend to conflate project ratings with job
performance. Very rarely did interviewees make the connection that IEG evaluations
mine evidence from self-evaluation and help inform the Board. IEG has sought to
improve incentives through its annual awards for candid self-evaluation but this is
not in itself enough given the confluence of misaligned incentives.


Summing Up
The Bank Group self-evaluation systems provide a framework and data for results
reporting to the Board and other stakeholders as well as inputs for more in-depth
analyses, including by IEG. Weak M&E clouds the degree to which ratings are an
accurate measure of results for some projects, and trust and ownership of systems
by staff and management is weak and the incentives are not conducive to
conducting high-quality self-evaluation. Apart from impact evaluations, it is not
clear that systems produce value to stakeholders other than IEG, donors, the Board,
and senior management. Client firms and governments are little engaged, and while
the frameworks pay attention to corporate commitments such as gender, safeguards,
and citizen engagement, reporting on these aspects is often perfunctory.

5The Results Measurement and Evidence Stream (RMES) is an effort to strengthen M&E skills and
professionalization across the World Bank Group. It is managed by OPCS and IFC’s Development Impact
Unit. The goals of the RMES are to promote the development of a world-class cadre of professionals on
results measurement and evidence; foster a holistic approach to results and evidence, ensuring the
adoption of uniform practices across the World Bank Group; and advance the frontiers of knowledge
about key technical aspects of M&E to help the World Bank Group and its clients adopt cutting edge
practices.
6 The assessment focused on the relevance, efficacy, efficiency and outcomes sections in the ICRRs and
reviewed 105 randomly sampled projects, 41% of all 258 projects that exited in FY12-14 for which IEG
downgraded the outcome rating (34% of all projects). The sample size was chosen to yield a confidence
level of 99% and a margin of error of 10%. All project types were considered.
7Lack of evidence is also an issue for IEG’s validation of IFC projects and can result in downgrades,
although separate rating categories exist to address lack of evidence. For Expanded Project Supervision
Reports (XPSRs), the rating “No Opinion Possible” was assigned for Environmental and Social Effects 7
percent of the time based on lack of sufficient information, often associated with the project company not
reporting. For Project Completion Reports (PCRs), the rating “cannot verify” was assigned 3 percent of
the time and “too early to judge” 6 percent of the time for the overall development effectiveness score.
For impact (one of the sub-indicators feeding into overall development effectiveness), “cannot verify”
was assigned in 13 percent and “too early to judge” 22 percent of projects. Note: Based on all XPSRs
(1151) and PCRs (543) ever reviewed by IEG through FY2014.
8 This practice began at a time when there was a backlog for IEG ratings but that is no longer the case:
timely and statistically representative IEG ratings are available and should feed the scorecard.

 4. Learning from Self-Evaluation
 Highlights
  Having a self-evaluation system in which the entire organization writes substantive end-of-
    project reports is a noteworthy accomplishment.
  Knowledge from the mandatory self-evaluation systems is rarely valued or used, and there is
   little effort to extract and synthesize evidence and lessons or to inform operations.
  The focus of the systems on accountability drives the shape, scope, timing, and content of
   reporting and limits their usefulness for learning.
  Tensions and concerns over ratings and disconnects distract from learning.
  There is more learning from impact evaluations, which are optional, seen as technically credible,
   and done in response to specific learning interests.



The Place of Self-Evaluation in Organizational Learning
Having a self-evaluation system in which the entire organization writes substantive
end-of-project reports is a noteworthy accomplishment, one that few other
organizations can claim. In principle, this could contribute significantly to
individual and organizational learning, as articulated in Operational Policy 13.60
and by the International Finance Corporation (IFC). Evaluation has long been
viewed as an instrument for accountability, but evaluators argue that the ultimate
value of evaluation is in stimulating organizational learning with a view to
improving performance by management and staff who are responsible for the
design and implementation of policies, programs, and projects.1 Yet learning from
evaluation (of any kind) does not occur automatically. IEG’s evaluations of how the
World Bank’s learns from lending found that the World Bank’s lacks a robust
learning culture.

A vast literature on evaluation use emphasizes that, to enable their use, evaluations
must be timely, relevant, based on sound data, perceived as technically credible,
delivered in an understandable format, based on collaboration and follow-up
between evaluators and those being evaluated, and contain clear messages and new
lessons. Use also depends on the receptivity and political environment in the
organization receiving evaluation findings (box 4.1).

Scholars and evaluators observe tensions between different objectives of evaluation.
According to John Mayne (2015, 47), “evaluation is often seen by those being
evaluated a bit like an audit, something to be avoided or at least controlled as much as


                                                                                                   57
CHAPTER 4
LEARNING FROM SELF-EVALUATION
possible.” Self-evaluation that is subject to independent validation can have the same
audit connotation. Other scholars note that evaluation may serve a symbolic function
that confers legitimacy but is delinked from organizational decision-making and
learning in a context where the primary purpose of evaluation gradually becomes to
satisfy funders more than to assess effectiveness (Meyer and Rowan 1977). Disclosing
evaluation information to external audiences raises the stakes further, and can lead to
risk aversion, deter learning from failure, and hinder innovation (Ebrahim 2005). A
review of OECD-DAC members’ systems for measuring results finds that much
results information is used for accountability and concise external reporting at the cost
of shedding light on how long-term results have been achieved, which would support
learning (OECD-DAC 2014).

This chapter addresses the degree to which self-evaluations serve individual and
organizational learning, taking into account the observations in literature regarding
factors that enable evaluation use and organizational learning and tensions between
accountability and learning.2


 Box 4-1. Organizational Learning
 Organizational learning has numerous definitions and conceptualizations, but the basic
 notion is that the organization engages in a comprehensive effort to create knowledge
 and facilitate active learning among its staff in support of its goals. Building on IEG’s
 recent evaluations of Learning in Bank Operations (2014; 2015) and external research, this
 chapter posits that organizational learning takes place when an organization institutes an
 enabling environment—policies, processes, structures, and incentives—for its staff to:
         Generate, share, and apply knowledge that is timely and based on credible data
          and analysis.
         Participate in active learning from and with others.
 This should be done so as to further the goals of the organization.

Organizational Learning from Self-Evaluations: The State of Affairs
The Bank Group has instituted policies and processes for generating and sharing
knowledge from mandatory self-evaluations. Set processes define their timing and
formats. Templates guide the information generated and contain “lessons” sections
meant to capture knowledge of wider relevance. Over the years, a vast number of
self-evaluation reports has accumulated.3 Impact evaluations, although not
mandatory, have been driven institutionally in the World Bank’s through the

Development Impact Evaluation Initiative (DIME), the Strategic Impact Evaluation
Fund (SIEF), the Health Results Innovation Trust Fund, and the Africa Gender Lab. 4

There is demand in the World Bank Group Board and management for knowledge
and evidence to enhance development effectiveness and Bank Group management
has taken important steps to promote results orientation and strengthen self-
evaluation use. 5 For example, the Operations Policy and Country Services (OPCS)
Vice Presidential Unit has proposed that the agenda for project concept note and
decision meetings include a discussion of the evaluative evidence that has informed
the design and the plan for collecting baseline data.6 Eighty-one global lead
positions have been created to provide technical leadership and strengthen
evidence-based learning and knowledge sharing in core Global Practice areas.
Ongoing work aims to refocus the World Bank’s advisory services and analytics
(ASA) to better meet client needs, new knowledge hubs have been set up to share
development experiences with partners, and the Science of Delivery initiative aims
to create a cumulative knowledge base of delivery know-how.


 Box 4-2. What the External Panel Said About Learning Culture and Self-Evaluation
 According to the external panel review of IEG commissioned by the Committee on
 Development Effectiveness (CODE), the World Bank Group has insufficient attention to
 learning, course corrections, and (self) evaluation use. The panel reviewed IEG “within
 the larger, interdependent system in which it operates, including core institutional
 processes around learning and accountability” and found that “the current overall system
 and processes are broken. They do not support a mindset of learning, course correction,
 continuous improvement and accountability. Nor do they create the cycles of learning
 and accountability necessary to make progress toward key development goals. Learning
 is not prioritized, accountability is mechanical and does not support necessary learning or
 continuous improvement, and while there is some single-loop learning (are we doing it
 right?), there is less discussion of the critically important double-loop questions about
 whether or not the World Bank’s is doing the right things to reach their goals…..
 Improving the self-evaluation system is key for the success of [the World Bank Group’s]
 new strategy and for strengthening the basis for IEG’s validation and review—and
 thereby its contribution to the Corporate Scorecard.”

The demand for knowledge and evidence to enhance development effectiveness has
not been matched with an active learning culture (see box 4.2) and the mandatory
self-evaluation systems have not yielded a strong repository of knowledge that is
mined, shared, and used regularly by staff, although there are exceptions.
Interviewees across the World Bank Group almost unanimously described the
process of conducting and writing a self-evaluation as a useful learning exercise for

LEARNING FROM SELF-EVALUATION
them individually, but with few benefits accruing beyond themselves. Fifty percent
of those interviewed noted that they had learned something through the self-
evaluation system. Authors of self-evaluation reports noted that they:

        learned about sectors and countries in which the self-evaluation took place
        benefited from reflection and the chance to think retrospectively
        better understood client relationships.

According to a survey conducted for IEG’s Learning and Results evaluation, 23
percent of Bank task team leaders use ICRs to a “substantial” or “very large” extent
for learning for new operations during project preparation (contrasted with 50
percent for documents produced by clients and 51 percent for analytical, advisory,
and economic work) (IEG 2014b). And 31 percent indicated that they use ICRs for
learning from previous operations during implementation (in contrast with 54
percent for documents produced by clients and 42 percent for knowledge products
financed out of project loans and credit proceeds).

Self-evaluations are not used regularly for extracting and synthesizing evidence and
lessons that would be used to inform new or ongoing operations, and if a particular
self-evaluation report were to raise policy or strategic issues, no mechanism exists to
elevate it for management’s attention. Said one staff: “There is no learning loop, or
systematic approach to feed the lessons of projects into any larger agenda.” A study
of lesson transmission in IFC from one project to another estimates this at only 7
percent. This evaluation identified relatively few instances where business units
mine or accumulate lessons or insights from mandatory self-evaluations (box 4.3).
Interviews with staff reveal that not much value is placed on systematic learning
from self-evaluations even as some project design document templates contain a
mandatory section on how past lessons have informed the proposed design. This
imposes a norm of using self-evaluation information. Nonetheless, staff cautioned
that filling out such a section can be a gesture of compliance, not necessarily one of
absorbing lessons learned. To promote a culture of applying evaluative lessons,
mandatory sections will not suffice.

A study of IFC’s effectiveness at lesson learning (through self-evaluation or in other
ways) conducted for this evaluation concludes that IFC has a fragmented approach
to lesson learning with no clear framework for capturing, storing and acting on
lessons and that no high-level champion for this has emerged.7 All 14 staff and
managers interviewed for the study thought IFC’s lesson-learning system is in need
of overhaul. Participants in the electronic survey of all IFC staff were asked to rate
the effectiveness of IFC’s lesson learning by selecting one of five categories:
Completely ineffective, slightly effective, moderately effective, very effective, and

totally effective. These were converted into scores from 0 to 4, with 4 being “totally
effective.” The average effectiveness score is 1.81 out of 4 (figure 4.1).8 Staff at grades
GG (senior) have the least favorable perception of IFC’s lesson learning
effectiveness, while staff at grades GA-GD (administrative and client support) have
the most favorable perception. Numerous projects are believed to have failed as a
result of repeating the mistakes of the past.


 Box 4-3. Good Practice Approaches to Learning from Self-Evaluation
 The Governance Global Practice organized a “boot camp” in 2014, in which in-depth
 reviews of ICRs were undertaken with the objective of learning lessons to feed into
 ongoing and future operations. The teams used the ICRs as a springboard to present,
 analyze, and interpret the lessons, contextualizing them with rich tacit information they
 had from their experiences. This strategic use of evidence with discussion and debate
 proved to be valuable and insightful for the participants.
 The Public-Private Partnership team set up a process where small meetings are used to
 capture critical lessons from each transaction. The Africa Region synthesized ICRs over
 the period 2011 to 2014 to inform actions to improve portfolio performance. IFC’s Results
 Measurement Unit reviews PCRs for lessons and reasons for failure and success. MIGA
 has seminars to present project self-evaluations to MIGA staff.
 Source: IEG interviews.


Staff often prefer tacit knowledge—”having coffee with peers”—to obtain nuanced
knowledge and experience, but self-evaluation systems do not exploit dialogue
formats as part of the learning process. In IFC, this tacit oral approach is regarded as
“IFC style” and it works well for experienced staff in Washington. However,
interviews recognized that this approach was not sustainable as IFC grows in size
and geographic reach. Dialogue and tacit knowledge alone is insufficient—experts
on knowledge management note that once individual lessons, evidence, or
information are generated, they should be culled, codified, and turned into
actionable guidance for implementation or strategy formulation as weaknesses in
documenting key lessons and over-reliance on personal connections can lead to
inefficiencies and loss of important knowledge. Combining written and dialogue-
based formats could boost learning from self-evaluation. The health, airline, and
energy industries are more attuned to the value of good lesson learning, which can
be mission-critical or lifesaving. Many hospitals, for example, conduct post-mortems
to this end. When researchers traced the source of hospital infections to improper
handwashing, this was developed into a checklist that is now widely used and has
reduced hospital infections (Gawande 2009).

CHAPTER 4
LEARNING FROM SELF-EVALUATION
The World Bank Group could usefully build more dialogue into self-evaluation
processes. Some parts of the World Bank Group use deliberative meetings to reflect
on experiences—most systematically in the PPP group and in parts of IFC’s

Advisory Services—and these were seen as useful safe spaces for learning. The
validation process could include (non-antagonistic) dialogue between the author,
the project team, and the validator aiming to explore the set of relevant lessons. Peer
review processes could require dialogue formats instead of report formats for
sharing knowledge on past projects, involving peer-to-peer learning.

There are also opportunities for more consistently exploiting self-evaluations to
drive on-the-job learning and professional growth of junior staff (box 4.4). None of
the staff and managers interviewed discussed strategically choosing an ICR or XPSR
author with a view to promote learning, say to feed into a follow-on operation or to
address strategic issues. Many ICRs and CLRs are written by consultants rather than
staff, according to interviews and reports’ acknowledgment pages.9 The reasons they
are outsourced are varied and legitimate—time constraints, desire for impartiality,
and skills in writing a report that meets the requirements—but, by using
consultants, the World Bank’s forgoes an opportunity for contextual learning by
staff and also signals the low priority placed on self-evaluation. In IFC, junior
investment officers write XPSRs, thus seizing this opportunity for learning about
project design, processing, and execution from investments made by the department
(although for accountability purposes the XPSRs are sampled randomly by IEG and
not strategically to meet learning needs). The same applies to MIGA, where junior
underwriters write PERs.


 Box 4-4. Facilitating Active Learning With and From Others through Self-Evaluation
 The literature indicates that in addition to knowledge generation, organizational learning is
 supported by creating an environment in which people are expected to learn constantly
 (through a range of modalities, such as on-the-job learning, mentoring, and training) and
 opportunities are available for the application of that knowledge. Organizations that value
 learning also promote a culture in which ways of thinking and mental models are
 challenged in an environment of trust (Senge 1990). Research shows that when companies
 adopt “formalized informal learning,” those programs outperform formal training by 3 to 1
 (Jackson and Williamson 2011; Mallon, Clarey, and Vickers 2012). In these companies the
 corporate training team not only trains people, it puts in place programs to help employees
 learn on the job, an important aspect of transmitting tacit knowledge. Concrete practices
 and processes are required; simply having an environment supportive of learning is
 insufficient (Garvin, Edmonson, and Gino 2008). Leaders in the field of evaluation also note
 the importance of participatory approaches to enhance learning (Mayne 2015).


LESSONS
ICR lessons have a justified reputation of being rather obvious and generic. The
evaluation team’s review of ICR lessons covered 60 ICRs with an average of 5.8
lessons per ICR. The majority of the lessons pertained to sectoral issues (70 percent);
10 percent to country-level issues, primarily in development policy lending (DPL)
operations; and the remaining 20 percent were cross-cutting. Eighty-eight percent of
the lessons were worded as “lessons” (as opposed to “findings”), and ought
therefore to be generalizable to future operations in other countries. Lessons were
often written in very general terms, without specific recommendations on how to do
things differently in the future (for example, “complex project design in a low-


                                                                                             63
CHAPTER 4
LEARNING FROM SELF-EVALUATION
capacity environment leads to poor implementation and non-attainment of
objectives”10). Further, 74 percent of the lessons pertained to design issues; 21
percent to implementation; 3 percent to internal institutional issues; and 2 percent to
external causes.

The evidence behind lessons was sometimes weak:

        18 percent of lessons were backed up by solid evidence presented in the ICR
         that discusses the issue and the consequences of the issue.
        30 percent of lessons were backed up by some supporting evidence in the
         ICR.
        34 percent of lessons lack supporting evidence and analysis.
        18 percent of lessons appear to come completely out of the blue.

The lessons were not always applicable:

        28 percent of lessons were very specific on how things should be done
         differently in the future.
        47 percent pointed toward a direction, but readers would need more
         information to know specifically what to do.
        24 percent were too broad and did not specify what to do in the future.

Thus, several issues hamper the potential for better lesson learning from the ICR.
The ICR document is both a reporting and a lesson learning tool and does not allow
for a systematic approach to recording lessons. Lesson learning would require
reading the entire document. Lessons are not consistently quality-controlled and
evidence-based and may not sufficiently cover internal institutional issues. And
whereas each ICR provides one data point, lesson-learning should be based on
mining a set of experiences to ensure that lessons are turned into knowledge with
applicability across contexts.

In interviews, Bank and IFC staff placed low value on information and lessons from
self-evaluations and expressed the view that the “right” lessons are not being
captured and that lessons captured fail to address the most critical issues, are too
generic, or too specific. Across the World Bank Group, 48 percent of those interviewed
cited one or more major obstacles to using the lessons from the mandatory self-
evaluations. Staff observed that similar types of lessons appear in project after project,
year after year, yet they are not acted upon and addressed in future operations.11 For
example, interviewees noted that self-evaluations are normally silent on lessons
pertaining to Bank Group internal constraints such as team leader turnover, the
factors leading to excessive complexity of projects, and client-related issues. Such
critical factors can result in mistakes and problems that are worth learning from but

tend to be left out of self-evaluations. In part, this is because Bank (but not IFC and
MIGA) self-evaluations are disclosed to the public.

IFC lessons were found to be of variable quality. IFC lessons were assessed for
quality using a system that recognizes that lessons have certain components,
referred to in the military as Observations, Insights, Lessons representing the train of
thought from an observation through to deriving a recommendation for future
projects. Average lesson quality in IFC was found to be relatively low, even though
there are some good examples within IFC. Lesson quality is highest (though still
variable) in the lessons in the XPSRs and LessonFinder, although even these were
described by interviewees as poor or variable in quality. Likewise, a majority of IFC
survey respondents thought that lessons are a mix of good and bad quality. Where
quality was poor, a large proportion of the “lessons” were observations rather than
lessons. Forty percent of the lessons in the “Lessons of Experience” and “Learning
By Doing” and 50 percent in the Post Vivems, for example, contained no
recommendations for the future, or only weak generic statements. Similarly, the
majority of the lessons within SmartLessons are observations or mini-case studies
under a vague heading such as “raise awareness at multiple levels” or “partner with
the press.” Root cause analysis in many of the lessons is superficial, and looks
primarily at external root causes rather than addressing issues within IFC. The
mixed quality of lessons was also recognized by survey participants. If staff find
brief or vague statements rather than useful content, they stop seeking.

There is no systematic support offered to Bank and IFC self-evaluation authors or
users to facilitate lessons identification and learning. There is little guidance on how
to write good lessons and no processes of using dialogue formats to help authors
discover key findings and lessons—a missed opportunity because, in the World
Bank Group’s face-to-face culture, dialogue would likely spur better lessons and
greater use of them. IFC stores its lessons in different systems; sometimes as
individual lesson documents collected within a file folder, sometimes as sections
within project reports. Few survey respondents were aware that lessons were also
collected in a lessons database, LessonFinder.

IMPACT EVALUATIONS
Results from Bank impact evaluations are well-regarded but still underused in
reporting on project effectiveness or integrating them as lessons. World Bank and
other impact evaluation hubs put a lot of emphasis on disseminating information
about these evaluations through newsletters, research publications, seminars, and
other media. Some World Bank sector strategies have included the findings in areas
in which there is large body of evidence from impact evaluations, such as education
and social protection, thus reflecting systematic use of knowledge for organizational


                                                                                          65
CHAPTER 4
LEARNING FROM SELF-EVALUATION
purposes (IEG 2012). There continues to be room to use impact evaluations to a
greater extent to inform operational decisions, according to IEG’s 2012 evaluation of
impact evaluations, interviews done for this evaluation, and IEG’s report on Social
Safety Nets and Gender. According to the latter, if projects are not conscious of
potential gender impacts, they do not collect gender-disaggregated data and do not
make the best use of existing impact evaluation evidence. Coupled with the lack of
attention to gender in project monitoring, this raises questions about missed
opportunities for learning (IEG 2014b). Interviews with team leaders indicated that
they have little time to familiarize themselves with recent findings and rely on their
own networks of colleagues when they have questions, making lessons application
somewhat idiosyncratic.

Bank-sponsored impact evaluations could improve how they serve operations by
more effectively brokering knowledge and by explicitly including reflections on the
evaluated project and lessons in future ones. More could be done to mine the
evidence, for example by conducting and better using existing systematic reviews
and by better bridging the agendas and priorities of researchers and operational
staff. While several regional chief economists’ offices have an impact evaluation
point of contact, they are generally responsible for conducting and supporting
impact evaluations in their Region rather than for disseminating evaluation
findings. Assigning responsibility for knowledge translation to dedicated
“knowledge brokers” could help transfer information from impact evaluations into
actionable lessons in the competitive space for staff attention. Some parts of the
World Bank’s, the Africa Region for example, have seen good results from engaging
in several of these modalities and may be a useful template upon which other
Regions and Global Practices can build.


Shape, Scope, Timing, and Content of Reporting
Driven by corporate requirements (Operational Policy 13.60 for the World Bank’s),
the vast majority of self-evaluations are project-specific (CLRs are an exception) and
summative in nature. There are benefits to this way of doing things from a reporting
and accountability perspective, but clear drawbacks from a learning perspective.

First, the aid architecture emphasizes programmatic approaches, yet the gravity of the
self-evaluation architecture remains the project (except CLRs). As Bank management
has emphasized, this “project mentality” does not square with the “development
solution” mentality implied by the World Bank Group Strategy. To facilitate learning
and guide strategic decisions, it can help to focus evaluations around themes, sectors,
or clusters of similar projects (IEG does this in its evaluations and learning products,



66
                                                                              CHAPTER 4
                                                          LEARNING FROM SELF-EVALUATION
as do evaluation departments in other organizations). Interviewees and focus group
participants noted that self-evaluations rarely address questions of strategic
importance for upcoming operations or to the sector, but that there is potential to
institute this approach for clusters of projects. Impact evaluation hubs12 sponsor
impact evaluations of individual projects that are clustered around themes and
within Regions, for example on gender in Africa or results-based health financing.

Second, and related, the systems pay little attention to synergies (or lack thereof)
across activities. For example: Do knowledge, lending, and policy dialogue activities
mesh well? For trans-border issues such as water and transport, are there synergies
between activities in adjacent countries?

Third, funding is tied to project evaluations. Business units can commission
evaluations on any topic they desire, but IEG did not identify any routine evaluation
funding sources other than donor funds for impact and program evaluations and the
administrative budget procedures that are used to finance the mandatory self-
evaluations (see appendix C). Funding for formative, voluntary evaluations is
therefore not readily available and it is not known how many are conducted. Key
informants from the World Bank’s noted the difficulty in securing funding for
evaluations of government interventions in areas where the World Bank’s does not
have an active lending program, limiting opportunities to engage.

Fourth, there is room to improve on self-evaluation timing to support timely
learning and decision-making:

       For Bank investment projects for which ICR reviews were completed in FY15,
        the most frequent year in which they were approved was FY06, nine years
        earlier, and they hence shed little light on how well current approaches to
        project design tackle development problems (the lag time is a few years less
        for XPSRs and policy lending). This is because they are done after closing.
       The timing of XPSRs is somewhat flexible, and CLRs are timed to inform the
        next country program, but ICR timing is not flexible: always done within six
        months of closing, ICRs come too late to inform follow-on operations which
        are prepared before project closing. Hence there is no room to consider
        optimal evaluation timing.
       Decisions about course corrections and scaling up pilot interventions need to
        benefit from accurate and timely evaluative results (Linn 2012). IEG’s
        evaluation of the poverty orientation of country programs therefore
        recommended “attention at project inception to evaluability” and “explicit
        evaluation protocols for piloted interventions to capture lessons from




                                                                                      67
CHAPTER 4
LEARNING FROM SELF-EVALUATION
         experience on poverty reduction, with a view toward opportunities for
         scaling up successful interventions” (2015b).
        The writers of some ICRs and PCRs have not had time to complete planned
         beneficiary surveys or other data collection that would facilitate accurate
         measurement. For IFC advisory services, BROE 2013 recommended post-
         completion monitoring to address the timing issues.13
        Likewise, interviewees expressed a desire for more timely impact evaluation
         findings. Leaders in the impact evaluation community have indicated that
         they are aware of this concern and are working to integrate impact
         evaluation methods into project monitoring systems to be able to provide
         mid-course interim findings to help projects make needed course corrections.

Consistent with this, key informants from the World Bank’s advocated for more
flexibility: some projects may need frequent assessments during implementation
and some projects may need to be revisited five years after closing depending on
their profile and impact. Users who participated in focus groups want flexible
systems that are transparent, adaptable, and promote real-time learning and
information sharing. They also argued that more could be done to capture
knowledge gained during implementation, ideally right after missions for easy
recall (see appendix H).

Fifth, a more comprehensive assessment of unintended positive and negative
consequences could promote learning. As Vinod Thomas and Xubei Luo (2012:9)
argued, “Unintended results can provide a rich source of learning for future
activities and checks on current ones.” An evolving good practice for impact
evaluations is to pair quantitative methods with qualitative methods to understand
not only what happened and what the results were, but also how the program was
implemented and why the outcomes came out as they did.

Sixth, some of the nuts and bolts such as sector and theme codes and core sector
indicators facilitate the aggregation of project information. According to guidelines,
“the World Bank’s theme and sector coding system provides the basis for analyzing
and reporting on the content of Bank activities,” and “responds to shareholder
recommendations for standard reporting.”14 Teams do not have the flexibility to use
theme codes that align with common knowledge topics (such as child labor or
school feeding).15 Imposing core sector indicators can promote useful standard
reporting but also crowd out the ability to adapt metrics to the project context and to
learning needs.

 Box 4-5. Learning from Evaluation in Other Agencies
 The evaluation community has responded in various ways to enhance uptake and
 learning, yet learning from self- and independent evaluations remains weaker than
 desired in several development agencies, according to studies. For example, a study on
 the uptake of learning in the European Union’s Directorate-General for International
 Cooperation and Development cites issues such as lack of systematic attempts in most
 reports to compile lessons, rigid methodologies that disincentivize learning, tendency
 toward bureaucratic compliance, and lack of staff time for learning. Both the Asian
 Development Bank (ADB) and the African Development Bank (AfDB) have launched
 knowledge platforms to enhance sharing of findings, lessons, and recommendations from
 past projects. An evaluation of the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) self-evaluation
 system finds learning to be weak. The evaluation community has adopted good practice
 guidelines, and, to improve timeliness, started conducting more formative (or real-time)
 evaluations.
 Sources: European Commission (2014); Nielsen, Turksema, and Knaap (2015); Independent Evaluation Office
 (IMF)(2015); Thomas and Luo (2012). See also Appendix B.


Summing up, summative (backward-looking) evaluation purposes sideline more
formative (learning-oriented) purposes in how systems operate. If the self-
evaluation systems had been set up to primarily serve learning, they would have
been more forward-looking (how can we do better?), more selective (which projects
and programs offer the greatest learning opportunities?), more programmatic (are
there synergies across activities and countries?), attuned to unintended
consequences, and more often done in real-time. As an operational Practice Manager
expressed, “fundamentally, [self-evaluations] should be formative and not
summative. They cannot do both for a range of reasons…As an institution we need
to pick our objective, we can’t have it both ways.” The Bank Group is not alone in
facing weak learning from self-evaluation (box 4.5).


Incentives to Learn from Self-Evaluations
Almost 70 percent of Bank staff agree or strongly agree that lending pressure crowds
out learning (IEG 2014b). Similarly, in interviews for the current evaluation, staff
noted that there is an implicit “pressure to lend” and the self-evaluations are
primarily a tool for reporting, although impact evaluations are supporting learning.

The Bank Group’s strong culture of success and competition leads staff to be wary
about acknowledging issues or problems that may be interpreted as failure in
projects (box 4.6). An overwhelming majority—78 percent—of the interviewees
specifically mentioned that there are either no incentives or negative incentives for
candid self-evaluation. Forty percent noted negative incentives for reporting issues

that may be interpreted as failure; some worried about the implications on their
professional reputation.


 Box 4-6. Learning from Failure
 Literature on organizational development states that the critical examination of failure can
 trigger learning, especially when organizations diagnose not only the proximal causes of
 failure but also examine the underlying causes—policies, norms, and objectives—and
 develop mechanisms for improvement, which can also lead to innovations.a The World
 Development Report (2015 chapter 10) also emphasized that it is important to recognize
 that “‘failure’ is sometimes unavoidable in development and encouraging individuals to
 learn, rather than hide, from it.” A review of results measurement systems among bilateral
 donors emphasizes the need for a “strong and mature results culture with incentives to
 strengthen results measurement and [an] enabling environment to discuss poor and good
 performance.b

The absence of a safe space for trying things out, identifying and discussing
problems and failures, and accumulating knowledge from failure was a recurrent
theme in interviews and focus groups. Interviews done for this evaluation also
suggest that the World Bank’s has room to better embrace the “failures” identified
by Bank-sponsored impact evaluations. Some impact evaluations reporting “null”
result—findings of weak or no results—have met with lukewarm or obstructionist
responses, though in other instances researchers have been able to use null results to
impel closer collaboration and investigation with the client country. Lack of candor
is equally applicable to IFC, as evidenced by interviews and BROE (2013), even
though ratings are less salient there, with profitability the bigger concern. The staff,
therefore, in the words of an interviewee, “focus on what is needed” to be consistent
with guidelines and to avoid a downgrade. Lesson learning has no high-level IFC
champion, and many of the signals staff perceive (or interpret) from management
promote short-term actions, and some interviewed IFC staff expressed cynicism
about lesson learning.

The system’s focus on accountability and reporting creates negative associations
among intended users, leading to under-use. Ratings can, in principle, focus
attention and stimulate action. Yet users reported overwhelmingly negative
experiences with the ratings and validation processes; these frustrating experiences
caused negative perceptions of the systems in general and IEG’s role in particular.
Staff perceive that ratings and validations focus too rigidly on documentation
requirements associated with the initial project objectives and results frameworks,
and often feel unfairly assessed by IEG, making them disassociate from the process
and the information it generates. Sixty percent of the World Bank’s staff interviewed

                                                                             CHAPTER 4
                                                         LEARNING FROM SELF-EVALUATION
stated that they are concerned with ratings and potential disconnect with IEG and
that this preoccupation leads them to focus less on learning from self-evaluation
(figure 4.2).

Figure 4.2. Incentives around Learning




IEG reviewed a random sample of 74 substantive email responses received from
Global Practices in response to ICR reviews and found that nearly all (72 of 74)
disputed ratings (often arguing that IEG had misinterpreted evidence, results
frameworks, or that guidance was unclear). These responses only rarely discussed
learning and lessons: eight mentioned learning, but six in the context of defending
the ICR and 18 mentioned lessons, but 11 in the context of defending the ICR. The
review also judged the tone of ICR review responses to be mostly factual but at
times crossing into antagonistic (16 percent of responses, but only in parts) and
personal or emotional (14 percent).16 On a similar note, interviewees from the World
Bank’s noted that meetings to review draft ICRs rarely focus on lessons and
implications and, instead, tend to focus on proposed ratings and their congruence
with the available evidence in anticipation of the reaction from IEG’s validator.

In interviews, ratings were the second-most frequently cited obstacle to learning,
after the nature of the lessons. The issues noted by staff square well with findings
from educational scholars on the impact of grading on students focus, learning, and
motivation (box 4.7)—although potentially ratings can also drive attention and
action. This said, the ratings validation process is far from the only reason that
learning is below potential. Some quotes illustrate how interviewees perceived the
impact of ratings on learning:

      “We do not learn from the graveyards around us” because “ratings are a
       lightning rod.”



                                                                                    71
CHAPTER 4
LEARNING FROM SELF-EVALUATION
      “Framing self-evaluation as an accountability tool automatically makes it
        confrontational.”
      “As a manager, every month I take a look at the dashboard and what
        unfortunately focuses the attention is the disconnect with IEG. If there is no
        disconnect, then there is a feeling of relief and the team moves on without
        further reflection.”

      “Learning is hindered by the tension created by judging/ratings and the
       need for accountability/justifying use of resources for projects. The Bank
       environment is competitive and focused on promotions, so people respond
       to ratings and this hinders learning.”



 Box 4-7. Grades and Learning
 Educational scholars long have studied the effects of feedback in general and grades in
 particular on students from elementary school to college. The literature is far too vast to
 be summarized here, but a few noteworthy themes are worth highlighting.
 First, feedback has a powerful influence on student learning and achievement. To be
 useful, feedback should be frequent, specific, and on a small chunk of course content. It
 should be timely to help students pay attention to further learning while it still matters.
 Second, grading shapes incentives in powerful ways and tends to dominate students’
 focus and interest. A number of studies have described students receiving their
 assignment back, glancing at the mark at the bottom, and then throwing it away,
 including all the feedback. “Students may tackle essays that are intended as learning
 activities so as to maximize grades they obtain rather than maximizing the learning
 achieved from engaging with the assignment” (Gibbs and Simpson 2005). Likewise,
 studies of higher education students have found them to spend considerable effort on
 discovering what portion of the curriculum that is likely to appear in exams.
 Third, a “grading orientation” is different from, and in many ways opposed to, a
 “learning orientation.” Extrinsic motivation (desire to get better grades) can undermine
 intrinsic motivation (desire to learn for its own sake) even in higher education, for
 example by inducing a preference for easier tasks, avoidance of unnecessary intellectual
 risks, and a tendency for skimming books for what is likely to come up in tests. Grade-
 oriented environments experience increased levels of cheating, and fear of failure even in
 high-achieving students.
 Educational institutions have been slow to take note of these findings. Some have
 responded by providing more frequent and focused feedback, and some medical schools
 and many Ph.D. programs have moved to pass/fail systems rather than grading.

Summing Up
Self-evaluation generates some individual learning but the potential of the systems
for organizational learning is unfulfilled. Knowledge from systems is rarely valued
or used, except by IEG, and there is little effort to extract and synthesize evidence
and lessons or to inform operations. Lessons have a justified reputation for being of
low value.

The systems’ focus on accountability drives the shape, scope, timing, and content of
reporting and limit the usefulness of the exercise for learning. Reporting against
objectives for all individual projects at closing makes sense from an accountability
perspective, but does not foster learning and has become a source of tension and
perceived rigidity. Staff often feel unfairly assessed, making them disassociate from
the process and the information it generates.

These shortcomings have to be understood within the context of a corporate culture
that often rewards delivery over learning. Parts of the system not focused on
accountability such as impact evaluations and other voluntary self-evaluations
produce far more learning, indicating that when conditions are right, the World Bank
Group has a strong demand for evaluative learning and a robust ability to supply it.

7The study looked only at lesson learning, a category of operational learning, and not at IFC’s numerous
broader ongoing learning initiatives which are not the subject of this evaluation.
8 IEG surveyed the entire staff of IFC, including consultants, on the capturing and use of lessons from
July 7 to 14, 2015. Out of 4,586 names in the HR database, IEG received 935 survey answers, representing
a response rate of 21 percent. The margin of error for the entire response is +/- 3 percentage points, with
95 percent confidence level.
9 The ICR authors are listed in each ICR and will always--as a rule--have a Bank staff as team lead for the

ICR (rarely the same as the team lead for the project covered by the ICR). A consultant is usually also
listed. There is no system-based way of knowing of the two, who did how much of the writing, analysis,
and data collection. In interviews, the team heard repeatedly that consultants do the bulk of the work in
many but far from all cases. Management indicates that they have begun more often assigning staff to
write ICRs, including junior staff so as to foster learning.

From this group, it was found that IEG had not received a ‘substantial’ response to 124 ICRR (meaning
GPs either agreed with the ratings, had no comments, or did not reply at all. From the remaining 104

 5. Conclusions and Recommendations
This evaluation set out to assess whether the operational self-evaluation systems of
the World Bank Group are suited to their stated purposes. The evaluation found
several positive aspects: The design and operation of the systems adhere to relevant
good practice standards, coverage is comprehensive, and many evaluation experts
consider the World Bank Group’s systems as good as or better than those in
comparable organizations. The systems produce corporate results measures that are
easy to report externally and to compare across time, contexts, and sectors. Guidelines
and review processes exist, and there is ongoing, process-driven use of the
information generated for performance management and accountability. The systems
mesh well with the World Bank Group’s independent evaluation systems for which
they provide information. Compliance with requirements is mostly strong.
Stakeholders have unparalleled access to the ratings, self-evaluations, and validation
documents.1 Staff and managers engage seriously and responsibly, and considerable
resources go into feeding and using systems (a low-end estimate puts the cost of
producing self-evaluation at $15 million, 0.6 percent of the World Bank Group’s
annual administrative budget).

Yet the emphasis in the 2013 World Bank Group Strategy on developing a “Solutions
Bank” and learning to enhance performance is not well-served by existing self-
evaluation systems. Information generated through the current systems is not
systematically mined for learning except by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG)
and use of the systems for project and portfolio performance management can be
improved. The focus on corporate results reporting for accountability has sidelined
use of the systems for these other purposes.

Some of the shortcomings identified by this evaluation are inherent in the design of
the systems, others relate to how they are used. The systems are mostly project-
focused, objective-based, and geared toward accountability (“did activities achieve
their stated objectives?”), and thus have built-in limitations for driving performance
(“what needs to change so that we can deliver better for clients?”) or generating
learning (“what worked well and what could we have done better?”). Also, using
results-based management systems blindly can lead to excessive focus on simple
outputs and underinvestment in complex, long-term strengthening of client systems.
Finally, ratings are a useful part of the systems but tensions associated with IEG’s
rating validation process are unnecessarily prominent and distracting.

In economics, it is well-established that multiple goals cannot be achieved with a
single instrument. The same applies to self-evaluation. In the current organizational


                                                                                     77
CHAPTER 5
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
environment, it is unrealistic to expect that self-evaluation systems can
simultaneously and fully deliver on performance management, robust measurement
of results for accountability, and learning. There are trade-offs among these
objectives that have been insufficiently recognized and, in practice, the main thrust
has been on results measurement for external reporting.


Evolution of the Self-Evaluation Systems
The Bank Group has not had a coherent approach to how, how often, and in what
direction systems ought to evolve. Several documents establish the current
expectations for the systems as encompassing support for performance
management, accountability and rigorous measurement of results, and learning, but
no single document sets out guiding principles or priorities. The 2013 Strategy adds
an ambition of linking evaluation to the institution’s twin goals, which are yet to be
achieved. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has expressed a desire to
reform its monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system to better meet its learning and
business needs but reconciling this with the reporting and accountability functions
provided by the existing systems proved contentious. The Bank has simplified the
Implementation Status and Results Report (ISR), whereas the most recent major
change to the Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) was in 2006.

There has been talk about integrating the diverse results measurement systems in
place across the World Bank Group institutions and product lines. Doing so would
be misguided. Already, corporate results reporting overshadows other purposes so
that information from systems is less useful and less used for performance
management and learning. Different product lines differ in their information needs
and, to be relevant and useful, systems should respond to these needs in the first
place. Also, the International Development Association (IDA) needs an IDA-specific
results framework for demonstrating its results.


Mapping Behaviors and Incentives
Key groups of people engage with the systems in ways that are fueled by a
compliance mindset more than a learning mindset. Levels of frustration and
mistrust are high, and many perceive systems to add little value. The systems map
(figure 5.1) illustrates in three loops the ways in which behaviors and incentives for
staff and managers constrain the usefulness of the systems:2

        There is excessive focus on ratings in how the systems are used, exacerbated
         by a competitive organizational culture. This can make staff focus on

                                                                                CHAPTER 5
                                                         CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
          avoiding negative ratings and disconnect and can limit candor and lead to
          attempts at “gaming the process,” making results reporting less than fully
          accurate (first loop).
         Attention to volume overshadows attention to results. The push for new
          deals, lending, and disbursements displaces incentives to invest in M&E and,
          without good data, systems create little value and are only partially used for
          project performance management. Thus, many managerial tasks rely on
          other data and occur outside the systems (second loop).
         The perceived value of the knowledge created is low, too many risks and
          failures are hidden, safe spaces to learn from failure are missing, lessons and
          knowledge are not mined, and systems therefore create little organizational
          learning (third loop).

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
experience for staff must improve (box 5.1). Interview respondents from across the
World Bank Group characterized the self-evaluation processes as an elaborate
architecture to “feed the bureaucratic beast” with data that add little value. Staff did
not understand how management and the Board use information produced by the
systems. Consistent with the external panel review of IEG (see box 3.4), people who
were interviewed or participated in focus groups were eager for reform that, in their
view, should not result in additional work pressure and complexity and needed to
address incentives. As one manager said: “Self-evaluations are only as good as the
intention, candor, and use to which they are put. Systems may change at the margin,
but unless signals and other factors change, not much will improve.”

Staff is not the only group for whom systems fail to produce much value. The main
focus is on the Board, donors, senior management, and arguably IEG, to some extent
at the expense of other stakeholders, particularly governments, implementing
agencies, firms, and even beneficiaries and citizens. In some cases these stakeholders
do not find the value they are looking for and instead find the systems to be
burdensome, bureaucratic, and irrelevant. It may not be possible for the World Bank
Group to realize all of the potential value for all potential stakeholders, but systems
need to produce value to the primary beneficiaries of the “Solutions Bank,” and to
the team and line management where the need for learning arguably is strongest.

Many staff are intrinsically motivated to help clients deliver results, and value
working toward improvement and learning, but managerial signals and
organizational habits distract. IEG’s report Learning and Results in World Bank
Operations: Toward a New Learning Strategy suggests that the World Bank’s needs a
fresh approach to learning and knowledge sharing, one that that affords sufficient
weight to behavioral drivers, to rigorous measurement of results so that meaningful
learning can take place, and to achieving results so that learning for learning’s sake
is avoided. Both this evaluation and IEG’s two evaluations on Bank learning call for
wide-ranging changes to deep-rooted organizational habits. How should such
reforms be designed? This evaluation was not able to identify any comparable
organization with clearly better systems that could be imitated. The four user-centric
design workshops conducted as part of this evaluation indicate that reforms will be
hard to design because many different systems are intertwined, stakeholders have
conflicting needs, and, for people deeply familiar with existing systems, it is hard to
visualize what highly functioning systems look like.

Unleashing the Potential of Self-Evaluation
Staff and management perceive IEG’s validation function as yet another obstacle to
overcome and many staff erroneously believe IEG to be the “owner” of systems that,
in fact, are owned by management. Yet because IEG has worked collaboratively with
management over the years in designing, maintaining, evolving, and refining
systems, the current state of affairs is a shared responsibility between management,
IEG, and to some extent the Board on whose behalf IEG conducts validations.



 Box 5-1. Applying User-Centric Analysis to Understanding Self-Evaluation
 User centric analysis offers several important and additional insights into the practice of self-
 evaluation more generally, and into the challenges specific to the World Bank Group’s self -
 evaluation systems. User-centric analysis considers “usability” as a sub-set of the user experience.
 Usability describes the extent to which a system, product, or service can be deployed by specified
 users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
 Unique to user-centric analysis is the dimension of “satisfaction.” The “nudge team” of the United
 Kingdom has proposed four dimensions for user satisfaction—“easy,” “attractive,” “social,” and
 “timely” (EAST).
 Do the World Bank Group’s self-evaluation systems offer “user satisfaction”? There are two kinds
 of users—those users that feed the system and those users that look to finding the ratings or the
 records to offer a realistic description of the past. Neither user experience appears to be anywhere
 close to being easy, attractive, social, or timely:

 In interviews with users, dissatisfaction was the dominant theme and few if any cited positive
 attributes to their actual experience with systems. There was a lack of trust and little sense that
 systems provide a service to the user. Positive aspects named, if any, pertained more to the overall
 function of having accountability, which is needed, and not to the actual experience.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Realizing the potential of self-evaluation to support the World Bank Group’s
strategy and the twin goals will require greater clarity and better balance between
accountability, performance management, and learning objectives. The
accountability function of mandatory self-evaluation is essential and should not be
sacrificed, so when reforming systems, options to enhance learning should be
explored while maintaining the accountability function. There is a need to work
toward a more learning-oriented culture where users trust systems and have
dramatically more positive experiences interacting with them.


Recommendations
This evaluation identifies three broad causes of misaligned incentives for writing
and using self-evaluations (illustrated in the three loops in figure 5.1): (1) excessive
focus on ratings, (2) attention to volume that overshadows attention to results, and
(3) low perceived value of the knowledge created. The evaluation proposes five
recommendations to address these issues.

First Loop: Excessive Focus on Ratings

The planned reform of the ICR process, template, and guidelines is an opportunity
to correct the incentives and signals surrounding self-evaluation, building on the
heightened attention that management has started to pay to results frameworks.
Staff perceive that the prevailing interpretation of the IEG/OPSC harmonized
objectives-based approach to rating and validating ICRs limits the appetite for
innovation and causes inflexibility for project management. Adaptability can be
promoted through increased flexibility in project design that minimizes the need to
amend legal agreements as well as through simplified Bank and client restructuring
procedures. There is a need to promote more constructive interactions between IEG
and operational departments over project validations without losing sight of IEG’s
accountability function. Something that would help with this would be a mechanism
to flag up when unsuccessful outcomes are caused by major shocks outside the
control of the World Bank’s such as, for example, disasters, conflict, and economic
crises. The harmonized ICR rating and validation guidelines give insufficient
attention to beneficiaries’ views and to unintended positive and negative
consequences.

Recommendation 1: Reform the ICR system and its validation to make it more
compatible with innovation and course corrections. As the report explains, project
teams should be able to change course faster and more often. The ICR system should
better account for unintended positive and negative outcomes, beneficiaries’

                                                                              CHAPTER 5
                                                       CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
perspectives, and unforeseeable shocks in how results are measured and projects are
rated (applies to the World Bank and to IEG’s role in validation).

Measuring and rating project outcomes at closing against objectives stated at design
years earlier has become a source of tension and perceived rigidity, given that the
quality assurance of results frameworks at the time of project design is insufficient
and that the options of restructuring and adaptive project management have not
taken root.

Recommendation 2: Help staff understand that project objectives pertaining to
innovating, piloting, and testing are feasible and that projects with such
objectives are rated appropriately, provided the project development objective and
indicators are set in the right way (applies to World Bank and IFC, with implications
for IEG).

Second Loop: Attention to Volume Sometimes Overshadows Results

Demand from the World Bank Group Board and management for knowledge and
evidence to enhance development effectiveness has not been matched by a corporate
learning culture. Managerial signals emphasize business volume more than they do
results, performance, and good self-evaluation; tensions over ratings and
disconnects distract from learning; and there is room to more consistently infuse
existing learning, strategic, and planning processes with evaluative evidence. The
Board has a role also to reinforce these signals.

Recommendation 3: Strengthen rewards and leadership signals at all levels of the
organization to reinforce the importance of self-evaluation. For example, this can
be done by promoting use of the knowledge generated from self-evaluations by
teams, practices, and senior management, and by balancing the current excessive
focus on outcome ratings and disconnects with more deliberative use of monitoring
and self-evaluation information by teams and managers (applies to World Bank and
IFC).

Identification of problems and solutions could be strengthened by having more
reliable monitoring data and using that data more consistently in safe space
deliberative meetings aimed at identifying and discussing problems. The M&E
systems that generate the underlying evidence for results have long-standing
shortcomings, despite various initiatives to strengthen M&E and results orientation.
Strengthening M&E is especially important for projects with new or innovative
designs and will also require building client M&E capacity in collaboration with
partners.



                                                                                        83
CHAPTER 5
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Recommendation 4: Formulate a more systematic approach to improving M&E
quality. As the report explains, this would entail building staff and clients’ M&E
capacity, demonstrating to clients the value of M&E, and provisioning of specialized
M&E skills at key moments of the project cycle for targeted projects (applies to the
World Bank and IFC).

Third Loop: The Perceived Value of Knowledge from Self-evaluation is Low

Corporate requirements specify the scope, timing, and content of self-evaluations in
a way that supports reporting more than it does learning. For example, most self-
evaluations continue to be project-specific, with similar approach and depth,
regardless of the learning potential. Mandatory and voluntary self-evaluations are
not used strategically to meet knowledge gaps and approaches to using them for
lesson learning are fragmented, further fueling staff perceptions of low importance.
There is scope to strengthen Bank-wide oversight and the regional and thematic
selectivity of impact evaluations, the uptake of findings from impact evaluations,
and the use of information systems for capturing, classification, and availability of
Bank Group mandatory and voluntary self-evaluations. IFC has a fragmented
approach to lesson learning with no clear framework for capturing, storing and
acting on lessons and no high-level champion for this has emerged.

Recommendation 5: Expand voluntary evaluations that respond to learning needs
of management and teams. These include impact and process evaluations,
retrospectives, and beneficiary surveys and need not be project-specific but can
cover multiple interventions in a given sector, country, or region, depending on
learning needs. Building on recent progress, further enhance the manner in which
impact evaluations respond to learning needs through greater regional and thematic
selectivity and enhance the uptake of findings from impact evaluations. Ensure that
information technology systems capture and make accessible knowledge from self-
evaluations (applies to the World Bank and IFC).

2System mapping is a term used to describe a range of methods aimed at providing a visual
representation of a system and help identify the various parts of a system, as well as links between
those parts. The evidence supporting this systems map stems from the semi-structured interviews,
the user-centric design workshops, game-enabled workshops, and an IEG focus group.

Appendix A. Evolution of the World Bank Group
Self-Evaluation Systems
From its inception in the mid-1940s, the World Bank had incorporated monitoring and
evaluation data into its project designs, but until the 1970s collection and analysis of
such data were carried out inconsistently and without benefit of policy or guidance. The
World Bank formally launched evaluation of its activities in 1970 under the leadership
of President Robert McNamara, whose goal was to improve the World Bank’s
contribution to the development of member countries through learning from its own
successes and failures. Evaluation also served as a tool for providing quality assurance
for its loans to financial markets by focusing on actual achievements and results as
opposed to economic rates of return that had been estimated at project appraisal.1

Aspects of the World Bank’s evaluation function were invested in two new
departments. In 1969, the World Bank’s established the Internal Audit Department to
take over the project auditing work of external auditors, except for the annual financial
audit of the institution. Then, in 1970, the World Bank’s established the Operations
Evaluation Unit (OEU), which was to review past lending operations and assess to what
extent the projects achieved their intended outcomes defined at project appraisal and
analyze the reasons for any shortcomings. McNamara believed that this would shape
learning for developing policy and procedures further and provide the evidence of the
World Bank’s development impact. OEU reported to the President as part of the
Programming and Budgeting Department.

OEU’s first two pilot evaluations were a country study that assessed the development
impact of Bank assistance in Colombia, and a sectoral review of the relevance and
efficacy of Bank interventions in the electric power sector. The country study,
distributed to the Executive Directors in 1973, provided an in-depth assessment of the
World Bank’s interventions in Colombia over a 20-year period. It focused on the
contribution of the World Bank’s assistance to Colombia’s development, defined as
“movement of the whole social system in such a way as to provide increasing
opportunities to a growing proportion of the population of the country to realize more
fully their mental and physical capabilities.” This definition was consistent with the
World Bank’s increasing focus on poverty reduction as a central development
challenge. The country evaluation not only assessed Bank performance, but also
proposed alternative solutions for addressing development challenges. The sectoral
review of Bank loans to the electric power sector in Africa, Asia, and Latin America
focused on issues such as the efficacy of institution-building efforts, the economic
validity of plant site selection, and other issues.

APPENDIX A
EVOLUTION OF THE WORLD BANK GROUP SELF-EVALUATION SYSTEMS
With the encouragement of the U.S. Government Accounting Office, the World Bank
embarked on institutional reforms to mainstream independent evaluation and self-
evaluation in its project-level operations. In 1973 the U.S. government, in particular the
U.S. Government Accounting Office, advocated for Bank evaluations to promote
operational standards already in place in U.S. institutions. Also, the U.S. Congress
passed an amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act that encouraged the establishment
of an independent evaluation unit for the World Bank. As a result, the World Bank’s
produced several project and sector-level evaluations as well as reviews of follow-up
actions by operating departments in response to evaluation recommendations.

In July 1973, the evaluation function was transferred from the Programming and
Budgeting Department to an Operations Evaluation Department (OED), under the
supervision of a vice president without operational responsibilities. At the same time,
OED started conducting project performance audits for all projects after one year of
loan disbursement completion.

OED gained full independence in 1975 with appointment of a Director-General of
Operations Evaluation (DGO) accountable to the Board of Executive Directors. In 1976,
Bank management introduced a policy that required all operating departments to
prepare Project Completion Reports (PCRs) for all projects within one year of loan
disbursement completion. The PCRs were subject to OED review before being
submitted to the Board by the DGO. Subsequently, OED was combined with evaluation
units from IFC and MIGA, which also had reported to the DGO, to create the
Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) for the World Bank Group; in what follows, IEG is
used to refer to its predecessor organizations.

The quality of project self-evaluation reports varied over time as a result of (i) reforms
encouraged by IEG that aimed to make self-evaluation an important element of the
project cycle, and (ii) transferring the self-evaluation responsibility back and forth
between the World Bank’s operational staff and its borrowers. Early project completion
reports substantially varied in quality because of a lack of institutional incentives,
budget pressures, and a focus on the number and volume of the lending portfolio
among others.2 At the end of 1970s, higher standards were introduced for completion
reports to provide basic accountability evidence. These were embedded in the Standards
and Procedures Document, which was reviewed and approved by the Board. The reforms
made project-level self-evaluation an integral part of the project cycle, together with
project identification, preparation, appraisal, and supervision. However, in 1980, the
self-evaluation function was transferred from operational staff to the borrowers and it
became part of loan agreements requiring borrowers to prepare project completion
reports. This led to a sharp decline in report quality and, eventually, a huge backlog.
After six years the self-evaluation actors changed again and the quality improved as

                                                                                  APPENDIX A
                                   EVOLUTION OF THE WORLD BANK GROUP SELF-EVALUATION SYSTEMS
Bank staff resumed its previous lead responsibilities. Soon after this, in 1987, the IFC
began self-evaluations of its investment operations.

Major institutional reforms aimed at improving accountability in the World Bank’s were
driven by several influential IEG evaluations. But institutional learning from
evaluations through aggregating or synthesizing results and findings across operations
to inform future interventions lagged behind. The Bank’s self-evaluation system can be
defined as a combination of project and country-level evaluations as well as other
review mechanisms conducted by management to assess its interventions’ results in
real time and ex-post. However, IEG is also part of the World Bank’s overall evaluation
system, and its independence provides critical incentives to generate unbiased
assessments and ensure quality control of its interventions.

Over time, IEG’s evaluations have been an important driver for the institution’s
continuous reforms and improvements in self-evaluation policies and procedures on
both the project and country levels. However, these changes primarily influenced the
accountability dimension of the self-evaluations, while the learning component or
objective, which can be defined as learning from experience, has lagged behind. The
Bank’s institutional structures and incentives historically have not been favorable for
learning. Individual learning has not been captured adequately in self-evaluations due
to: (i) the organization’s forward-looking nature and stronger focus on the quantity of
operations and programs as opposed to their performance and implementation3; (ii)
frequent changes in task team leaders between project or program approval and
completion; and (iii) the limited space allocated to learning in completion reports.4 This
has led to poor institutional learning and subsequently affected IEG’s role in
aggregating learning across projects and programs and improving the learning agenda
in the organization.

Several key initiatives, such as the Wapenhans report, and establishment of the
Inspection Panel, the Quality Assurance Group (QAG), and the Working Group on
Monitoring and Evaluation, have been influential for improving the World Bank’s
project performance, monitoring, and evaluation. In the early 1990s, the deterioration of
development effectiveness of projects, as reported in PCRs reviewed by IEG, became a
major driver for subsequent reforms to improve portfolio management and evaluation.
The Report of the Portfolio Management Task Force (known as “the Wapenhans”
report6) provided actionable recommendations for improving quality at project entry,
including introduction of the Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) as a
replacement for the PCR in 1994. According to new guidelines, ICRs would be
submitted to the Board together with IEG’s evaluative notes, which had to be circulated
to the regional management for comments beforehand. In 1993, the Board also
established an Independent Inspection Panel to ensure the institution’s compliance with
its operational policies and procedures. Another IEG report on quality at entry helped
trigger the creation of QAG, which was to conduct real-time evaluations and to ensure
lessons learned from evaluations were fed into ongoing operational work. There was no

                                  EVOLUTION OF THE WORLD BANK GROUP SELF-EVALUATION SYSTEMS
overlap between IEG and QAG as the latter was responsible for ex-ante evaluations as
opposed to ex-post. QAG was closed in 2010. Finally, the World Bank’s-wide Working
Group on Monitoring and Evaluation, created in 1999, highlighted the following
findings: (i) poor incentives to conduct good monitoring and evaluation; (ii) diffused
accountability because of unclear roles and responsibilities both within the World
Bank’s, and between the World Bank’s and borrowers; and (iii) weak capacity for
monitoring and evaluation both in the World Bank’s and in client countries.7

The Wapenhans report highlighted several critical shortcomings of the then-current
system, in particular lack of management and staff incentives with regard to the quality
of performance management and feedback, which also directly influenced the self-
evaluation culture, some of which remain relevant today. Among factors affecting the
quality of portfolio performance management was the higher visibility attached to loan
processing than to project performance management. In addition, some staff members
considered supervision report ratings a reflection on their own performance instead of a
project adjustment or decision making tool. Also, there was pressure from managers to
award generous ratings to minimize the number of problem projects. With regard to the
absence of feedback on portfolio performance management, the report highlighted the
lack of management attention to project implementability and risk assessment. Also,
there was a gap in learning from projects when preparing country strategy papers and
in learning from past experience.

The Bank’s move toward providing more client-driven development aid lifted the focus
of self-evaluation from projects to the higher plane of country-level assessments in 2003
which subsequently evolved into a results-oriented system. In 1997, President James
Wolfensohn undertook major institutional reforms to address criticism of the World
Bank’s and to provide more client-driven services through partnerships, which could be
beneficial from social, cultural, and economic perspectives. As a result of this change in
aid perception and stronger focus on strategic country-level engagements, in 2003
country-level self-evaluations emerged to assess the achievement of program results
and to provide a learning tool for management. Also, IEG’s country evaluations
beginning in 1997 helped lay the ground for this change, which was supported strongly
by the Director General of IEG. In 2005, the World Bank’s mainstreamed results-based
Country Assistance Strategies (CASs) that incorporated a results-based monitoring and
evaluation system.

The Bank Group’s self-evaluations systems vary across its three institutions but not at
country level, where they jointly produce both strategies and self-evaluations. IFC and
MIGA’s self-evaluation systems have substantially evolved over time to some extent
tracing the reform pattern in the World Bank’s.8 The key differences in the self-
evaluation systems among Bank, IFC, and MIGA stem from the unique business model

and role of each institution in pursuing the twin goals of poverty reduction and shared
prosperity. The Bank assists governments in providing public goods and addressing
market failures through knowledge sharing and financial resources. IFC and MIGA
target private agents to promote private sector development.9

While the approach on country level self-evaluations is similar across the World Bank
Group institutions, there are key differences on the project level.10 First, IFC conducts
project-level self-evaluations on a sample basis, randomly selected and further fully
validated by IEG. Otherwise, Quarterly Credit Reports serve as a monitoring tool that
assesses only the financial aspects of the projects and covers their entire portfolio.
Second, IFC also evaluates its knowledge products or so called Advisory Services, as
opposed to the World Bank’s, which has no systematic assessment of its Analytical
Advisory Services. Finally, in addition to learning and accountability, IEG’s rating of
IFC self-evaluations were at some point in time fed into personnel records and used as a
criterion for providing bonuses to IFC’s investment officers. After a hiatus in which IEG
conducted project evaluations of MIGA guarantees, MIGA resumed self-evaluations on
a pilot basis in 2010 and shares this responsibility with IEG for now.

Appendix B. How Does Results Reporting and
Self-Evaluation Work in Other Development
Agencies and How Does the World Bank Group
Compare?
Objective and Methodology
To set the self-evaluation system in the wider context, this study looked at joint
initiatives assessing the development effectiveness of the World Bank Group and some
comparator organizations; good practice standards for self-evaluation; and self-
evaluation in five multilateral and bilateral development agencies—Asian Development
Bank, African Development Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, EuropeAid of
the European Commission, and the U.K. Department for International Development.

In recent years many multilateral and bi-lateral development agencies have invested
resources to strengthen their project management cycle and M&E systems. The breadth
and depth of these reforms varied and were driven by incentives to improve
development effectiveness and demonstrate accountability for results.

The purpose of this review is (a) to learn about the key features and dynamics in the
results reporting and self-evaluation systems of other development agencies and (b) use
that information to provide comparative perspectives on the World Bank Group’s
systems. The study does not aim to survey systematically each layer of self-evaluation
in these organizations.1 Rather, it zooms in to more recent changes in their results
reporting architecture to explore how it has changed, what has triggered those changes,
and what are the effects.

The study is based on desk review of documentary evidence from comparator
organizations on self-evaluation structures, policies and processes. These also include
the self- and independent assessments that report on results and development
effectiveness. The review is supplemented by phone interviews with AfDB, ADB, and
IADB staff and visits to DFID and the European Commission.

Assessing the Development Effectiveness of Multilateral Development Banks
Overall, the World Bank Group is strong in a number of areas, such as results
measurement, uptake of lessons when preparing new operations, transparency, and
some other aspects of knowledge management in inter-agency and bilateral

assessments reporting on development effectiveness of multilateral development banks
(MDBs).

A number of inter-agency initiatives, such as the Multilateral Organizations
Performance Assessment Network (MOPAN) and the Common Performance
Assessment System (COMPAS), report on development effectiveness of MDBs, aimed
to introduce some benchmarks for their performance and to push the institutions to
better respond to their changing corporate needs and global commitments.

In the latest (2012) assessment of the World Bank by MOPAN (MOPAN 2013), which is
based on a survey of donors and clients in eight countries, the World Bank’s is
perceived as a strong performer, although there is no area where the World Bank’s
stands out as very strong in comparison with its peer institutions. The Bank is perceived
as strong in uptake of lessons for informing new operations, disseminating lessons and
evaluating results, and setting up proper targets for monitoring project performance.
The Bank is also marked high for promoting transparency via its access to information
policy. The Bank is perceived weaker, although still adequate, in the availability of
project performance information, proactive management of poorly performing projects,
and in using feedback information to adjust and revise policies. There is (Figure B2)
some difference in how the donors and clients see the World Bank in setting targets to
monitor project implementation at the country level. In the country, the clients rated the
World Bank’s more favorably (74 percent) than the donors (43 percent).2

evaluation of results, managed by IEG, and for good practices in the identification,
documentation, and dissemination of lessons learned. The Bank has established
reporting mechanisms to present performance information at the country and corporate
level, but there remains room for improvement in these areas.3

 to report on members’ development effectiveness. Members self-report on COMPAS
 indicators. COMPAS’s latest 2012 report assessed the progress on organizational
 effectiveness and results of seven MDBs, including the World Bank Group.4 Two
 indicators measuring the quality of self-evaluation system are presented in Table B1.
 While direct comparison among these MDBs may not be possible, it is a useful tool for
 visualizing the variation in practices. The only notable difference is the lack of reporting
 on quality at entry indicators for the World Bank Group, due to the lack of a centralized
 quality at entry control mechanism. The reporting against these indicators just gives a
 broad picture and should be interpreted with caution. Both indicators are not
 sufficiently detailed to reflect the entire range of the “satisfactory” spectrum that the
 evaluation departments in these MDBs use to rate the quality at entry or the quality of
 completion reports. For instance, World Bank project completion reports, while still
 falling under the “satisfactory” range, are often downgraded due to insufficient credible
 evidence.

 Both initiatives, the COMPAS self-reported by the MDBs, and the MOPAN based on
 perception surveys among stakeholders and document reviews, are intended to
 promote harmonization among multilateral aid reviews and reduce the need for
 individual assessments carried out by bilateral donors. However, while they are widely
 referenced, they did not replace bilateral assessments.

 A number of bilateral aid agencies, including DFID, Canadian International
 Development Agency (CIDA), and the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and
 Trade carry out their own reviews of multilaterals. IDA and IFC were part of DFID’s
 2011 review. Of the 43 organizations assessed, only nine—including IDA and IFC—

were deemed to offer very good value for money for UK aid. The 2013 review update
scored IDA and IFC as providing very good value for UK aid, identified evaluation as a
core strength of IDA, and noted progress in strengthening results framework and
appropriate procedures and instruments.

The Results Paradigm
The establishment of corporate results frameworks has been a major driving force for
the MDBs and bilaterals to improve their self-evaluation systems. There has been a
great degree of harmonization and cross-fertilization in the design and utilization of
self-evaluation systems among the MDBs in the last two decades.5 All development
institutions under review have adopted multi-tiered results frameworks to track the
performance of organizations as a whole, as well as the results of the operations they
finance. With slight variation in the internal results architecture, these result
frameworks are generally structured the same way: to link organizational effectiveness
indicators at the institutional level to results indicators.6

However, adapting the self-evaluation systems to obtaining data for aggregate
reporting in the corporate scorecards can lead to distorted incentives to report only
positive outcomes and weaken the learning, performance management, and
accountability roles of the self-evaluation system inside the institution. Some of self-
evaluation system’s key tools, such as country strategy completion reports and project
completion reports have become the building blocks of corporate performance and
results reporting. Such shifts in usage of self-evaluation reporting has undoubtedly
given more visibility to self-evaluation reports and revamped the system’s role as a
corporate tool to monitor performance of an organization in achieving its overarching
goals.

On the other hand, such visibility can create incentives to focus on positive outcomes or
to become excessively risk averse, while the focus on aggregating the results can lead to
losing the granularity and flexibility that a self-evaluation system should have to serve
its learning, performance management, and accountability roles inside the institution.
While this issue has not come up in our interviews for this study, it surfaced quite
strongly in the assessments of development co-operation systems of many OECD DAC
countries.7 DFID’s OECD DAC peer review, for instance, noted that the results agenda
has created heavy burdens on staff and partners. These burdens do not always seem
justified, given the use made of the results data—particularly that some of the
information is used mainly for communication.8 DFID’s most recent independent
evaluation also confirmed that aggregating results across a complex aid program has

the inevitable effect of shifting the focus and incentives down to the activity and output
levels and focusing on short-term results.9

The cumulative experience from OECD DAC countries also revealed the potential
conflict between the performance information that helps managers “run the business”
and what is needed for external political or public audiences, where it may be more
important to “tell the story” rather than simply provide an array of technical data. One
of the key lessons suggested is to develop a stronger culture of managing for results and
align incentives accordingly, but in ways that promote, not weaken, local structures of
accountability. In relation to this, the lessons underscore the importance of both the self-
and independent evaluation and the development of evaluation culture that can be
central to broader learning and knowledge management inside the organization.

Good Practice Standards and Self-Evaluation Practices of MDBs
The World Bank Group’s self-evaluation policies and processes are in line with those
recommended by the international evaluation community. Since 2001, the members of
the Evaluation Cooperation Group (ECG) of MDBs have established good practices,
operational policies, and processes to facilitate the harmonization of independent
evaluation of public and private sector operations and country strategies as well as
achieve comparability of results. The ECG periodically updates the standards and
conducts benchmarking studies to assess the uptake of good practice standards (GPS).
These assessments have shown that the standards had significantly improved the
evaluation systems and partly also self-evaluation across MDBs.

Few of these GPS standards that apply to self-evaluation aim to broaden the coverage
and improve the quality of self-evaluation and to improve the harmonization between
self- and independent evaluation of MDBs. They are, however, limited to those most
critical for the quality of independent evaluation, excluding topics such as the
processing and review of self-evaluation reports or the balance between learning and
accountability. The most recent benchmarking exercise carried out by ECG in 2013 did
not cover self-evaluation.

Good practice standards for self-evaluation of public sector operations cover three
aspects: 1) ensuring that projects are evaluable, 2) ensuring timely and quality delivery
of completion reports, and 3) role of evaluation department in self-evaluation system
(table B.2).10 These standards are quite broad and MDBs tailor those to their own
monitoring and reporting needs.

Many MDBs use self-evaluation systems similar to the World Bank Group’s—
mandatory monitoring and implementation support reports one or two times a year
during the project implementation, mid-term reviews, and completion reports at the
end of the project cycle.11 This is largely due to harmonization efforts and because the
World Bank was one of the pioneers establishing a systematic self-evaluation system
about four decades ago and thus has had a strong influence on the formation of other
agencies’ evaluation systems.

With many common features in their self-evaluation systems, these organizations also
have to address similar challenges related to the quality of M&E, availability of data,
and learning. The ECG’s 2010 review of evaluation practices found that self-evaluation
systems of most MDBs are weak, starting from project entry (poorly-designed M&E
frameworks) all the way to project completion (low completion rates and quality of
completion reports). The low quality of completion reports were cited as a problem by
IADB, IFAD, CEB, and AfDB, while the World Bank, EIB, and EBRD were generally
satisfied with completion report quality.12

All the institutions reviewed have made changes in their self-evaluation systems in
recent years to improve accountability for results and, relatively recently, to get reliable
and timely data to report in their corporate results frameworks. The changes were often

triggered by self- and independent evaluations that assessed the underlying causes of
weaknesses in their development effectiveness and identified gaps in their systems. The
reforms often encompassed the entire project cycle to improve the quality and rigor of
reporting. The most common measures are summarized in table B.3.

An Inter-American Development Bank evaluation in 2009 found that the project level
M&E was very weak in IADB.13 This has triggered changes in the self-evaluation
system. IADB has introduced the Development Effectiveness Framework in the public
sector operations, which is a set of tools through which projects are assessed,
monitored, and evaluated. A key new feature in that framework is the Development
Effectiveness Matrix (DEM) to assess a project’s ability to report on results at
completion that is, its evaluability.14 The Development Effectiveness Matrix introduced
an “evaluability threshold” for each project that goes to the Board to make sure that the
projects lacking proper M&E are not approved. There were also improvements in the
PCR template and ratings scale.

The Asian Development Bank has strengthened its self-evaluation system as part of the
effort to improve development effectiveness of its operations and has put greater
emphasis on knowledge and learning from its operations. In 2011 it introduced a project
performance management system to improve the results focus of its projects. The

system includes the entire project cycle: (i) mandatory design and monitoring
framework (DMF); (ii) progress reports; (iii) borrower monitoring and evaluation; (iv)
project completion reports; and (v) the validation of project completion reports.15 In
addition to strengthening monitoring and reporting at project level, ADB also carries
out quality-at-entry assessments every two years.

African Development Bank also has made changes to address the shortcomings in the
self-evaluation system, align with other multilateral development institutions and
comply with good practice standards. Only 11 percent of completed projects in 2008-
2009 in the AfDB prepared completion reports. To remedy this, AfDB created a central
operational unit responsible for self-evaluations and introduced new approach and
guidelines16 for project completion reporting and rating for public sector operations and
introduced a new evaluation policy in 2011.

AfDB has adopted a set of quality assurance tools encompassing entire project cycle: (i)
the Readiness Review at project design stage to apply quality-at-entry standard, (ii) the
results-based logical framework, (iii) the implementation progress and results report,
and (iv) the project completion reviews. The PCR template, which was revised in
response to the Evaluation Department’s report on the quality of portfolio, aimed to
facilitate the systematic compilation of indicators required for Bank-wide results
reporting on development effectiveness (corporate scorecard). It also aimed to focus on
learning lessons to contribute to the AfDB’s knowledge agenda.

European Commission’s EuropeAid is currently embarked in reforming its M&E
system17 triggered by two factors. First, an audit report in 2014 of EC’s two key M&E
tools—Results-Oriented Monitoring (ROM) and project evaluations—found that these
do not provide adequate information on results. Most projects lack clear objectives and
monitoring indicators; ex-post evaluations are not done systematically; the uptake of
findings is weak due to lack of proper mechanisms to monitor their follow-up and
dissemination.18 Second, EC has introduced a corporate results framework in 2015 and
currently is adjusting its results reporting system to be able to systematically report
against the corporate scorecard.

The European Commission revamped its end of project reviews (ROM support to end of
project results reporting) to gather reliable data that can feed in the new corporate results
framework. Unlike its other M&E tools, this mechanism is now designed to be
mandatory for all the projects and its compliance will be closely monitored. The
responsible unit provides guidance and training to country delegations to implement
this new function.

APPENDIX B

DOES THE WORLD BANK GROUP COMPARE?
DFID has heavily invested and achieved a notable improvement in performance and
results reporting since 2010 to meet the growing demand for better reporting and
accountability. In 2011, DFID also introduced its Results Framework where some of the
indicators are based on reporting from the self-evaluation system.19 DFID’s reforms
were comprehensive aimed at strengthening project/program cycle, and the
institutional and policy environment. These included:

         Improving project design: More focus was put on evidence and evaluability at
          the project design stage by introducing a new Business Case template in 2011.
          Business Case encompasses the theory of change, the logframe, and monitoring
          strategy and evaluation plan. The synergy between the reporting templates
          throughout the project cycle also improved.
         Establishing central quality assurance unit: DFID established a Quality
          Assurance Unit to review large business cases to make sure that they are built
          on research and evidence. The QAU proved to be effective.20
         Improving program management controls: Introduced new program
          management controls that significantly improved the timely submission of M&E
          reports.21
         Decentralizing evaluation and strengthening M&E capacity: DFID adopted a
          decentralized approach to evaluation and invested significant resources to make
          it work. Evaluation specialists are embedded within operational teams. The
          decision on evaluation was delegated to country offices. The Evaluation
          Department remained in charge of developing evaluation policies and
          guidelines and plays a key role in building M&E capacity inside DFID.

What Were the Effects of These Reforms?
The self-assessment of IDB’s new Development Effectiveness Framework (DEF)
showed that as a result of making evaluability assessment mandatory, already in 2011
all country strategies had satisfactory evaluability score, from a baseline of only 27
percent in 2006-2009. All private sector operations, which started to assess evaluability
since 2011, also achieved a satisfactory rating on evaluability dimensions.22

The extent to which evaluability assessments helped to improve accountability and
learning from self-evaluation is unclear. An independent assessment of how DEF works
in practice highlighted the gaps in the framework. One is the need to better integrate all
those tools so that the evaluability standards will help the project teams to prepare
better monitoring reports and allow gathering the needed information to create quality
completion reports.23 Second, the enforcement of the Development Effectiveness
Framework tools needs to be accompanied with fostering an organizational culture of

  HOW DOES RESULTS REPORTING AND SELF-EVALUATION WORK IN OTHER DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES AND HOW

“planning for results and a willingness to report on problems and failures.” Another
notable weakness of evaluability assessment, which surfaced in DFID’s application of
the concept as well, is that it may not be sufficient in the international development
context, given that many evaluability issues may not become visible until project
implementation begins.24

In ADB, despite introducing mandatory design and monitoring framework, results
frameworks and monitoring still remain weak.25 The content of completion reports is
still somewhat superficial. Learning from the self-evaluation reports is uneven. Project
completion reports more serve for accountability, although some regions put more
emphasis on learning as well. According to the interviews, the ADB has a better record
in learning from country strategy implementations because it is mandatory to take
account the lessons from the previous country strategy when preparing a new strategy.

As a result of reforms, in the African Development Bank the number of completed
operations with timely submission of PCRs increased to 90 percent in 2013.26 As for
strengthening learning from self-evaluations, the new format of PCR aimed to improve
the balance between accountability and learning and most importantly to promote
evaluation culture. While important, these improvement are not sufficient. The
interviewees noted the importance of building M&E capacity in the organization, which
is still a work in progress, in order to promote evaluation culture in the organization.
Building an information sharing system that would be accessible and useful for
different users is also important for making the learning from self-evaluations more
effective. The Independent Evaluation Department of AfDB also articulated its role in
promoting accountability, learning and evaluation culture in the organization.27

More recently both the ADB and AfDB launched knowledge platforms to share
findings, lessons, and recommendations from the past projects. The goal is to provide
easy access to information that can be used to inform and improve the quality of design
and implementation of new projects.

In the European Commission EuropeAid’s evaluation system the key monitoring tool
that was improved—final Results Oriented Monitoring (ROM)—would likely induce
better attention to project M&E and systematic data gathering. However, this tool is
geared toward performance management and not accountability and learning. In the
EU evaluation system, only strategic evaluations seem to have a clear focus on learning
and accountability. Since strategic evaluation is decoupled from other M&E tools,
learning from the M&E is unlikely to be effective.

Strategic evaluations have limited uptake because the main drive in the EU system is
accountability.28 Knowledge and learning are not yet corporate priorities in EU


                                                                                       101
APPENDIX B

development cooperation and very limited institutional learning takes place. The
pressure to spend money within imposed timelines and in compliance with the
prevailing procedures contributes to a culture of bureaucratic compliance rather than
deeper learning. The interviews noted the lack of systematic attempts in most reports to
compile lessons, and even accountability does not go much beyond accountability for
money, it is perceived “almost as an audit,” the methodologies are rigid and do not
provide incentives for learning. There is a strong tendency toward bureaucratization,
which tends to overload staff and reduce quality time for learning.29 Also, not much
synthesis of the available evaluation reports is available for easy access. As one
interviewee noted: “a real interest for learning from evaluations happens when there
are profound institutional changes (e.g. after Arab Spring).”

To improve learning from M&E a new knowledge management and communication
strategy was developed that aims not only to address the structural gaps (such as in
information management systems, quality of reporting) but also work toward
improving incentives along the organizational hierarchy to gear it toward learning. A
notable initiative in this direction is the capacity4dev online platform, which aims to
facilitate learning by sharing M&E experience and building an M&E community.

DFID’s comprehensive reforms have made program design, performance monitoring,
and results reporting rigorous. However, these changes did not help make aid delivery
more effective. The 2013 DFID assessment found evidence of emerging culture of risk
aversion, incentives geared toward design rather than delivery, proliferation of
program management guidelines, and scarcity and undervaluing of program
management skills.30 While compliance and accountability improved, learning suffered
as well. DFID reviews were underutilized for organizational learning (box B.1). The
lessons learned section was removed from the templates.31 The Independent
Commission for Aid Impact found this a concerning trend that should be reversed. The
introduction of tighter rules has increased the pressure to comply and drifted the staff’s
attention and time away from effective delivery and self-reflection.

The decentralization of evaluation function, another key step in DFID’s reforms,
improved the demand side of evaluations and led to better ownership and uptake from
evaluations. The downside is, it has led to proliferation of program evaluations, and
fewer thematic or country evaluations. This presents a challenge to DFID as it seeks to
synthesize the learning from individual projects into broader lessons for policy and
program planning and design.32 The organization’s capacity to effectively absorb and
use the information generated by growing number of evaluations also becomes
challenging.33

 Box B.1: Why Learning from Annual and Completion Reviews is Difficult
 Some of the reasons identified by DFID’s Quality Assurance Unit:
     Hard to identify lessons from reviews
     No easy way to search all reviews to identify common trends or patterns,
     No central single point to receive, collate and disseminate lessons from reviews
     XPSR (Expanded Project Supervision Report) for IFC investments at maturity
     PCRs (Project Completion Reports) for IFC advisory projects at closing
     PERs (Project Evaluation Reports) for MIGA guarantee projects.
 There are also voluntary self-evaluations:
       Impact evaluations for IFC Advisory and World Bank lending projects
       Evaluative studies, such as IFC’s program performance evaluations.
 Data from self-evaluations feed into corporate results measurement:
       World Bank Group corporate scorecard; IFC, MIGA, and World Bank scorecards
       The website by the President’s Delivery Unit
       Various internal portfolio monitoring reports.
 Some activities are not currently covered by self-evaluation, such as:
       The Bank’s Analytical and Advisory Services (see below)
       Board operations
       Control and Treasury functions
       The Bank’s Reimbursable Advisory Services
       Country programs under country engagement notes
       Various assessment tools such the Country Financial Accountability Assessment.

Since 2014, DFID leadership has started a change process (Box B.2) to achieve faster
program design and approval, in order to allow more time for innovation and
delivering results. The changes also aim to revamp learning throughout the entire
project cycle. The new streamlined project management guidelines, “Smart Rules” were
introduced to provide the operating framework for DFID’s programs.35

       flexible and adaptive programming
       economic development as core business
       flexible, planned and skilled workforce

APPENDIX B

The key principles of change toward more adaptable programming are to achieve
clarity in accountability and better learning. The changes aimed to have fewer but
sharper controls, more precise processes. In parallel, DFID works to improve project
management capabilities (skills, knowledge, and behaviors), leadership skills to
empower the program teams. For instance, while still considering that Business Case is
necessary for project approval (value for money), the logframes do not have to be fully
elaborated at the project design stage.

Since learning is central for adaptive programming, DFID also works toward creating
organization-wide incentives for learning, such as by integrating learning outcomes into
performance management, improving feedback loop with different types of partners.
The self-evaluation tools are also expected to play some role in learning, but those still
seems to be viewed more as performance management and accountability tools. A new
Learning Strategy is expected to play an important role in promoting a culture of
organizational learning, including clarifying the role of self-evaluation tools in learning
and addressing some of the barriers to learning. The challenge is to make those
incentives for learning sustainable and aligned with the incentives for delivering.

To sum up, IEG desk review and interviews find that the reforms in the results
reporting architecture in multilateral and bilateral development institutions have
improved the compliance to institutional policies to produce data in systematic and
timely manner to feed corporate results frameworks. There is little evidence, however,
that learning from self-evaluation has improved or strategic decisions are informed by
lessons learned.

The fact that learning is lagging behind is recognized and, these organizations also
make efforts to improve learning from M&E. However, the measures often are patchy,
without clear links between accountability and learning and no strong incentives for
organizational learning.

The Role of Evaluation Departments
Good practice standards for the role of evaluation departments in self-evaluation
system are mainly about the upstream involvement of evaluation departments in the
institution’s self-evaluation system, such as providing normative guidance on
evaluation issues and contributing to evaluation capacity building.

The World Bank’s self-evaluation system is largely in line with the ECG’s good practice
standards, with some variation in the extent of involvement of IEG in self-evaluation.
Besides its key role in validating the completion reports of public and private sector
operations and country strategies, IEG’s role in self-evaluations is limited to

coordinating with Bank management to harmonize evaluation criteria and ratings.
Some MDBs sill work toward better harmonization of the evaluation criteria and rating
between the operational side and the evaluation department.

IEG’s involvement is limited in providing training to improve the monitoring and
evaluation capacity of the operations staff.37 Such limited engagement in M&E capacity
development is quite common among multilateral agencies in order to maintain their
independence and to avoid conflict of interest. IEG also is not involved in conducting
any evaluability assessment on project at entry, while some other evaluation
departments have a role in it:

       IADB’s evaluation department in 2009 conducted its own assessment of how
        project evaluability works in practice and compared the results with the
        management’s results. This has generated a dialogue that led to improvement of
        the Development Effectiveness Matrix.
       In ADB, quality-at-entry assessments are carried out by management every two
        years covering all approved operations and country strategies. While this is the
        responsibility of ADB management, an interdepartmental panel is formed to
        oversee the work and this is often chaired by Independent Evaluation
        Department to ensure impartiality.38 The Independent Evaluation Department
        also provides comments at project’s concept stage, mostly limiting its comments
        to issues such as results and monitoring framework. To strengthen the quality of
        project completion reports the department also provides training both at the
        headquarters and in resident missions and, like IEG, recognizes and awards
        good quality completion reports.
       AfDB management revised the Project Completion report template and the
        ratings in close collaboration with the evaluation department.
       EBRD’s evaluation policy defines the role of the evaluation department:
        “provide training and familiarization services on evaluation within the EBRD to
        strengthen self-evaluation and encourage effective use of evaluation findings.”39
        EBRD’s Independent Evaluation Department designed the template of project
        completion reports and prepared sector-specific guidance and examples of good
        practice PCRs for each sector.40

Findings and Conclusions
All the organizations reviewed have reformed their self-evaluation systems in recent
years to improve accountability for results and, more recently, to feed reliable data to
their corporate results frameworks. The institutions need to be aware of one major
caveat to adapting their systems to obtaining data for aggregate reporting: Independent

assessments show that doing so can lead to distorted incentives to report only positive
outcomes and thereby weaken the learning, performance management, and
accountability roles of the self-evaluation system inside the institution.

The reforms in the results reporting architecture in multilateral and bilateral
development institutions have improved the compliance to institutional policies to
produce data in systematic and timely manner to feed corporate results frameworks.

Although learning has been cited as an important aspect to improve, measures to
improve learning from M&E often seem patchier, without clear links between
accountability and learning and no strong incentives for organizational learning to
happen. There is little evidence that learning from self-evaluation system has improved
and strategic decisions are informed by lessons learned.

DFID succeeded in improving its project design and results reporting through strong
leadership commitment, strengthening the entire project cycle, investing significant
financial and human resources, and building internal M&E capacity to embed
evaluation culture inside DFID. However, these efforts did not lead to better learning or
even to better accountability for results. DFID’s experience shows that the strengthening
of project design and M&E does not automatically translate into an effective transfer of
knowledge and effective project management and delivery of results. Deliberate
system-wide efforts are needed to promote organizational culture of learning that
would encompass creating incentives for learning, establishing systems and processes
to facilitate such learning.

The World Bank’s self-evaluation system compares well with its peer organizations. Its
self-evaluation policies are in line with the international good practice standards. Some
of the key strengths noted by other partner organizations are the rigor in completion
reports, reliability of data that allows validating those reports though desk reviews, and
some aspects of knowledge management. Some notable differences are:

         In many MDBs quality at entry is centralized, while the World Bank’s opted for
          a more decentralized Quality Enhancement Reviews.
         No evaluability assessments are carried out at the design stage for the Word
          Bank projects. Although it is required to have a results framework before the
          project can be approved, there are no criteria of what constitutes an acceptable
          results framework.
         IEG is not involved at project conception stage, while some peer agency
          evaluation units provide input at that stage.

Appendix C. Estimating the Cost of Self-
Evaluation
The costs of self-evaluation in The World Bank Group are not well tracked and are
challenging to estimate. This Appendix estimates the costs of ICRs, CASCRs, and
impact evaluations in the World Bank, XPSRs in IFC, and PERs in MIGA. It estimates
the cost of an ICR and CASCR at around $45,000 each, totaling almost $13 million
annually. Interviews with resource management staff showed that is difficult to know
how much is actually spent on self-evaluation instruments, but no one seemed
concerned about overspending for them. In IFC, a previous IEG report found that the
XPSR, done as a desk review by new staff costs $7,465 each, costing $522,000 annually
and the PERs done by MIGA cost around $40,000 each, or up to $400,000 annually.

Methodology
Estimating costs (or even the use of resources) for self-evaluation in the World Bank
Group is challenging. This paper attempts to reasonably estimate the cost for the World
Bank, and references the 2013 “Biennial Report on Operations and Evaluation:
Assessing the Monitoring and Evaluation Systems of IFC and MIGA”1 (BROE) analysis
for IFC and MIGA. For impact evaluation costs, IEG’s 2012 study, “World Bank Group
Evaluations: Relevance and Effectiveness”2 is referenced. This paper will only cover the
following instruments:

       World Bank Implementation Completion and Results Report
       World Bank Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report, recently changed
        to Country Learning and Results Report
       IFC Expanded Project Supervision Report
       MIGA Project Evaluation Report.

The study team focused on the completion reports because estimating the full cost of
other aspects of self-evaluation such as performance management and learning is
complicated. On the World Bank’s side, it involves the costs of preparing results
frameworks, Implementation Status and Results Reports, and other activities
implemented throughout the World Bank starting from task teams and development
effectiveness staff in Global Practices, to OPCS, and is beyond the scope of this
evaluation. The costs of learning related to self-evaluation is also difficult to determine
as these activities are threaded throughout all the learning events and publications
related to operations in the World Bank’s. On the IFC side, however, an effort was made
in the BROE to estimate total costs including monitoring, for those interested. Other


                                                                                       111
APPENDIX C
ESTIMATING THE COST OF SELF-EVALUATION
costs that are not estimated here are costs of interaction with IEG during the validation
process and the costs to clients to provide data and their own responses for self-
evaluations. Resource management staff and task team leaders in regional units,
country units, Global Practices, IEG, and OPCS were consulted to prepare this analysis.

World Bank Self-Evaluation Instruments and Costs
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT

The World Bank does not separately track the actual costs of preparing Implementation
Completion Reports. They are included in supervision costs and are budgeted by the
Country Management Units which then allocate the money to the appropriate Global
Practice.

On the budgeting side, there is no consistent method of budgeting for ICRs. According
to regional resource management staff and ICR team leaders interviewed, different
regions use different methods to budget for ICRs, as of the date of this study. Some
allocate a percentage of the supervision costs of the final year of the project. Others use
a coefficient that reflects the differing costs of working in individual countries. Others
allocate a standard amount: $40,000 to $50,000 per ICR were the amounts most
frequently quoted. There are efforts to standardize this, but budgeting in the wake of
the World Bank Group’s organizational changes is in flux. Once it has stabilized, there
is likely to be a more consistent method for budgeting for ICRs across the World Bank’s,
according to resource management staff.

On the spending side, the amount spent is fungible, as ICR missions can include
activities for other projects, or vice versa; and work done for ICR activities could be
mixed with other purposes. The expenditures are charged against the general
supervision code for the project. If costs to prepare an ICR go over the budgeted
amount, respondents said they simply use money from other projects or sources
without penalty. So the actual amount spent is difficult to know. Although some
claimed concern about value for money of ICRs during interviews, no one seemed
worried about overspending for the ICRs.

The activities of a typical ICR are shown below, using the model of a consultant doing
most of the research and writing. During discussions with staff, the following were the
most commonly cited costs of a typical ICR:

         Staff time – one to three weeks, usually a grade G or H staff
         Consultant – eight weeks, at a daily rate ranging between $330 to $800
         Research assistant or additional staff for mission
         Travel to the country

                                                                                   APPENDIX C
                                                       ESTIMATING THE COST OF SELF-EVALUATION

       Domestic travel to project sites
       Quality Enhancement Review (QER) time for a Practice Manager, Operations.
        Advisor, , Country Director or representative, current and former team leaders
        and members
       Time for preparation of comments from any or all of the group above at
        different stages
       Administrative staff – three days

When a more junior staff member writes the ICR, some of the consultant time is
replaced by staff time. It is difficult to know if all of the activities cited above are
consistently charged to all ICRs prepared. For instance, some regions do not do QERs.
For any staff time, the time spent is simply charged to the supervision code for that
project. However, it certainly covers travel costs for the ICR mission and consultant
contracts.

Given the inconsistent method of budgeting and the variety of problems involved in
collecting and aggregating the cost of ICRs, this study determined that estimating an
average cost based on the range given by staff seems as accurate an estimate as may be
possible. The amounts most cited were $40,000 to $50,000 per ICR, which results in a
mid-point of $45,000. There were 295 ICRs received by IEG in FY14. If FY14 is
considered a typical year, multiplying that number by $45,000 adds up to an estimated
$12.98 million dollars spent annually on preparing ICRs.

Country Assistance Strategy Completion Reports/Country Learning and Results
Reports
The Bank does not separately track the costs of preparing CASCRs [which were recently
changed to become Country Learning and Results Reports (CLRs)] in the budget
systems. They are part of the Country Assistance Strategy exercise and are included in
the overall budget line for CASs.

All CASCR TTLs said they charge any expenses against the code for a CAS. Many said
it could be easy to track since it is simply one charge—the cost of the contract for a
single consultant, who does all activities for the CASCR. However, not all units execute
a CASCR in that fashion. The actual cost can vary quite a bit depending on four
variables:

       The size of the World Bank program in that country.
       Whether it is being written by a CMU staff person (who would charge time) or
        by a consultant. If the former, the costs might not be recorded very precisely. If
        the latter, the costs are pretty clear, because the contract has a fixed amount.


                                                                                         113
APPENDIX C
ESTIMATING THE COST OF SELF-EVALUATION
         Whether other team members are allowed to charge the code for the time spent
          contributing to the report.
         Whether there are any consultations with those outside the team, which would
          be charged to the code.

The amounts reported from CASCR team leaders interviewed ranged from $20,000 to
$70,000 per evaluation. Taking the median of this range brings a cost of $45,000 per
review. There were 26 CASCRs completed in FY14, so the estimated total is $1.17
million.

Impact Evaluations
IEG’s 2012 study of impact evaluations3 describes and analyzes the cost and financing
of World Bank impact evaluations, which is summarized here. The financing
mechanism for the evaluations is complex, and funding sources are fragmented and
difficult to trace. According to the Development Impact Evaluation Initiative (DIME),
the World Bank shares the costs with clients: the World Bank’s provides internal funds
and trust funds, and the clients use project financing. It is then difficult to account for
the full expenditures as many are not coded as impact evaluation (they can be counted
under budget codes for other types of analytical work).

For example, coordination costs can be covered by the DIME Research Support Budget,
the budget of the impact evaluation program, or the budget of the unit under which the
evaluation is managed. Its data collection can be financed by the government as part of
the M&E framework. The funding for staff involved in its design and analysis can come
from internal Bank funds or trust funds, channeled directly to the evaluation or through
a specific impact evaluation program. It is, therefore, difficult to estimate the costs and
funding sources of World Bank impact evaluations. However the 2012 IEG study was
able to do an analysis to contextualize the cost of World Bank impact evaluations that
are imbedded in World Bank lending projects which suggests that expenditure on
impact evaluations is, on average, 1.4 percent of the total cost of the evaluated
component in a World Bank lending project. That study also reported the cost of the
evaluations in these World Bank lending projects ranges from $250,000 to $1 million
each.

IFC Self-Evaluation Instruments and Costs
The BROE did a detailed analysis of the monitoring and evaluation systems of IFC and
MIGA and their related costs. The system for budgeting and spending has not changed,

Expanded Project Supervision Report
The XPSR project-level cost was estimated to be $7,465 per XPSR. This was based on IFC
staff weeks spent on XPSRs over three years, multiplied by the market reference salary
of GF-level staff who usually prepare the XPSRs, and then averaged. This totaled
$522,000 per year.

Advisory Services Self-Evaluation
These activities are not tracked in IFC budgeting and the Project Evaluation Report that
is prepared is simply the final monitoring report, so it cannot be separated from
monitoring and is not estimated here or in the BROE.

Appendix D. Gender in the Self-Evaluation
Systems
Gender has been recognized as a top World Bank Group priority in the recent
restructuring with the creation of the Gender Cross-Cutting Solutions Area. IEG’s
Report on Self-Evaluation Systems (ROSES) assesses the extent and quality of reporting
on gender while reviewing the World Bank Group’s self-evaluation architecture.
Particularly, the gender review focuses on the several Bank Group commitments on
gender coverage in operational activities, and how they are captured in operational
reporting systems through self-evaluation reports. The analysis evaluates whether
gender coverage in self-evaluation systems are adequate, support learning, and
promote accountability.

Currently, the World Bank Group has included gender in operations through Corporate
Scorecard indicators, Core Sector Indicators, and the Gender Flag. Corporate Scorecard
Indicators provide a high-level and strategic overview of the World Bank Group’s
performance toward achieving the twin goals and are disaggregated by gender where
feasible. Core Sector Indicators disaggregate project beneficiaries by gender, and the
Gender Flag (effective July 2012) addresses gender inequalities in lending operations
and ESW/TA through underlying analysis, proposed actions, and monitoring and
evaluation arrangements.1 However, despite intentions to capture gender, several
challenges were identified in gender-based indicators and results in operational work.

Methodology
This analysis primarily relies on a qualitative review of current World Bank Group
documents2 and key-informant interviews3 with staff who work on gender at the
regional, country, or project level. The qualitative review focused on the role of self-
evaluations systems broadly, whether gender is adequately covered and tracked on self-
evaluations and challenges associated with capturing gender results, the effectiveness
of the gender flag, role of self-evaluations in learning for Bank Group staff, role of self-
evaluation systems in informing the agenda of the World Bank Group at the corporate
level, and incentives (if any) to capture gender in current self-evaluation systems. The
analysis and findings below are based on the qualitative review and key informant
interviews.

                                                        GENDER IN THE SELF-EVALUATION SYSTEMS

Capturing Gender in Self-Evaluation Systems: Barriers and Facilitators
Gender is not adequately covered or tracked on self-evaluations, mainly due to the lack
of a systematic approach to report on gender results. This is especially true for projects
that do not have a well-defined gender-component. Self-evaluation tools like ICRs are
often rigid, and capture what is in the monitoring framework, which may or may not be
gender specific. ICR guidelines do not provide any systematic approach to capturing
gender results.4 Hence many gender-related aspects of the project, and secondary and
tertiary outcomes, truths about local realities, and unintended consequences are not
captured in ICRs, often leading to knowledge gaps on local processes and local realities.
It is possible that the most interesting part of the project may not be measurable, and
therefore is not “counted”. Gender-based learning to clients and project teams can
encourage observability so that gender aspects are covered and do not ‘fall through the
cracks’. It is often difficult to include the results from Impact Evaluations in ICRs, which
may highlight both successes and failures in projects and allow for learning in terms of
what works, or not.

ISRs are also a potentially important tool to capture gender results during project
implementation, while there is still an opportunity to take corrective action, but to
realize this potential the ISRs should report critical information which they currently do
not systematically. However, there is no provision in ISRs to report on gender unless
there is a gender indicator. Bank Group management has committed in the context of
the 17th replenishment of IDA to strengthening gender tracking in ISRs (that is, the ISR
template capturing gender results systematically), but it is still early to assess
implementation of this commitment. Interviewees also report that gender outcomes
often are unintended and hence are not reflected in the project indicators defined at
design.

The importance given to gender and the extent to which gender mandates are
considered is largely driven by the Country Management Unit (CMU). For example, the
most recent Country Partnership Framework for Myanmar incorporates analysis,
action, and key indicators for tracking gender. Some CMUs consider gender to be
important and generate data on it (Brazil, for example). The importance a CMU gives to
gender is often reflected in appointing a gender focal point. This gender focal point
becomes the gatekeeper of including gender dimensions in projects and analytical work
by providing information and learning to TTLs and may also act as an interlocutor
between the client (country government) and Bank Group staff. In India, the CMU has
taken lead and been catalytic in including gender in the project portfolio. The TTLs are
told to take help of the India gender focal point at the PCN, and PAD stage to “allow
ticking the gender box.” The Country Director is also interested in tracking gender
results, especially since the India CPS will have to report on gender at the end of the


                                                                                         117
APPENDIX D
GENDER IN THE SELF-EVALUATION SYSTEMS
CPS cycle. Hence, in the case for India, the CMU has used a combination of utilizing the
existing system (like reporting for the CAS) and including country-specific ways of
tracking data. The India CMU adopted 100 percent gender coverage at design, and also
incorporated explicit gender analysis in some recent ICRs.

The role of the client and client demand in preparation and implementation of the
project is also important in the extent to which gender is emphasized. It is often hard to
generalize about client demand for gender work, and hence the role of TTLs in
supporting and making the business case for incorporating gender becomes important.
The business case for gender can be formulated at various levels where gender matters
intrinsically, involvement of women can lead to better development outcomes, or there
is an economic case for gender that connects gender directly to poverty reduction and
shared prosperity. The more challenging part is considered to be the next level which is
sector dependent and needs the TTL to be convinced about the importance of gender.
Staff interviews suggest that evaluation systems should have “elevator speeches” that
can be adopted by the TTLs. This would mean short and easy to understand
explanations on the importance of including gender aspects in projects, and user
friendly interfaces in the operations portal where teams get explanations of evaluation
data elements, especially in the context of gender. TTLs could potentially have a
stronger business case for gender if they track who supports these efforts. For example,
in India, gender coverage in the design phase is hard, but there are opportunities to
innovate during implementation in the field. One of the TTLs set up a meeting of the
India gender focal point and the client (government) to provide better gender coverage
during a project.

There is a lack of gender-disaggregated data in project monitoring and self-evaluation
systems. Even though the World Bank Group focuses on gender-disaggregated data
collection both through the Corporate Scorecard and the Core Sector Indicators, the
quality of the gender-disaggregated data may not be useful for further analysis or may
not provide project insights. For example, while household surveys usually have data
disaggregated by gender, it is difficult to identify the ‘head of household’. In data for
business enterprises and firms, while information is usually conveyed about the
number of men and women employed, there is usually no systematic gender-
disaggregated data for the identity of the head of the business. Other challenges
encountered in collecting gender-disaggregated data were experimental control groups
not being reflected in the results framework, and lag in data collection between the time
the project starts and when actual data collection starts.

Time constraints due to heavy reporting requirements often leaves gender outcomes
undocumented in projects, as other issues take priority. Even though there are spaces in
the set of broad policies, procedures, and practices to capture gender based reporting,

                                                                       GENDER IN THE SELF-EVALUATION SYSTEMS
until the system does not make certain reporting mandatory, the information will be
missed.

The results frameworks are too mechanical since they are pre-defined. The indicators in
the results frameworks are loosely defined and hence make it hard to measure gender
indicators in the field. There needs to be flexibility to adjust indicators as the project
progresses.

Effectiveness of the Gender Flag
A majority of the staff working on gender issues were aware of the gender flag but
reported that often TTLs and staff who do not work on gender issues were not aware of
the gender flag. The gender flag indicates whether lending or ESW/TA considers
gender inequalities along three dimensions: analysis and/or consultations on gender-
related issues, specific actions to address needs of women and girls, or men and boys,
and how interventions will narrow gender disparities, and mechanisms to facilitate
monitoring and evaluation of gender impacts.

 Box D.1. What is the Gender Flag?
 The gender flag assesses whether a Bank activity is gender-informed. TTLs indicate whether gender
 inequalities are addressed in underlying analysis, in actions proposed, and/or in monitoring and
 evaluation arrangements of the operational or analytical work. If there is a positive response in at
 least one of these three dimensions, the operation or activity is considered gender-informed.
 The ‘analysis’ component of the gender flag includes analysis and/ consultation on gender related
 issues. To respond ‘Yes’ for analysis, the project documents should: (i) specifically identify and
 analyze gender issues; and/or (ii) refer to or undertake country/ regional gender diagnostics or
 assessment; and/or (iii) reflect consultations with women/ girls, men/boys, and/or NGOs that
 focus on these groups.
 ‘Actions’ considered relevant to be included in the gender flag are expected to narrow gender
 disparities, including through specific actions to: (i) address distinct needs of women/ girls (men/
 boys) and/ or (ii) propose gender-specific safeguards in a social/environmental assessment or in a
 resettlement framework, and/or (iii) show how interventions are expected to narrow gender
 disparities.
 The ‘Monitoring and Evaluation’ component of the gender flag includes mechanisms to monitor
 gender impact and facilitate gender disaggregated analysis. To respond ‘Yes’ for Monitoring in the
 gender flag, it requires the evaluation to include (i) gender-disaggregated indicators in the results
 framework; and/or (ii) proposing an evaluation strategy that includes the project’s gender specific
 impacts.

While theoretically the “gender flag” is considered a good development, and “helps to
trigger reporting,” many caveats and criticisms are associated with it. A major
disadvantage of the gender flag is that flagging takes place before the project goes for
approval to the Board. As the Board approves the project, the gender flags cannot be


                                                                                                         119
APPENDIX D
GENDER IN THE SELF-EVALUATION SYSTEMS
modified. So if a project is doing more (or even less) on gender than planned, this is not
reflected as the project progresses to the implementation and completion phase. There is
often no follow-up to the gender flag in the system which prompts the TTLs to report
specifically on how projects address gender-related issues (Gender CCSA Senior
Director wants to change this). The percentage of projects that are ‘gender-flagged’ are
tracked by the Gender CCSA on a quarterly basis.

IFC has a more standardized, programmatic approach to integrating gender through
standard gender indicators reflected in the Development Outcome Tracking System
since 2008. The DOTS indicators for investment services provide a profile of IFC clients
(through gender-disaggregated indicators on client’s staff, management, and board
members, as well as students reached) but do not track results for end-beneficiaries.5
IFC instituted the gender flag in 2013 for Advisory Services. Interviews suggested that
the monitoring dimension of the flag was the weakest, particularly due to the
‘evaporation effect’, meaning that emphasis is greater at the beginning, and lesser at the
end of the project cycle.

Often the gender flag became a ‘ticking the box’ exercise as the analysis, action, and
M&E dimensions refer to disjointed components of the project, often providing no
meaningful information. Interviewees suggest that a meaningful discussion and
application of the flag was important. For example, for a project in Costa Rica (the
interviewee did not mention the project name), all three components of the gender flag
were present (analysis, action, M&E), but they were completely disjointed as the
analysis was for one aspect of the project, the operations component addressed a
different problem, and M&E measured a third thing. Yet the project got credit for being
gender sensitive. In such a scenario the role of the CMU, and the country Gender Focal
Points becomes important to question the team on the rationale, and process, and
engage in meaningful discussions about these processes.

Learning
Self-evaluations were not considered an effective tool for learning on gender issues.
TTLs consider gender an “add on” mainly due to little time, and requirements from a
heavy bureaucracy. Even if they are provided with one-page format with key lessons,
key indicators etc. they do not have enough time to learn and integrate in their work.
Staff interviewees indicate that if reporting on gender is mandated from above and
there is a gender specialist on the team to work with the TTL, the right questions on
gender will be asked and reported.

Also for self-evaluation systems to be useful and accountable, interviewees propose that
the culture of the World Bank’s should steer toward staff willing to try, fail, take risks,

                                                        GENDER IN THE SELF-EVALUATION SYSTEMS
and learn. However, currently there are no incentives provided to learn from failure, as
on the contrary more successes are highlighted.

The quality, coverage, and learning on gender issues in ICRs also depends on how well
the ICR team (which are usually consultants from outside of the World Bank Group)
performs. However, the country office can also take the lead on highlighting gender-
based stories in ICRs. For example, for learning purposes, good stories on gender from
India projects are added as a separate Gender Note in ICRs of the Assam Agricultural
Competitive Project ICR, and the Madhya Pradesh District Poverty Initiatives Project/
MPDPIP.

There may not be any interest in learning if the project is closing and there is no follow-
up project. Often self-evaluations are considered more helpful if there are follow-up
projects.

Gender in Corporate Scorecard Indicators
Overall the Corporate Scorecard Indicators being disaggregated by gender were not
considered helpful to address gender in self-evaluation systems as they were
considered to “aggregate too much across too many contexts”. For example, while it is
possible to count the number of jobs in a particular sector of the client country that the
World Bank’s supports, it may not be attributable to the World Bank’s efforts. Also
while each IDA project has to keep track of female beneficiaries, only having the percent
of beneficiaries does not reveal much. On the IFC side, currently they do not have a
gender indicator on the Corporate Scorecard but the process to include such an
indicator is underway.

Incentives
Overall, few incentives exist to capture gender for accountability in current self-
evaluation systems. For example, due the lack of well established guidelines for the
establishment of the regional action plan for gender, targets were set at levels deemed
feasible by the staff leading the process, who (the same staff) further reported on
whether or not these targets were achieved. Hence there is no standard process that
triggers accountability.

At IFC, few incentives existed until recently for staff to reflect on gender in self-
evaluation if projects were not focused exclusively on gender. However, this may be
changing due to the inclusion of a new gender indicator in IFC’s corporate scorecard
which could mean that gender will be included in regular portfolio analysis and
management progress reports.

APPENDIX D
GENDER IN THE SELF-EVALUATION SYSTEMS

Emerging Findings
To conclude, the coverage of gender analysis in self-evaluation systems of the World
Bank Group is patchy due to the lack of systemic coverage of gender issues from
project/ analytical work inception to project/ analytical work completion. Some
suggestions on how to address gaps in gender coverage in self-evaluation systems
follow:

         Better capture gender results during project implementation through ISRs.
          ISRs should create space to monitor gender results in a systematic way, as
          committed by management, thereby allowing gender-based reporting during the
          lifetime of a project compared to project-end when little changes can be made.

         Track and measure the right gender indicators, appropriate to the project
          context, and better allow for capturing unintended positive and negative
          consequences.

         Reassess the gender flag. While the gender flag puts gender ‘on the radar’ of
          teams by indicating whether projects are gender-informed, it focuses only on
          providing information at entry and does not track gender throughout the project
          cycle and hence does not reflect results. Reassessing the gender flag at closing
          would help the World Bank’s assess how and whether projects addressed gender
          issues.

Appendix E. Citizen Engagement in the Self-
Evaluation Systems
Over the past four decades, the World Bank Group has transitioned from a top-down,
external expert-driven approach to a participatory and collaborative approach to
development. The expansion of this approach started in the 1980s. In 1982, the World
Bank’s adopted the Indigenous Peoples Policy requiring consultation with affected
indigenous peoples as part of project design. Social and environmental safeguards were
later mainstreamed into Bank operations. In the 2000s, concepts of social inclusion,
social accountability, and governance and anticorruption (GAC) emerged. The 2004
Word Development Report highlighted the role of citizen engagement in improving
pro-poor targeting of service delivery. The 2007 Governance and Anticorruption
Strategy emphasized the importance of expanding space for citizens’ voice as a means
for improving the accountability of governance systems. The 2012 GAC Strategy update
expanded this focus by emphasizing the importance of a closer interaction between
citizens and the state to attain inclusive and open governance. Also in 2012, the World
Bank launched the Global Partnership for Social Accountability to provide strategic and
sustained support to civil society organizations and governments for social
accountability initiatives aimed at strengthening transparency and accountability.1

The recent World Bank Group Strategy upheld the importance of engaging with citizens
as critical for inclusion and for developing a “science of delivery” that will accelerate
progress toward ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity. Inclusion
entails empowering citizens to participate in the development process and integrating
citizen voice in development programs. The strategy also highlights the importance of
developing a scientific, flexible, results-based approach to delivery in order to accelerate
progress toward achieving development results. A central element of this new approach
to delivery is the engagement with citizens-beneficiaries. To further this new approach
to delivery, the strategy notes that the World Bank Group will “actively engage with
civil society and listen systematically to citizen-beneficiaries to enhance the impact of
development programs, provide insights on the results ordinary people most value, and
collect feedback on the effectiveness of [Bank Group]-supported programs” (World
Bank, 2013:23). These commitments to citizen-beneficiary engagement were reinforced
by President Kim when, at the Annual Meeting in October 2013, he undertook to
include beneficiary feedback in 100 percent of projects that have clearly identifiable
beneficiaries. The commitment is being tracked by the President’s Delivery Unit and the
Corporate Scorecard.

APPENDIX E
CITIZEN ENGAGEMENT IN THE SELF-EVALUATION SYSTEMS
As a first step toward responding to the corporate mandate of systematically
mainstreaming citizen engagement across projects, the World Bank Group has
developed a Strategic Framework for Mainstreaming Citizen Engagement in World
Bank Group Operations. The framework builds on the longstanding tradition of
stakeholder engagement and lessons learned from Bank Group–financed operations
across regions and provides definitions for the terms “citizen,” “citizen engagement,”
and “beneficiary feedback.” The Strategic Framework provides guidance on the
possible entry points for mainstreaming citizen engagement in operations and on
possible citizen engagement approaches.

Citizen engagement is defined as the two-way interaction between citizens and
government or the private sector within the scope of Bank Group interventions—policy
dialogue, programs, projects, and advisory services and analytics—that gives citizens a
stake in decision making with the objective of improving the intermediate and final
development outcomes of these interventions (World Bank 2014d:8). Citizens, in turn,
are understood as the ultimate client of government, development institution, and
private sector interventions in a country.2 This review defines clearly identifiable
beneficiaries as the subset of citizens that are expected to benefit from a development
project. This definition includes both direct and indirect beneficiaries.3 The proposed
definition is slightly different from the one presented in the Strategic Framework
(World Bank 2014d), which defines beneficiaries as a subset of citizens directly targeted
by and expected to benefit from a development project. In this sense, the Strategic
Framework definition appears to leave out indirect beneficiaries who, in many cases,
are the ultimate beneficiaries of World Bank interventions. Finally, this review follows
OPCS guidance to identify what constitutes a citizen engagement indicator. According
to that guidance, an indicator is considered a “citizen engagement indicator” when it
“clearly captures feedback from citizens or monitors the degree of involvement that
citizens have in the design, implementation, or oversight of projects” (World Bank
2014b: 8).

Objectives and Methodology
Given the corporate mandate of mainstreaming citizen engagement across projects, this
study reviews the extent and quality of reporting on citizen engagement in Bank self-
evaluation systems, particularly in ICRs of investment project financing. More
specifically, this review has four sub-objectives:

         Identify the extent to which ICRs report on mandatory citizen engagement
          activities.




124
                                                                                     Appendix E
                                              Citizen Engagement in the Self-Evaluation Systems
      Identify the extent to which ICRs include citizen engagement indicators in their
       results frameworks; classify these indicators; and analyze whether they are
       useful for performance management.
      Assess the extent to which ICRs include beneficiary surveys; analyze how well
       these surveys are integrated into the ICRs; assess their quality; and assess
       whether ICRs contain lessons arising from these surveys.
      Review and reflect on existing Bank Group guidance on citizen engagement.

To achieve the first three sub-objectives, the study conducted a desk review of ICRs that
exited the project cycle in FY14. To achieve the fourth sub-objective, the study
conducted a qualitative review of the available guidance on citizen engagement. For
this purpose, the study reviewed the following Bank websites: OPCS, Presidential
Delivery Unit, and Spark. In addition, IEG reached out to the Citizen Engagement

qualitative analysis of Bank guidance on citizen engagement.

Findings
ICR REPORTING ON MANDATORY CITIZEN ENGAGEMENT ACTIVITIES

The majority of investment projects include citizen engagement activities, particularly
consultations, motivated by the application of safeguards policies. Box E.1 details the
safeguard policies that require mandatory citizen engagement. IEG’s review of ICRs of
investment project financing4 that exited the portfolio in FY14 found that 73 percent
(145 out of 197) of the projects triggered an Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01)
category A or B and 54 percent (93 out of 1725) of the projects triggered Involuntary
Resettlement (OP 4.12) and/or Indigenous Peoples (OP 4.10). These safeguard policies
require mandatory citizen engagement through consultations and grievance redress
mechanisms.

 Box E.1. Safeguard Policies that Require Mandatory Citizen Engagement
 Environmental Assessment. Environmental Assessment is used in the World Bank to
 identify, avoid, and mitigate the potential negative environmental impacts associated
 with Bank lending operations. The purpose of Environmental Assessment is to improve
 decision making, to ensure that project options under consideration are sound and
 sustainable, and that potentially affected people have been properly consulted.
 Category A and B projects require mandatory consultations.
 4.10 Indigenous Peoples. The Indigenous Peoples Policy underscores the need for
 borrowers and Bank staff to identify indigenous peoples, consult with them, ensure that
 they participate in, and benefit from Bank-funded operations in a culturally appropriate
 way—and that adverse impacts on them are avoided, or where not feasible, minimized
 or mitigated.
 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement. The Involuntary Resettlement policy is triggered in
 situations involving involuntary taking of land and involuntary restrictions of access to
 legally designated parks and protected areas. The policy aims to avoid involuntary
 resettlement to the extent feasible, or to minimize and mitigate its adverse social and
 economic impacts. It promotes participation of displaced people in resettlement
 planning and implementation, and its key economic objective is to assist displaced
 persons in their efforts to improve or at least restore their incomes and standards of
 living after displacement. The policy prescribes compensation and other resettlement
 measures to achieve its objectives and requires that borrowers prepare adequate
 resettlement planning instruments prior to Bank appraisal of proposed projects.

Despite the high percentage of projects triggering safeguards that require mandatory
citizen engagement, ICRs do not systematically report on citizen engagement activities
related to these safeguards or on their outcomes. This review assessed the extent and
quality of reporting on mandatory citizen engagement consultations related to
Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01) and found that 38 percent (55 out of 145) of the
ICRs reported on whether during the environmental assessment process the borrower
consulted affected citizens on the project’s environmental aspects. Out of this pool of 55
ICRs, only 44 percent (24 out of 55) have some level of reporting on the stakeholders
consulted and only 32 percent (18 out of 55) report on whether citizens’ views were
taken into account as part of the environmental assessment process. Within this pool of
18 ICRs, only 3 out of 18 (16 percent) provide details on how the project-affected groups
and local nongovernmental organizations views were incorporated into the
environmental assessment. Finally, only 8.2 percent of the ICRs reviewed (12 out of 145)
report on whether complaints were registered throughout project implementation in

relation to OP 4.01. However, these ICRs do not report on the groups involved in these
complaints or on how their concerns were addressed.

Citizen Engagement Indicators
IEG developed a survey instrument to assess the coverage and type of citizen
engagement indicators in ICRs results frameworks and followed OPCS criteria (World
Bank 2014b) to identify citizen engagement indicators. The survey instrument was
applied to the ICRs of investment project financing that exited the portfolio in FY14 and
that had clearly identifiable beneficiaries. Out of the 197 projects reviewed, 156 had
ICRs available and clearly identifiable beneficiaries. The survey instrument was applied
to the ICRs of these projects.

The review found that 45 percent (70 out of 156) of the ICRs include at least one citizen
engagement indicator in their results framework. The share of ICRs including indicators
to capture citizen feedback and citizen participation is roughly equal with 30 percent (47
projects) and 27 percent (42 projects) respectively. Citizen feedback indicators capture
feedback from citizens whereas citizen participation indicators monitor the degree of
involvement that citizens have in the design, implementation, or oversight of projects.

Citizen Feedback Indicators
The majority of the citizen feedback indicators identified report on citizen-beneficiary
satisfaction with respect to the intervention or the services delivered by the
intervention; a minority report on citizen-beneficiary consultations, grievance redress
mechanisms and citizen-beneficiary satisfaction with safeguard-related aspects. Figure
E.2 provides the distribution of projects with citizen feedback indicators by type. Within
the 47 projects with citizen feedback indicators, the majority (45 out of 47) include at
least one indicator that measures citizen-beneficiary satisfaction with the intervention or
with the services delivered by the intervention. The review also found a minority of
projects with citizen-beneficiary feedback indicators reporting on consultations with
citizen-beneficiaries (2 out of 47); grievance redress mechanisms (4 out of 47); and
project-affected people satisfaction with the resettlement process and outcome (1 out of
47).

An analysis of the quality of the citizen feedback indicators shows that, in the majority
of the cases, these indicators capture citizens-beneficiaries’ views at the end of the
project. Therefore, the timing of these indicators is too late to inform iterative learning,
mid-course corrections, and flexible implementation based on ongoing feedback from
beneficiaries. IEG conducted a qualitative review of a random sample of 14 projects
from the pool of 47 that included beneficiary feedback indicators.6 In the majority of the
cases, 10 out of 14, data on the beneficiary feedback indicators was collected at the end
of project. To illustrate, the Rural Community Development Project (P040653) in Mali
included the following indicators: by the end of the project, at least 80 percent of
beneficiaries perceive positive social or environmental impacts as a result of project
intervention; by the end of the project, 80 percent of targeted communities perceive
significant improvement in access to basic services because of project interventions.
Likewise, the Second Shandong Environment Project (P077752) in China measured
beneficiaries’ satisfaction with wastewater, solid waste and water supply services at the
end of the project; thus reducing the use of the indicator as a tool to monitor satisfaction
throughout project implementation. In contrast, the Second Agricultural Technology
Project (P087046) in Nicaragua proposed two beneficiary satisfaction indicators that
were monitored by yearly surveys and a final impact evaluation. The surveys were
used to monitor and fine tune implementation and learnings from these surveys and
impact evaluation are reflected in the ICR’s “Lessons Learned” section.

Citizen Participation Indicators
This review found that 27 percent (42) of the 156 projects reviewed include indicators to
monitor the involvement in decision making that citizens have in the design,
implementation, or oversight of projects. Within this pool of 42 projects, the majority

                                                                    Citizen Engagement in the Self-Evaluation Systems
(35) includes indicators that capture citizen collaboration, inclusion, and empowerment.
These indicators usually report on the participation of citizens in user groups and on
whether the voice of the most disadvantaged has been included as part of the decision-
making process. Two examples of this type of indicator are: number of community-
based organizations which took part in road maintenance; and minimum 50 percent
participation rate of women in planning and decision-making meetings. The review
also found a minority of projects that include indicators to monitor the participation of
citizens in capacity-building activities for engagement (7 out of 42) and in monitoring,
evaluation, and oversight of projects (5 out of 42). Indicators that track capacity-
building activities for engagement usually report on activities that facilitate or that are
necessary but not sufficient conditions for citizen engagement (such as number of water
user associations fully established under the project). In turn, citizen monitoring,
evaluation, and oversight indicators track citizen-beneficiary participation in
mechanisms such as social audits and third-party monitoring. The review shows that
the purpose of these activities is usually to improve delivery and reduce opportunities
for corruption. Figure E.3 provides the distribution of projects with citizen feedback
indicators by type.

ICRs including indicators to monitor citizen collaboration, empowerment, and capacity
building for engagement do not report on whether citizens deemed their participation
meaningful, thus leaving their voices outside the ICRs. IEG conducted a qualitative
review of a random sample of 12 projects from the pool of 35 that included citizen
collaboration, inclusion, and empowerment indicators7. The review found that, in more
than half of the cases (8 out of 12), ICRs report on citizen participation and
empowerment but that the views of these citizens with respect to their participation and
empowerment are absent. For instance, the Togo Community Development Project
(P110943) approved in FY08 had two indicators to measure women’s participation in
community associations and had a beneficiary survey to measure this participation.
However, the ICR did not report on whether women were satisfied with this

participation and whether they considered that their participation meaningful. In other
words, the voice of these women was absent from the ICR in relation to their
participation. IEG also conducted a qualitative analysis of the 7 ICRs including
indicators to track capacity-building activities for engagement and found the majority
only report on whether these activities were delivered but not on whether citizens
deemed these activities meaningful and useful.

Beneficiary Surveys

This review found that 43 percent of projects with clearly identifiable beneficiaries that
exited the portfolio in FY14 (66 out of 156) included beneficiary surveys in their ICRs.
From this pool of projects, IEG drew a random sample of 10 projects to qualitatively
analyze how well these surveys are integrated into the ICRs, to assess their quality, and
to assess whether these ICRs contain lessons arising from beneficiaries views. 8

Beneficiary surveys are not well integrated in the body of ICRs and their findings are
not included as part of the justification for ICR’s ratings. In general, the findings from
beneficiary surveys are usually orphaned in appendixes and are not well integrated
with the body of the ICRs. In addition, the majority of the ICRs reviewed (8 out of 10)
do not explicitly include the results from the beneficiary surveys as part of the
justification for the overall outcome rating and Bank and Borrower performance ratings.
These findings are not surprising as ICR guidelines do not mandate the inclusion of
citizens’ views and participation in the discussion of these ratings, thus leaving the
views of citizens outside the overall justification for these ratings.

Beneficiary surveys do not usually report on the representativeness of the findings and
data limitations. ICR guidelines do not mandate discussing the representativeness and
data limitations of beneficiary surveys. Not surprisingly, only 3 out of the 10 ICRs
reviewed discussed these parameters. In most of the cases, response rates were not
reported and the method for drawing the sample was not clearly described.

Beneficiary survey findings are rarely reflected in ICRs lessons learned. Only 3 of ICRs
reviewed based lessons explicitly on the beneficiary surveys. In the other 7 ICRs it was
not clear what value these beneficiary surveys added to the lessons learned. The 2013
IEG evaluation on “Learning and Results in World Bank Operations: How the World
Bank’s Learns” (IEG 2013) corroborates this finding. In the context of that evaluation,
IEG compared ICRs with and without beneficiary surveys to assess whether the type
and depth of lessons on ICRs with beneficiary surveys was superior to the lessons on
those ICRs without beneficiary surveys. The analysis concluded that none of the ICRs
with beneficiary surveys based their lessons explicitly on the beneficiary surveys that

                                            Citizen Engagement in the Self-Evaluation Systems
they conducted and that the type and depth of lessons was not fundamentally different
from the ICRs without beneficiary surveys.

Review of Bank Group Guidance on Citizen Engagement Reporting

An objective of the Strategic Framework is to achieve the corporate target of 100 percent
beneficiary feedback in all World Bank projects with clearly identifiable beneficiaries by
FY18. The corporate target means that all projects going to the Board with clearly
identifiable beneficiaries in FY15 and beyond should include an indicator on citizen
engagement in their results frameworks. Progress on this commitment is tracked at the
corporate level by two indicators, “Beneficiary-Oriented Design” and “Beneficiary
Feedback during Project Implementation.” The first indicator measures the percentage
of investment projects for which at least one citizen engagement indicator is included in
the results frameworks of the PAD. The second indicator measures the percentages of
projects that report on a citizen engagement indicator during the first three years of
implementation.

Meeting the corporate target requires clear guidance on: how to identify projects with
clearly identifiable beneficiaries; what constitutes a citizen engagement indicator; and
how citizen engagement activities could contribute to development outcomes. First,
defining what clearly identifiable beneficiaries means is critical for getting the
“denominator” right and, thus, for being able to track progress toward the target.
Second, task teams must incorporate citizen engagement indicators in all projects with
clearly identifiable beneficiaries going to the Board in FY15 and beyond. For this to
happen, task teams require clear guidance on what constitutes a citizen engagement
indicator. Third, to avoid the pitfalls of “box-ticking” and tokenistic approaches, task
teams require guidance on how citizen engagement can contribute to development
outcomes. In this sense, task teams require guidance on how citizen engagement
activities can best contribute to improve development outcomes in a given context.

Guidance has been provided to task teams on how to discuss citizen engagement in
PADs and on possible citizen engagement indicators to enable corporate and project-
level monitoring on beneficiary feedback. In his sense, the Strategic Framework refers to
two OPCS notes offering guidance for task teams. The first one (Investment Project
Financing Project Preparation Guidance Note) indicates that PADs should have a
description of the citizen engagement mechanism adopted under the project (World
Bank 2014a:19-20). More specifically, this guidance states that the PAD should: explain
the local context for citizen engagement; specify how citizen engagement contributes to
the project development objective; define which activities can be incorporated in the
project cycle; and include citizen engagement indicators in the results framework. The
second one (OPCS Results Framework and M&E Guidance Note) defines the two


                                                                                         131
APPENDIX E
CITIZEN ENGAGEMENT IN THE SELF-EVALUATION SYSTEMS
criteria used to determine whether an indicator is considered a citizen engagement
indicator and provides an indicative list of citizen engagement indicators that teams can
adapt to match their project design (World Bank 2014b).

Although the World Bank Group has developed the Strategic Framework and two
guidance notes to support achievement of the corporate target, the guidance is not clear
and a critical definition is missing. The corporate target states that, by FY18, the World
Bank Group will have incorporated 100 percent beneficiary feedback in all World Bank
projects with clearly identifiable beneficiaries; however, neither the Strategic
Framework nor the two OPCS guidance notes contain a definition of what is meant by
“clearly identifiable beneficiaries.” Defining clearly identifiable beneficiaries can be
challenging, not straightforward, and open to interpretation. For instance, assume a
health project targeting health professionals to improve their skills/capacity. In this
case, whether the clearly identifiable beneficiaries are the health practitioners, the user
of the services delivered by the health practitioners, or both is not clear. Both health
practitioners and patients benefit from the project, although health practitioners do it
directly and the patients indirectly. The absence of this guidance raises a lot of concerns.
If teams cannot identify who the clear identifiable beneficiaries of the project are, it is
highly unlikely that they will be able to incorporate appropriate citizen engagement
indicators. Finally, the Strategic Framework document noted that results chains were
being developed to help governments and staff think through the objectives and
targeted outcomes of citizen engagement in the context of five outcome areas (public
service delivery, public financial management, governance, natural resource
management, and social inclusion and empowerment). These results chains are not yet
available, thus raising questions about whether teams will be able to meaningfully
incorporate citizen engagement indicators to their projects.

Citizen engagement guidance and requirements are frontloaded at the design stage, but
little or no guidance exists on how to report or reflect on citizen engagement results
during project implementation or at the end of the project cycle. As it was mentioned
before, the OPCS Guidance Note provides guidelines on how to incorporate and discuss
citizen engagement in PADs. In contrast, a review of OPCS guidelines for elaborating
Implementation Completion and Results Reports (World Bank 2014c) shows that they
do not require explicit discussion of citizen engagement processes and outcomes, not
even where such engagement is mandatory, as in the case of environmental and social
safeguards policies. Also, ICR guidelines lack clear guidance on how to include the
perspectives of beneficiaries as part of the evidentiary base and on how to triangulate
these perspectives with other sources of evidence. Under current guidelines, ICRs are
supposed to discuss the achievement of the project development objective in one
section. In this section, they are not required to discuss beneficiaries’ feedback or

                                                                                   Appendix E
                                            Citizen Engagement in the Self-Evaluation Systems
participation unless this feedback or participation was an explicit objective of the project
and, thus, was included in the results frameworks.

Conclusions
This study reviewed the extent and quality of reporting on citizen engagement in Bank
self-evaluation systems, particularly in ICRs of investment project financing. Several
findings and conclusions emerged from this exercise.

First, the majority of projects reviewed triggered safeguards that require mandatory
citizen engagement activities, yet ICRs do not systematically report on citizen
engagement activities related to these safeguards and their outcomes. This suggest that
there is scope for improved reporting in ICRs on mandatory safeguard-related citizen
engagement activities and their outcomes.

Second, beneficiary surveys are used in less than half of the projects with clearly
identifiable beneficiaries that exited the portfolio in FY14 (66 out of 156). In most cases,
the survey results are not well integrated into the body of ICRs and their findings are
not included as part of the justification for ICR’s ratings. In addition, beneficiary
surveys usually do not report on the representativeness of their findings and
beneficiary survey findings are rarely reflected in ICRs lessons learned. This suggest
that there is scope for increased used of beneficiary surveys and also that there is a need
for better guidance on how to report on survey representativeness and on how to
integrate beneficiary survey findings as part of the ICRs’ evidentiary base.

Third, the review found that 45 percent (70 out of 156) of the projects with clearly
identifiable beneficiaries include at least one citizen engagement indicator in the ICR’s
results framework, thus indicating that the World Bank’s is half-way to the corporate
target of achieving 100 percent beneficiary feedback in all World Bank projects with
clearly identifiable beneficiaries. However, achieving the corporate target may not lead
to enhanced development results and enhanced participation for two reasons. First, this
review found that citizen feedback indicators usually capture citizens-beneficiaries’
views at the end of the project. Therefore, the timing of these indicators is too late to
inform iterative learning, mid-course corrections, and flexible implementation based on
ongoing feedback from beneficiaries. This mean that these indicators are not useful for
performance management. Second, citizen participation indicators usually
quantitatively track citizen participation. However, these indicators do not capture any
quantitative or qualitative information on whether citizens deemed their participation
meaningful. The absence of this critical information leaves the voices of citizens outside
ICRs and casts doubt on whether citizen participation was meaningful and valued by
citizens.

Fourth, citizen engagement guidance is not clear and requirements are frontloaded at
the design stage but little or no guidance exists on how to report, reflect and act upon
citizen engagement activities at the implementation and self-evaluation stage (ICRs). In
addition, citizen and beneficiary feedback and/or participation are not systematically
included as part of the justification for the overall summative judgments provided in
ICRs (that is, in ICR ratings).

maternal health care practitioners benefiting from assistance to improve their skills / capacity for
improving care. Indirect beneficiaries are those that ultimately benefit from project interventions.
Following our example, this would be the mothers that receive improved maternal health care owing to
the improved skills / capacity of health practitioners.

Appendix F. Impact Evaluation in World Bank
Operations
Scope and Evidence Base
The term Impact Evaluation (IE) as used at the World Bank and in this report refers to a
quantitative study that employs experimental or quasi-experimental methodologies to
establish a counterfactual and by comparison with observed outcomes assert the causal,
attributable effects of an intervention. This appendix looks at how well and through
what channels the World Bank’s uses impact evaluation within the self-evaluation
system as an accountability mechanism, a mechanism to improve operational
performance, and a learning mechanism. It does not assess IFC IEs or the relevance and
technical quality of IEs. It draws on:

       Semi-structured and unstructured interviews with 21 Bank staff, including
        regional economists, leading practitioners, and operational task team leaders
        (TTLs) who have worked with IEs
       The IEG 2012 Study, World Bank Group Impact Evaluations: Relevance and
        Effectiveness
       Case studies of specific IEs
       IE portfolio data from Business Warehouse
       The recent DEC external evaluation
       Recent literature on IEs and World Bank operations
       The updates from the Management Action Review (MAR) related to the 2012
        study
       Review of ICRs and IEs for select projects
       Key documents, such as those on the websites of the Development Impact
        Evaluation (DIME) group and the Strategic Impact Evaluation Fund (SIEF).

Background
The use of IE to assess causal outcomes of development interventions and to
complement other evaluation approaches has expanded rapidly over the past 15 years,
as the development community has focused more sharply on measuring results and
using results to inform budget allocations and policy decisions. Consistent with this
trend, the production of IEs at the World Bank Group has also grown rapidly and the
World Bank Group has endeavored to expand and deepen its IE work. Between 2004
and 2008, the number of Bank Group–supported evaluations increased sevenfold
starting with the creation of DIME in 2005. There are currently several IE hubs at the

World Bank, including SIEF, DIME, the regional Gender Innovations Labs (including
the front-running African GIL), and the Health Results Innovation Trust Fund.

At the 16th IDA replenishment discussions, donors called on World Bank management
to strengthen the World Bank’s program of IEs and deploy a strategic approach to
selecting projects for such evaluations: “The findings from impact evaluations,
including data, results and lessons learned, would be used to further improve the
development effectiveness of IDA operations. They would be widely disseminated
outside the World Bank to allow others to benefit from IDA’s experience.”1
Management committed to doing impact evaluations on 10% of IDA projects in FY12
and FY13 (44 projects) and 22 projects in FY14, and to report that to deputies, a
commitment that was met. There are expectations that the evaluations will help build
the knowledge base of what does and does not work in development and where
resources may be best allocated. DIME aspires to mainstream IE as a core instrument in
the World Bank’s knowledge agenda and analytic toolkit as a way to “improve the
quality of Bank’s operations, strengthen country institutions for evidence-based policy
making, and generate knowledge in strategic development areas.”2

Trends
Details of contemporary trends in IEs are difficult to ascertain because the database that
had been maintained by the World Bank’s on IEs was abandoned in 2013—despite
agreement by OPCS to maintain the database and expand its usefulness for learning
purposes. The evaluations are currently tracked archived in the World Bank’s
operational databases.3 Still, these are incomplete: they do not contain all the projects
that are given project codes. Sometimes multiple IEs are grouped into one code.
Moreover, an IE can be assigned the project code for its larger parent project. Because
the storage infrastructure to which the World Bank’s has defaulted in archiving IEs is
inaccurate and somewhat obtuse, the following statistics are likely to underestimate the
actual number of individual IEs.

TRENDS BY DELIVERY YEAR

The number of IEs delivered peaked in FY11 and 12 at about 35 per year, but then
dropped in 2013 and 2014, and is on the rise for FY15 (Figure F.1). Of 120 reported
completed IEs between 2011 and 2015, fully 62 percent were not related to a “parent
project”. Of the 38 (32 percent) that were embedded in World Bank investment lending,
the largest share of completed evaluations is in the education sector.

TRENDS BY CONCEPT REVIEW YEAR

An alternative approach is to look at internal data on the number of IE concept reviews.
Despite a dip in FY11, the number of IE concept reviews showed a relatively stable
increasing trend in IE concept reviews through most of the period. FY2015, however,
saw an extremely large 75 percent year-on-year increase in IE concept reviews (Figure
F.2).

Of the 245 IEs that had a Concept Review between 2010 and 2015, 113 (46 percent) had
parent projects associated with them, suggesting that IEs increasingly are embedded in
lending. During recent interviews, some IE practitioners said that, for their units, there
is more demand for the evaluations in Bank operations than there is ability to supply
them. So the upward trajectory could continue, provided funding is available.

TRENDS BY REGION

Fifty-five percent of IEs that were begun in the past five years were in the Africa region,
compared to 37 percent up until 2010. Some of this increase is due to trust funds
earmarked for evaluation of gender in Africa and administered through the Africa
Gender Innovation Lab. The share in Latin America and the Caribbean was greatly
reduced from 29 percent to 10 percent (Figure F.3). The Middle East and North Africa
has consistently trailed all other regions in generating learning on the causal outcomes
of World Bank projects.

IMPACT EVALUATION IN WORLD BANK OPERATIONS
TRENDS BY GLOBAL PRACTICE

Using the concept review data, Figure F.4 shows the share of IEs by their primary GP.
The Health and Education GPs are the largest producers. These GPs have TTLs and
practitioners with expertise in doing IEs. The need for such evaluations in other GPs—
including those with large lending programs such as governance, transport, energy, and
agriculture—has been a persistent challenge (IEG 2012). The Impact Evaluation to
Development Impact (i2i) program was launched in March 2014 as a partnership
between the World Bank’s DIME and DFID to expand the use of IE across the
developing world, particularly in areas that have traditionally been under-evaluated.

Clearly there is considerable room for improvement in balancing out regional and
sectoral representation. This issue has been highlighted in the Management Action
Record for IEG’s earlier evaluation, and while the World Bank’s has certainly made
progress, further growth opportunities abound.

Accountability
The internal validity4 of IEs yields a significant level of trust in their findings. The 2012
IEG study found that 94 percent of completed World Bank IEs meet medium (40
percent) or high (54 percent) standards of quality based on their frequent reliance on
baseline data, use of well-defined and appropriate outcome indicators, and ability to
credibly establish the causal effects of the intervention and deal with potential selection
biases. The 2012 study also found that, at the project level, the majority of questions

                                                  IMPACT EVALUATION IN WORLD BANK OPERATIONS
addressed by World Bank Group IEs have been aligned with development objectives
and outcomes articulated in projects’ results frameworks.

Attribution of impacts through establishment of a credible counterfactual to the
intervention is the defining characteristic of impact evaluations. A large number of
World Bank evaluations (87 percent) discussed and checked all or some of the
identifying assumptions of the employed empirical strategy and the potential biases
that could confound causal claims.

All staff interviewed for this report asserted that IEs should not be used for
accountability, despite widespread confidence in the findings and accuracy of such
evaluations. The reasons for this are varied: concern that there may be pressure on IE
practitioners to bias their findings; fear that the evaluations would devolve to become a
“tick box” exercise; being tied to a project’s budget cycle forcing the evaluations to
measure outcomes that may not have matured; difficulty for IE practitioners to be
objective; the challenge of working at dual purposes—collaborative learning alongside
judgment and accountability; insufficient numbers of staff with the technical capacity to
meet current demand for IEs, much less future demands if a mandate of IEs were
imposed; and stress that such a requirement would place on quality assurance
mechanisms, potentially resulting in lower quality IEs.

In addition, interviewees cited the following time and financial resource challenges:

       IEs are expensive, costing between $250,000 and $1 million each.
       Sources of funding are difficult to manage. Client countries are often reluctant to
        spend money for IEs and there is a heavy reliance on trust funds. Very little IE
        work is supported by Bank Budget.
       IEs are complicated and require more TTL time and attention. Project timing,
        staff transitions, procurement issues, and client ownership are constraints to
        producing relevant and high-quality evaluations within projects.
       Concern that accountability through IEs would jeopardize the client relationship
        necessary for clients to be willing to learn and integrate results.
       Lack of client capacity, particularly when IEs are financed through project
        funding.
       Over-inflated expectations of what and when IEs can deliver.

None of those interviewed thought it would be useful to make IEs mandatory. In their
words:

       “As soon as they become mandatory they are about ‘accountability’ and not
        about ‘bringing value’.”
       “There is [sufficient] demand for IE, no need to make them mandatory.”


                                                                                        141
APPENDIX F
IMPACT EVALUATION IN WORLD BANK OPERATIONS
         “Accountability and learning cannot be together. We cannot expect teams to
          learn and be judged at the same time.”
         “[Our] IEs do not tell them whether they do good or bad, but how to get better.”
         “IEs work best when the TTLs want it and want to work with IE Teams. It
          doesn’t work as well when forced.”

Instead, interviewees said IEs should focus on learning, assisting decision making, and
policy change. In interviews some IE managers noted that they see them as a public
good focused on knowledge generation. Because the evaluations have strong internal
validity and provide credible and quantifiable information on the value added of the
project and of the World Bank Group, Bank staff said the largest impact of IEs is during
decision-making discussions. Recent interviews reveal that many senior management
and staff appreciate the usefulness of IEs as evidence for policy dialogue with client
governments.

Performance Management
IEs can improve performance management by enhancing the results frameworks,
monitoring, and implementation of World Bank operations, but require much planning
and effort to do so. Because IEs cover a variety of delivery schemes and institutional
models they can provide valuable input on how implementation arrangements shape
outcomes.

IMPROVING M&E

At the World Bank, not only are IEs increasingly embedded in projects, but more recent
evaluations are also more likely to be used as an integral part of project M&E. Based on
survey results, IEs initiated in 2007–10 are more often reported to be an integral part of
project M&E (49 percent) than projects initiated in preceding years (29 percent).8
Consequently, building capacity of project teams and local counterparts to understand
and integrate IE evidence becomes critical.

IEs address capacity issues through specialized teams for evaluation design and data
collection providing support on the ground (and, obviously, requiring additional
expenses). This helps provide quality assurance of the data. Although the process is not
without tensions, the processes for setting up monitoring systems to gather IE data
tends to result in credible data and evidence that strengthen the credibility of IEs as a
source of learning.

IE practitioners are also increasingly involved in field monitoring. They help with
coordination in the field, and often help with monitoring of other project indicators.

                                                                                  APPENDIX F
                                                  IMPACT EVALUATION IN WORLD BANK OPERATIONS
Thus there is a potential link between IE and implementation assurance that the World
Bank’s could exploit to greater effect.

IEs are a complement, not a substitute, for solid monitoring. Cases in which monitoring
was lax because of over-reliance on IE often has resulted in inferior and even negative
impacts on clients. IEs measure outcomes at discrete points in time while M&E systems
are best at measuring process and progress on a continuous basis. There may also be
scope for greater use of administrative data.

Too often, though, the impact evaluation is done separately and in parallel to project
monitoring. Some regional IE focal points identified this as a missed opportunity to do
IEs more cheaply and to improve capacity and quality of project monitoring. This may
be why less than half of completed World Bank IEs were mentioned in the project
completion documents to demonstrate project effectiveness (IEG 2012). World Bank
team leader and evaluator surveys suggest that 37 percent of IEs linked to a lending
project were used as an input to the ICR or midterm review.3

It is not enough to tell teams to improve M&E, staff need help to build their capability.
Working with monitoring data requires skills. There are examples of IE practitioners
helping to building the statistical capacity both of staff and clients. The DIME team
worked with the Senegalese government to digitize the judiciary caseload. In Gambia,
IE staff worked with the Bureau of Statistics, living there for the duration of the IE
implementation. Yet although IEs can help with training and mentoring, they cannot
build a statistical system for a whole government agency.

IMPROVING IMPLEMENTATION AND RESULTS

Being clear on how the evaluation will achieve operational usefulness, serve the key
decision points of the project, engage operational teams and local counterparts, and
disseminate its findings is correlated with better implementation and often yields
improved results.

The case studies for the 2012 IEG study showed that, of the 19 projects with completed
IEs reviewed in the case studies, the evaluations helped shape (sometimes marginally)
the decision to scale up or down and continue the projects in eight cases (42 percent).
According to surveys of TTLs and IE practitioners conducted for that study, 36 percent
of completed World Bank IEs were used to make decisions about continuing, stopping,
reducing, expanding, or changing the design of the evaluated project. A common, if
somewhat misplaced, criticism of IEs is that the project team does not learn in time to
provide opportunities for course correction. One way an Education GP TTL is
overcoming that critique is to plan an IE at the very beginning of project
implementation. The resulting data can then give direction about targeting and


                                                                                        143

intervention choices for scaling up. More challenging can be the tension between IE
design and operational course correction that may undermine the empirical strategy of
the IE design.

Regression analysis from DIME on Bank projects has found an association between
having an IE attached to a project and the project’s rate of disbursement, and explains it
with the additional staff and financial resources that IEs provide to projects for data
collection, monitoring, and clarifying results chains.5 The analysis is suggestive of the
potential for project strengthening that occurs by attaching an IE team to the design
team. Interviewees indicated that this result may be an effect of greater attention and
detail given to the project’s theory of change when an IE team becomes involved. An
external reviewer found a similar result in looking at the effect of World Bank projects
with an impact evaluation on the evaluated project’s ICRR ratings.6 Although that
author termed the finding as a Hawthorne effect wherein project teams that had an IE
worked harder to develop a higher quality project in the first place (and thus potentially
undermining the external validity of the IE’s findings to similar but non-impact
evaluated projects), it does seem clear that the additional ex ante scrutiny from working
with an IE team does yield real project benefits. To operationalize this effect, one
manager asked operational staff to think through an IE even if the IE was not going to
be implemented because doing so forced them to produce a clear picture of their results
chain and resulted in an improved project design.

At the World Bank, there has been an increase in IEs evaluating the relative
contribution of different design features.7 In particular, IEs initiated in the past three to
four years are paying more attention to the questions of “what works and why.”8 In
actuality, IEs are better suited to answer questions of “what is the effect” and “which
options work best”; questions of “why” an intervention does or does not work are often
best answered through complementary qualitative work.

Even so, emphasis on the question of “which option works best” should be done with
caution as the learning objectives of the operations team and the IE team may not
always be aligned. Interviews suggested there are tensions in the process of including
IEs in investment operations, often because of friction at the personal level. From an IE
practitioner, “Experimentation in projects is viewed as an annoyance. One TTL said we
were trying to turn the project into an academic playground, when we suggested
adding options to the analysis.”

Learning
Impact evaluations have a strong potential role to play in how World Bank Staff and
Operations learn. Building the capacity of project teams and local counterparts to

understand and integrate IE evidence is critical, but is not the responsibility of the IE
hubs alone. The External Evaluation of DEC pointed out that DIME’s IEs need to focus
on knowledge that is useful to the evaluated and similar programs. It also noted that IE
findings are underutilized by Bank operations for informing particular policy areas and
driving the wider policy of the World Bank’s.9

Influence on Design

IE practitioners and project TTLs should have as their joint design tactic the
strengthening and integration of IE evidence into the appraisal and design of projects,
as well as their assessment. Impact evaluators, regional IE focal points and IE hubs can
actively engage in dissemination of results to the relevant global practices, regions, and
the country team to boost take-up of IE lessons.

IEG’s 2012 study found that only 45 percent of World Bank IEs helped inform the
design of follow-on or new projects, although more recent evidence suggests this may
be starting to improve. There are notable examples of IE influence on development
practice, including project assessment, decisions to design and sustain evaluated and
future projects, raising the profile of certain types of interventions, informing policy
dialogue and institutional strategies, and building local M&E capabilities. Such
examples indicate that, overall, IE is regarded as a valuable tool to increase
development effectiveness through better evidence. But in some instances, even when
IEs have been relevant and of good quality, they appear to have had limited use and
influence for varying reasons including poor timing, failure to engage project teams and
decision makers, or lack of dissemination.

Surprisingly few (only one-fifth) of the reviewed completed IEs were reported in the
ICRs to have contributed to strategic decisions. The ICRs linked to 19 of 87 World Bank
completed IEs explicitly mentioned the use of the evaluations in making operational
decisions or providing lessons for future endeavors. ICRs of 10 of these projects cited
the contribution of the evaluations in decisions to scale up or continue or to inform
policy and/or project design.6 The Philippines’ Integrated Early Childhood
Development Project, for example, was reportedly used to justify expanding program
innovations. In Ethiopia, IE lessons were incorporated into subsequent projects and
therefore can be expected to generate continued design benefits.

Yet in interviews, IE practitioners and TTLs argued that lessons from IE are not
reflected enough or systematically informed in project designs, even when relevant
evidence exists. One reason is that little “knowledge translation” is taking place. “You
would need a person with the right skill set to translate and transfer the information
stemming from IE into actionable lessons for operational teams,” said one manager. The

MAR update shows that TTLs continue to have difficulty finding IEs if they are
interested in using findings from them in their work. The data system to track them is
difficult to find and cumbersome to access. Said one staff, “One needs to be sympathetic
to time constraints of TTLs and package information so you can find the pertinent IEs.
Even TTLs and IE practitioners who know their way around this stuff have trouble
finding IEs.”

Completed IEs of projects were mentioned in around half of the follow-on lending
operations, as reported in the 2012 study. Around one-third of these citations are
marginal, another one-third summarize the effects of the preceding phases, and in the
remaining one-third of cases the evaluation was cited as having some influence on
project design. IEs can also have substantial knowledge spillovers to future projects and
policies, especially ones that are similar to the ones evaluated.

More work is needed to make IE lessons actionable. Informants provided several
hypotheses for the lack of integration of IE lessons into operational design:

         Working with academics can lead to delays until findings are published.
         There is a need for “knowledge translation” in dissemination away from
          theoretical models and statistical issues with more emphasis on findings and
          operational implications.
         Accessing the relevant IEs and their findings quickly and efficiently is difficult.
          The search and aggregation capabilities of the World Bank’s Business
          Warehouse, which has served as the database for IEs for the past two years, is
          perhaps barely adequate for archiving tool but falls well short as a learning tool.
         IE reports are time consuming to read and not necessarily in a format useful to
          TTLs.

Even so, individual IE hubs within the World Bank’s is engaging in several excellent
dissemination efforts through a large and growing portfolio of regional workshops,
Brown Bag Lunch series, and various forms of policy briefs.

Learning from Failure and Null Results

                                                   IMPACT EVALUATION IN WORLD BANK OPERATIONS
Impact evaluated projects do not always generate statistically significant outcomes,
which is to be expected. This is often referred to as a null result and null results need to
be closely examined to ascertain why (poor implementation? low statistical power?
weak project design? and so on). Staff reported that they often do not feel supported in
doing so by management, and staff and management both may be disinclined to dwell
on hard work and good attempts that ultimately did not pay off.

IEs that find null results are not disseminated in all cases (the same applies in academia
and elsewhere), missing a potential opportunity to learn. Most staff in recent interviews
could cite one or two situations where they or others had null findings from IEs that led
to subtle or overt censorship by management or country counterparts of those findings.
Often, however, they cited the same handful of examples. Interviewees indicated that
the two most important explanatory factors for when an evaluator is able to publish
null results are 1) the evaluator’s relationship with the World Bank’s country team and
the client, and 2) and data ownership and funding sources of the IE—those funded by
the client were more likely to be at risk of being dropped.

There are some examples where null findings led teams to explore further and much
was still learned, but potentially far more frequent are instances where null results were
quietly abandoned by both evaluators and implementers: All face much stronger
incentives to disseminate significant results than null results. This asymmetry likely
leads to underreporting of interventions that did not have an impact (often referred to
as the “file drawer” bias). One result of this is that some project designs that repeatedly
have been shown to not work, even by a rigorous series of IEs, continue to be proposed
because the null results are never finalized or brought to light.

An evolving good practice is to pair good IE with sound field-based qualitative
investigation. Qualitative work done over the course of the evaluation, in parallel to it,
can provide useful real-time feedback on processes, beneficiary sentiment, and reasons
why an intervention may or may not be working.

IEs of World Bank projects could be used for multiple institutional objectives in the
creation of public goods. For example, impact evaluations can do a better job at
measuring effects of Bank projects on incomes and in exploring distributional analysis
of outcome, thereby both servicing and informing the World Bank’s “Twin Goals” of
reducing poverty and increasing shared prosperity. They can also be used as inputs into
efficiency calculations: effort and expense is undertaken in IEs to understand benefits;
the relative effort to analyze costs is small, but benefit-cost analyses are rare in IEs
despite their potential utility for decision makers. In all, impact evaluations can help the
World Bank’s make smarter, data-driven decisions.

APPENDIX F
IMPACT EVALUATION IN WORLD BANK OPERATIONS
LEARNING IN BANK STRATEGIES AND POLICIES

Establishing the value of IEs for project operations and policy making is not
straightforward. There is no mechanism in place and no comprehensive evidence base
to document uptake of IE findings. Most of the narrative examples that showed
achievements from the World Bank’s IDA investment which were included in the
document for the IDA replenishment were taken from IEs. A knowledge system could
help pull lessons from IEs and systematic reviews to inform project design.

Impact evaluations provide excellent information on the effects of an intervention (the
“what”) when it is possible to create a counterfactual. They are less easily applied to
macroeconomic cases or nation-wide interventions or policy changes. This does not
guarantee that the evaluations address the most pressing questions. For instance,
interventions that are easier and faster to evaluate may get subjected to evaluation
rather than questions of more strategic importance, or the IE agenda may be driven by
ease of application for certain methods (such as randomized controlled trials) or by the
availability of data or by the individual incentives faced by evaluators, project
managers, and decision makers (Ravallion 2009).

According to IEG’s 2012 report, more recent IEs at the World Bank are more likely to
correspond to global knowledge priorities in development. Three-quarters of survey
responses of evaluators and TTLs perceived that the World Bank IEs have contributed
(or are anticipated to contribute) to the global knowledge of “what works.”

The fact that IE are more likely to be cited in the strategies of sectors with large IE
evidence suggests that the evaluations have the potential to make a larger contribution
to influencing strategic priorities when there is a critical mass of credible evidence
available. In several GPs there are now IE working groups that bring together TTLs,
managers, researchers with occasional sessions on identifying high-level gaps, cases,
discussing progress and results.

LEARNING BY CLIENTS

IEs can strongly influence policy dialogue with clients, most effectively when staff have
long-term relationships. Client interest was reported as growing, yet even credible and
relevant IE findings do not automatically translate into policy changes because of a
variety of factors that range from political interests to fiscal conditions to priorities
within the policy agenda. Survey results from IEG’s 2012 study show that 55 percent of
completed World Bank IEs helped influence policy dialogue with clients. There is
suggestive evidence that IE use in policy dialogue has improved over time: 75 percent
of completed World Bank IEs initiated since 2005 were reported to have informed
policy dialogue, compared with 42 percent initiated before 2005. Much also depends on

                                                                                 APPENDIX F
                                                 IMPACT EVALUATION IN WORLD BANK OPERATIONS
the level of sophistication and absorptive capacity of policy makers and the
implementing environment to adapt findings from other contexts.

Conditional cash transfers and school vouchers provide the clearest evidence of IE
influence across projects. There is a large and rigorous evidence base on conditional
cash transfers (CCTs) to which the World Bank has contributed substantially. The
positive IE findings and lessons of a pioneer CCT program in Mexico
(Progresa/Oportunidades) were an important factor in influencing other countries in the
region to adopt similar instruments.10 CCTs now have been implemented in more than
30 countries, in almost all regions of the world.

IEs have also raised the profile of other interventions. Interviews with World Bank
Group management, together with other anecdotal evidence, indicate that the existing
IE literature on the effectiveness of some instruments (such as social funds, school-
based management, scholarships, and teacher incentives at the World Bank and
business simplification at IFC) has been important in raising the profile of these
interventions and leveraging more Bank Group resources to projects that include them.

Interviews with Bank management suggest that client demand on a client’s own project
is still weak (13 of 21 interviewees). However, even though the increase in the
evaluations being initiated by the government/borrower has been small, there is
evidence of strong growth in government/borrower involvement in the design stage
among more recent World Bank IEs.

How Impact Evaluations Fit into the Self-Evaluation System
The success of IEs at the World Bank’s is belied by the lack of bank budget supporting
them. While mandatory self-evaluations are financed exclusively by the World Bank
Group’s own resources, impact evaluations are financed mostly by trust funds provided
by donors for a specific purpose. There are tradeoffs to this arrangement. On the one
hand, this arrangement yields fractured earmarked financing with gaps in what they do
not cover and inhibits the ability to generate a coherent impact evaluation strategy
across the whole of the World Bank Group. By operating independently of Bank
Budget, IEs can be more easily ignored and work in isolation; this can attenuate the
incentive for IE hubs to produce material to help policy decisions and devalue the stake
that the World Bank’s has in using results produced by IEs. This arrangement also goes
against the latest guidance that partner governments should finance IEs. On the other
hand, without significant investment in capacity building (which DIME, SIEF, and
CLEAR11 are expanding) few clients are able to run IEs because of the instrument’s
heavy technical, timing and procurement requirements. Moreover, the trust funding
arrangement has allowed IEs to be protected and even expand significantly despite



                                                                                       149
APPENDIX F
IMPACT EVALUATION IN WORLD BANK OPERATIONS
severe budget cuts elsewhere in the World Bank’s; without trust funds there would
likely be far fewer World Bank IEs today. Similarly, trust funds resolve the potential
risk of IE funds being reallocated to project work once operations are initiated.

While there is coordination among most of the IE hubs, the MAR update indicates that
there is still not a unifying, cohesive strategy for impact evaluation selection. This
results in uneven application of the evaluations between regions and GPs and leads to
some inefficiency; examples of overlap were described in interviews as well as
systematically missed opportunities as gaps between the hubs still exist. The oft-
repeated defense among the IE hubs of having multiple entities engaged in producing
causal evidence is to “let 1,000 flowers bloom”; this is fine so long as the entire
landscape is covered, more important plots and varieties are ensured growth, and
consumers know where and how to select the blooms they need to form bespoke
bouquets of evidence.. Some suggestions from recent interviews of possible ways of
organizing the IE agenda arose from interviews and IEG observations:

         Assign an entity such as the Chief Economist to take responsibility for IE
          strategy across the World Bank Group to ensure overall coverage of knowledge
          gaps across topics, sectors and regions.
         Develop a formal platform to link IE practitioners across Bank units.
         Better resource IE hubs and regions to keep track of all the IEs and their results,
          and develop a dynamic database that allows TTLs to make detailed, specific
          queries.

Suggestions for Strengthening Impact Evaluations in Bank Operations
      a. IEs are resource-intensive and difficult to do, and they should therefore be
         deployed strategically and adhere more rigorously to project development
         objectives.

      b. Although the individual IE hubs and some regions have strategies for IE
         selection, an overall strategy for IEs has still not been established. IEG’s 2012
         recommendation for a strategic approach to identify IEs remains valid. Emphasis
         and resources should be put into IEs for a broader range of GPs, particularly the
         larger ones, and on a more even regional distribution of IEs.

      c. Work with trust fund donors to achieve greater flexibility in their funding, and to
         explicitly target understudied areas—as successfully achieved by DIME’s i2i
         trust fund. Provide allocation of Bank resources in areas still not covered.

      d. Similarly, following i2i’s example, encourage operational managers to think
         strategically about which frequently-occurring challenges could be illuminated

                                                                               APPENDIX F
                                               IMPACT EVALUATION IN WORLD BANK OPERATIONS
     by IEs, which projects could provide the best input for future operations and
     policy, and encourage synergies between IE and operational professionals.

e. In addition to collecting outcome data on project-specific goals and metrics, IEs
   should also estimate impacts on outcomes that directly service the World Bank’s
   twin goals of shared prosperity and reduced poverty.

f. More Bank budget funding would fill gaps arising from trust funding and ease
   tensions that can arise when clients fund IEs.

g. Bank resources can also be earmarked specifically for efforts to bridge the
   learning bap between IE knowledge production and application in project
   design. Non-financial efforts can be made to bring together IE practitioners,
   TTLs, and M&E staff for knowledge sharing.

h. TTLs need a system that collects IEs and makes their findings easily accessible
   and collates them in ways TTLs find useful (e.g. by region, intervention type,
   sub-population, outcome, etc). Better data input about IEs into the World Bank’s
   operational data systems would facilitate tracking.

i. Efforts should be made to incorporate the knowledge from the large body of IEs
   that have now been undertaken. This might include a review process and a
   determination of how the knowledge can be acted upon.

j.   Incentivize knowledge-sharing. This is not unique to impact evaluations, but it is
     particularly relevant as the knowledge generated by these evaluations is so
     valuable because of their internal validity.

k. As IEs become increasingly aligned with projects and project objectives, the
   World Bank’s should emphasize IE findings in project reporting documents
   including ICRs, and IEG should emphasize IE findings in ICRRs and PPARs.

l. In line with findings from both the IEG 2012 report and the more recent 2015
   DEC external evaluation, disseminate IE findings to project teams in a timely
   fashion, irrespective of implication on academic publishing considerations.

m. Operations managers and TTLs should actively explore where IEs might help
   improve the evaluation capacity development (particularly the statistical and
   monitoring capability) of client agencies.

Appendix G. Self-Evaluation of Advisory Services
and Analytics
Context
How have knowledge products and services of the World Bank been used? Do they
represent an efficient use of resources? These questions have inspired intense
institutional conversations since the 1990s, and self-evaluation processes for knowledge
products and services are part of those conversations. A recent articulation of the World
Bank’s vision around knowledge services appears in the 2013 World Bank Group
Strategy:

       “Be recognized as a Solutions [Bank], offering world-class knowledge services and
       customized development solutions grounded in evidence and focused on results.” (p. 4)
The World Bank Group’s advisory services and analytics work occurs within an
institution that publishes large amounts of information and implements many kinds of
knowledge initiatives. Examples that received attention in 2014-2015 include the Open
Knowledge Repository (an online, public collection of research outputs and knowledge
products of the World Bank that enhances search and re-usability of content and is
optimized for use in areas with low bandwidth) and the Open Data initiative. The
World Bank eLibrary provides academic research published by the World Bank. The
IFC has a SmartLessons database and website. The World Bank (IBRD and IDA) IFC,
MIGA, and International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) each
have public websites with information on projects and results as well as on regions and
sectors relevant to development. Bank

context would be a key element of good performance. Knowledge work beyond
technical assistance is not covered in the World Bank’s Operations Manual. User
documentation is available, however, on how to enter knowledge work into the World
Bank systems.

IFC’s Advisory Services are to the World Bank’s Technical Assistance but an important
operational difference is that Advisory Services generally involve IFC helping to
implement a project funded by IFC investments.1 IFC’s Policies and Procedures

Advisory Services, as well as a detailed guideline on Project Completion Reports for
Advisory Services.

As of June 2015, several communities of practice around knowledge products and
services are active, but there is no Chief Knowledge Officer or similar leader focused on
knowledge work for clients throughout the institution (as had existed briefly in the
mid-2000s). There is a Global Head of Knowledge Management and Learning for IFC,
leading the Global Knowledge Office, which provides knowledge management
services, learning, and collaboration tools to IFC but also has many Bank Group-wide
initiatives.

Method: Desk Review
The analysis in this report is based on desk review of the guidance available on the
World Bank’s intranet, complemented by interviews with staff who have worked on
operational policies related to ASA or who helped implement the client feedback
surveys. Some aspects of IFC’s intranet were also explored.

Strategic Context for Self-Evaluation of Client-Facing Knowledge Work
Research and interviews for this report suggest strategic areas and questions that
management may wish to consider in shaping future knowledge work with and for
clients. These areas are summarized in the diagram below. This report focuses on
descriptions of current processes and guidance, but a view of the strategic context may
be helpful.

of World Bank lending projects is provision of                 Evaluability

ICRs of lending products, the review assesses whether
the indicator data reported in the ICR supports the
conclusions about results achieved.

For knowledge products and services, the same principles of verifiability could apply,
even if indicators and measures differ from those used in lending. Objectives of a
knowledge product or service could be defined in terms of what would be observable


                                                                                               155

events or changes that the knowledge product or service could influence. The results
framework defined for ASA as of June 2015 includes categories of observable events or
changes that knowledge products or services could plausibly influence. Evaluability,
however, would also require that the report of results achieved include not only what
kind of result was achieved but also what observation or information signaled the
achievement. For example, a typical completion summary might give a rating of “8
Effective” on the intermediate outcome “client capacity increased” and then state that
“government officials learned how to use an expenditure assessment toolkit.” To be
evaluable, this statement would need to be supported by details about what event or
behavior the task team or completion summary observed that enabled them to know
that the government officials had learned how to use the toolkit, for example, “based on
the government officials’ own self-assessment of their ability to use the toolkit,” or “as
evidenced by examples of expenditure analysis documents produced by the ministry
before this assessment compared with after being exposed to the expenditure analysis
toolkit.” Good practice would be to then archive the examples, with annotation
explaining how the team interpreted their meaning, that is, how the examples were
used to draw conclusions about increased client capacity. The infrastructure for
reporting this type of supporting information exists in the Operations Portal. What
would be needed is to build a standard practice of including third-party documentation
or evidence of the event or change that signals the knowledge product or service is
successful. As of June 2015, the guidance focuses on reporting results without
explaining or requiring inclusion of information that would enable a reviewer to come
to an independent conclusion about the results that were achieved.

For Advisory Services in IFC, the guidance on writing PCRs was revised during FY15 to
include thresholds and minimum requirements for assessing such projects and
assigning ratings on development effectiveness and other result areas.

Types of World Bank Client-Facing Knowledge Work
Within the World Bank, client-facing knowledge products or services are known as
advisory services and analytics (ASA). As of June 2015, nine ASA product lines are
listed on the main intranet page on ASA. Four are considered to focus on knowledge for
external clients:

              Economic and Sector Work (ESW)
              Technical Assistance (TA)

In the past several fiscal years, the World Bank has completed around 300 ESW
products per year, and around 250 to 600 TA products per year. Bank ASA tend to be
much smaller than Bank lending products, and much smaller than IFC Advisory
Services.

ASA Design and Self-Evaluation: Structure, Recent Improvements, Opportunities
The current features of self-evaluation for ASA are linked to structures provided for
recording ASA in budget and archive systems. In late FY15, OPCS articulated a two-
part approach to evaluation of ASA. The self-assessment element comprises the
rating(s) and information provided by the TTL in the Activity Completion to indicate
achievement of outcomes. The client feedback element comprises information gathered
through the client satisfaction survey. Client feedback is intended to gather the client’s
opinion on the quality, relevance, timeliness, and efficacy of the activity.

Addition of external evaluation (or external validation) as a third element of the
approach to evaluating ASA has come up in discussions between management and IEG
at various times over several years, with ideas floated to have either validation of the
self-assessment by IEG, or to have another external perspective on the quality,
relevance, timeliness, and efficacy of the knowledge product or service.

For Bank ASA, as of June 2015, an overall concept for results frameworks for ASA
exists, as shown in Figure G.2.2 At the highest level, a results framework for ASA
conceptualizes the development goal to which the knowledge work contributes, for

example improved economic outcomes in a country. The important element of this
development goal level is to make explicit how the specific knowledge product or
service is envisioned to contribute to a higher-level development objective, without
claiming attribution. In the ASA results framework, the next level, “Outcomes,” are
smaller-scale or more specific events or changes that are hoped will arise from ASA, but
that are outside the World Bank’s sphere of influence, for example, adoption of a new
regulation or policy. “Intermediate outcomes” are more immediate statements of the
purpose of the World Bank’s ASA, reflecting events or changes that are plausibly within
the control of the World Bank’s. Five categories of intermediate outcomes are identified
in the results framework:

         Development financing informed
         Policy/strategy informed
         Client capacity increased
         Knowledge deepened
         Innovative approaches and solutions generated

For World Bank ASA, there is no practice in place whereby an M&E specialist or other
results professional validated an ASA results frameworks or plan for demonstrating
results.

As of May 2015, for ESW, TA, IE, and TE product lines, self-evaluation elements are
built into project milestones and corporate guidelines for Bank ASA require statements
of a development objective and intermediate outcome. A large number of guidance
documents, intranet pages, and Spark pages are available to lead users through the
process. Based on this review, the guidance available indicates greater attention to the
transactions involved (for example, how to enter the required information in the
Operations Portal) than to the design of ASA and the attendant planning for data or
observations that would signal that an ASA has been successful in achieving its
objectives.

Further simplification of the results framework is anticipated during FY16, as part of
rolling the core client-facing knowledge products into one ASA product type. A
question of interest for future review may be whether simplification will involve
making the communication and guidance available internally consistent, as well as
scanning for outdated guidance and removing it or marking it as superseded.

IFC has a results framework for Advisory Services, as well as guidance on reporting
achievement of project objectives substantiated by evidence that “verifies that the
advice contributed to the change in behavior/practices of the client” and “establishes
the links between changing client behavior/practices and achieved or expected
impacts.”3 An interesting difference in practice is that an M&E review is required for
IFC Advisory Services. Normally, projects that lack this validation do not move
forward, and managers push back on projects with murky statements of objectives or

unrealistic M&E plans. Similarly, before a project can be completed, an M&E specialist
validates that the results reported are supported by the evidence provided.4

Client Feedback Survey and Satisfaction Survey
OPCS established a client feedback mechanism for ASA in approximately FY13, with a
pilot in the previous year. The survey questionnaire asked about the relevance,
technical quality, and timeliness of the ASA the client had been involved in, as well as
questions about acquisition and use of knowledge. To frame analysis of responses to the
questionnaire, OPCS created a schematic showing elements of ASA quality leading to
outcomes (figure G.3). Each of the elements had corresponding client feedback
questions and responses.

      Figure G.3. Schematic: ASA Quality and Outcomes




      Source: OPCS presentations to ABCD meeting, 2014 and 2015


To gather information on use of Client Feedback Survey data, inquiries were posted on
Spark, and emails were sent out to 25 vice-presidential unit (VPU) focal points
identified for the survey of ASA closed in FY14. Nine focal points responded, and of
those, four described specific ways the results of the Client Feedback Survey had been
used. One reported that they used the results of the surveys in VPU-level management
reporting (for example, in Memoranda of Understanding) to report on performance of
their knowledge products or services, but that the limitation on receiving disaggregated
data (that is, data for each specific project) prevented much learning from the data.
Another focal point reported their team conducted their own analyses of survey results
and presented them to managers and TTLs in their own practices. Several TTLs who
received reports customized to their specific ASA product or service expressed
appreciation for them and indicated that the information helped inform future work,
but such a report was not possible for most ASAs because most had fewer than six

responses. Another focal point reported that they used the information showing results
related to quality at the practice-wide forum to stimulate a discussion about how
quality is good but timeliness needed improvement. Several focal points reported
discussions of the results at GP leadership meetings or in other management meetings.

During FY15, OPCS transitioned to a new, shorter Client Satisfaction Survey,
administered at the completion of an ASA activity. This reduces the number of
questions to six, mainly about elements of ASA quality.

Appendix H. Human Aspects of Self-Evaluation
To better understand the user experience of self-evaluation and get deeper insight into
the process, the study team used a variety of innovative and participatory approaches
to collect data:

      Prototyping workshops using user-centric design principles
      Game-enabled simulations of the World Bank project cycle that allowed
       participants to conduct and experience a stylized self-evaluation
      Focus group discussions and interviews with staff to understand the inevitable
       and intrinsic linkages between self-reporting and IEG.

These were triangulated with findings from several publications: The World Development
Report: Mind, Society and Behavior (WDR 2015) provided information on how humans
think and behave and the how considering human thought patterns and behavior can
help in designing development interventions and policies. Additionally, the recent two-
part IEG evaluation Learning and Results from World Bank Operations shed light on how
the World Bank can learn better from its operations.

Why Should Self-Evaluation Look at Human Decision-Making Abilities?
The influence of human behavior, perceptions, and biases toward the self-evaluation
system became very evident during interviews, game simulations, and design
workshops, prompting the study team to dig deeper. While traditional economics
teaches that human beings are rational and make logical decisions, behavioral
economists posit that when faced with making a decision with partial information, time
pressure, or other constraints, several psychological factors come into play. These
factors affect human decision making, which may or not be either economical or
rational. This behavior affects how one approaches self-evaluation as well.

The Bank’s self-evaluation process has promoted a compliance mindset and a focus on
ratings over learning. Changing this mindset will require consideration of how staff
think and behave and of what would give them an incentive to write higher-quality
self-evaluations. To that end, the study team asked: How can self-evaluation in the
World Bank be based more on intrinsic motivation, which builds on how human beings
think and react, rather than on a cumbersome process that feeds a compliance mindset?
Human thinking and decision-making abilities affect all three aspects of self-evaluations
(accountability, performance management, and learning).

Methodology
USER-CENTRIC DESIGN WORKSHOPS

Four eight-hour “User-Centric” Prototyping Workshops that combined user experience
and design thinking (Box H.1) were administered. These focused on the elements of
self-evaluation—accountability, performance management, and learning. Each
prototyping workshop was kept intentionally small at 8 to 10 participants. A total of 36
participants from across the World Bank, IFC, MIGA, and IEG attended the workshops.
The outputs of the first three session were shared with the study team in the fourth
workshop to generate further perspectives.

                                           colored sticks to enclose triangles either
                                           individually or as a group (see photo).
Participants have access to all the rules shaping the system, but do not initially
recognize the emergent complexity (including risks of underperformance resulting from
excessive ambition, inadequate planning or coordination, and luck of the draw). At the
end of the game—after several rounds of strategic stick placement—participants were
encouraged to self-evaluate and rate their performance and that of their project. An IEG
representative assigned a rating to each project based on the number of triangles
enclosed and the original objective. A debrief discussion then took place.

IEG FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSION

The evaluation team also engaged seven IEG staff in a focus group discussion to gather
their input about the validation process and assess possible tensions, as well as explore
alternative systems and solutions. To capture a representative sample of opinions and
experiences, participants were deliberately chosen from different sectors across IEG
including four from the public sector, two from the private sector, and one from the
country and corporate sector. Although each of these sectors are associated with specific
self-evaluation platforms, the group conversation was steered toward three overarching
themes familiar to all participants and relevant to all systems:

         Perceived roles of validators
         Assessing frustrations (both perceived frustrations by users and IEG’s own) and
          disconnect
         Alternative systems, solutions, and incentives.

                                                           HUMAN ASPECTS OF SELF-EVALUATION

Overall Findings
The findings from the various participatory data gathering exercises revealed
limitations to learning from the current self-evaluation system and shed light on why
practitioners are reluctant to embrace the process and IEG’s role as validators.

Practitioners at the World Bank Group are generally frustrated with the current system
and expressed distrust in the process. During each of the user-centric prototyping
workshops, participants expressed discontent with self-evaluation. One person talked
about the “bureaucracy monster’s neglect for the human factor.” This neglect makes the
process impersonal and fuels the compliance mindset. Similarly, gameplay participants
expressed concerns with the “lack of clarity in the relationship” between self-evaluation
components—how can you trust a system that is not fully understood? Validators
participating in the focus group discussions were aware of some of these user
frustrations and shared concerns related to the “box-checking exercise” that currently
characterizes part of the process.

The strong focus on ratings and the disconnect with IEG are important drivers in the
self-evaluation process, and a distraction from learning. Participants from two of the
four workshops as well as some informants interviewed in preparation for these user-
centric events voiced “fear of the disconnect in ratings” potentially leading to what they
perceived to result in “reputation loss.” Avoiding a negative rating therefore often
becomes top priority. Ratings are then widely seen as a powerful incentive to comply
with the self-evaluation system rather than a tool to promote operational learning. The
inadequacy of the system in this regard strips the exercise of its value for practitioners
that perhaps would otherwise prioritize better performance and reflective learning.
Likewise, validators recognized that the focus on avoiding the rating disconnect limits
learning. Game session participants were also observed to be driven emotionally by the
IEG rating, provoking extended discussions on the topic during the debrief sessions.

Practitioners and validators alike expressed the need for safe reflective space to share
stories and relevant experiences as well as results. Behavioral cues and responses
during all the experimental exercises revealed that staff tend to be candid and express
concerns more freely in an open, judgment-free, casual environment. For example, the
mood of reflection at the prototyping workshops facilitated open communication and
frank discussions about the current self-evaluation architecture and possible alternative
models. Workshop participants voiced concerns with the “rigid structure” of self-
evaluation formats hindering reflective thought. To validators, a safe reflective space,
much like the prototyping workshops and gaming sessions, takes the form of “monthly
informal forums hosted with refreshments where development professionals can

interact and learn face-to-face.” Opportunities to provide candid feedback about
operations are in demand.

Users want a flexible system that is transparent, adaptable, and promotes real-time
learning as well as sharing of information. In addition to a safe reflective space,
participants in the user-centric workshops urged a more flexible and adaptable system
that permits operational staff to reevaluate priorities and overarching goals as projects
evolve. These should also be considered in the IEG validation and rating process. IEG
validators at the focus group discussions agreed that real-time learning should be
promoted and suggested that the self-evaluation exercise incorporate a running “live-
record” of operations conducted twice a year and used ultimately to evaluate the
project as a whole. They also suggested the use of online tools mirroring a social media
platform for the purpose of sharing real-time experience and learning from each other
across projects, regions, and practices.

Plotting the Course Ahead
Bringing about culture change requires time, direction, and trial and error. The
suggestions provided below are “compass points,” or broad guiding principles. These
are placed into three principles of human decision making (Table H.1) by
contextualizing the recommendations provided by the WDR 2015 and the recent IEG
evaluation Learning and Results in World Bank Operations.

COMPASS POINT ONE: THINKING AUTOMATICALLY

In “automatic thinking” (Table H.1)            Table H.1. Two Systems of Thinking

                                               People have two systems of thinking—the automatic system

Make Self-Evaluation More Intuitive and Personal (But Not Simplistic)

As heard in the user-centric workshops and focus groups, staff currently view self-
evaluations as a procedural exercise without much credibility and tend to complete
them from an “automatic system thinking” standpoint. As a corrective suggestion, self-

                                                                                   APPENDIX H
                                                             HUMAN ASPECTS OF SELF-EVALUATION
evaluation systems should be designed in a way that activates deliberative, reflective
thinking. This model would require reflective thought to arrive at a sound conclusion.

As much as possible use staff “automatic thinking” as levers, which may lead to better
written and used self-evaluations. Consider making the questions intuitive, well
framed, aptly sequenced, and anchored which will help trigger cognitive thinking to
help recall crucial facts, data, and lessons. While not a perfect example, in the IFC self-
evaluation template, staff are simply instructed to recall, “what was expected, what
happened and why, what are the lessons for future operations.” This prompts staff to
structure their thinking, reflect on what happened, and identify lessons based on
reasoning.

To help activate deliberative thinking, consider these additional factors to get better
written and more useful self-evaluations.

       Think “salient and sequential”: “The way in which facts (information) are asked
        and presented influence how one absorbs them and how judgments are reached.
        People tend to “process information that is most salient to them” (WDR 2015, 29
        and 30). Since staff will recall recent key facts and lessons easily—ask them to
        think beyond that and guide them to think along timelines or in sequential
        order so that critical information is not overlooked.
       Anchoring: Ask questions in a calculated order that provide hints or clues to help
        them think and recall. A prior question or the inclusion of some hints in a
        previous question can influence what information an individual retrieves for the
        next question (WDR 2015, 31).
       Default options: Think along the lines of setting defaults in self-evaluation, which
        take advantage of people’s tendency to accept default settings.
       Choice architecture: Simplifying the choice architecture influences decision
        making.

          (1) By simplifying the presentation of options
          (2) By helping to automatically evoke particular associations
          (3) By making one option more salient or easier to choose.

       Loss aversion: People do not like to report loss or assume loss, so frame questions
        in a positive way that will encourage people to reveal more information and
        data than when questions are framed in terms of what was expected but not
        achieved.

Move from “Box Checking” to Capturing Personal Team Experience

While asking staff to be more deliberative and
reflective in thinking, make the template capture
team and personal experiences by asking for
anecdotes and quotes from beneficiaries/clients and
so on. This will help capture richer information and
the report consumers will remember the data better.

COMPASS POINT TWO: THINKING SOCIALLY

People are influenced by what
they see, hear, and perceive.          Box H.2. Don’t Wait for “GP Weeks” to Present Your

evaluations (box H.2). IEG’s
recent evaluation on learning
and results found that most staff rely on tacit knowledge or informal gatherings to learn
from each other. Staff learn from seeing, imitating, and improvising from each other.
Perceptions that ICRs are not useful or provide only generic lessons, can be overcome
by introducing concepts that build on existing social networks. Self-evaluation systems
will benefit by being more flexible and geared toward socializing learning.

Create safe space to foster learning and exchange of tacit knowledge. Teams that meet
more frequently and share ideas more often tend to produce better results (WDR 2015).
Promote more safe space for staff to learn and foster creativity. Some GPs have
introduced safe-space clinics at the beginning of projects. The Bank would benefit from
scaling up these clinics throughout project implementation, which will allow staff to
discuss, share, and learn from each other. The recent initiative of the World Bank’s to

introduce a pool of expert peer reviewers and have Quality Enhancement Reviews to
discuss ICRs is a very positive signal.

More carrots, less stick—Incentivize self-
evaluation. As evidenced by the 2015 IEG
evaluation Learning and Results from Bank
Operations 2, the right incentives are needed for
staff to perform and be encouraged to learn.
During gaming sessions and the design
workshops, staff mentioned that the incentive to
write good self-evaluations and use them later was very weak. It was seen only from an
accountability standpoint and thus staff incentive is only to ensure that one does not get
downgraded by IEG.

While IEG is not endorsing these, staff made a few suggestions that would make them
feel more incentivized:

       Have a sample of completion self-evaluations
        discussed by the Board of Directors. This will
        ensure a sense of accountability and also provide
        staff with an opportunity to present their
        accomplishments and lessons.
       Celebrate project completions and not just project approvals.
       Celebrate when teams turn around a problem project. Publicize it and provide
        incentives to staff who achieve it. This may help people admit to problems in
        projects more openly.
       Include a category under the annual performance review for lessons captured
        from operations.
       IEG may consider including a rating for quality of lessons captured in the self-
        evaluation template. Also collaborate more with IEG on lessons from
        evaluations.
       Allocate more time to capture lessons.
       Ensure new projects under preparation adequately reflect the lessons learned
        from previous operations.

COMPASS POINT THREE: THINKING WITH MENTAL MODELS

The principle of mental models focuses on the tendency of human beings to rely on
what they already know about certain subjects and draw on available concepts,
theories, and opinions to shape and define what they are thinking (WDR 2015). People
take mental models for granted or as truths, which often leads to stereotyping and bias.



                                                                                       169
APPENDIX H
HUMAN ASPECTS OF SELF-EVALUATION
The negative perceptions of staff lead them to conclude that self-evaluations are not
very useful. Evidence suggests that staff are biased about self-evaluation systems and
generally accept this perception. Staff are so caught up in the mental model that
marginal changes to self-evaluation systems alone will not suffice to improve
perceptions. Some ways to change this perception emerged from the various exercises.

         Invoke positive aspects of the self-evaluation system and the intellectual
          curiosity of staff. To overcome the bias against self-evaluation systems, identify
          the positive aspects that staff see in self-evaluation. Most World Bank Group
          staff enjoy intellectual curiosity and gaining the respect of their peers. Consider
          designing processes that allow staff to gain recognition and credibility by
          completing well-substantiated self-evaluations regardless of a project’s outcome.
         Reduce the “cognitive tax” on staff by devising an ongoing, transparent, and
          partially automated self-evaluation system. Development is complicated and
          staff often have to deal with a myriad of issues and tackle bureaucratic hurdles
          under tight deadlines. Under constant pressure, the chances of making mistakes
          or the wrong decision are much higher. This places a cognitive tax (WDR 2015)
          on staff. While it may not be possible to overcome all burdens staff deal with, it
          is best to ask staff to interact with self-evaluation systems when their cognitive
          tax is at a minimum.
         Recommendations from a producer perspective: consider introducing a
          continuous/rolling self-evaluation system that captures information in real time
          and remains active throughout the project cycle and requires inputs as the
          project progresses (for example, build on the existing ISRs). Additionally, the
          use of pre-populated fields can help capturing information less tedious.
         Recommendations from a consumer point of view: introduce pop-up alerts and
          smart search options that alert users to the location of relevant information from
          past projects—for example, when a staff member creates a new project in the
          Operations Portal, have a pop up link them to information on similar projects,
          which will be timely and increase the likelihood of staff reading the lessons.

Conclusions
Self-evaluation is an inherently human process with the potential to be very valuable if
it triggers reflection and learning. However, it can also be a source of frustration if the
system is seen as too constraining and focusing on the unessential. While most agree
that ratings can serve accountability purposes, along with other factors, they crowd out
learning and trigger many concerns. The Bank Group needs to consider human
behavior and design self-evaluation systems that leverage those behaviors. The
compass points mentioned above are suggested to help in thinking that through.
