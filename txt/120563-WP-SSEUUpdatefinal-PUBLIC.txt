  viii   Executive Summary
    Box 1       Inflation stabilization plans


All stabilization plans need a nominal anchor to lower inflation and they differ among each other
depending on which nominal anchor is used. Nominal anchors play a fundamental role in successful
stabilization plans. First, setting a predetermined path for the exchange rate or the amount of money
helps pin down prices and controls inflation expectations. Second, a nominal anchor limits political
pressures to pursue expansionary monetary policies that could fuel inflation. Third, nominal anchors
send a strong signal to the market that the policy regime has shifted and the government is credibly
committed to fighting inflation.


Experiences with stabilization plans suggest that they vary in their speed at which inflation
is reduced, the business cycle they create, and their sustainability over time. When choosing a
stabilization plan, policymakers are confronted with trade-offs regarding “speed vs. sustainability”
and likely “recession now vs. recession later.” On the one hand, ERBS is very successful at reducing
inflation quickly, even in countries where inflation is exceptionally high. In addition, immediately
after its implementation it creates an economic boom. However, over time the economic expansion
is followed by a recession. The economic downturn, which might include a financial crisis, can trigger
the collapse of the stabilization plan and the reemergence of inflation. As a result, ERBS is relatively
short-lived, sometimes only being in place for four or five years before it is abandoned. On the other
hand, MBS decreases inflation but only gradually while initially creating a contraction of economic
activity. However, once this downturn is passed, economic growth returns and inflation continues to
slow down. As a result, MBSs are more sustainable over time.


A common feature of ERBS and MBS is that both require a strong institutional framework to be
implemented successfully. Whether the central bank is targeting the exchange rate, the growth
rate of money, or the inflation rate, the monetary authority needs to send clear signals to the public
that its main goal is to comply with the target. This includes, among others, that the central bank
is independent, has a legal mandate to control inflation, is free from political pressures, and has
adequate disclosure standards. If the public does not believe that the central bank is committed to
fighting inflation, the stabilization plan will unlikely succeed. Another important precondition for the
successful adoption of ERBS and MBS is fiscal discipline. A country that implements a stabilization
plan but fails to control fiscal deficits is more prone to pursuing an expansionary monetary policy.
For countries under an ERBS, expansionary monetary policies would sooner or later lead to a fall in
reserves that could force the central bank to abandon the peg. Likewise, in countries under an MSB,
an increase in the money supply beyond the target would undermine the credibility of the central
bank. In both cases, this will weaken the main pillar of the stabilization plan: the nominal anchor
supposed to endure in the long term.

   Does the choice of exchange rate regime matter for aid effectiveness in restoring macroeconomic
   stability?


   Based on the experience of 38 countries emerging from war and conflict, Elbadawi and Soto (2013)
   suggest that post-conflict performances of the fixed and managed regimes were very similar, and
   were superior to that of a floating regime. While inflation was in single digits under the fixed and the
   managed floating regimes, it was more than 16 percent under the floating regime.


   More in-depth empirical analysis confirms that in post-conflict economies, both the fixed and managed
   regimes have direct stabilizing effects on inflation. Aid does not seem to have a direct effect on
   post-conflict inflation under the fixed and managed regimes, while it was found to have a stabilizing
   impact under the floating regime.


   Therefore, it seems that the free-floating exchange regime may not be appropriate for countries emerging
   from wars and conflict situations. The managed floating regime seems to have an edge on two critical
   areas of economic performance: (i) aid promotes post-conflict demand for money balances and (ii)
   the monetary reconstruction role of aid is likely to be more effective under this exchange rate regime.

      Box 3       Oil revenue forecast and governance4


South Sudan’s legal frameworks for oil and gas management are either poorly implemented or
partially absent. The absence of a permanent constitution leads to uncertainty with respect to the
legal framework related to the oil and gas sector. Currently, the management of petroleum and gas
is based on two legal frameworks. The National Petroleum Act (PA) of the Republic of South Sudan
(RSS) governs the management of petroleum resources while the Petroleum Revenue Management
Act (PRMA) governs the allocation and accounting for the proceeds of the government’s share of
production. Although the frameworks exist, their implementation is very limited. Furthermore, the
downstream sector (refining, exporting and product pricing) is currently not regulated.


Petroleum revenue management is insufficiently monitored. The last national and publicly
released audit was conducted for 2008 raising major concerns for accounting and documentation
of transactions. The National Audit Chamber would benefit from appropriate funding and staffing so
that audits of the national accounts can be brought up to date and extended to the state and local
levels. Additional gaps could be reduced by establishing regulatory certainty by regulations, formal
processes for budget interactions with the operators, a recoverable cost audit, improved and better
resourced internal and external audit function as well as establishing the Public Accounts Committee.


The RSS can induce oil operators to continue production at low oil prices by allowing larger recovery
of costs. Once oil production becomes unprofitable in the medium-term, operators are likely to
terminate their contracts. An oil price of at least US$83/bbl is required to keep production in all blocks
going. The minimum oil price required drops by 20 percent if the operators are allowed to recover
100 percent of costs. Oil production becomes unprofitable for all blocks at an oil price below US$38.2/
bbl even if Government allows 100 percent cost recovery and relinquishes its share in revenues. Thus,
an oil price permanently below this will likely lead to a stop of production.


Large-scale investment in investment in Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) can substantially increase
oil revenues for the Government. A resumption of production in all blocks would generate 18 percent
higher Government oil revenues over the remaining lifetime of the oil fields compared to current
production (Scenario “Peace” in Figure 1). Additional investment into EOR and the construction of a
350 km pipeline to remove restrictions on current production due to export limitations would provide
142 percent additional revenues (Scenario “Investment’ in Figure 1). Thus, an investment into EOR and
the pipeline – if enabled by security as well as regulatory and contractual certainty – can substantially
increase oil revenues for the next decades. At this stage, however, such a scenario remains highly unlikely.

The RSS can help attract needed investment by providing security, regulatory certainty and
overcoming the monopolistic export infrastructure. Investors need to be confident that the state can
provide the necessary security for the private sector to work in the contract area without disruption.
Furthermore, investors still face risks arising from changes in regulatory and legal framework. The
risk could be reduced by implementing a permanent constitution and the ratification of existing
laws governing the sector. Another disincentive to investment is that the only export infrastructure
available is under a monopolist control. In addition to moderately high oil prices, discoveries must be
large enough to justify construction of alternative export routes. The international community could
support the necessary studies to establish the costs of an alternate pipeline route. This would likely
establish some negotiating boundaries for the parties and potentially lead to a long-term agreement
to provide the certainty for investment in the petroleum sector in the RSS.


A reform in the oil sector should be accompanied by a transparent use of funds to benefit the people
of South Sudan. Even if the contracts are extended and investments are made, it will be difficult to
ensure that oil revenues are consistently used for the “benefit of the people of South Sudan” as the
Transitional Constitution requires. The RSS could create a social protection program using oil funds
to make periodic payments to specific categories of vulnerable citizens. However, for the public to
able to participate in the discussion related to the use of resource revenues, they would also need to
have access to information regarding the amount of revenues received and their current distribution.
A transparent, fair and public use of funds would add to the credibility of the Government and, thus,
could contribute to stability and peace in South Sudan.

The High Frequency Survey collected panel data for a representative sample of urban households
to relate inflation to changes in livelihoods between 2015 and 2016. The survey conducted repeated
interviews for a sample of 643 households in urban centers across 6 of the 10 former states of South
Sudan, drawn randomly based on a stratified two stage clustered design.¹⁵ The fieldwork for Wave 1
was undertaken between the months of February to November 2015, and Wave 2 from January to
May 2016. Although inflation had not reached its current levels, price increases remained high over
the sample period, with prices in May 2016 reaching almost five times their February 2015 levels.¹⁶
The conflict did not escalate until after July 2016, thus, the changes in livelihoods observed between
the two waves were not primarily driven by insecurity.


The HFS questionnaire covers a large range of topics, and paints a well-rounded picture of the
material and psychological well-being of people in urban areas of South Sudan. The HFS questionnaire

             in the technical appendix accompanying the data. The data and the appendix are freely available on the World

covers topics including demographics, employment, education, consumption, as well as perceptions
of well-being and of the effectiveness of public institutions. Consumption is measured using the
newly developed rapid consumption methodology. In the rapid consumption methodology food
and non-food consumption items are partitioned into core and non-core modules, and households
are asked only about items in the core and in an assigned module. This reduces the number of items
asked to households from 270 to about 120, household consumption is then estimated based on
within survey multiple imputations.¹⁷


The data is complemented by video testimonials providing a glimpse of the lives of the people of
South Sudan. At the end of the interviews, respondents are offered to provide a short video testimonial
where they can share their views and anything they would like to communicate. This creates a more
rounded perception of the situation on the ground in South Sudan. The translated testimonials are
available at http://www.thepulseofsouthsudan.com.

    Box 5         Hyperinflation experiences


Many countries ranging from France in 1795 to Zimbabwe in the recent years have witnessed periods
of hyperinflation. More developed countries such as Germany, USSR, Austria, Poland, Bulgaria and
Hungary have gone through hyperinflation, albeit way back in time after the First World War. After the
Second World War, Hungary, Greece, China, Taiwan and the Philippines went through exceptionally
high inflation. During the 1990s, many Europe and Central Asian (ECA) economies such as Armenia,
Ukraine, Bulgaria, Estonia, Azerbaijan, Russia, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Kazakhstan went through
hyperinflation. Latin American countries such as Peru, Argentina and Brazil, as well as African
countries such as Congo (and the DRC in the late 1990s), Angola and Zimbabwe also went through
hyperinflationary situations.²⁶


The reality of hyperinflation is that prices change so rapidly that everyday items rise exponentially and
money becomes worthless, virtually overnight or even in the course of a working day (see Figure 21).

  ²⁶ This is based on Hanke and Krus (2013) compilation. This is different from previous studies using Cagan (1956)
  definition that documented fewer records of hyperinflation. For example, Fisher, Sahay, and Végh (2002) report that
  between 1920 and 1946 there were eight hyperinflations, while there were no cases between 1947 and 1984. Since
  1984 to 2007, there have been fifteen hyperinflation cases. Using a 12-month inflation rate of 1,000 percent as the
  threshold for defining a period of high inflation, Coorey et al. (2007) identify 30 episodes of inflation in 24 countries
  between 1980 and 2005, including countries from Latin American (5), Europe and Central Asia (17), and Africa (2). Six
  of these countries (Argentina; Brazil; Democratic Republic of Congo; Macedonia, FYR/SFRY; Nicaragua; and Tajikistan)
  out of the 24 countries experienced two periods of high inflation.




  27     2. Special Focus - Taming the tides of high inflation: policy options for South Sudan
In general, hyperinflation coincides with wars and a series of ill-advised fiscal policy decisions that
result in a rapid increase in the money supply without economic growth support. Hanke and Kruse
(2013) point out that hyperinflation occurred when the supply of money had no natural constraints
and was governed by a discretionary paper money standard.” This shows that any fiat currency is
susceptible to rampant inflation, although to take hold, hyperinflation requires a series of extreme
political and social circumstances.


The length and the severity of hyperinflation have varied across countries. For example, Hanke and
Krus (2013) report that during the inflationary period in Hungary (1945-46), an increase in consumer
prices as high as 4.19 × 1016% was recorded in July 1946 (see Annex 2 for more details). Coorey et al.
(2007) find that the length of the crisis in ECA countries is close to one year, while in Latin American
economies the median was twice as long. Until the early 2000s, high inflation was prevalent in Latin
American economies. In fact, the region suffered from chronic inflation and registered the highest
inflation rate in the world. Inflation reached a peak between the 1980s and 1990s when many Latin
American countries suffered from exceptionally high inflation and, even, hyperinflation. In the period
1981-90 the average annual inflation rate among Latin American countries reached 145 percent
whereas in the period 1991-98 this value was 97 percent (Elberg et al., 1999). In some years, annual
inflation even surpassed 1,000 percent in some countries (Burki and Perry, 1997). However, by the
end of the 1990s, inflation started to relent in Latin America and in 1998 average annual inflation in
the region reached 11 percent (Elberg et al., 1999). Since then, Latin American countries have been
successful in maintaining inflation in check and, with some exceptions, countries have been able to
keep annul inflation below a two-digit value. In the context of unbridled inflation during the 1980s
and the 1990s, Latin America became a laboratory in which policymakers experimented with a wide
range of stabilization plans in an attempt to put a halt to inflation.

  ²⁷ A credible and clear policy that pins down the currency exchange, be it gold standard or another stable currency,

  down inflationary pressures. Following Germany, many other European countries accepted to peg their currency
  against gold as a strategy for curbing inflation. These countries include Austria (1923), Poland (1924), and Hungary
  (1925). Since the abandonment of the gold standard at the outbreak of WWI and the Bretton Woods Conference
  following WWII, several countries have managed to stabilize their currency by pegging their local currency to a major
  convertible currency.

    Box 6           Advantages and disadvantages of dollarization

Advantages associated with dollarization.²⁸ Dollarization (i) resolves the problem of credibility and
hence promotes macroeconomic stability, with declining inflation and interest rates; (ii) eliminates
the risk of depreciation of the domestic currency, a factor that contributes to accelerated inflation;
(iii) lowers the currency risk premia associated with depreciation and hence improves access to
international capital markets (Berg and Borensztein, 2000) and lower information costs (Calvo 2002);
(iv) eliminates transaction costs of currency exchange to the anchor currency (Fischer 1982; De Grauwe
2000) and reduces financial fragility (Hausmann et al., 1999); and (v) enhances fiscal discipline by
eliminating the possibility of monetization of fiscal deficits (Fischer 1982; Eichengreen 2001) and by
motivating the government to either look for alternative sources of revenue or reduce expenditures.


Disadvantages to dollarization. These include: (i) loss of the option to print money, influence the
economy, including the right to administer monetary policy and any form of exchange rate regime;
(ii) loss of the central bank’s ability to collect seigniorage revenue, which is instead collected by the
U.S. This could be as high as 7% of GDP (Bogetic, 2000); (iii) loss of the central bank’s role as the lender
of last resort for its banking system; and (iv) need to buy back securities in U.S. dollars, implying that
the country would have to collect enough reserves or run a current account deficit.


Early empirical work on fully or partially dollarized economies suggests that for a given fiscal deficit,
dollarization exacerbates the resulting inflation rate, and increases the volatility of inflation and
exchange rates (Rojas-Suarez, 1992; McNelis and Asilis, 1992; Akçay, Alper and Karasulu, 1997). Several
studies confirm that the exchange rate pass through on inflation is higher for dollarized economies
(e.g. Reinhart, Rogoff and Savastano, 2003). For instance, Kavila and Roux (2016) find that a post-
dollarization in Zimbabwe one percent increase in South African inflation resulted in a 0.3 percent
increase in inflation in Zimbabwe. Similarly, a one per cent appreciation in the South African rand
against the US dollar induced a 0.1 per cent increase in inflation in Zimbabwe.




  ²⁸ Bogetic´ (2000); Chang (2000); LeBaron and McCulloch (2000), offer different perspectives on the costs and
  benefits of official dollarization.

  ³¹ In this note we consider inflation targeting as a specific case of money targeting stabilization plans. The theoretical
  literature typically analyzes them as different types of stabilization plans (see, for example, Mishkin 1999 or Corbo, 2002).
  However, in empirical papers, this distinction is not made (see, for example, Kiguel and Liviatan, 1992, Reinhart and
  Vegh, 1994, and Calvo and Vegh, 1999). We opt for the latter option because looking at their characteristics inflation
  targeting is essentially a monetary targeting plan with additional features. In fact, many countries that have started
  with monetary targeting, over time refined their plans and transitioned toward inflation targeting.

Does the choice of exchange rate regime matter for aid effectiveness in restoring macroeconomic stability?


Based on the experience of 38 countries emerging from war and conflict, Elbadawi and Soto (2013)
suggest that post-conflict performances of the fixed and managed regimes were very similar, and
were superior to that of a floating regime. While inflation was in single digits under the fixed and the
managed floating regimes, it was more than 16 percent under the floating regime.


More in-depth empirical analysis confirms that in post-conflict economies, both the fixed and
managed regimes have direct stabilizing effects on inflation. Aid does not seem to have a direct
effect on post-conflict inflation under the fixed and managed regimes, while it was found to have a
stabilizing impact under the floating regime.


Therefore, it seems that the free-floating exchange regime may not be appropriate for countries
emerging from wars and conflict situations. The managed floating regime seems to have an edge
on two critical areas of economic performance: (i) aid promotes post-conflict demand for money
balances and (ii) the monetary reconstruction role of aid is likely to be more effective under this
exchange rate regime.

Notes:								
- When a country experiences periods of hyperinflation that are broken up by 12 or more consecutive months with
a monthly inflation rate below 50%, the periods are defined as separate episodes of hyperinflation.			
					
- The currency listed in the chart is the one that, in a particular location, is associated with the highest monthly
rate of inflation. The currency may not have been the only one that was in circulation, in that location, during the
episode.								
- We are aware of one other case of hyperinflation: North Korea. We reached this conclusion after calculating
inflation rates using data from the foreign exchange black market, and also by observing changes in the price of
rice. Based on our estimates, this episode of hyperinflation most likely occurred from December 2009 to mid-
January 2011. Using black-market exchange-rate data, and calculations based on purchasing power parity, we
determined that the North Korean hyperinflation peaked in early March 2010, with a monthly rate of 496%
(implying a 6.13% daily inflation rate and a price-doubling time of 11.8 days). When we used rice price data, we
calculated the peak month to be mid-January 2010, with a monthly rate of 348% (implying a 5.12% daily inflation
rate and a price-doubling time of 14.1 days). All of these data were obtained August 13, 2012 from Daily NK, an
online newspaper that focuses on issues relating to North Korea (http://www.dailynk.com/english/market.php).
We also acknowledge that our investigation was aided by reports from Good Friends USA, a Korean-American
advocacy and research organization, as well as from Marcus Noland at the Peterson Institute for International
Economics. 								
(*) The authors calculated Zimbabwe’s inflation rate, from August to November 2008, using changes in the price
of the stock, Old Mutual, which was traded both on the Harare and London stock exchanges. The stock prices
yielded an implied exchange rate for Zimbabwe dollars, under purchasing power parity.

until early 1994, the National Bank of Republika Srpska issued its own unique currency, the Republika Srpska

(‡) Greece’s inflation rate was estimated by calculating the drachma / gold sovereign exchange rate.			
					
(§) The peak monthly inflation rate listed for China in the table differs from that presented in one of the authors’
previous pieces on hyperinflation (Hanke and Kwok, 2009). This revision is based on new data from a number of
sources, which were recently obtained from the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.				
				
(**) We calculated the Free City of Danzig’s inflation rate using German inflation data, since the German papiermark
was in circulation in Danzig during this time. It is worth noting that Germany and Danzig experienced different
peak months of hyperinflation. This is case because the last full month in which the German papiermark circulated
in the Free City of Danzig was September 1923. Germany continued to circulate the papiermark beyond this point,
and subsequently experienced its peak month of hyperinflation (October 1923).

States of the Former USSR. In this publication, the authors stated that the data should be viewed with an extra
degree of caution because the statistics were taken from the corresponding official internal government source
and not independently reviewed by the World Bank. However, these statistics are official and are the only source
of data available for the corresponding time periods for each country.
