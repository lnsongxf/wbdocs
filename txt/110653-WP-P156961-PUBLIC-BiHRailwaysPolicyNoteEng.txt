                       SUMMARY OF FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
                                 Purpose of the Policy Note
This Policy Note has been prepared to assist the governments of the Entities in Bosnia
and Herzegovina to better understand the current conditions of the railway sector,
assess the policy options for modernizing it and help chart a course ahead. Railway
performance is benchmarked against a number of regional comparator countries and against
the EU average. The financial performance of each railway has been examined by main business
sectors (freight, passenger and network infrastructure) using a railway cost allocation model
developed by the Bank. Sector policies have also been assessed in terms of budget impact.

Public policy decisions on the railway sector are the prerogative of the governments of
the Entities. To help inform their decisions a range of structural and policy options is
presented, their key features delineated and relative merits discussed. The range of policy
options has been discussed with representatives of the Entity governments and railways but
no endorsement of any policy option has been given at this stage. The Policy Note does present
the Bank team’s opinions on certain of the options where this seems warranted but is not
intended to be prescriptive.



                                The institutional framework
Bosnia’s legal framework 1 for the sector has established a two-railway system with two
centers of governance, one railways corporation and one BiH regulator. In the Federation
of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBH) the railway is managed by Željeznice Federacije Bosne I
Hercegovine (ŽFBH) and in Republika Srpska by Željeznice Republike Srpske (ŽRS). The Entity
governments are majority (though not exclusive) owners of the railways located within their
territory. They are responsible for its policy framework, performance oversight, and budgetary
support as well as for the inter-entity coordination through the Railways Corporation (BHŽJK).
At the BiH level, the Railway Regulatory Board (RRB) is responsible for international regulation.
Figure 1 is a functional map broadly describing the ‘de facto’ roles of the main institutions. The
sector faces three critical policy challenges relating to international obligations, sector
strategy and company performance.

    Railway transport operations



The Law on Railways of Bosnia and Herzegovina of 2005 was intended broadly to reflect
European Union directives for railways. The law provides for a degree of separation between
railway transport services and infrastructure management, introduces License and a Safety
Certificate for train operators, the establishment of a Railway Regulatory Board, and
introduction of the concept of a track access fee. The law indicates that its purposes are to
ensure the development of a sound railway transport system with effective competition
among train operators and with other transport modes, to ensure non-discriminatory access
to railway infrastructure, to encourage efficient and transparent management of the railway
sector, to follow prevailing international practices and applicable directives of the European
Union, to promote a safe and efficient railway transport system, and to ensure fair and
efficient regulatory decisions.

The Law on Railways of Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina makes the ŽFBH the
manager of railway infrastructure in FBH and adopts some similar articles to the BiH law
in terms of vertical separation and competition. FBH is the owner of the railway
infrastructure2. The law was established in 2001 and amended in 20123. According to the law,

2
  Although the law specifies that FBH is the owner of the railway infrastructure, currently 8.2% of
ŽFBH belong to private shareholders.
3
  Amendment published in the Official Gazette of FBiH, issue No. 25/12 whose objective was for the
FBiH Railways to continue their operations as a limited liability company. The amendments reduced
the number of members of the Supervisory Board (Management Board) from 11 to 7, and a new article
was added, Article 21a, according to which the company is under obligation to act in compliance with
the decisions of the Regulatory Board as determined in the Law on Railways of BiH.

                                                 8
                                   BiH Railways Policy Note


competition in the railway market through entry of a new company is possible as ŽFBH shall
allow approved operators access to railway infrastructure without discrimination if operators
accept designated railway routes and pay an adequate infrastructure fee to ŽFBH. The law
mandates accounting separation (but no other degree of separation) between infrastructure
management and transport operations. The law provides a basis of compensation by the
Entity government and Cantons to reimburse ŽFBH for loss-making railway passenger
services. However, there is no specification of contract form, scale of compensation or how to
calculate the amount.

A new Railways Law in RS is under preparation to be harmonized with the EU rail acquis.
The draft law as published in March 2016 proposes to restructure ZRS to promote its financial
stability, and for the railway network to be integrated into the European network. The draft
law divides roles of the entity government, the infrastructure manager and the train operator,
introducing vertical separation in railway transport with the possibility for third party
operators to enter the market. The draft law in its current form does not establish the
principles for calculating the infrastructure access fees. Also, the draft law does not provide
the basis for estimating and contracting for payment of Public Obligation Services for non-
profitable passenger lines. A more comprehensive review of the railways organization and laws
is provided in Annex I.

Although the institutional arrangements in BiH are particular to the country, the two
railways themselves are relatively straightforward and share many of the features and
problems of state-owned railways worldwide. The Policy Note benchmarks performance at
the Entities’ levels and first considers the options within the current framework of roles and
responsibilities, taking the current arrangements as the starting point. The similarities in the
role, structure and transport functions of each railway means that the policy issues and
options are also much the same and would not be materially different if the two railways were
one. However, the need for each Entity to consider new structural arrangements in response
to BiH agreements with the EU also offers opportunities for the Entity governments to
reconsider how best to co-operate to mutual advantage in the European railway market. These
wider dimensions and possibilities are therefore also addressed in the Policy Note.



                                    Railway performance
FBH’s network has about 600km and is the most intensely-used freight railway in the
region with about 1.4 million tonnes per route-km, nearly 20 percent higher than the EU
average. In 2014, ŽFBH carried 8.5 million tonnes for 885 million net tonne-km. ŽFBH achieves
good locomotive and wagon productivity though an already old fleet continues to age. Despite
low labor productivity and the poor overall financial results, the freight sector earns a
creditable surplus above operating costs. Passenger rail services however make a near-
negligible contribution to FBH’s overall personal mobility needs. In 2014, ŽFBH carried 355,000
passengers (fewer than 1,000 passengers/day). With an estimated total passenger operating
costs of about BAM 23 million, the financial results for the passenger sector represent a poor
use of operating resources and a financial drain on the surplus from freight operations. Because
there is a heavy implicit subsidy from the freight to the passenger sector, the ability of freight
to contribute to infrastructure costs is correspondingly low.

The railway network in the Republika Srpska consists of 426 route-km (of which 353
route-km are in use) being one of the smallest networks in the Western Balkans region.
ŽRS freight traffic density of about one million tonnes/route-km is high compared to
neighboring countries and about 80 percent of the EU average4. In 2015, it carried around 5
million tonnes for 428 million net tonne-km (ntkm). Despite a weak overall financial status,
ŽRS actually earns a healthy surplus on freight operations relative to its operating costs. By
contrast, there are substantial losses on passenger services, even allowing for revenue support
from the budget. Passenger rail transport is marginal to the RS’s overall transport system,
carrying only about 460 passengers/day. Passengers have declined in recent years and train
occupancy now averages only about 14 passengers/train equivalent to less than half a bus-
load. Even with RS budget support, passenger unit revenues cover around a third of direct
expenses of passenger services and 16 percent of total operating costs. ŽRS is not financially
sustainable in its current role and form. The amount of total revenues, including budget
support, was just about sufficient to cover cash operating expenses, with labor costs
representing a disproportionate component of the cost structure of ŽRS.



                                     The policy challenges
Restructuring for compliance with the EU railway acquis
A specific policy challenge is to meet the terms of EU-Bosnia and Herzegovina
Stabilization and Association Agreement (2015) as they apply to the railway sector. The
obligation is to harmonize sector policies with the EU railway framework of directives and
regulations (the ‘EU railway acquis’). The framework needs action in a number of areas to
become compliant. The areas that most immediately bear on responsibilities currently
exercised by the Entity governments are those related to institutional structure, track access,
budgetary support for passenger services; budgetary support for infrastructure; and debt
sustainability. Compliance requires both structural and process changes in the railway sector.

Implementation of an affordable sector strategy
A second and more long-standing policy challenge is the need for both Entities to settle
on a financially sustainable railway sector strategy. Annual deficits recur year after year,
even after receiving budget support from the respective Entity governments. This is partly due
to railway employment policies and partly due to underfunded passenger losses. Over 97
percent of the traffic of both railways is freight, and both earn a creditable surplus on freight
transport relative to operating costs. But nearly half of all the train distance run (42 percent
in FBH and 49 percent in RS) comprises passenger trains. They carry few passengers but are
a huge cost burden which consumes most of the freight surplus, which is therefore not
available to re-invest in the freight rail business or contribute more to the upkeep of the
infrastructure networks. To illustrate the scale of this problem if, in compliance with the EU
rail acquis, passenger services had been adequately reimbursed through Public Services
Contracts (PSC) in 2014, the average subsidy per return trip would have been about BAM 108
in FBH, and BAM 168 in RS. While providing subsidies for non-profitable passenger lines
through PSC is allowed, cross-subsidizing passenger trips from freight earnings is contrary to

equals the EU average.

the EU rail acquis, but more crucially is a poor use of resources as better passenger services
could be offered at lower costs using intercity buses. Moreover, cross-subsidizing passenger
services by freight increases the cost of doing business for firms relying on the railway freight,
reflected in a high average freight rate compared to neighboring countries. New sector policies
are essential to make the railway system more cost-effective and sustainable.

Adoption of a commercial management culture
The third challenge is an extension of the previous two and is the imperative for railways
to become, and be allowed by their owners to become, more commercially-focused. Both
geopolitical and structural economic changes in the region mean that traffic levels can never
reach historic levels experienced as part of the former Yugoslavia nor justify the levels of
employment and assets that those high traffic levels supported. It is important that railway
managements be allowed and encouraged to adopt a more commercial ‘zero-based’5 approach
to the assets, human resources, operating and maintenance standards, workshop
requirements, work practices and business processes they need to be successful in the future.
In the short-term this is needed to make the railway sector affordable. In the longer-term it is
necessary to give the industry a better chance of being successful in an integrated European
transport market.

Strengths of the sector
In contemplating options, BiH starts with some strong and positive features - it has the
two busiest railway networks in the Western Balkans region. The overall traffic density per
route-km in BiH is the highest in the region. The density of freight traffic is comparable with
the EU (some 80 percent of the EU average in RS6 and 119 percent of the EU average in the
FBH). Moreover, most of BiH’s network is main-line and it does not have a large sub-network
of underutilized branch lines which have been a formidable and enduring financial burden in
most other countries in South East Europe. The basic infrastructure and rolling stock allow
the companies to provide a reasonable freight service for most traffic realistically available.
These fundamentals would allow substantial improvement in cost-effectiveness if railway
sector policies were matched to the country’s markets, scarce budget resources more
productively used than they are now, and railway managements permitted and encouraged to
run the railways as commercial transport businesses.

The structural options
The Entity governments have various structural options in the way they configure the
railways they own which could each be consistent with the EU railway acquis. Among the
alternatives considered in the Policy Note are: whether to adopt a group company structure or
separate companies; the institutional arrangements for delivery of passenger services;
whether the ministry performing the policy functions of the sector should also administer the
government’s share ownership in public railway companies; and whether to privatize the
freight transport operations (Figure 2).

  Zero-based approach is a budgeting process that asks managers to build a budget from the ground
up, starting from zero and allocates funding based on program efficiency and necessity rather than
budget history.

Holding company structure or separate companies (without a holding company)
The most pressing structural issue is the institutional form of what are currently
vertically integrated companies. The EU railway acquis allows a group structure with a
holding company. Four EU countries use such model, the nature and merits of which are
discussed in the Note. In the case of small railways similar to the ones in BiH, such a structure
seems too ‘top-heavy’ and bureaucratic. The Bank team’s view is that the simplest and most
straightforward approach in each Entity is to create two separate companies: an
Infrastructure Manager and a Transport Operating Company (13 EU countries have opted for
such separation). Synthesized structures including a number of specific arrangements are
found in other EU countries. Institutional separation would avoid the ambiguity and potential
conflict of interest inherent in a group structure. The preference for separation is reinforced
by the added weight the team gives to two factors in the evaluation criteria: first, there is the
expectation under separation that clarity and focus in roles would lead to better management
of the individual infrastructure and transport operating companies; and second it would
enhance their ability to determine their own business strategies in the context of a European
railway system in which each will have different opportunities and constraints, and sometimes
different interests.

Passenger rail services management
The Bank team’s favored approach is that passenger service management be established
as a separately-accounted division or subsidiary of the Operating Companies. The EU rail
acquis would require separate accounts be kept for the passenger division activities in order
to verify and agree on the costs of the passenger Public Service Contract. Alternatively, the
passenger company could be a specialist subsidiary of the Operating Company, buying in most
of its services (e.g. crew, rolling stock maintenance) from the main company at properly
verified transfer prices.

Vesting of government’s share ownership
Following the changes in company structures, it is considered better to vest the
ownership of the government’s shares in new companies in a central agency or ministry
of government other than the line transport ministry. There are potential conflicts of
interest when a line ministry is both railway policy-maker and railway owner. Moreover, under
the EU model the relationship between a line ministry as ‘customer’ and a railway enterprise
should be governed by contractual arrangements that embody public policy aims. The owner
and customer roles should clearly be kept separate. At the time of formation, it is considered
better, if the option is available, to vest the ownership of the government’s shares in the two
rail enterprises in a central agency or ministry that will not be responsible for negotiating the
PSC and MAIC contracts. Given that a minor proportion of shares in each existing railway
company are already privately owned, it would also seem appropriate to encourage or
incentivize such shareholders to swap their shares in the current integrated company for
shares in the Operating Company. This would leave the Infrastructure Manager as a fully
publicly-owned company while the Operating Company would be part-private, with the
possibility of increasing the private participation later on.

Private participation in the Operating Company
The Entity governments 7 currently hold majority ownership of existing companies but
further privatization of the new Operating Companies is an option worthy of
consideration. International experience and envisaged participation in a competitive
European railway market suggest the government could benefit from considering the option
of privatization before the market is opened up. When the railway freight market becomes
contestable each Entity’s Operating Company will be vulnerable to competition for the best of
their few markets. While the EU acquis does not favor either public or private ownership as a
principle, the Bank’s international experience is that under public ownership, freight railway
operators are less likely to grow into the high-efficiency, high-performing enterprises
necessary to compete successfully both with the predominantly private road transport
industry and the other operators in the emerging European rail freight industry. Privatization
should be seriously considered while the Operating Company still has dominant freight market
positions and before the market becomes contestable because the value of the companies will
deteriorate once it is.

Structural options: implementation issues
Irrespective of whether a holding company is established or not, the creation of separate
operating and infrastructure companies needs to be well-planned and implemented and
not just be a process of dividing existing assets, liabilities and human resources. The
intention of restructuring is not just to harmonize with EU structures but to create a more
effective and sustainable railway industry. Separation of the current railway companies in the
two Entities into infrastructure and operating companies appears likely to require a new
Railway Law in each Entity with legal obligations on companies to implement those parts of
the EU rail acquis that fall to them (for example, in the case of the Infrastructure Manager, the
preparation and publication of the Network Statement and access terms and conditions).

 In case of ŽRS, shares of state owned capital are managed by owners of shares: the Share
Management Fund and the restitution Fund, which are within the structure of the RS IDB.

The new companies should be established with a clear commercial mandate to operate
their businesses in the most efficient and effective manner. Their opening balance sheets
should carry only the assets they need and any obsolete or surplus assets disposed of as soon
as possible. They should not be burdened with the transfer of unsustainable loan obligations
which they are unable to service and repay and which are in practice funded from the budget.
The new companies should ideally only take over the staff they need to run the companies
efficiently. Unless these issues are addressed prior to separation and a robust implementation
plan adhered to, the new companies will simply inherit and share between them the current
problems and inefficiencies rather than having the opportunity to make a clean start.



                                      The policy options
The Entity governments have policy options in four main areas of railway development
policy: railway jobs policy, the future of passenger services, the future of freight services
and the level of investment in infrastructure. The options evaluated are shown in Figure 3.
The options have been grouped in different combinations to provide different reform
scenarios. The combinations and their budgetary impacts are summarized in Tables 1 and 2
below. The World Bank team evaluated the policies using purpose-built financial models of
each railway to estimate for the next 10 years (2016-2025) the total amount that each Entity
budget would need to pay to sustain the railway financially though a combination of capital
outlays and net operating deficit.



Employment and productivity
At the present employment levels, BiH’s railways will retain the lowest levels of labor
productivity in the region and a cost to Entity budgets that past experience suggests is
unaffordable. In both railways, labor costs constitute around two-thirds of operating costs.
Employment levels have been heavily influenced by government job protection influences that
in the ‘business-as-usual’ option would continue to amplify operating costs, reduce the funding
available for equipment, works and services, and perpetuate labor-intensive operational
practices that impede train operations. A second option of a sustained program of natural
attrition of employee numbers would offer gradual improvements in productivity and budget
affordability over a ten year period compared to doing nothing. In this case the net operating
deficit prior to budget support over ten years could be cut by around half in FBH and by about
40 percent in RS.

The adoption of railway labor restructuring programs in line with market demand and
reasonable levels of labor productivity in each Entity would offer much greater efficiency
and long-term competitive benefits in a single European railway market. The target in this
third option would be to achieve regional best productivity by 2025, which should be facilitated
by BiH’s relatively high traffic density and freight predominance (though the 2025 labor
productivity levels would still be below EU average levels). In this case the net operating deficit
prior to budget support could be cut by around 25 percent in FBH and by more than 90 percent
in RS.

Rail passenger services
Passenger rail services cost far more than the Entities’ budgets have shown willingness
to fund but make a near-negligible contribution to BiH’s overall personal mobility needs.
Passenger traffic density per network-km in both Entities is less than 2 percent of the EU
average. In 2014 ŽFBH carried fewer than 1000 passengers/day (around 21 passengers/train)
and ŽRS around 450 passengers/day (14 passengers/train). Improving labor productivity
would help cut cost, but the basic problem is that trains are being run to serve passenger
markets for which the use of railway technology is wholly uneconomic. Doing business as usual
is an inherently unattractive option as it involves the Entities paying much more money than
they do now (to avoid cross-subsidy) for a low quality service performing a minimal transport
role. A range of options for passenger services, ranging from rail services to be discontinued
and public transport provided by good replacement bus services, to the rail services to be
improved to attract a bigger market and perform a more significant role, is available.

Withdrawal of obligations to operate passenger rail services would beneficially transform
the economics of each railway company and the budget support they require. In concert
with higher labor productivity, this option would just about eliminate the need for net
operating cost support from the budgets of the Entities. The Operating Companies would then
be capable of operating profitably in their freight markets and, depending on their track access
charges paid to the Infrastructure Manager, network infrastructure might nearly recover its
operation and maintenance costs so requiring capital support only.

The option of reinvigorating passenger services by investing in modern rolling stock and
providing better services on the main passenger routes could generate more passengers
but its budget impact would be severe. The indicative policies tested in the Policy Note could
increase passenger numbers by about 60- 65 percent. More efficient rolling stock would also
provide some unit operating cost savings although these would be more than consumed by
increasing service frequency to more attractive levels. This would result in an increase in the
10-year budgetary impact compared to discontinuing services would be about BAM 580 million

8
 If the EU railway acquis is adopted this is not a strategic choice but will depend on the market.
However, the two alternatives are included to illustrate what impact significant competition could
have on sector finances.

                                                  15
                                   BiH Railways Policy Note


in FBH and about BAM 91 million in RS (considering productivity improvement by labor
restructuring).

While discontinuing passenger services is politically problematic, and reinvigorating may
be unaffordable, there is a need for an informed assessment and implementation plan. An
intermediate option would consist in identifying the services that should be kept and that
Governments can afford to subsidize through Public Service Contracts. This would require a
wider potential catchment survey of passenger transport demand that might be attracted to
an improved railway service as well as detailed economic, social and environmental appraisal
of the investments required. A much more explicit Public Service Contract would also need to
be developed with a verifiable costing procedure that meets EU approaches.



Rail freight services
The strategic imperative is to try to hold onto the freight already carried and minimize
vulnerability to envisaged third-party competition through efficiency improvements and
customer service. In accordance with the EU rail acquis, freight rail services should be
competitive and financially self-sustaining without budget support for the train operations so
that business strategy decisions and rolling stock investment would be essentially matters for
the operating company management rather than governments. It has not been possible to
discern any substantial new commodity flows that railways could realistically target in RS. In
FBH, there are potential traffic movements to/from the Port of Ploče that may be transferable
to rail. Other things being equal (and without third-party competition) if railway freight in FBH
could be increased by about 30 percent, the net operating results of the company could be
improved over the ten year period by about BAM 100 million.

With track access, the concentrated market of a few large bulk customers could be
attractive to third-party competitors in both Entities. Infrastructure access rights would
tend to pressure freight rates downward (which is the aim of competition) and probably reduce
the volume of traffic carried by the Entity-owned Operating Companies. Naturally, if new
operators were to win part of the freight market they would still pay track access charges for
infrastructure and so the income of infrastructure management companies would not be
diminished. Competitive markets are never predictable, but noting the competitive
vulnerabilities, an indicative scenario was tested in which by 2025 the Company’s markets
would be reduced by 50 percent. This would increase the operating support required in FBH by
BAM 77 million and in RS by BAM 45 million over the 10 year period because the increased
track access income from third-party operators would not compensate for the anticipated
reduction in net operating surplus from freight by the Entity-owned Operating Companies. In
practice, sufficiently entrepreneurial managements might preserve more of their pre-existing
freight markets but it is also possible that the impact could be greater.

Rail infrastructure investment policies
The Policy Note considers three development policies for the infrastructure sector
depending on the level of investment that government wishes to make in the railway
network. One policy is to sustain investments at the current level but this would perpetuate
a number of operational problems. A second policy is to increase investment levels giving
priority to the creation of an improved train control system which would include overcoming
the numerous delays currently associated with train operations at level crossings. A third

                                               16
                                                   BiH Railways Policy Note


policy is to add to the train control system improvements yet higher investment so as to
achieve higher line speeds. Comparisons of the budget impact are given in the Sections B and
C of the Note. In the view of the Bank Team, investment in train dispatching and control
(including level crossing control) to reduce operational delays and labor costs is the highest
priority capital investment in both Entities. There is also an additional case for rehabilitation
of tracks on the more problematic track sections of Corridor Vc connecting Bosnia to the port
of Ploče in the south and to Central and Western Europe in the north.

Policy options: implementation issues
All of the main elements of the policy options require more detailed evaluation and
planning prior to decision and implementation. A labor restructuring program should have a
sound basis in future business needs of the companies. Their managements would undertake
a fundamental re-evaluation of their ways of working to identify the most efficient labor force
capable of meeting the traffic commitments they can reasonably foresee. A labor restructuring
program would also need to be able to demonstrate that it is fair and transparent, that full
consultation with the workforce and trade unions has taken place, and that funding is available
for satisfactory compensation packages and supporting social/retraining programs.

  All policies include third-party freight train operator access from 2020, which is an essential
element of the EU railway acquis

Deciding the future of passenger rail services requires a more detailed review of the public
passenger transport market in the Entity corridors where passenger rail services
currently run. More detailed passenger surveys could define the precise existing and potential
markets for passenger rail service by origin-destination, journey purpose, age and gender,
amongst other attributes. The option of withdrawing passenger rail services could then be
accompanied by public transport policies to ensure adequate bus replacement services.
Conversely, the passenger improvement policy option would require a more detailed economic,
social and environmental appraisal of the investments required and a solid estimate of the
costs of the Public Service Contract implied. (The financial model estimates suggest the
budget support for such contract would need to be at many multiples of what government now
pays for passenger rail services).

Third-party access will become obligatory if the EU acquis is to be adopted, but many of
the details of implementation and timing need to be determined. Good practice Network
Statements are available from other EU Infrastructure Managers 11 . Track Access charges
should be structured in accordance with evolving EU guidance. When freight traffic no longer
subsidizes passenger traffic it could in principle make a significant contribution to network
infrastructure costs relative to many European countries or rates could come down increasing
the attractiveness of rail. There is a strong case to implement only after labor restructuring,
the proper separation of the infrastructure management from operating companies, and when
the latter have been given the opportunity to re-organize themselves for commercial
effectiveness. The implementation of track access in 2020 that was assumed in the financial
model may be a reasonable target to aim for.

The final network investment programs would be developed by the management of the
Infrastructure Management Companies in each Entity. The programs would need to be
within a budget envelope agreed with Entity governments who will ultimately need to fund
them. The program should cover a duration of at least five years and be renewable. The Note
has concluded at a strategic level that greater centralization of train dispatching and control
and better (and safer) control of level crossings is the main priority but there are track sections
in both Entities where, if sufficient funds are available, a combined train control and track
rehabilitation program could be a justified priority. A fuller investment appraisal could be used
to optimize the projects which will provide highest returns.

                        Implications for the railway sector at BiH level
Coordination between the railway companies in RS and FBH
The adoption of new structural arrangements to comply with the EU railway acquis will
present Entity governments and railways an opportunity to consider how best to
cooperate for mutual advantage in a European railway market. At present each railway
enjoys de facto exclusivity in transport operations within its territorial boundaries. The most
critical impact of the new structure will be the effective dismantling of both Entity and
international boundaries so far as rail transport operations are concerned in accordance with
the EU acquis. When the EU railway competition model is implemented, any train operating
company licensed in the EU (including those of the two Entities) will be able to cross between
the tracks of the FBH and RS Infrastructure Management Companies, and across those of

neighboring countries, as already happens daily throughout the European Union. The Entities
should consider how they might productively cooperate in such circumstances.

Cooperation between transport Operating Companies
It is likely to be in the mutual interest of the Operating Companies to partner to
undertake marketing and operations on a co-operative basis. Cooperation to provide
‘seamless’ inter-entity and international freight services would tend to strengthen the
operating companies combined competitive position relative to new entrants. Cooperation
also has advantages in regional markets in that ‘going it alone’ from the relatively small
resource base of each Operating Company may well be to the advantage of other, larger
European operators.

Co-operation between Infrastructure Managers
The EU railway framework means the physical interface between the two infrastructure
management companies will become less important than the economic interface. The
challenge will be to ensure mutually advantageous coordination of network statements, train
control performance standards and track access charges. When the two infrastructure
management companies are in place, BHŽJK could provide the technical resource and
institutional forum for the entities infrastructure managers to agree to harmonize key aspects
of their Network Statements (or to publish a combined Network Statement). This would lower
the cost of doing business for firms using the railways.

The role of the Railway Regulatory Board to meet the EU acquis
A good regulatory capacity and effectiveness is imperative to meet the EU acquis and
provide for market access. According to RRB, it is sufficiently empowered under the BiH
Railway Law (2005) to perform licensing, economic regulation, safety regulation and other
functions compatible with the EU railway acquis. It already performs a range of BiH-wide
licensing, regulatory and safety functions under its legislation. But when the railway market in
BiH is opened, the actual economic regulatory tasks will include the access to the network and
track access charges. Although the BiH railway sector is smaller than many in the EU, it also
has a bigger freight market than many, plus two international SEETO Comprehensive Network
freight routes of wider regional significance (north-south Corridor Vc and east-west route 9a).
Moreover, RRB will effectively be regulator of two entity rail markets, two infrastructure
managers and access administration and pricing issues pertaining to two separately-owned
and managed networks.

Railway infrastructure funding
Implementation of a multimodal planning policy in Bosnia could lead to an alternative
allocation of network infrastructure development funds between roads and railways. A
multimodal approach in planning and financing transport infrastructure could put in
perspective the comparative advantage of the railways, their important role in Bosnia’s freight
movements, the detrimental impact of overloaded trucks on roads and the environmental
benefits of the railways. They could lead to an increase in the capital allocation for railways.

An alternative or complementary policy consists in raising additional funds to be
allocated to the railways. Such approach can either be applied under the current sector
planning approach as dedicated funds for the railways or under a multimodal planning

approach discussed earlier raising additional funds to be invested in all transport modes, but
leading to higher investment resources for railways.

There are a number of possible options for raising additional funds for transport
investments. Traditional approaches include fuel taxes, classic road tolls, electronic distance-
based tolling, vehicle registration and licensing fees, and freight related fees. In particular, fuel
levies and electronic distance-based tolling have been successfully applied in Europe to raise
additional funds for transport investments. However, each mechanism has its advantages and
disadvantages and must be studied in detail before any attempt of implementation.



Next steps and action plan
It is anticipated that the Entity governments who own the two railways will, in consultation
with their railway managements, now consider the various structural and policy choices
presented and analyzed in this Report and their financial and other consequences. The
strategic choices they make will determine the content and timing of actions to implement
such strategy over the next few years. A preliminary roadmap presented by RS Government is
described in section D4.

Once the Entity governments have prepared a preliminary roadmap, the World Bank stands
ready to work with them to identify a detailed Action Plan to bring about the desired
transformation of the railway industry. Such Plans would be pursued with each Entity
individually, reflecting the fact that their structural and policy choices may well differ.
However, it would also be important to ensure that such Action Plans cohere with the overall
policy and institutional framework in BiH to provide the most beneficial adaptation of the EU
railway acquis for BiH as a whole.

                       PART A          BACKGROUND AND OVERVIEW
A.1    Origins and aims of the Policy Note
The railways of Bosnia and Herzegovina are passing through testing times: confronted by
sovereign obligations requiring structural change; struggling to attain a financially
sustainable transport role; and needing to adopt a more commercial orientation and
culture. The sovereign obligations are contained in Bosnia and Herzegovina’s (BiH)
Stabilization and Association Agreement (2015) requiring preparation for participation in EU
railway acquis communautaire. The challenge of financial sustainability is demonstrated by
continued inability or unwillingness of Entity budgets to meet the full costs of the transport
role currently performed by the railway companies. These two challenges extend to a third: the
imperative for railways to become, and be allowed by their owners to become, much more
commercially-focused to make the railway sector affordable in budget terms and to give the
industry the chance of being successful in an integrated European transport market.

In contemplating solutions to these challenges BiH starts with one strongly positive
feature– in traffic terms it has the busiest railway lines in the West Balkans region. The
average traffic density per route-km in BiH is comparable with the EU average level and in FBH
is higher. Moreover, its traffic profile is predominantly freight (over 97 percent of traffic units)
on which each Entity’s railway company earns a positive financial surplus. The country also
does not have a large low-density branch-line network to support which in many other
countries in South East Europe has been found to be a severe financial burden on the state.
These fundamentals would allow a substantial improvement if railway sector policies were to
be matched to the country’s markets, scarce budget resources more productively used, and
railway managements permitted and encouraged to run the railways as transport businesses.

The Policy Note, financed by the Swedish Government, is intended to help the
governments and railways in Bosnia and Herzegovina to identify the options and chart a
course for moving forward. The reform of BiH railways has been identified by the BiH Council
of Ministers and Entity governments as a priority. They recognize that the services provided
by well-managed railways can provide wider transport economic and other benefits that can
justify budgetary support. The EU railway acquis is partly about making that support explicit,
targeted and transparent. This makes it easier to gauge value for money from public
expenditures. It also helps ensure competitive neutrality between suppliers of transport
services and minimizing cross-subsidies between passenger and freight sectors, and between
infrastructure management and transport operations. The Policy Note identifies structural
options for harmonization with the EU railway acquis and policy options for attaining a more
sustainable industry.

The Bank’s involvement in BiH builds upon a continuing commitment to support of the
railway sector in the Balkan region. It follows the Bank’s previous railway policy and
operational investigations and action plans: Railway Policy Notes for Serbia and Croatia; a
multi-country study “Railway Reform in South East Europe and Turkey: On the Right Track?”
reviewing the state of the sector in the region; and an update of the Regional Western Balkans
Infrastructure Study (REBIS) identifying regional physical and non-physical priorities. The
findings of those studies and the policy directions indicated are reflected in this Policy Note.

A.2    Functional map of BiH’s railway sector
Bosnia and Herzegovina’s railway institutional structure reflects its political structure. It
is useful to distinguish between the key sector functions, such as policy-making, regulation,
financing, etc. Figure A1 summarizes ‘who does what’ in the railway sector as it is in practice.
There are some inconsistencies between the ‘de facto’ situation and founding statutes, as well
as between different legislative instruments. Bosnia’s legal framework (described in Annex I)
has established a two-railway system plus BiH institutions. The framework is governed by a
BiH railways law and two Entity railways laws—one for the Federation of Bosnia and
Herzegovina (FBH) and the other for the Republic of Srpska (RS). In FBH, the railway system
is operated by Željeznice Federacije Bosne I Hercegovine (ŽFBH), while in RS, the railway is
operated by Željeznice Republike Srpske (ŽRS). The Entity governments are majority (though
not exclusive) owners of the railway network located within their Entity, and are responsible
for its policy framework, performance oversight, and budgetary support.

 Railway transport operations


The basic structure of the railway industry itself is straightforward – each Entity’s
railway is responsible to its Entity governments. Both railways are vertically integrated
enterprises, managing both the railway network and transport operations (both passenger and
freight) on their networks within a divisional structure, albeit with a procedure for separating
(by estimation and assumption) the financial accounts of infrastructure and transport
operations. Each railway’s Entity government is responsible for railway sector planning,
regulation and funding. Both railway companies have a (minority) element of private
ownership. ŽFBH is owned approximately 9 percent by private investors. ŽRS is owned 10
percent by pension fund, 5 percent by public organizations and 10 percent by private
shareholders. Detailed descriptions, performance indicators and benchmarks for the railways
are provided in Sections B (ŽFBH), Section C (ŽRS), and in the Annexes.

The Entity governments formulate and adopt their own transport policies, including
railway policies. The BiH State Level (Council of Ministers) has the authority to propose a
multi-modal transport strategy for the country in collaboration with the Entities and Brcko

District. A Strategy has been prepared and is in the process of adoption. This Policy Note has
been prepared prior to the completion of strategy and without access to its findings and
recommendations.

Other railway sector institutions at inter-entity and BiH level reflect specific
international agreements. The BiH Railways Corporation (BHŽJK), mandated by the Dayton
Accords, was allocated a wide-ranging coordinating role by agreement of the Entities in 1998,
though it performs a more specific and limited role in practice. With staff sourced from both
railways it verifies technical standards to ensure interoperability throughout BiH, assembles
long-term plans of railway development, and manages capital projects and funds financed by
International Financial Institutions (IFI’s). BHŽJK management and making decisions on
operations require the consent of entity governments (both for the founding and for the
delineation of its mandate of the Corporation. The BiH Railway Regulatory Board (RRB), was
formally established in 2008 and is responsible for state obligations with regard to railway
licensing and rail safety regulation 12 . RRB is also intended to supervise the separation of
accounts between operations and infrastructure and between freight and passenger services
though in practice the two railway companies determine their own accounting separations.

A.3     EU-Bosnia and Herzegovina, Stabilization and Association Agreement (2015)
Under this Agreement 13 BiH undertakes to prepare for the participation of BiH in the
implementation and future evolution of the railway acquis. Some of the foundations have
already been laid14. The State Law on Railways of Bosnia and Herzegovina (June 2005) contains
provisions broadly reflecting concepts in relevant EU directives, requiring the separation of
transport services and infrastructure management, the obtaining of a license and a safety
certificate to operate, and the establishment of the Railway Regulatory Board (RRB). However,
there are substantial gaps in implementation of some provisions and deficiencies in the
application of others. A more detailed ‘gap analysis’ against the requirements is provided in
Annex II and summarized later in this Policy Note. The bottom-line is that the greater part of
the transformation to a compliant and competitive market structure remains to be achieved.

Adoption of the EU acquis per se is not of itself the goal of railway reform but an
opportunity to create a more efficient and effective industry. In many parts of the world
(Latin America, Australia, Africa), many governments have decided - with some justification -
that the best policy for small freight-predominant railways is to sell or concession them as an
integrated business to a private company with a degree of exclusivity in rights of operation. If
there is no competition in the market for these railways, their tariffs are typically subject to
regulation. However, this option is not consistent with the EU framework which prohibits such
exclusivity and it is based on a wider a trans-national construct of the railway sector: each
participating state’s railway network forms a part of the European-wide network and its rail
user markets form part of a larger single but contestable market. The EU policy framework
holds both opportunity and threat for BiH railway companies, but neither positive nor negative

outcome are automatic: the balance of advantage gained will depend on public policy choices
made with regard to institutional structure and sector strategy and on how successful railway
managers are in responding to a more competitive and commercial market.

A.4    Structure, strategy and management
The Policy options that are subject of this Policy Note have been developed and evaluated
at two levels: industry structure options and sector policy options. Institutional structure
and sector policies are primarily the responsibility of governments and are therefore the key
elements of policy analysis. They are interdependent but treated in this order because the
undertaking to harmonize with EU railway acquis will drive the main structural features;
governments will then need to pursue sector strategy within a compliant structure. The Note
treats labor productivity as a sector policy issue (though in most industries it is a management
issue) because railway labor levels have been heavily influenced by job protection policies
rather than commercial needs and any restructuring of the labor force would require policy
support. Figure A3 shows the two policy areas covered in the Note, but it also reminds that
the third driver of sector outcomes is railway commercial management (Level 3). Commercial
management is the responsibility of and performed by enterprises and not policy-makers: but
it requires that sector institutional structure (Level 1) is designed to permit company
managements to manage commercially at ‘arm’s length’, and that sector policies (Level 2)
enable rail companies to be financially sustainable. Policy reforms in structure and strategy
are, or should be, enablers of more commercially effective management: if they are not, then
little practical change may be anticipated.

The Note presents alternative structural options that could each be designed to be
consistent with the EU acquis. Among the options considered in the Policy Note are: whether
to adopt a group company structure or separate infrastructure and operating companies;
alternative institutional arrangements for delivery of passenger services; whether the ministry
performing the policy functions of the sector should also administer the government’s share
ownership in public railway companies; and whether to privatize the freight transport
operations. The advantages and disadvantages of options are assessed in the context of each
of the two railways but taking account of international experiences.

The sector policy options depend mainly on the level of public resources that Entity
governments are willing to devote to railways in BiH. Entity governments have shown they
are unwilling or unable to afford the railways as currently constituted. In the EU framework
budget support for railways may come from funding of a passenger services contract (PSC),
funding of network operations and maintenance through an infrastructure contract (MAIC),
and loans, grants or sovereign guarantees for infrastructure or passenger rolling stock
investment. The sector policy options examined are in four main areas: railway jobs policy, the
future of passenger services, the future of freight services and the level of investment in
infrastructure. The World Bank team has evaluated the strategies using purpose-built
financial models of each railway to estimate for the next 10 years (2016-2025) the total
amount that each Entity budget would need to pay to sustain the railway financially.

A.5    Effect of a two-railway system on policy options
The fact that there are two railways in BiH does not significantly affect the nature of
either structure or sector policy options. The two railways themselves are relatively
straightforward railway businesses sharing many of the features and challenges of small,
state-owned railways worldwide. The approach of the Policy review started at the Entity level
and first considered the options that exist within the current framework of roles and
responsibilities shown in Figure A1. Part B of the Policy Note addresses the railways of FBH and
Part C the railways of RS. They have similar (though not identical) physical and operational
profiles and market prospects. Each railway has a comparatively small network.15 Each is more
than 97 percent freight-dominant carrying significant volumes of bulk products, much of it for
a limited number of customers (in some cases it is the same freight consigned between
entities). Each railway nevertheless has very low labor productivity and operates nearly as
many passenger trains as freight trains. Each Entity government faces similar budget
pressures and a compliance gap with the EU rail acquis. These similarities mean that the policy
issues and options are much the same and would not be materially different if they were one
railway.

However, the need by both Entity governments to adopt new structural arrangements
under the railway acquis implies a turning point in their affairs and the creation of new
opportunities. A restructured railway in each Entity will offer opportunity for the Entity
governments to reconsider how best to co-operate or combine for mutual advantage in the
European railway market. The RRB will need to perform a fuller role as BiH and international
regulator once there is a proper track access regime. And any significantly higher levels of
domestic public funding for investment are not credible without additional funding sources,
which might require funding decisions at the state level. The wider implications and dimensions
of reform are addressed in Section D of the Policy Note.

The Policy Note is organized as follows: Part B discusses the railways and policy options for
the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Part C discusses the railways and policy options
for the railways of Republika Srpska. Parts B and C include an assessment of the current
status of the railway in the Entity, assessment and discussion of the rail industry structure
options and the railway development policies. Part D elaborates on likely reform implications
for entity governments and BiH. Part D presents a proposed action plan.

  Though more than 30 countries worldwide also have national railways of less than 1,000 km and in
the USA there are some 550 ‘viable’ short-line and regional railroads operating lines which, while
varying in length, have an average length of only around 125km.

B.1.       Current status of the railway in FBH16
B.1.1 Overview of railway
Railway length and density
The 600 km railway network of FBH is comparable with the small railways in the West
Balkans region17. The network is similar in length to that of FYR Macedonia (Fig B1). Compared
to land area, the network density (Figure B2) is a little less than half of that Croatia and Serbia,
largely because those railways have more extensive networks of lightly-used branch lines. By
contrast, most of the FBH operational network consists of its main lines the most important
of which is the north-south trunk line (located in Pan-European transport Corridor Vc). The
network is standard gauge (1,435mm), mainly single track (89 percent of the total) and 73
percent electrified (73 percent of the total).
The rated line speed on Corridor Vc averages around 50-80 km/h depending on section
but the commercial (end-to-end) speed on the corridor and the network as a whole is
significantly lower. Commercial speeds are much lower than rated speeds partly due to poor
track conditions on specific sections. This is notable on Corridor Vc between Sarajevo and
Zenica and between Zenica and Doboj (though in the latter section is mitigated somewhat by
double-tracking). But an additional major cause of train stops and delays is low-performance
train dispatching and control technology (with relatively short distances between many stops,
including train stops at unprotected level crossings) and there are problems in reliability of
power supply in some areas.

Rail freight transport
FBH’s network is the most intensely-used freight railway in the region with about 1.4
million tonnes per route-km, nearly a fifth higher than the EU average. Table B1 provides
the country comparisons. ŽFBH manages what is overwhelmingly a freight railway in terms of
transport role, with freight comprising more than 97 percent of all traffic units. In 2014, ŽFBH
carried 8.5 million tonnes for 885 million net tonne-km an average intra-entity transit
distance of 104 km. Over the last ten years, the company’s freight volume has been stable to
marginally increasing, other than a dip in 2009 coincident with the global financial crisis. (Fig
B3). ZFBH freight traffic is characterized by significant volumes of heavy industrial
commodities – mainly iron ore, coal and metals. Domestic traffic comprises 27 percent of the
total ntkm, import and export traffic 72 percent, and transit traffic 1 percent of total (Fig B4).

Rail freight prices applied by ZFBH are high compared to neighboring countries 18. Although
detailed information about transport prices was not provided, in 2014 ZFBH transported 885
million net tonne-km with an associated freight revenue according to the financial statement
of 77.7 million BAM, which represents an average price of 0.088 BAM/tkm or 0.048 USD/ntkm.
Average prices in ZFBH are higher than in neighboring countries, with 0.038 USD/ntkm in
Croatia, 0.029 USD/ntkm in Serbia, 0.023 USD/ntkm in Slovenia, but slightly lower than in
ZRS where the average price is 0.05 USD/ntkm or Albania 0.057 USD/ntkm.


Passenger rail transport
Passenger rail services now make a near-negligible contribution to FBH’s overall personal
mobility needs. In 2014, ŽFBH carried 355,000 passengers (fewer than 1000 passengers/day)
for a total of 22 million passenger-km, an average distance of 62 km (Figures B5 and B6). The
average train occupancy is only 21 people 19 . The railway share of FBH total non-urban
passenger travel was around 2 percent in 2014.

Passenger traffic density is less than a tenth of most other South East European
countries and less than 2 percent of the EU average. Table B1 provides the comparisons.
Domestic (incl. inter-entity) routes account for 98 percent of trips for which the main
domestic routes are Sarajevo-Zenica (4 pairs of trains/ day), Sarajevo-Capljina (2 pair of
trains/day) and Sarajevo-Konjic (2 pair of trains/day). Inter-entity trains run between Doboj and
Sarajevo and Doboj and Tuzla once and twice per day in each direction respectively, but they
carry very few inter-entity passengers and most passengers are intra-entity. FBH is served by
two international passenger rail routes – Sarajevo- Zagreb and Sarajevo - Ploče, but most
passengers on international trains are relatively short-distance cross-border trips rather than
inter-city trips. (Table B1).

Rolling stock
ŽFBH achieves good locomotive and wagon productivity though an already old fleet
continues to age. Locomotive and wagon productivity (Figures B7 and B8) are highest in the
region though lower than the EU average by about 30 percent (locomotives) and 18 percent
(wagons). Out of 97 locomotives most are older than 40 years and around 40 are operational.
Investment in new freight wagons has proven productive. Passenger coach productivity in
2014 is one of the lowest in the region (details are provided in Annex IV). Nine Talgo passenger
train-sets were acquired in 2008 with finance from Spain and have never been used in service
until end of September 2016 when a service started between Sarajevo and Doboj.

Human resources
The company has improved its labor productivity in recent years as staff attrition has
coincided with gradually improving freight volumes but it remains very low. By 2014, ŽFBH
had 3,572 employees. But the average traffic units per employee in 2014 was lower than in
most neighboring countries other than Albania and Serbia, and only about 40 percent of the
EU average (Table B2). For a freight-dominant railway this is particularly meagre as freight
traffic is generally less labor intensive in its needs than passenger traffic, but the passenger
train services are still much more labor-intensive, bringing down the average, despite the small
proportion of passenger traffic in the total.

B.1.2    ŽFBH financial status
ŽFBH has incurred heavy financial losses in each of the last 10 years as operating
expenses have exceeded total revenues even when the latter include budgetary support
from the FBH government. Annex IV provides the detailed analysis. Total revenue, with
budget support, was just sufficient to cover just cash operating expenses but those expenses
were not themselves sufficient to cover full operations and maintenance needs and there is a
considerable backlog. In principle there is an agreed infrastructure funding ‘contract’ with
government but the company’s actual budget subvention has consistently fallen short of the
work that the company considers necessary or believes it agreed. Labor costs constitute about
two-thirds of operating expenses20 and 88 percent of market revenues. This is a very high
proportion of costs, with most railway enterprises internationally aiming to keep labor costs
below half of operating expenses.

Despite low labor productivity and the poor overall financial results, the freight sector
earns a creditable surplus above operating costs. Table B3 provides World Bank estimates
of the performance by business sector in 2014, using a financial model based on commonly-
used management accounting techniques for railway analysis. ŽFBH earns a surplus on freight
operations relative to operating costs (about BAM 30 million) but a big deficit on passenger
services (BAM 19.5 million). The passenger services loss is mainly offset by the freight surplus
rather than the FBH budget, which only reimburses the company for about 9 percent (BAM 2.1
million) of the estimated total passenger operating costs of about BAM 23 million.

The financial results for the passenger sector represent a poor use of operating resources
and a financial drain on the surplus from freight operations. Although passenger numbers
are minimal and passenger traffic provides less than 3 percent of all revenue, around 42
percent of all train-km operated by the company are generated by passenger trains. Direct
budgetary support for the passenger services is very low and some two-thirds of the freight
surplus is effectively diverted to covering the direct operating costs and train control costs
incurred by the passenger business. As a result there are insufficient funds to cover the cost

20
   Defined for this purpose as expenditures related to materials, fuel, electricity, salaries and
allowances, outsourcing and other services, and depreciation.


                                                    33
                                      BiH Railways Policy Note


of infrastructure maintenance and these are funded by a separate budget payment, equivalent
to about 73 percent of infrastructure maintenance 21 cost (excluding any cost coverage of
depreciation).

Subsidies for passenger transport in FBH are high compared to the EU average. Subsidies
for passenger transport in the EU, as included in PSO contracts, vary largely from around 0.1
USD/train.km in the Netherlands to about 20 USD/train.km in Luxembourg, with an average
around 8 USD/train.km. In FBH, the implicit subsidy estimated from the total deficit for
passengers is around 10 USD/train.km, higher than the EU average. The relative subsidy is still
higher when computed by passenger.km since the average occupancy in the EU is around 100
passengers/train while in FBH it is only around 20.

During 2009-2013 ŽFBH invested on average 279 million BAM annually on rail
infrastructure and rolling stock. Infrastructure investments included overhaul and
rehabilitation of track and modernization of signaling and telecom system on Corridor Vc,
south of Sarajevo. The financing was made available to ŽFBH through foreign and domestic
loans. Persistent financial losses prevented ŽFBH from funding much of its capital expenditure
or servicing fully its debt obligations. As a result, the debt service payments were made on the
behalf of ŽFBH by the Entity government but charged to the railway account. In addition to the
loans, ŽFBH received significant annual subsidies for infrastructure (and a small amount for
passenger services); however this total amount declined over the years from over BAM 23
million in 2008 to BAM 22 million in 2014.




21
   The total infrastructure expenditure in the accounts is BAM 71.4 million. However, BAM 14.0 million
is depreciation (non-cash), BAM 5.6 million is debt service and BAM 1.4 million is provisions (also non-
cash). This leaves BAM 50.4 million of operating cash expenditure, of which BAM 7.4 million is an
allocation of corporate overheads. Infrastructure-related direct costs are thus BAM 22.4 million for
train control/safeworking and BAM 20.6 million for maintenance. The figure of BAM 22.5 million for
maintenance in Table B3 includes BAM 1.8 million as the estimated cost of work trains. When train
control costs for the work trains and corporate overheads are included, the estimated cost of
infrastructure maintenance is BAM 26.4 million.

B.1.3 Alignment with EU Acquis
The policy framework for the railway sector in BiH must be significantly modified to
harmonize with the EU railway acquis. The main requirements bearing on the policy
responsibilities currently exercised by the FBH government relate to institutional structure,
track access, budgetary support for passenger services, budgetary support for infrastructure,
and debt sustainability. Harmonization implies: greater separation between the management
of railway infrastructure and of rail transport operations which are currently co-located and
commonly managed in one corporate structure; the implementation of a non-discriminatory
track access regime and charging structure promulgated through an explicit Network
Statement; the provision of adequate compensation for any loss-making passenger transport
services (basically all of them) via a service-based contract; similarly adequate budgetary
support for the O&M of network infrastructure through more rigorous (and preferably multi-
annual22) maintenance contracts; and a mechanism for government to assume or restructure
unsustainable debt of its train operating company in order for it to be able to compete on a fair
basis with third-party train operators competing under access arrangements. More detailed
analysis is contained in Annex II. Substantial legislative action at the Entity level appears
necessary to underpin the necessary institutional and structural changes necessary. It is to
the options for change that the Policy Note now turns.




22
   The railway acquis does not require that the infrastructure contract be on a multiannual basis but it
is suggested in EU supporting papers as best practice.

B.2. Rail industry structure options
B.2.1   Industry structure alternatives
There are various ways of organizing state railways while harmonizing with the EU rail
acquis and FBH should consider which arrangement best suits its future railway industry.
EU member states have adopted many different arrangements for their national railways to
comply with the acquis. Four of the main structural choices facing FBH relate to (a) the
organizational form of the future state-owned railway enterprise (or enterprises); (b) if the
state chooses to have a state-owned passenger rail operation, where to locate this activity in
the structure; (c) the exercise of state share-owning functions in such enterprises; and (d)
whether to seek greater private participation in the rail user company. These main choices are
set out in Figure B9.

Each of the policy choices has its own rationale and a mix of advantages, disadvantages
and risks. The policy options are set-out below and the appraisal that follows seeks to
delineate the key features of each. The Note presents an opinion on options when, weighing all
factors, this seems to be justified by the local circumstances and international experiences.
However, public policy decisions are the responsibility of governments.



B.2.2 Basic organizational form of state-owned railway enterprises
The Policy Note is guided by provisions of the informal agreement on the 4th Railway
Package market pillar agreed by representatives from the European Commission,
Parliament and Council in April 2016. The Agreement has still to be approved by the full
Council and Parliament, and this is expected in late 2016. It implies that both the separated or
group structures that exist in member states are acceptable but whichever alternative is used
it should be designed to ensure impartiality of railway infrastructure managers in providing
non-discriminatory access to tracks, allow them to pursue their own strategies for better use


                                              36
                                     BiH Railways Policy Note


of rail infrastructure, and improve financial transparency in order to remove the risk of cross-
subsidy between infrastructure managers and transport operators. Detailed rules on each of
these matters are to be promulgated.

On balance, the Bank team expresses a preference for institutional separation of
infrastructure manager from transport operating company, arguably the simplest and
most clear-cut option for FBH. The basis of the evaluation is described in more detail in Annex
III. The evaluation was aimed at identifying a structure which, while capable of complying with
the EU acquis, would also consider the efficiency of various elements of sector management,
and the ease of implementation. Institutional separation would avoid the ambiguity and
potential conflict of interest inherent in a group structure. The two companies would each have
a clear role and functions. Relations between the two companies would be governed by a
contract for infrastructure access subject to the regulatory oversight of the BiH RRB, in
accordance with EU principles. The preference for separation is reinforced by the added weight
the team gives to two factors in the evaluation criteria: first, there is the expectation under
separation that clarity and focus in roles would lead to better management of the individual
infrastructure and transport operating companies; and second it would enhance their ability
to determine their own business strategies in the context of a European railway system in
which each will have different opportunities and constraints, and sometimes different
interests. Thirteen EU member states have separated structures: Bulgaria, Czech Republic,
Denmark, Great Britain, Greece, Finland, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Spain,
Sweden, Slovakia (See Annex III).

However, a group structure is also a legitimate and compliant option that would maintain
a measure of coordination between the state-owned components of the rail industry.
Under this structure a holding company would be interposed between the FBH government
(and the other) owners and subsidiary infrastructure and operating company (ies). Four EU
Member States have adopted holding company arrangements for their railways: Germany,
Poland, Italy and Austria. It might be easier to implement in FBH, requiring corporate
reorganization of the existing railway rather than its division, and it might be easier for the
line-ministry to deal with one holding company rather than two separate companies. However,
it would create less clarity and focus in company roles and would create a greater regulatory
compliance challenge because of the need to demonstrate management independence,
competitive neutrality and financial transparency on the part of the infrastructure
management subsidiary.

The separate companies approach seems more suitable for FBH and likely to deliver
better performance at lower cost. The railway industry is not sufficiently large or complex
to justify adding another institutional layer23 (in the form of a holding company) to a railway
industry already characterized by an abundance of institutions. Moreover, in a group structure
the best railway managers would tend to gravitate to the holding company instead of running
the actual businesses where their skills are most needed. This would dilute the responsibility
and accountability of the subsidiary managements. While in theory a group structure could
provide some sharing of corporate services such as financial accounting and human resources
management, putting these at holding company level would reduce management
independence at the subsidiary level. It is also likely that with current low levels of productivity,

23
   The holding company would need to have separate management structure and steering committees,
in order to prevent conflict of interest.

                                                 37
                                   BiH Railways Policy Note


significant costs can be saved anyway in all functions during a well-planned separation
process, a saving less likely if resources are simply regrouped into subsidiaries.



B.2.3 Location of a passenger rail management in the structure
If a holding company structure were to be favored it would be relatively straightforward
to locate a separate passenger company within it. A small and separate passenger
subsidiary could be nested into a group structure, a PSC contract agreed between the
government and the passenger subsidiary (possible with the assent of the holding company).
The ‘group’ would then consist of a Holding Company, Infrastructure Manager, Freight
Operating Company and a Passenger Operating Company.

It would also be possible, but probably not very practicable, to establish an independent
separate passenger services company. In this option, FBH would establish three separate
companies: Infrastructure Manager, Freight Operating Company and a Passenger Operating
Company. However, a railway Passenger Operating Company in FBH would be a very small
enterprise to operate entirely independently, might suffer some diseconomies of very small
scale, and be more or less wholly dependent on and therefore vulnerable to fluctuations in
budget funding (which would need to provide more than 95 percent of income).

The best option would seem to be to leave passenger services as subsidiary or special
business division of the Operating Company. In view of the very small scale of FBH passenger
rail operations then it would be a sensible approach to retain passenger capability within the
Entity-owned Operating Company as a division or subsidiary rather than having two new
Operating Companies. (This presupposes that the FBH government would choose to continue
to own a passenger rail operation, a proposition that is evaluated in Section B3). If this option
were preferred the EU railway acquis requires that separate accounts be kept for the
passenger activities to facilitate verification and agreement on the costs of the Public Services
Contract, and avoid cross-subsidy from freight to passenger sectors (that clearly now occurs).



B.2.4 Exercise of state share-owning functions
When ownership functions in government transport enterprises are exercised by the line
ministry (normally the transport ministry) this increases ministerial control but can lead
to day-to-day intervention and undermining of management responsibilities. A line
ministry has the responsibility for formulating overall transport policies in accordance with
government social, economic and other aims, and bears the burden of public accountability for
those policies. However, the shareholder functions in a corporate structure must be primarily
concerned with the efficiency and commercial sustainability of the enterprise. In many
countries exclusive line ministry oversight of enterprise share ownership has led to conflicts
of interest between political and commercial aims, resulting in day-to-day political
intervention in the management of enterprises despite adverse commercial impacts.

The exercise of public ownership functions in state-owned enterprises by an agency or
department not responsible for transport policy tends to give greater weight to the
efficiency and commercial performance of the company. The World Bank’s Toolkit on
Corporate Governance of State-Owned Enterprises (2014) suggests governments should
consider moving away from traditional ownership models in which line ministries have

                                               38
                                   BiH Railways Policy Note


ownership responsibilities, to centralized ownership arrangements. Similarly, OECD Guidelines
on Corporate Governance of State-Owned Enterprises (2015) suggest: there should be a clear
separation between the state’s ownership function and other state functions that may
influence the conditions for state-owned enterprises… The exercise of ownership rights should
be centralized in a single ownership entity, or, if this is not possible, carried out by a
coordinating body. OECD reports that such vesting of the public share-ownership functions in
State-owned Enterprises in a single, specialized agency or department is being increasingly
adopted among OECD countries, including (but not limited to) some EU countries.

Adoption of the EU railway acquis tends to support (but does not require) vesting the
share-ownership functions in a ministry separate from the contracting line ministry.
Under the EU model the relationship between a line-ministry and a railway enterprise should
generally be governed by contractual arrangements that embody public policy aims, leaving
managers freedom to manage enterprises commercially in how they meet the contracted
targets. These contracts are the PSC contract with an Operating Company for passenger rail
services and a MAIC contract with an Infrastructure Management Company for network
infrastructure management. Following the implementation of new company structures, the
customer/owner roles can then be separated, with the line-ministry being the party
contracting with the companies in accordance with transport policies and a separate agency
performing ownership functions. However, this option is clearly only feasible if the FBH
government were to create such an agency for a number of the enterprises owned by the
entity. If not, a third ‘compromise’ alternative is to divide the share-ownership function
between a line-ministry and a non-line-ministry (e.g. a ministry of Industry or Ministry of
Finance) to try to give more balance between the corporate governance functions of an
‘independent’ shareholder and the policy/contracting functions of the line ministry.




B.2.5 Private participation in the Operating Company
The FBH government currently holds majority ownership of ŽFBH and has no plans for
privatization of any part of transport operations. When the Entity’s rail freight market
becomes contestable under a non-discriminatory access regime the Operating Company will
need to compete for freight traffic with possible new entrants, both public and private. It will
be vulnerable to competition for the best of its few markets. It is not always clear why
governments wish to participate as a player in freight transport which in all other modes of
transport is dominated by the private sector. There is a serious risk that if it remains publicly-
owned, the Entity’s Operating Company will be unable to grow into the high-efficiency, high-
performing enterprise necessary to compete successfully both with the predominantly private
road transport industry and the many operators in the emerging European rail freight industry.

International experience and proposed market competition suggest the government
should consider the option of privatization before track access rights open up the market.
Private participation in rail freight has been successful in improving performance just about
everywhere it has been tried. A World Bank review of rail freight privatization on three
continents, Latin America (sample of 7 freight railways), Africa (12 freight railways) and
Australia (5 freight railways) showed that privatization has almost always had a positive result
on the pre-existing business efficiency and effectiveness in the rail freight sector. While


                                               39
                                  BiH Railways Policy Note


acknowledging this must be a decision for Entity governments this option should be seriously
considered before the market becomes contestable through track access rights because the
value of the company will surely deteriorate once it is. The option of privatization should be
considered while the Railway Operator still has dominant market positions.

B.2.6 Implementation issues
The most pressing of the structural issues is to determine and implement the desired
future institutional structure of what is currently ŽFBH. The most suitable approach for
the railways of FBH is that which creates the most simple and straightforward structure, that
is the creation of two separate companies, an Infrastructure Manager and a transport
Operating Company. A supplementary decision is how to handle any residual passenger
services and the most straightforward solution is again favored which is to have it as a
separately accounted division or subsidiary of the Operating Company rather than trying to
create an independent company in such a small and unpromising market.

At the time of formation, it is considered better, if the option is available, to vest the
ownership of the government’s shares in the two rail enterprises in a central agency or
ministry that will not be responsible for negotiating the PSC and MAIC contracts. Given
that a small proportion of shares in the integrated ŽFBH are already independently owned, it
would seem appropriate to encourage or incentivize such shareholders either to sell their
shares back to government or to swap their shares in ŽFBH for shares in the new Operating
Company. This would leave the Infrastructure Manager, which will be greatly dependent on
MAIC, as a fully publicly-owned company while the Operating Company would increase its
proportion of private ownership with the possibility of profitable freight operations and
potential dividends. Increasing private participation still further should then be seriously
considered, but any decision to do so beyond this could be deferred until the new Operating
Company is up and running with an audited set of accounts.

If the FBH government chooses the option of separating companies it should be well-
planned and implemented and not just be a process of dividing out existing assets,
liabilities and human resources. The intention of restructuring is not just to harmonize with
EU structures but to create a more effective and sustainable railway industry. Separation of
the two new rail companies appears likely to require a new FBH Railway Law and the
opportunity should be taken to establish the new companies on a firm commercial foundation.
They would be obligated by law to implement those parts of the EU rail acquis that fall to the
companies (for example, in the case of the Infrastructure Manager, the preparation and
publication of the Network Statement and access terms and conditions)

The new companies should be established with a clear commercial mandate to operate
their businesses in the most efficient and effective manner. Their opening balance sheets
should carry only the assets they need and any obsolete or surplus assets disposed of as soon
as possible. They should not be burdened with the transfer of unsustainable loan obligations
which they are unable to service and repay and which are in practice funded from the budget.
They should ideally only take over the staff they need to run the companies efficiently. Unless
these issues are addressed prior to separation and a robust implementation plan adhered to,
the new companies will simply inherit and share between them the current problems and
inefficiencies rather than having the opportunity to make a clean start.

B.3. Railway development policy
B.3.1 Key policy options
The FBH government has policy choices in four main areas of railway sector policy, each
having significantly different budgetary impacts for the Entity. The options concern
employment policy, the future of passenger services, the success of freight services in winning
more traffic combined with the impact of third-party track access, and the level of investment
in infrastructure. The options evaluated are summarized in Fig B10. The strategies have been
evaluated using the ŽFBH financial model by estimating the total 10 year cost, expressed in
2015 constant prices, of capital outlay and net operating costs (operating costs less
commercial revenues), which is essentially the amount that the Entity budget would need to
pay to support the railway on a sustainable basis over that period through (using the EU
framework) a combination of Public Services Contract a Multi-Annual Infrastructure Contract
and support of capital investment in passenger services and network infrastructure. In all cost
tables in Section B3, this capital cost is the future cost outlay and excludes FBH government
payments of existing IFI debt service, which will average about BAM 20 million/year between
2016-25.

B.3.2 Employment policy options
If the government of FBH adopts a ‘business as usual’ approach then the total potential
budgetary impact of its railway sector over the ten years would need to be about BAM
344 million. The capital support would be about BAM 90 million and net operating cost
support (passenger services contract and infrastructure O&M costs) about BAM 254 million.
The business-as-usual case represents broadly a continuation of current policies and
investment levels. Specifically it assumes: no significant change in total employment levels
from a 2015 base of about 3065 employees; passenger and freight trains continue to be
operated in FBH much as now for the same traffic levels; and no competition from any third-

24
  If the EU railway acquis is adopted this is not a strategic choice as such but the two alternatives are
included to illustrate what impact significant completion could have on sector finances.

                                                   41

party freight train operators. The overall results are shown in the business-as-usual row in
Table B5.

An active policy of improving productivity through natural attrition of employment levels
could reduce net operating costs by around 50 percent over the period. Capital spend
would not be affected so that overall budgetary impact would reduce by about 37 percent to
around BAM 218 million. The natural attrition policy could deliver a reduction of around 3-4
percent of the labor force each year yielding a staff level of around 2134 after 10 years. The
average labor productivity would improve to 434,000 traffic units/employee, about 70
percent of the current EU average level.

An early labor restructuring program would mean that by the end of the period budgetary
support of net operating costs (excluding depreciation) could be reduced by about four-
fifths. The labor restructuring policy is represented as a downsizing over the period 2017-
2019 to about 2,000 staff by 2020 with a gradual reduction thereafter to a total staff of
around 1770 by 2025. Assuming labor compensation costs are treated as operational
expenditures25 the capital spend would not be affected so that overall budgetary impact over
the period would reduce by about 60 percent to around BAM 145 million. The average labor
productivity in 2025 would improve to about 520,000 traffic units/employee, about 82
percent of current EU levels.

The budgetary impact of FBH’s railway sector is therefore dramatically influenced by
railway labor productivity which in turn depends strongly on Entity employment policy.
While ŽFBH has been addressing the issue gradually through attrition, Government support
would be necessary to pursue major labor restructuring. If the government of FBH were to
approve programs to improve railway efficiency through higher labor productivity then the net
budgetary impact of other strategies would be more favorable. Moreover, in anticipating a
future as part of an integrated rail market, the FBH Operating Company will not be competitive

25
   In practice there is a strong case for treating labor restructuring as a form of investment which in
overstaffing situations yields returns on investment substantially higher than either rolling stock or
infrastructure investment.

with third-party operators if it is not operating efficiently and its Infrastructure Manager will
similarly not be able to offer an attractive route if government support is being funneled into
supporting employment levels rather than infrastructure improvements.



B.3.3 Passenger service policies
Withdrawal of the requirement for ŽFBH to provide passenger services would beneficially
transform both the economics of ŽFBH and the FBH budget support required for railways.
This policy has been represented in the financial model as a withdrawal of all rail services from
the year 2020. The fares revenue foregone would be minimal but the potential operating costs
savings substantial. Table B6 shows the net impact compared with a base policy of
productivity improvement through natural attrition of employment levels (Case 2 above).
Discontinuing passenger rail services would reduce the need for capital cost and operating cost
support from the budget by one third. When added to the productivity improvements scenario
of an early labor restructuring program (Case 3 above), discontinuing passenger rail services
would eliminate the need for net operating cost support from the budget and by 2025 would
be close to being able to fund minor investments in infrastructure. At the same time the total
staff of the (in this scenario) freight-only railway would be reduced to around 1350 employees
and the productivity would increase to about 670,000 traffic units/employee, nearly 10
percent higher than the EU average.

The FBH government could choose to adopt the converse policy of reinvigorating
passenger services by investing in modern rolling stock and providing a higher level of
service on the main passenger routes, but the budget impact would be severe. This policy
has been represented in the financial model as comprising government funded investment to
operate a good frequency inter-city service between major centers on main lines with new
better quality all-EMU rolling stock, starting in 2020 (Annex III gives more details). The policy
would increase passenger numbers which, using conventional estimates of market elasticity,
suggests an increase in passengers of about 65 percent. The new (more efficient) rolling stock
would also provide some unit operating cost savings although these would be more than
consumed by increasing service frequency to more attractive levels. The upshot is that the
operating financial support required over the ten years would be BAM 87 million more than the
net cost under Case (2), but with an increase in need for capital support to BAM 501 million,
yielding an overall budgetary support requirement of more than BAM 700 million.

The FBH government might wish to replace rail public transport services with a bus
service contract the cost of which for a comparable or better service would be only a
fraction of current rail service costs. The FBH has a well-developed bus industry that with
a reasonable period of preparation could readily provide the capacity to absorb the small
volume of rail passengers affected. However, an alternative that might be favored to assure
the public of continuity of is for the Ministry of Transport and Communications to tender a
transitional contract for replacement bus services paralleling the existing railway services.
This is a way of assuring passengers who may be impacted by service withdrawal that they will
receive continued public transport service at affordable price which can be done by
establishing performance benchmarks service frequency, station stops, journey times and
vehicle standards at levels equal to or ideally superior to those of the rail services they replace.

B.3.4 Rail freight policies
In the freight sector ŽFBH must try to hold onto the freight it already carries while
seeking to attract additional flows. There are flows of traffic in FBH which are carried by
road transport such as bulk petroleum products, for which railways would normally be
expected to offer comparative economic and environmental advantages. Table B7 (Case 3f1)
shows that if additional freight of about 30 percent of tonne-km could be won by FBH by 2025
the total budgetary impact of the rail sector over the period compared to Case 3 would reduce
by about two-thirds. A similar result, resulting however in higher budget amount, is found when
the reference scenario is Case 2. Within the EU rail acquis freight rail services are to be
competitive and financially self-sustaining without budget support for transport operations
so strategic decisions are essentially for the operating company management rather than the
FBH government26. Rolling stock investments would need to be financed by the company, not
through the budget.

However, the Company’s financial performance will also be influenced by when the FBH
rail market becomes open to competition by other freight train operators, and what the
impact of such competition would be. For illustrative purposes it is assumed that an
effective access regime in place on the FBH rail network by 2020. Competitive markets are
never very predictable, but observing other European experiences and noting that ŽFBH has a
very concentrated market of a few large bulk customers, it is evident that parts of the market
could be quite attractive to competitors, or may lead to freight shippers operating their own
services. Naturally, if new operators win part of the freight market they will still pay track
access charges for infrastructure and so the income of a ŽFBH infrastructure company would
remain constant. But the revenue of a ŽFBH freight company would reduce. For illustrative

26
  ŽFBH has been unwilling on grounds of commercial confidentiality to provide the Bank team with
any data on its freight customers or freight tariffs, so any analysis of freight strategy is necessarily
speculative.

                                                    44
                                      BiH Railways Policy Note


purposes the evaluation assumes that the ŽFBH average freight rates for the traffic they
retain (which will generally be wagonload traffic unattractive to new operators) would remain
constant compared to business-as-usual but that the ŽFBH freight operator would lose 10
percent of its markets to private operators each year with a residual market of about 50
percent of the ‘without access’ case by 2025.

In practice a sufficiently active management might preserve more of the company’s pre-
existing markets than assumed, but equally the impact on the company could be more
severe. Based on the assumptions stated, Table B7 (Case 2f2) shows that such an outcome
would double the operating support for the Entity-owned railways compared to Reference case
(2) because the increased track access income from third-party operators would not
compensate for the anticipated reduction in revenue lost to competition by the incumbent
Entity-owned operator.

B.3.5 Rail infrastructure investment policies
Three development policies may be contemplated in FBH’s rail infrastructure sector
depending on the level of investment that government is willing to fund. One policy is to
sustain investments at the current level (as assumed in Cases (2) and (3)). A second policy is
to increase investment levels giving priority to the creation of an improved train control
system which would include overcoming the delays and heavy staffing currently associated
with train operations. In the view of the Bank Team this is the highest priority capital
investment need. A third policy is to add to the Train Control system improvements the
additional investment necessary to achieve higher line speeds which have been represented as


27
   In view of the huge losses it is unlikely that any third-party operator would wish to enter the
passenger market without a passenger services contract.
28
   This productivity is overestimated as it includes the traffic carried by new train operators on the
system but excludes their staff.

B.3.6 Combined development policies
When individual policies are combined, the range of policies implies a total budget impact
range from BAM 20 million to BAM 769 million. Table B9 shows the budgetary impact for a
range of combined policies. The most expensive in commitment of public resources would be
to adopt a ‘business as usual’ approach and do nothing about existing low labor productivity,
while investing in improving passenger services, and adopting the higher investment. The most
cost-effective in terms of public resources is to pursue a labor restructuring program, replace
most or all passenger rail services by bus services, and concentrate investment in improving
train control systems to reduce operational delays to freight trains.

Public expenditure must of course be judged by decision-makers according to their
judgement of value for money and not just the absolute level. The choice of overall
development policy is the responsibility of the government of FBH taking account of transport
policy aims and budgetary constraints. The analysis suggests that an optimal order of decision
making is as follows: first, whether or not to adopt an early labor restructuring program;
second, whether to continue to fund a rail passenger services contract; third, when to
implement an infrastructure access regime; fourth, whether to adopt the train control
investment priority policy and how to finance it; and lastly, whether and how much to invest
in attaining higher line-speeds. The last of these may itself be influenced by the availability of
EU-sourced funding that might require even higher line speeds as a condition of financing.

B.3.7 Policy Implementation Issues
All the main elements of the new policy options require more detailed evaluation and
planning prior to implementation, none more so than labor policy which could improve the
performance of any other railway policy. The natural attrition option should be relatively
straightforward to pursue in FBH as the company is already attaining a steady annual
reduction in employees by this means. A labor restructuring program, if sanctioned by the FBH
government, would give immediate productivity benefits but should be planned in the context
of the longer-term commercial requirements. This would involve company managements
undertaking a fundamental re-evaluation of their asset management strategies, operating and
maintenance standards and methods, workshop needs, work practices, demarcation
constraints, crew rosters, opportunities for competitive outsourcing, and other business
processes using a ‘zero-based’ methodology to identify the most efficient labor force they
actually need to meet the traffic commitments they can reasonably foresee. The resulting

   All policies include third-party freight train operator access from 2020, which is an essential
element of the EU railway acquis

                                                                                   47

retrenchment program would also need to be able to demonstrate that it is fair and
transparent, that full consultation with the workforce and Trade Unions has taken place, and
that funding is available for satisfactory compensation packages and supporting
social/retraining programs.

Deciding the future of passenger rail services requires a more detailed review of public
passenger transport demand and supply in the FBH corridors where passenger rail
services currently run. The analysis carried out for the Policy Note has been strategic in
nature, using service utilization data from ŽFBH. To fully appraise the option of discontinuing
passenger rail services, an informed assessment would need to be made as to their social
benefit and how the continuation of such benefits could be assured through adaptation of
road-based public transport services. This would require more detailed passenger surveys to
better define the precise markets for passenger rail service by origin-destination, journey
purpose, age and gender, amongst other attributes. To gauge the passenger improvement
policy option would require a wider potential catchment survey of passenger transport
demand that might be attracted to an improve railway service as well as detailed economic,
social and environmental appraisal of the investments required. A much more explicit Public
Service Contract would also need to be developed with a verifiable costing procedure that
meets EU approaches. The model estimates suggests the budget support for such contract
would need to be at many multiples of what the government now pays.

Third-party access is obligatory if the EU railways acquis is to be adopted, but many of
the details of implementation and timing need to be properly prepared. Fortunately, there
are numerous examples of Network Statements available from other EU Infrastructure
Managers and available on the internet. Track Access charges will need to be structured in
accordance with evolving EU guidance, however, if the freight traffic does not have to subsidize
passenger traffic it could make a significant contribution to network infrastructure costs
relative to many European countries. Track Access charges and conditions should also be
harmonized so far as possible between Entities (discussed further in Section D). A decision
would also need to be made when to fully implement the track access regime. There is a strong
case to defer this until FBH has properly separated Infrastructure Manager from Operating
Company, and the latter has been given the opportunity to become as efficient as possible in
advance of competition. The assumption of implementation of track access in 2020, as used
in the financial model, may be a reasonable target to aim at.

The final network investment programs for the new companies under a new structure
would be developed by the management of the FBH Infrastructure Manager. The
programs would need to be within a budget envelope agreed with Entity governments who will
ultimately need to fund them. The program should cover a duration of at least five years and
be renewable. The Note has concluded at a strategic level that greater centralization of train
dispatching and control and better (and safer) control of level crossings is the main priority but
there are sections of Corridor Vc, particularly from Sarajevo to Zenica which are in very poor
shape and the FBH section of Doboj-Tuzla. If sufficient funds are available (including
international loans and grants) a joint train control and track rehabilitation program could be
justified on these sections. A fuller investment appraisal could be used to optimize the line
speeds and standards sought but this will demonstrate that these should be built around the
needs of freight markets for sufficient capacity, end-to-end delivery times and reliability. It
seems highly unlikely that the incremental investments to attain fast (100-120 km/h plus)

passenger services necessary to compete with private cars or road coaches could be
economically or environmentally justified in FBH’s passenger markets.

                     PART C              RAILWAYS OF THE R EPUBLIKA S RPSKA

C.1.       Current status of the railways in Republika Srpska30
C.1.1      Overview of railway
Railway network
The railway network in the Republika Srpska consists of 426 route-km of which 353 km
are currently under traffic operations. It is one of the smallest networks in the Western
Balkans region 31 , similar in size to Albania’s (Fig C1). Compared to land area, the network
density is one of the lowest in the region (Fig C2), a little less than half of that of neighboring
Croatia and Serbia because a significant proportion of those networks consists of lightly-used
branch lines whereas most of the RS network consists of the Entity’s main lines.

The backbone route in RS is the east-west line from the border with Croatia via Novi
Grad, Banja Luka and Doboj. There it meets the Entity’s section of the north-south Pan-
European railway corridor Vc. It also provides the western section of the link eastward from
Doboj to the exclaved part of ŽFBH’s network centered on Tuzla. The operational network is
standard gauge (1,435mm) predominantly single track (94 percent) and electrified at 25 kV
(88 percent). The maximum rated design speed on the main line is generally 100km/h, and
many sections have been rehabilitated to this standard. The rated design speed Doboj
eastward is generally 40 km/h with short sections at 80 km/h. Commercial speed is lower than
rated speed throughout mainly because of an obsolete train dispatching and control system,
including some compulsory stops at unprotected level crossings (of the 278 level crossings on
the ŽRS network only 23 are protected).

Rail Freight Transport
ŽRS freight traffic density is high compared to neighboring countries and is comparable
to the EU average. Traffic density is about one million tonnes/route-km - about 80 percent
of the EU average - taking into account the entire network and 1.2 million tonnes/route-km
which equals the EU average considering only the network length currently in use. Table C1
provides regional and other benchmarks. More than 97 percent of ŽRS traffic task is freight.
In 2015, it carried around 5 million tonnes for 428 million net tonne-km (ntkm), an average
distance of 85 km.32 Freight traffic has been increasing modestly since 2005 other than a
temporary drop in 2009 coincident with the global financial crisis (Fig C3). Domestic traffic
(which for freight includes the inter-Entity traffic) comprised 1.9 million tonnes (38 percent),
import and export traffic was 1.3 million tonnes (26 percent) and transit traffic 1.8 million
tonnes (36 percent) (Fig C4).

Freight is dominated by bulk cargo. The main commodities are iron ore, bauxite,
aluminium, hydrated aluminium, alkali and coal. The iron ore is about 40 percent of the total
2015 volume by tonnes, with the main user of the iron ore (and the largest client of ŽRS) being
Arcelor Mittal Zenica in FBH (2.02 million tonnes of iron ore were transported by rail from RS
to FBH in 2015). Locomotives are sometimes changed at the boundary of the two railways but
when necessary (for example, the receiving locomotives not available) are run through by
mutual agreement. Other bulk commodities including coal, bauxite, aluminium, hydrated
aluminium and alkali are transported on various routes, mainly to Alumina Zvornik Novi (0.46
million tonnes in 2015).

  Because a substantial proportion of traffic is inter-entity the tonnes carried by each of BiH’s railway
are not additive. However, the net tonne-km, a measure of traffic task within each entity, are additive.

Rail freight prices applied by ZRS are high compared to neighboring countries33. In 2014
ZRS transported 425 million net tonne-km with an associated freight revenue according to
the financial statement of 41.44 million BAM, which represents an average price of 0.097
BAM/tkm or 0.054 USD/ntkm. Average prices in ZRS are higher than in neighboring countries,
with 0.038 USD/ntkm in Croatia, 0.0288 USD/ntkm in Serbia, 0.023 USD/ntkm in Slovenia,
and comparable to Albania average of 0.057 USD/ntkm. ZRS average rate is also higher than
the average rate applied by ZFBH which is 0.048 USD/ntkm.


Rail Passenger Transport
Passenger rail transport is marginal to the RS’s overall transport system, carrying only
about 460 passengers/day. In 2014 as a whole, ŽRS carried 168,000 passengers for a total
of 12 million passenger-km, an average distance of 71 km. Some 77 percent of passengers were
classified as domestic (intra-entity), 14 percent international, and 9 percent inter-entity. All
passenger groups have declined in recent years and train occupancy now averages only about
14 passengers/train34 equivalent to less than half a bus-load (Figs C5 and C6).
Despite near negligible passenger numbers, around half of all train-km run by the
company are of passenger trains. Passenger traffic density (passengers/route-km) is less
than a tenth of most other countries in the region and less than 2 percent of the EU average.
(Table C1). The two main domestic routes are Doboj – Banja Luka (4 pairs of trains/day), Doboj
– Petrovo Novo (3 pairs of trains/day) and Banja Luka – Dobrljin (2 pairs of trains/day). Inter-
entity trains run between Doboj and Sarajevo (2 pairs of trains/day) and Doboj and Tuzla (1 pair
of trains/day) but they carry very few inter-entity passengers and most passengers are
travelling intra-entity. There is an international train (1 pair of train/day) between Sarajevo and
Zagreb that uses the ŽRS line, but most international passengers on the train are relatively
short-distance cross-border trips.

   The low share of transit traffic implies in more manipulations per ntkm in average, what may, at
least partially, explain a higher price.

Rolling stock
ŽRS has acquired little new rolling stock in the last twenty years, with the exception of a fleet
of wagons for the iron ore traffic. The locomotive and passenger carriages fleets are very old
and in generally poor condition. Nevertheless, the fleets are far larger than is required for the
current traffic task. Locomotive, freight wagon and passenger coach productivity (even
excluding non-operational stock) are all relatively low by regional standards and a fraction of
EU average levels (Annex V provides details).

Human resources
At end 2015, ŽRS had 3,160 employees. Labor productivity (average traffic units per total
employee) in 2015 was estimated to be 146,000, lowest in the region (other than Albania) and
about a quarter of the EU average. The company increased its employment levels until 2010,
on the basis of its employment policies rather than commercial needs, and despite some
attrition in numbers since then, ŽRS still has more employees than it had in 2005 and the
highest number of employees/route-km of any railway in the region (Table C2).

C.1.2 ŽRS financial status
ŽRS is not financially sustainable in its current role and form, operating with a large
deficit in every recent year after receiving some support from the RS budget for
passenger services and infrastructure. Total operating expenses of ŽRS exceeded total
revenues for each year during 2007-2014 (Annex V provides details). The amount of total
revenues, including budget support, was just about sufficient to cover cash operating
expenses. Labor costs are a disproportionate component of the cost structure of ŽRS, not
surprisingly given the very high levels of staff for railway of this length and traffic profile. In
2014, the wage bill was 64 percent of operating expenses35 and 108 percent of commercial
revenues (excluding Entity subsidies). Depreciation is the second largest cost item, but ŽRS
has had no commercial revenue or budget support to fund depreciation provisions as a source
of finance for annual renewals or investment. Basically, all infrastructure O&M costs are
funded from the budget.

Most financing of major capital investment since the company’s formation was made
available to ŽRS through foreign and domestic loans, servicing and repayment of which
are basically funded by the RS government though channeled through the company’s
accounts. Between 2009 and 2013 ŽRS invested on average BAM 56 million annually on rail
infrastructure and rolling stock. Infrastructure investments (BAM 146 million in total for those
five years) included mainly overhaul and rehabilitation of track and modernization of signaling
and telecom system on some sections. Rolling stock investments totaled BAM 127 million
during the 2009-2013 period and financed the purchase of new wagons and rehabilitation and
overhaul of some existing rolling stock. Persistent financial losses prevented ŽRS from funding
capital expenditure or fully servicing debt obligations from its own resources. As a result, the
debt service payments were made on the behalf of ŽRS by the RS government but charged to
the railway account. In addition to the loans, ŽRS received annual subsidies for infrastructure
but this amount declined over the years from over BAM 28 million in 2008 to BAM 17 million
in 2014.

                                       BiH Railways Policy Note


Despite the weak overall financial status, ŽRS actually earns a healthy surplus on freight
operations relative to its operating costs. By contrast, there are substantial losses on
passenger services, even allowing for revenue support from the budget. Table C3 provides
Bank estimates of the performance by business sector, using a financial model based on
commonly-used management accounting techniques used internationally for railway analysis.
Even with RS budget support, passenger unit revenues cover around a third of direct expenses
of passenger services and 16 percent of total operating costs (excluding depreciation). These
estimates of losses are higher than internally estimated by the company but arise because of
the costs attributable to the approximate half of all train-km that are passenger trains 36 .
These represent a substantial net cost burden to the company (BAM 14.164 million) which
consumes virtually the whole of the freight surplus that it earns (BAM 14.194 million). As a
result the freight surplus is not available either to reinvest in the profitable freight business or
to contribute to recovering the network infrastructure costs. The operations costs of network
infrastructure are more or less fully funded from the budget.

that both train control and corporate costs in the above table include significant labor components.

   Although infrastructure costs are often considered to not vary with traffic volumes, there seems
little doubt that very substantial costs in train control costs and corporate services could be avoided if
passenger services ceased to run, so such costs are properly allocable to passenger services.

C.1.3 Alignment with the EU railway acquis
The railway policy framework in BiH needs strengthening in a number of areas to
harmonize with the EU railway acquis. The areas that most immediately bear on
responsibilities exercised by the Republika Srpska government (as opposed to the BiH level)
are those related to institutional structure, track access, budgetary support for passenger
services; budgetary support for infrastructure; and debt sustainability. The required actions
(for which more details are given in Annex II) are:

       the separation between the management of railway infrastructure and management
        of rail transport operations which are currently co-located and managed by one
        company;
     the implementation of a compliant non-discriminatory track access regime with a
        Network Statement to facilitate access with a system of track access charges;
     if passenger services will be continued, the provision of adequate compensation for
        passenger transport services via a public service contract (PSC) between the
        government and the service provider;
     adequate budgetary support for the O&M of network infrastructure through a more
        rigorous (and preferably multi-annual) maintenance contract (MAIC38); and
     a mechanism for government to assume or restructure unsustainable debt of its train
        operating company in order for it to be able to compete on a fair basis with third-party
        train operators competing under access arrangements.
The Republika Srpska government is actively considering legislative actions to underpin the
institutional and structural changes necessary. The following section now turns to the policy
options that the RS government might wish to consider its deliberations.


C.2. Rail industry structure options
C.2.1 Industry structure alternatives
There are various ways of harmonizing with the acquis, as evidenced by the variety of
arrangements that EU member states have adopted for their own national railways. The
Republika Srpska should consider which arrangements best suit the Entity’s circumstances.
The main high-level structural choices faced by the RS government fall into four categories,
relating to (a) the organizational form of the future state-owned railway enterprise (or
enterprises); (b) if the state chooses to contract for passenger rail services with a state-owned
rail user, where to locate this activity in the structure; (c) the exercise of state share-owning
functions in such enterprises; and (d) whether to seek private participation in the Rail
Operating company. These main choices are set out in Figure C7.

Each of the policy choices has its own advantages, disadvantages and risks. The options
are described below and the appraisal that follows seeks to delineate the key features of each
choice. The Policy Note presents an opinion on options when, weighing all factors, this seems
justified by both the local circumstances and international experiences. However, the Policy
Note is not intended to be prescriptive and ultimately these key structural decisions are for
governments.


38
   The railway acquis does not require that the infrastructure contract be on a multiannual basis but it
is suggested in EU supporting papers as best practice.

C.2.2 Basic organizational form of state-owned railway enterprises
The Policy Note is guided by provisions of the informal agreement on the 4th Railway
Package market pillar agreed by representatives from the European Commission,
Parliament and Council in April 2016. The Agreement has still to be approved by the full
Council and Parliament, and this is expected in late 2016. It implies that both the separated or
group structures that exist in member states are acceptable but whichever alternative is used
it should be designed to ensure impartiality of railway infrastructure managers in providing
non-discriminatory access to tracks, allow them to pursue their own strategies for better use
of rail infrastructure, and improve financial transparency in order to remove the risk of cross-
subsidy between infrastructure managers and transport operators. Detailed rules on each of
these matters are to be promulgated.

On balance, the Bank team considers the best way forward to be institutional separation
of the infrastructure manager from the transport operating company, arguably the
simplest and most clear-cut option for RS. The evaluation of options is described in more
detail in Annex V. The evaluation was aimed at identifying a structure which, while capable of
complying with the EU acquis, would also consider the efficiency of various elements of sector
management, and the ease of implementation. Institutional separation would avoid the
ambiguity and potential conflict of interest inherent in a group structure. The two companies
would have a clear role and functions. Relations between the two companies would be
governed by a contract for infrastructure access subject to the regulatory oversight of the BiH
RRB regarding the access to each other’s network, in accordance with EU principles. The
preference for separation is reinforced by the added weight the team gives to two factors in
the evaluation criteria: first, there is the expectation under separation that clarity and focus
in roles would lead to better management of the individual infrastructure and transport
operating companies; and second it would enhance their ability to determine their own


                                              58
                                     BiH Railways Policy Note


business strategies in the context of a European railway system in which each will have
different opportunities and constraints, and sometimes different interests. Thirteen EU
member states have separated structures: Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Great Britain,
Greece, Finland, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Slovakia (See Annex
III).

However, a group structure is also a legitimate and compliant option that would maintain
a measure of coordination between the state-owned components of the rail industry.
Under this structure a holding company would be interposed between the RS government (and
the other) owners and subsidiary infrastructure and operating company (ies). Four EU Member
States have adopted group structures for their railways: Germany, Poland, Italy and Austria.
It might be easier to implement in RS, requiring corporate reorganization of ŽRS rather than
its division, and it might be easier for the line-ministry to deal with one holding company rather
than two separate companies. However, it would create less clarity and focus in company roles
and would create a greater regulatory compliance challenge because of the need to
demonstrate management independence, competitive neutrality and financial transparency
on the part of the infrastructure management subsidiary.

The separate companies approach seems more suitable for RS and likely to deliver better
performance at lower cost. The railway industry is not sufficiently large or complex to justify
adding another institutional layer39 (in the form of a holding company) to a railway industry
already characterized by an abundance of institutions. Moreover, in a group structure the best
railway managers would tend to gravitate to the holding company instead of running the actual
businesses where their skills are most needed. This would dilute the responsibility and
accountability of the subsidiary managements. While in theory a group structure could provide
some sharing of corporate services such as financial accounting and human resources
management, putting these at holding company level would reduce management
independence at the subsidiary level. It is also likely that with current low levels of productivity,
significant costs can be saved anyway in all corporate functions during a well-planned
separation process, a saving less likely if resources are simply regrouped into subsidiaries.

C.2.3 Location of a passenger rail services in the structure
If a holding company structure were to be favored it would be relatively straightforward
to locate a separate passenger company within it. A small and separate passenger
subsidiary company could be nested into a group structure, a PSC contract agreed between
the government and the passenger subsidiary (possible with the assent of the holding
company). The RS railway ‘group’ would then consist of a Holding Company, Infrastructure
Manager, Freight Operating Company and a Passenger Operating Company.

It would also be possible, but probably not very practicable, to establish an independent
separate passenger services company. In this option, RS would establish three separate
companies: Infrastructure Manager, Freight Operating Company and a Passenger Operating
Company. However, a railway Passenger Operating Company in RS would be a very small
enterprise to operate entirely independently, might suffer some diseconomies of very small
scale, and be more or less totally dependent on and therefore vulnerable to fluctuations in
budget funding (which would need to provide more than 95 percent of income).

39
   The holding company would need to have separate management structure and supervisory boards,
in order to prevent conflict of interest.

                                                 59
                                   BiH Railways Policy Note


The best option would seem to be to leave passenger services as subsidiary or special
business division of the Operating Company. In view of the very small scale of RS passenger
rail operations then it would be a sensible approach to retain passenger capability within the
Operating Company as a division or subsidiary rather than having two new Operating
Companies. (This presupposes that the RS government would choose to continue to own a
passenger rail operation, a proposition that is evaluated in Section C3). If this option were
preferred the EU railway acquis requires that separate accounts be kept for the passenger
activities to verify and agree the costs of the Public Service Contract, and avoid cross-subsidy
from freight to passenger sectors (as now occurs). This could be achieved by the division or
subsidiary ‘buying in’ most of its services (e.g. crew, rolling stock maintenance) from other
parts of the company at properly accounted transfer prices.

C.2.4 Exercise of state share-owning functions
When ownership functions in government transport enterprises are exercised by the line
ministry (normally the transport ministry) this increases ministerial control but can lead
to day-to-day intervention and undermining of management responsibilities. A line
ministry has the responsibility for formulating overall transport policies in accordance with
government social, economic and other aims, and bears the burden of public accountability for
those policies. However, the shareholder functions in a corporate structure must be primarily
concerned with the efficiency and commercial sustainability of the enterprise. In many
countries exclusive line ministry oversight of enterprise share ownership has led to conflicts
of interest between political and commercial aims, resulting in day-to-day political
intervention in the management of enterprises despite adverse commercial impacts.

The exercise of public ownership functions in state-owned enterprises by an agency or
department not responsible for transport policy tends to give greater weight to the
efficiency and commercial performance of the company. The World Bank’s Toolkit on
Corporate Governance of State-Owned Enterprises (2014) suggests governments should
consider moving away from traditional ownership models in which line ministries have
ownership responsibilities, to centralized ownership arrangements. Similarly, OECD Guidelines
on Corporate Governance of State-Owned Enterprises (2015) suggest: there should be a clear
separation between the state’s ownership function and other state functions that may
influence the conditions for state-owned enterprises… The exercise of ownership rights should
be centralized in a single ownership entity, or, if this is not possible, carried out by a
coordinating body. OECD reports that such vesting of the public share-ownership functions in
State-owned Enterprises in a single, specialized agency or department is being increasingly
adopted among OECD countries, including (but not limited to) some EU countries.

Adoption of the EU railway acquis tends to support (but does not require) vesting the
share-ownership functions in an agency or ministry separate from the contracting line
ministry. However, under the EU model the relationship between a line-ministry and a railway
enterprise should generally be governed by contractual arrangements that embody public
policy aims, leaving managers freedom to manage enterprises commercially in how they meet
the contracted targets. These contracts are the PSC contract with an Operating Company for
passenger rail services and a MAIC contract with an Infrastructure Management Company for
network infrastructure management. Following the implementation of new company
structures, the customer/owner roles can then be separated, with the line-ministry being the
party contracting with the companies in accordance with transport policies and a separate


                                              60
                                   BiH Railways Policy Note


agency performing ownership functions. However, this option is clearly only feasible if the RS
government were to create such an agency for a number of the enterprises owned by the
entity. If not, a third ‘compromise’ alternative is to divide the share-ownership function
between a line-ministry and a non-line-ministry (e.g. a ministry of Industry or Ministry of
Finance) to try to give more balance of shareholder views between the corporate governance
functions of an ‘independent’ government shareholder and the policy/contracting functions
of the line ministry.



C.2.5 Private participation in the Operating Company
The Republika Srpska government currently holds majority ownership of rail freight
operations and has no current plans for privatization. When the rail freight market
becomes contestable under a non-discriminatory access regime the Operating Company will
need to compete for freight traffic with possible new entrants, both public and private. It will
be vulnerable to competition for the best of its few markets. The RS government should
consider why it would wish to participate as a player in a freight transport market which in all
other modes is dominated by the private sector. There is a serious risk that if it remains
publicly-owned, the Entity’s Operating Company will be unable to grow into the high-
efficiency, high-performing enterprise necessary to compete successfully both with the
predominantly private road transport industry and the many operators in the emerging
European rail freight industry.

International experience and proposed market competition suggest the government
should consider the option of privatization before access rights opens up the market.
Private participation in rail freight has been successful in improving performance just about
everywhere it has been tried. A World Bank review of rail freight privatization on three
continents, Latin America (sample of 7 freight railways), Africa (12 freight railways) and
Australia (5 freight railways), showed that privatization has almost always had a positive result
on the pre-existing business efficiency and effectiveness in the rail freight sector. While
acknowledging this must be a decision for Entity governments this option should be seriously
considered before the market becomes contestable through track access rights. The value of
the company will surely deteriorate once it is.



C.2.6 Implementation Issues
The most pressing of the structural issues is to determine and implement the desired
future institutional structure of what is currently ŽRS. The most suitable approach for the
railways of RS is that which creates the most straightforward structure, that is the creation
of two separate companies, an Infrastructure Manager and a transport Operating Company. A
supplementary decision is how to handle any residual passenger services and the simplest
solution in practice is to retain it as a separately accounted division or subsidiary of the
Operating Company, rather than trying to create an independent company in such a small and
unpromising market.

At the time of their formation, it is considered better, if the option is available, to vest
the ownership of the government’s shares in the two rail enterprises in an agency or
ministry that will not be responsible for negotiating the PSC and MAIC contracts. Given


                                               61
                                   BiH Railways Policy Note


that a small proportion of shares in the integrated ŽRS are already independently owned, it
would seem appropriate to encourage or incentivize such shareholders either to sell their
shares back to government or to swap their shares in ŽRS for shares in the new Operating
Company. This would leave the Infrastructure Manager, which will be greatly dependent on
MAIC, as a fully publicly-owned company while the Operating Company would increase its
proportion of private ownership with the future possibility of profitable freight operations and
potential dividends. Increasing private participation still further should then be seriously
considered, but any decision to do so beyond this should be deferred until the new Operating
Company is up and running with a strong business plan and an audited set of accounts.

If the RS government chooses the option of separating companies it should be well-
planned and implemented and not just be a process of dividing out existing assets,
liabilities and human resources. The intention of restructuring is not just to harmonize with
EU structures but to create a more effective and sustainable railway industry. Separation of
the two new rail companies appears likely to require a new RS Railway Law and the opportunity
should be taken to establish the new companies on a firm commercial foundation. They would
be obligated by law to implement those parts of the EU rail acquis that fall to the companies
(for example, in the case of the Infrastructure Manager, the preparation and publication of the
Network Statement and access terms and conditions)

The new RS railway companies should also be established with a clear commercial
mandate to operate their businesses in the most efficient and effective manner. Their
opening balance sheets should carry only the assets they need and any obsolete or surplus
assets disposed of as soon as possible. They should not be burdened with the transfer of
unsustainable loan obligations which they are unable to service and repay and which are in
practice funded from the budget. They should ideally only take over the staff they need to run
the companies efficiently. Unless these issues are addressed prior to separation and a robust
implementation plan adhered to, the new companies will simply inherit and share between
them the current problems and inefficiencies, rather than having the opportunity to make a
clean start.


C.3. Railway development policy options
C.3.1 Key policies
Irrespective of structure, the Republika Srpska government has policy choices in four
main areas of railway policy, each having very different budgetary impacts for the Entity.
The strategies have been evaluated using the ŽRS financial model by estimating the total 10
year cost, expressed in 2015 constant prices, of capital outlay and net operating costs
(operating costs less commercial revenues), which is essentially the amount that the Entity
budget would need to pay to support the railway on a sustainable basis over that period
through (using the EU framework) a combination of Public Services Contract, a Multi-Annual
Infrastructure Contract and support of capital investment in passenger services and network
infrastructure. In all cost tables in Section B3, this capital cost is the future cost outlay and
excludes RS government payments of existing IFI debt service of about BAM 4 million/year.

C.3.2 Employment policy options
If the government of RS does nothing fundamental to change the way its railway industry
is run then the total potential budgetary impact of its railway sector over the ten years

                                               62
                                       BiH Railways Policy Note


would need to be about BAM 328 million. The capital support in this ‘business-as-usual’
approach would be about BAM 103 million (excluding existing debt servicing on behalf of
railways) plus net operating cost support (passenger services contract and infrastructure
O&M costs) about BAM 225 million. The business-as-usual case represents continuation of
current policies and investment levels. Specifically it assumes: no change in total employment
levels from a base of around 3065 employees; passenger and freight trains continue to be
operated in RS much as now for the same traffic levels; and no competition from any third-
party freight train operators. The overall results are shown in the Case 1, business as usual, line
in Table C5.

An active policy of improving productivity through natural attrition of employment levels
could reduce net operating costs by around 39 percent over the period. Capital spend
would not be affected so that overall budgetary impact would reduce by about 26 percent to
around BAM 241 million. The natural attrition policy could deliver a reduction of around 3-4
percent staff /year yielding a staff level of around 2172 after 10 years. The average labor
productivity would improve to around 202,000 traffic units/employee but this would still be
lower than most railways in this region achieve already despite lower traffic density than in
RS.

An early labor restructuring program would transform the performance of the railway
and nearly eliminate the net operating cost deficit. The labor restructuring policy is
represented in the financial model as a downsizing over the period 2017-2019 to about 1500
staff by 2020 with a gradual reduction thereafter to a total staff of around 1319 by 2025.
Assuming labor compensation costs are treated as operational expenditures 41 the capital
spend would not be affected so that overall budgetary impact would reduce by about 62
percent to around BAM 123 million. The average labor productivity in 2025 would improve to

    If the EU railway acquis is adopted this is not a strategic choice as such but the two alternatives are
included to illustrate what impact significant competition could have on sector finances.
41
   In practice there is a strong case for treating labor restructuring as a form of investment because in
overstaffing situations it yields returns on investment substantially higher than either rolling stock or
infrastructure investment.

about 333,000 traffic units/employee, comparable with productivity levels currently attained

The budgetary impact of the railway sector is clearly heavily influenced by railway labor
productivity. ŽRS is heavily overstaffed partly as a result of policies to create employment
so government support would be necessary to right-size the labor force. If the government of
RS were to approve programs to improve railway efficiency through higher labor productivity
then the net budgetary impact of any other railway development policy would be more
favorable. More crucially, the government of RS must anticipate a future as part of an
integrated European rail market: its Operating Company cannot be competitive with any
third-party operators if it is not operating efficiently; and its Infrastructure Company will not
be able to provide an attractive route if government support is funneled into job creation rather
than infrastructure improvements.


C.3.3 Passenger service policy
Withdrawal of the requirement for ŽRS to meet a public passenger services contract
would beneficially impact both the economics of ŽRS and the RS budget support required
for railways. This policy has been represented in the financial model as a withdrawal of all
passenger services from the year 2020. The fares revenue foregone would be minimal but the
potential operating costs savings substantial. Table C6 shows the net impact compared with
the labor strategies of natural attrition and of restructuring (Cases 2 and 3 above). It shows
that after allowing for those productivity improvements, while under natural attrition of labor
the need for budget support would be reduced by 15%, the labor restructuring scenario would
eliminate the need for net operating support from the budget (by 2025 the freight only railway
would be in overall operating surplus of BAM 27 million) and total budgetary impact would be
only 40 percent of that from Case 3 (though still requiring Entity investment in infrastructure).
At the same time the total staff of the (in this scenario) freight only railway would be reduced
to around 925 employees and the productivity would soar to about 463,000 traffic

units/employee, nearly as high as now achieved in Poland and about three-quarters of the
current EU average.

In contrast, the RS government could choose to invest in modern rolling stock and offer
a higher level of service on the main passenger routes but the budget impact would be
severe. This policy has been represented in the model as comprising government funded
investment to operate a better frequency, inter-city service between major centers on main
lines with new good quality rolling stock, starting in 2020. The policy would increase passenger
numbers which, using conventional estimates of market elasticity, suggests an increase in
passengers of about 65 percent. The new (more efficient) rolling stock would also provide some
unit operating cost savings but these would be more than consumed by increasing service
frequency to more attractive levels. The upshot is that the operating financial support
required over the ten years would be BAM 42 million greater than the net cost under Case (3p1),
with an increase in need for capital support to BAM 128 million, yielding an overall budgetary
support requirement of BAM 143 million, about three times the budgetary cost if the rail
passenger service were discontinued even allowing for much higher labor productivity in the
comparison.

The RS might wish to replace a rail public service contract with a bus service contract
but the cost would be only a fraction of the total costs of running rail services. The RS
has a very well developed bus industry that could readily absorb the small volume of rail
passengers affected given reasonable notice. However, an alternative that might be favored
to assure continuity of services to the public is for the Ministry of Transport and
Communications to tender a transitional contract for bus replacement services paralleling the
existing railway services. This simple measure is a way of assuring passengers who may be
impacted by service withdrawal or line closure that they will receive continued public transport
service at affordable price which can be done by establishing performance benchmarks service
frequency, station stops, journey times and vehicle standards at levels equal to or ideally
superior to those of the rail services they replace.

C.3.4 Rail freight policies
In the freight sector ŽRS’s strategic imperative must be to try to hold onto the freight
already carried. It has not been possible to discern any significant new commodity flows that
the company could realistically target. Within the EU rail acquis freight rail services are to be
competitive and financially self-sustaining without budget support for transport operations
so strategic decisions are essentially for the operating company management rather than the
RS government. The corresponding investment range is from maintaining the current level of
investment in rolling stock to a modest increase to strengthen fleet quality, but such
investments would be financed by the company not state-aided through the budget.

However, budgetary impact will be influenced by when the RS rail market becomes open
to competition by other freight train operators, and what the impact of such competition
would be. For illustrative purposes it is assumed that an effective access regime is put in place
on the RS network by 2020. Competitive markets are never predictable, but observing other
European experiences and noting that ŽRS has a very concentrated market of a few large bulk
customers it is evident that parts of this the market could be quite attractive to competitors
or to major shippers either operating themselves or contracting to a third-party for rail
transport services. Contestability would certainly impact freight rates but probably also the
volume of traffic that a ŽRS freight company could retain. Naturally, if new operators win part
of the freight market they will still pay track access charges for infrastructure and so the
income of a ŽRS infrastructure company would remain constant. But the revenue of a ŽRS
freight company would reduce. For illustrative purposes the evaluation assumes that the ŽRS
average freight rates for the traffic they retain (which will generally be wagonload traffic
unattractive to new operators) would remain constant compared to business-as-usual but
that the ŽRS freight operator would lose 10 percent of its markets to private operators each
year with a residual market of about 50 percent of the ‘without access’ case by 2025.

In practice a sufficiently entrepreneurial management might preserve more of their pre-
existing freight markets but equally it is possible that the impact could be greater. Based
on the assumptions stated above, Table C7 shows that such an outcome would increase the
operating support for the Entity-owned railways by BAM 55 to 60 million because the
increased track access income from third-party operators would not compensate for the
anticipated reduction in average revenue yield and the traffic lost to competition by a ŽRS
freight operator.

C.3.5 Rail infrastructure investment policies
Three development policies may be contemplated in the infrastructure sector depending
on the level of investment that government wishes to make in the railway network. One
policy is to sustain investments at the current level (as summed in Case (3)). A second policy
is to increase investment levels giving priority to the creation of an improved train control
system which would include overcoming the delays and heavy staffing currently associated
with train operations. In the view of the Bank Team this is the highest priority capital
investment need. A third policy is to add to the Train Control system improvements yet higher
investment so as to achieve higher line speeds which have been represented as 90 km/h for
passenger services and 80 km/h for freight services, (compared to about 75 km/h at present).
Comparisons of budget impact are given in Table C8.

Modest investment in improving the train control system and operations is estimated to
break even over the period but then deliver on-going annual benefits. Capital costs would
increase by BAM 37 million but this is offset during the period by the net operating costs
savings of BAM 33 million, with continuing benefits of BAM 5 million annually. By contrast,
increasing line speeds has a much higher capital outlay by BAM 39 million that is not offset the
lower operating costs of BAM 14 million during the period44.




42
   In view of the huge losses it is unlikely that any third-party operator would wish to enter the
passenger market without a passenger services contract.
43
   This productivity is overestimated as it includes the traffic carried by envisaged new train operators
on the system but excludes their staff.
44
   Over a longer evaluation period than 12 years the ratio of benefits to costs would improve but given
the pressing financial constraints the 12 year evaluation period clearly shows the economic priority of

C.3.5 Combined development policies
When individual policies are combined, the range of strategies implies a total budget
impact range from BAM 52 million to BAM 342 million. Table C9 shows the budgetary
impact for a range of combined strategies. The most expensive in commitment of public
resources would be to continue to tolerate existing low productivity, while investing in
improved passenger services and higher line speeds. The least expensive in terms of public
resources is to pursue a labor restructuring program and discontinue passenger services:
investment in improved train control would have a very small net negative budgetary impact
during the 10 year period but positive financial benefits thereafter.

The choice of overall development policy is the responsibility of the government of RS
taking account of transport policy aims and budgetary constraints. Public expenditure
must of course be judged by decision-makers according to their policy judgement of value for
money and not just its absolute level. The analysis suggests that an optimal order of decision
making is as follows: first, whether or not to adopt an early labor restructuring program;
second, whether to continue to fund rail passenger services or replace with road-based public
transport; third when to implement an infrastructure access regime; fourth, when to adopt
the train control investment priority policy and how to finance it; and lastly, whether and how
much to invest in attaining higher line-speeds.

C.3.7 Policy Implementation Issues
All of the main elements of new policy options require more detailed evaluation and
planning prior to implementation, none more so than labor policy which could improve the
performance of any other railway policy. The natural attrition option should be relatively
straightforward to adopt and would provide gradually accruing benefits. A fuller labor
restructuring program, if sanctioned by the RS government, would give immediate
productivity benefits but in business planning terms should have a sound basis in future
business needs of the Infrastructure Manager and the Operating Company. Company
managements would thereby undertake a fundamental re-evaluation of their asset
management strategies, operating and maintenance standards and methods, work practices,
demarcation constraints, crew rosters, opportunities for competitive outsourcing, and other

element of the EU railway acquis

                                                                                 69

business processes using a ‘zero-based’ methodology to identify the most efficient labor force
capable of meeting the traffic commitments they can reasonably foresee. The resulting
retrenchment program would also need to be able to demonstrate that it is fair and
transparent, that full consultation with the workforce and Trade Unions has taken place, and
that funding is available for satisfactory compensation packages and supporting
social/retraining programs.

Deciding the future of passenger rail services requires a more detailed review of public
passenger transport demand and supply in the RS corridors where passenger rail services
currently run. The analysis carried out for the Policy Note has been strategic in nature, using
service utilization data from ŽRS. To fully appraise the option of discontinuing passenger rail
services, an informed assessment would need to be made as to their social benefit and how
the continuation of such benefits could be assured through adaptation of road-based public
transport services. This would require more detailed passenger surveys to better define the
precise markets for passenger rail service by origin-destination, journey purpose, age and
gender, amongst other attributes. To gauge the passenger improvement policy option would
require a wider potential catchment survey of passenger transport demand that might be
attracted to an improve railway service as well as detailed economic, social and environmental
appraisal of the investments required. A much more explicit Public Service Contract would also
need to be developed with a verifiable costing procedure that meets EU approaches. The model
estimates suggests the budget support for such contract would need to be at many multiples
than government now pays.

Third-party access is obligatory if the EU acquis is to be adopted, but the details of
implementation and timing need to be determined. Fortunately, there are numerous
examples of Network Statements available from other EU Infrastructure Managers and
available on the internet. Track Access charges will need to be structured in accordance with
evolving EU guidance, however, if the freight traffic does not have to subsidize passenger
traffic it could make a significant contribution to network infrastructure costs relative to
many European countries. Track Access charges and conditions should also be harmonized so
far as possible between Entities (discussed further in Section D). A decision would also need to
be made when to fully implement the track access regime. There is a strong case to defer this
until RS has properly separated Infrastructure Manager from Operating Company, and the
latter has been given the opportunity to become as efficient as possible in advance of
competition. The assumption of implementation of track access in 2020, as used in the
financial model, may be a reasonable target to aim at.

The final network investment programs for the new companies under a new structure
would be developed by the management of the RS Infrastructure Manager. The programs
would need to be within a budget envelope agreed with Entity governments who will ultimately
need to fund them. The program should cover a duration of at least five years and be
renewable. The Note has concluded at a strategic level that greater centralization of train
dispatching and control and better (and safer) control of level crossings is the main priority but
there are RS sections of Doboj to Zvornik where if sufficient funds are available a combined
train control and track rehabilitation program could be a justified priority. A fuller investment
appraisal could be used to optimize the line speeds and standards sought but this will
demonstrate that these should be built around freight needs as there is no conceivable way
that the incremental investments for fast (100+km/h) passenger services could be
economically justified.

          PART D          IMPLICATIONS FOR E NTITY GOVERNMENTS AND BIH

D.1. Co-ordination between Entity railways and the role of BHŽJK
The adoption of new structural arrangements to comply with the EU railway acquis
presents to Entity governments and railways a coincident opportunity to reconsider how
best to interact to mutual advantage in the European railway market. The implications of
adopting the railway acquis for the future of BiH’s railway industry differ for the train
operating companies and the infrastructure management companies. The implications for the
train operating companies are the more profound, but in each case they will challenge Entity
government thinking about what BiH level arrangements would be most likely to serve their
policy interests.



D.1.1   Entity Train Operating Companies
The most critical impact of the acquis will be the effective dismantling of boundaries to
rail transport operations. At present each railway has ‘de facto’ exclusive operating rights
within its Entity boundaries 46 . In contrast, when the railway competition model is
implemented, any train operating company licensed in the EU (including those of the two
entities) will be able to cross between the tracks of the FBH and RS infrastructure
management companies as of right, as already happens daily throughout the European Union.

The two rail operating companies will therefore be faced with a new competitive
paradigm and have choices in how they may react. Open access will create threats and
opportunities. The threats are clear: pressure on end-user tariffs as customers exploit their
ability to change supplier of rail services and on market share if they actually do change
supplier. But there are some potentially offsetting opportunities. Each Entity may in principle
choose to try and win traffic carried by the other Entity railway, but alternatively they could
decide to pool their services and offer a seamless origin to destination service throughout BiH.
Similarly each company might also choose to operate in neighboring countries and the larger
geography offered by the EU rail market either as individual companies or in business
partnership.

It is likely to be in the mutual interest of the train operating companies to undertake both
inter-entity and regional marketing and operations on a co-operative basis. Competing
head-to-head in BiH is likely to reduce overall revenue without expanding the total BiH rail
traffic task. By contrast, co-operating to provide seamless inter-entity service would tend to
make it harder for third-party competitors to win these markets. Co-operation also has
advantages in regional markets in that ‘going it alone’ by each Entity company from the
relatively small resource base of each may well be to the advantage other, larger regional train
operating companies. It is worth noting that each company should have a strong incentive to
maximize its productivity and efficiency whether they choose to compete or to co-operate.




46
  There is currently a degree of co-operation between ŽFBH and ŽRS at boundary stations and some
through-running of locomotives and crews by agreement.

D.1.1   BHŽJK and Entity Infrastructure Management Companies
Upon adoption of the EU model, the physical interface between the two infrastructure
management companies will become less important than the economic interface. The
challenge will be to ensure mutually advantageous coordination of Network Statements, train
control performance standards and track access charges. On the one hand, this is only one
instance of the difficult challenge of harmonizing track access charges through this region
where track access charges already differ markedly. But on the other hand, the better
coordinated are the two parts of BiH’s railway network, the better positioned they will both be
to support their train operator customers to attract traffic from road to rail transport and
from other international routes to routes transiting through BiH.

The inter-entity Agreement that established the Bosnia and Herzegovina Railway
Corporation provides the most immediate channel for seeking the necessary co-
ordination between the two infrastructure management companies. BHŽJK is a joint-
structure between the entities and between their railways, with the fundamental purpose of
furthering co-operation to facilitate railway traffic as well as harmonizing infrastructure
standards and infrastructure access charges, and allocating train paths for inter-entity and
international traffic. Although BHŽJK does not now perform all these functions it could do so.
When the two infrastructure management companies are in place BHŽJK could, at a minimum,
provide the technical resource and institutional forum for the Entity infrastructure managers
to agree on key aspects of network statements where the two companies should be
harmonized to mutual benefit. The Entities might also wish to consider institutionally
strengthening BHŽJK’s role in the allocation of routes and the determination of charges for
access to infrastructure as defined in the EU Directives and the agreement for BHŽJK’s
establishment.

A key role of BHŽJK is to ensure ways to improve inter-entity and international railway
traffic and co-ordinate railway companies with the international requirements and
investments. BHŽJK coordinates actions and investments to improve the efficiency on the
two international lines, Corridor 5c (Mostar ~ Slavonski Samac) and the line Zagreb ~ Banja
Luka ~ Doboj ~ Tuzla ~Zvornik. It was mandated to manage loans and grants from international
lenders and act as a common international railway representative of the Entities and the
railway sector in Bosnia and Herzegovina, respecting the particular membership of the railway
companies in international organizations.

An alternative existing in theory, but probably not in practice, would be for Entities to
cede to BHŽJK the role of BiH Infrastructure Manager with the Entity networks being
geographic divisions or subsidiaries. Combining the two infrastructure management
companies in this way would have some theoretical attractions in co-ordination terms but
from a practical viewpoint the potential benefits of merger may be elusive. For example, in
theory, the most obvious administrative efficiencies from merger would be by the replacement
of the two existing railway management centers (Sarajevo and Doboj) by either one or the
other, but the political complications make any such decision unlikely. Similarly, decisions on
issues such as labor restructuring, workshop rationalization to fewer locations or the location
of network investments might be complicated rather than simplified by having two
shareholders with conflicting interests. Improvements in efficiency are urgent in both railways,
and while they would be mutually beneficial to the BiH transport system they are not
interdependent in terms of implementation.

D.2. The Role of the Rail Regulatory Board
The regulatory capacity and effectiveness of BiH Rail Regulatory Board (RRB) will be
critical to the future of railways in BiH. The RRB believes it is sufficiently empowered under
the BiH Railway Law (2005) to perform licensing, economic regulation, safety regulation and
other functions compatible with the EU railway acquis. Directive 2012/34/EU establishing a
single European railway area provides that ‘the efficient management and fair and non-
discriminatory use of rail infrastructure require the establishment of a regulatory body that
oversees the application of the rules set out in the Directive and acts as an appeal body… also
that the regulatory body should be able to enforce its information requests and decisions by
means of appropriate penalties’.
The RRB already performs a range of BiH-wide licensing, regulatory and safety functions
under its legislation. RRB publishes various authorizations, instructions and rulebooks in
conformity with the EU acquis. However since the rail market in BiH is currently essentially
closed in both entities, the day to day regulatory tasks of RRB with regard to economic
regulation are correspondingly narrowed. There is also a question regarding the independence
of RRB as it is established within the BiH Ministry of Communications and Transport and
reports through one Director to the Minister. But in BiH, ownership of infrastructure managers
and government/railway contracts (such as for infrastructure development and passenger
services) are with entity governments, so in practice RRB is substantially independent of those
being regulated.  

The regulatory burden implicit in the EU rail acquis is substantial and when the railway
market in BiH is opened, the actual regulatory tasks of RRB will be fully performed.
Among other tasks RRB will, under Article 56 of Directive 2012/34, need to (in summary):
monitor the Network Statements of the FBH and RS infrastructure management companies
to ensure they do not contain discriminatory clauses or create discretionary powers for the
infrastructure managers that may be used to discriminate against applicants; ensure that
charges set by each of the infrastructure managers are compliant with Directives and are non-
discriminatory; supervise any negotiations between applicants for infrastructure access and
the entity infrastructure managers concerning the level of infrastructure charges and
intervene if negotiations are likely to contravene the Directive; consider and decide on any
complaints and take action to remedy the situation; where appropriate, decide on appropriate
measures to correct discrimination against applicants, market distortion and any other
undesirable developments in these markets; be prepared to defend its decisions which will be
subject to judicial review; carry out audits or initiate external audits with entity infrastructure
managers, operators of service facilities and, where relevant, railway undertakings, to verify
compliance with accounting separation provisions; draw conclusions from the accounts
concerning state aid issues which it shall report to relevant BiH authorities dealing with state
aid issues; regularly consult representatives of users of the rail freight and passenger transport
services and take into account their views on the rail market; as necessary, request relevant
information from the infrastructure manager, applicants and any third party involved within
BiH.




                                                73
                                   BiH Railways Policy Note


A good regulatory capacity and effectiveness is imperative to meet the EU acquis and
provide for market access. According to RRB, it is sufficiently empowered under the BiH
Railway Law (2005) to perform licensing, economic regulation, safety regulation and other
functions compatible with the EU railway acquis. It already performs a range of BiH-wide
licensing, regulatory and safety functions under its legislation. But when the railway market in
BiH is opened, the actual economic regulatory tasks will include the access to the network and
track access charges. Although the BiH railway sector is smaller than many in the EU, it also
has a bigger freight market than many and two international SEETO Comprehensive Network
freight routes of wider regional significance (north-south Corridor Vc and east-west route 9a).
Moreover, RRB will effectively be regulator of two entity rail markets, two infrastructure
managers and access administration and pricing issues pertaining to two separately-owned
and managed networks. Although the number of access applications to BiH railway
infrastructure may be limited, the RRB will still need to ensure compliance of the Network
Statements and access regime and charges to ensure that the market conditions for any such
application are adequate and appropriate. Moreover, under the 4th railway Package the task of
monitoring compliance is likely to be increased, particularly in structures that do not have a
clear institutional separation between infrastructure manager and transport operator (see
Annex V).




D.3. Railway infrastructure investment funding
Transport investments in BiH are disproportionate towards roads, particularly given the
predominant role that railways play in freight transport. Since 2005 the government of BiH
have accessed loans from EIB and EBRD that together provided about EUR 160 million for
investment in the railways but more than EUR 500 million for the road sector. While there is
clear need for investments in the road sector, such imbalance leaves the railways with limited
resources for investments. Adopting a multimodal approach to investment planning and/or
raising additional investment funding for railways could help ensure that the balance is based
on a proper comparative evaluation of projects and programs across modes.

D.3.1 Adopting a multimodal approach to investment planning
There is a multiplicity of interrelationships between the various modes of transport.
Roads, railways, aviation and navigation can be alternatives in specific markets but can be
complementary in others. Competition and complementarity both have a part to play in
transport markets. Investment projects need to take into consideration the interaction
between the different transport modes, their competitive advantage in serving the demand
for freight and passengers, their role in the economy and impact on the environment.

There is an international trend to move from budget earmarked funds by individual
transport sub-sector to a multimodal investment planning approach. While the traditional
approach implies often that planning, prioritization and budgeting are prepared by mode-
specific agencies and rely on earmarked funds such as fuel levy for roads or state budget for
railways, there is an international trend towards a multimodal approach for planning and
budgeting. The multimodal approach implies that investment prioritization scrutinizes and
may combine all transport modes and that budget is considered as a common resource
irrespective of the source.


                                              74
                                     BiH Railways Policy Note


Successful approaches have been applied to planning, approval and funding of transport
infrastructure in Europe. For example, Germany prepares a multiannual “Federal Transport
Infrastructure Plan” taking into account the total level of funding available for the rail, road
and waterway modes for a 15 years period with regular reviews and updates. Projects are
prioritized according to their priority level, where highest priority is given to ongoing projects.

French transport infrastructure funds for roads have been significantly rebalanced in
favor of rail and public transport. Following the adoption of the ‘Grenelle de l’Environnement’
the latest National Transport Infrastructure Plan (SNIT for the French acronym) sets as goals
to (i) optimize the existing system to limit the creation of new infrastructure, (ii) improve the
performance of the system in serving areas away from the major metropolitan areas, (iii)
improve the energy efficiency of the system, and (iv) reduce the environmental impact of the
system. Transport planning and investment looks across all modes and integrates a high level
of public participation in the selection process.

Sector plan integration represents a compromise between single sector and multimodal
approaches. Between individual modal plans and integrated multimodal planning and funding
scheme there is a range of possible approaches found in many countries in the regions such as
Croatia, Bulgaria and Romania. These countries adopted a Master Plan which at a minimum is
just a combination of different sector plans into a single document but can begin to make
trade-offs between the different sector plans when overall budgets are constrained.
Representing real progress in planning and responding to an EU condition to receive funds,
such approach does not necessarily bring all the benefits of an integrated multimodal planning
in particular in regard to multimodal prioritization and funding.

Implementation of multimodal planning approach in Bosnia could lead to an alternative
allocation of network infrastructure development funds between roads and railways. A
multimodal approach in planning and financing transport infrastructure could put in
perspective the comparative advantage of the railways, their critical role in Bosnia’s freight
movements and environmental benefits. It could lead to a capital allocation towards railways.
This is not to make specific recommendation for such reallocation but to create a transport
budgetary approach that would enable decision-makers objectively to make such reallocation
if such case were substantiated.

D.3.2 Raising additional investment funding for railways
Another and possibly complementary policy consists in raising additional funds that can
be allocated to the railways. Such approach can either be applied under the current sector
planning approach as dedicated funds for the railways or under a multimodal planning
approach discussed earlier raising additional funds to be invested in all transport modes, but
leading to higher investment resources for railways.

There a number of possible options for raising additional funds for transport
investments. Traditional approaches include fuel taxes, classic road tolls, electronic distance-
based tolling, vehicle registration and licensing fees, and freight related fees. In particular, fuel
levies and electronic distance-based tolling have been successfully applied in Europe to raise
additional funds for transport investments. However, each mechanism has its advantages and
disadvantages and must be studied in detail before any attempt of implementation.




                                                 75
                                  BiH Railways Policy Note


Electronic distance-based tolling is seen as a fair and acceptable way of charging for the
use of road infrastructure. Electronic distance-based tolling can be applied for specific types
of vehicles, on specific types of roads, can be modulated according to the level of pollution
emission of the vehicles and can be associated to speed restriction controls. In Bulgaria, a
recent World Bank study recommended that e-tolling should be applied only for heavy vehicles
by means of an on board unit registering data based on GNSS and e-vignette for light vehicles
covering all national road classes. Such system would generate revenues per year ranging from
EUR 300 mi to EUR 750 M from 2018 according to the rates applied.

Many countries are currently shifting from the traditional use of fuel levy to finance
roads, to a broader application of funds covering the entire transport sector. In France,
while the fuel levy finances the multimodal transport plan, the regions have the freedom to
apply an additional tax to fund water and rail transport. Higher fuel prices are viewed as
incentives to reduce fuel consumption, e.g. through purchase and use of more fuel efficient
vehicles, a shift to non-motorized or public transport modes, fewer trips, and less motorized
transport-orientated patterns of settlements. Differentiated fuel taxes can stimulate a shift
towards cleaner fuels, for example electricity or sustainable biofuels.




D.4. Towards an Action Plan
A preliminary roadmap was provided by the Government of Republika Srpska in the
options presented in this note.

Railways Structural Alternatives

The Government of Republika Srpska wishes to maintain an integrated railways structure for
the time being. RS Government considers that before deciding on the final company structure,
it is imperative to improve its efficiency. The RS Government wishes however to implement
account separation from infrastructure, freight and passenger activities and implement Public
Service Obligations Contracts for passenger services.



Railways Industry Options



Employment and productivity
The RS Government wishes to initiate, with support from the WB, a labor restructuring
process.



Rail Passenger Services
The envisaged option consists in identifying the most promising segments for passenger
transport and provide services under Public Service Obligations Contracts to the level that can
be afforded by the Entity. In addition, following the new RS Railways Law, the local
governments will be able to provide financial contribution to service provision where there
require it.

                                   BiH Railways Policy Note




Contestability of the freight market
The RS Government wishes to delay the market opening to allow for efficiency improvement
of the Entity owned railways operator.



Investment in railways infrastructure
Priority investments are being identified by RS Government to complement on-going
investments and projects to be financed by the European institutions. The focus is to articulate
infrastructure, train control and rolling stock investments to ensure an optimal use of the
railways.



World Bank stands ready to work with the Entity Governments to identify a detailed
Action Plan to bring about the desired transformation of the railway industry. Such Plans
would be pursued with each Entity individually, reflecting the fact that their structural and
policy choices may well differ. However, it would also be important to ensure that such Action
Plans cohere with the overall policy and institutional framework in BiH to provide the most
beneficial adaptation of the EU railway acquis for BiH as a whole.

ANNEX I: Current legal and institutional framework
I.1    Main Institutions
The railway network and train operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina are governed by the
Railway Law of Bosnia and Herzegovina and by Railway Laws of two Entities, Federation of
Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republic of Srpska. The Railway Law of Bosnia and Herzegovina
applies to the railway sector within the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, while the railway
law of each Entity applies within that Entity to construction and maintenance of railway
network, train operations, safety of railway transport, and establishment and management of
each Entity-owned public railway company.

Most governance functions in the railway sector are vested in the Entities. The Ministry of
Communications and Transport of Bosnia and Herzegovina performs specific but limited roles
at the state level. The Entity governments are majority (though not exclusive) owners of the
railway system located within the Entity, and are responsible for its policy framework,
performance oversight, and budgetary support. The Railway Public Corporation (BHŽJK) is
intended to harmonize railway sectors at the inter-entity level.

I.2    BiH Law on Railways (2005) and Railway Regulatory Board

The Law on Railways of Bosnia and Herzegovina, adopted by the Parliament in June 2005 and
issued in August 2005, comprises 28 articles. As the law was intended broadly to reflect
European Union (EU) directives for railways, it provides for a degree of separation between
railway transport services and infrastructure management, for a License and a Safety
Certificate for train operators, the establishment of a Railway Regulatory Board, and
introduction of the concept of a track access fee.

The law indicates that its purposes are to ensure the development of a sound railway transport
system with effective competition among train operators and with other transport modes, to
ensure non-discriminatory access to railway infrastructure, to encourage efficient and
transparent management of the railway sector, to follow prevailing international practices and
applicable directives of the European Union, to promote a safe and efficient railway transport
system, and to ensure fair and efficient regulatory decisions.

Article 4 sets out the principles of railway transport and railway infrastructure management
as follows:
   i.   railway transport services shall be distinguished from railway infrastructure;
  ii.   a train operator shall be granted an appropriate license and a safety certificate to
        provide rail transport services; and
 iii.   an infrastructure manager shall be authorized a permit to manage public railway
        infrastructure.

Railway Regulatory Board

Articles 5 to 10 describe the roles, the organization and functions of the Railway Regulatory
Board (RRB) of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The RRB is established within the Ministry of
Communications and Transport of Bosnia and Herzegovina and reports through one Director
to the Minister. The Law gives RRB powers to:

          i.     enact regulations and control the railway sector regarding EU directives;
         ii.     issue, comply and revoke Licenses for a train operation, Safety Certificates for a
                 train operator and Permits for an infrastructure manager;
        iii.     issue instructions for the safety and interoperability of the railway system, monitor
                 compliance with such instructions and approve railway equipment with respect to
                 safety and interoperability; and
        iv.      conduct inspections and investigations about railway accidents.
The RRB reports annually to the Minister of Communications and Transport of Bosnia and
Herzegovina on the overall operations and safety of the railway sector.

Licenses, Safety Certificate and Permit

The RRB has powers to license rail transport services and infrastructure management. Article
12 regulates conditions that each applicant train operator must meet to obtain a license,
including financial soundness, adequate insurance coverage, good reputation with no history
of bankruptcy and no serious criminal offence, and professional competence and technical
equipment, including quality rolling stock.

Article 13 requires the train operator also to obtain a Safety Certificate requiring that:

   i.         the activities shall be organized in such a way that damages to personal property or
              injuries are prevented or mitigated;
  ii.         an internal safety instruction is consistent with the safety instructions issued by the
              RRB;
 iii.         safety related duties should be allocated to suitably qualified employees, who have had
              regular medical examinations to check their ability to perform duties allocated;
 iv.          the train operator should have a procedure to report all accidents to the RRB in timely
              fashion.
Article 14 requires the infrastructure manager to meet the following conditions to obtain a
Permit for managing railway infrastructure:

   i.         its main office should be located in the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina,
  ii.         the senior managers have not been convicted of a serious criminal offence and have not
              seriously or repeatedly violated any applicable laws governing customs, social security
              or employment,
 iii.         it has the ability to meet liabilities in the next 12 months,
 iv.          it should have skilled staff to implement its functions and responsibilities, particularly
              the train traffic control and maintenance and modernization of the railway
              infrastructure,

                                                     80
                              BiH Railways Policy Note - Annexes


  v.    it must fulfill the safety and technical requirements for organizing and regulating
        railway traffic control, which is regulated by the RRB.
Applicants who fulfil the conditions obtain a License, a Safety Certificate or a Permit from the
RRB, issued for a 5-year period with a possibility of extension. The RRB annually reviews the
conditions imposed on a License, a Safety Certificate or a Permit and monitors a change
affecting the legal status of a train operator or an infrastructure manager such as a merger or
a takeover, or significant changes or extension of activities. Article 16 requires a train operator
to ensure transparency in its finances, including all financial compensation or aid paid by the
Entity and separate accounts for passenger and freight transport services.

A License for train operation may be revoked in the following cases:

   i.   the train operator does not meet any of conditions for the License,
  ii.   the train operator ceases to provide rail transport services for more than 3 months,
 iii.   any legal proceedings have been started to liquidate the train operator actions.
A Safety Certificate may be revoked if the train operator does not comply with the conditions
for the Certificate or ceases to provide rail transport services for more than 3 months and has
confirmed that it has no intention of restarting the services.

A Permit for the infrastructure manager may be revoked if the infrastructure manager does
not comply with the conditions.

Management of Public Railway Infrastructure

Articles 19 to 23 regulate the management of the railway infrastructure. The law states that
infrastructure management shall be separated from providing railway transport services. In
terms of accounting, an infrastructure manager is required to ensure the transparency of
revenues and expenditures and to record activities by international accounting standards.
Also, the annual financial statements must be audited by an independent auditing firm. The
functions of the infrastructure manager include the issuance of the network statement, the
maintenance and modernization of the infrastructure, the organization and regulation of the
railway traffic control on the tracks, the granting of access to railway infrastructure for train
operators, the allocation of train paths for all types of traffic, and the participation in the
determination and collection of the infrastructure fees.

Track access are required to be granted in a non-discriminatory manner and be based on a
track access contract with a train operator, which contract regulates the mutual rights and
obligations of train operator and infrastructure manager, the designated capacity and the
infrastructure usage fees, and matters related to safety and environmental protection.
According to the Article 23, a train operator can appeal to the RRB if it is not treated equally
or has conflicts with an infrastructure manager as regards the infrastructure capacity
allocation, the network statement, the infrastructure usage fees or the track access contract.

According to the Law the governing bodies of the infrastructure manager shall be the
Supervisory Board and Management. The Supervisory Board decides the annual budget and

                                                81
                             BiH Railways Policy Note - Annexes


the four year business plan, develops guidelines and policies to the Director regarding
performance of activities and management, appoints Directors, and approves the organization
and any borrowing proposed by the Director. The Supervisory Board shall be appointed in
accordance with the law governing the establishment and operations of public companies. The
Management will be composed of a Director appointed by the Supervisory Board and
Executives appointed by the Director. Main assignments of the Director are preparation of the
four year business plan, the yearly budget and the organization, recommendations to the
Supervisory Board, implementation of the adopted four year business plan, issuance of
business policies, management of business activities and programs, and proposal of financial
borrowings.

I.3    FBH Railway Law (2001) and status of FBH Railways
Law on Railways of FBH (2001)

The Law on Railways of Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina regulates railway transport in
that Entity, establishes the Entity railway company (ŽFBH) and relations between Bosnia and
Herzegovina Railway Public Corporation (BHŽJK) and the ŽFBH.

The law gives the ŽFBH monopolistic status as the only manager of railway infrastructure in
FBH. It requires the work of the ŽFBH to be performed professionally and in market-oriented
way with business efficiency and technological progress, specifying that the objectives of the
company are: internal and international railway transport; maintaining, modernization and
building of railway infrastructure; and services related to the railway traffic.

In terms of vertical separation and competition, the law adopts some similar articles to the BiH
law. Firstly, the article implies that competition in the railway market through entry of a new
company is possible though ŽFBH, which is also a railway operator, decides whether a new
company can use railway infrastructure or not. According to the law, the ŽFBH shall allow
approved operators access to railway infrastructure without discrimination if operators
accept designated railway routes and pay an adequate infrastructure fee to ŽFBH. An
approved operator needs to acquire the requisite License and pay fees for infrastructure use.
The law states that the fees for infrastructure use are determined by the BHŽJK.

In addition, the law mandates accounting separation (but no other degree of separation)
between infrastructure management and transport operations. Accounting separation is the
lowest degree of vertical separation but can provide greater financial transparency and help
facilitate further structural separation.

The law emphasizes that the ŽFBH is to be operated on the basis of market principles to earn
profits. In practice, many other political influences constrain this outcome. The FBH
government has various rights of control over ŽFBH including consenting to Articles of
Incorporation, appointing and dismissing the members of Managing Board, approving annual
and development plans and business reports, providing funding for maintenance of
infrastructure and passenger transport.

The law provides a basis of compensation by the Entity government and Cantons to reimburse
ŽFBH for loss-making railway passenger services. However, there is no specification of
contract form, scale of compensation by the Entity government, or how to calculate the

                                              82
                             BiH Railways Policy Note - Annexes


amount of compensation other than as ŽFBH itself estimates the difference between overall
costs of transportation and revenues gained.

In 2012, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina has adopted amendments to the Law on
Railways of FBiH, published in the Official Gazette of FBiH, issue No. 25/12 whose objective
was for the FBiH Railways to continue their operations as a limited liability company. The
amendments reduced the number of members of the Supervisory Board (Management Board)
from 11 to 7, and a new article was added, Article 21a, according to which the company is under
obligation to act in compliance with the decisions of the Regulatory Board as determined in the
Law on Railways of BiH.



Status of ŽFBH

ŽFBH is an Entity-owned joint stock company, with minor shareholders owning 9 percent of
shares. As a vertically integrated railway company responsible for train operation and railway
infrastructure management, ŽFBH provides railway transport services for passengers and
freight on domestic and international lines; maintenance, modernization and construction of
rolling stock for transport services; and maintenance, modernization and development of
railway infrastructure.

The organizational structure has a Managing Board and the Managerial Body. The Managing
Board of the company has nine members: three representatives of the FBH government; three
representatives of service users; and three representatives of the company’s employees. The
Managing Board is intended to make decisions on adopting development and business plans,
establishment of other associations, buying shares, profit-sharing, and regarding investments.
It also appoints the Managerial Body with the concurrence of the FBH government.

The Managerial Body ŽFBH is composed of the Director General (the Chief Executive Officer)
and four Executive Directors for operations, infrastructure, economic affairs, and legal affairs
and human resources. The company has five regional offices in Sarajevo, Mostar, Zenica, Tuzla
and Bihać for train operations and infrastructure management.

I.4     The RS Railway Laws (2001 and 2016) and status of ŽRS
Law on Railways of Republic of Srpska (2001)

The law regulates construction and maintenance of railway infrastructure, management of
railway vehicles, railway transport, safety and working conditions.

The law provides the basis of the establishment of the Railways of Republic of Srpska (ŽRS)
vertically integrated as an infrastructure manager and a public railway transport operator. The
law guarantees ŽRS exclusivity in rail infrastructure management and that the Entity provides
the funds for construction and maintenance of railway infrastructure from its budget.

The law allows ŽRS to establish new companies to perform its activity efficiently. ŽRS may
also borrow on its own account and issue securities. It requires accounting separation between
infrastructure and train operations. As infrastructure manager, ŽRS is to ensure access of
train operators to railway infrastructure without discrimination. However, the Entity gives
ŽRS a right to utilize the whole railway property. The law does not include regulations about
authorization of new railway companies to enter the railway market and does not deal with
track access regime or contracts for new operating companies to access the rail network.

                              BiH Railways Policy Note - Annexes


The law has many articles related to the standard and structure of railways and safety
including intersection of railways and roads, and management and safety of rolling stock. The
law also regulates the organization of railway transport, railway traffic management,
signalization system and obligations in emergency situations. Other articles are related to
railway workers, including professional training and examination, entitlement to drive a
traction vehicle, health conditions, working hours, duties and responsibilities of workers and
security measures.

Draft Law on Railways of Republic of Srpska (2016)

The draft law was published on the website of the Ministry of Transport and Communication
on March 2016. The main objective of the draft law is to harmonize the railway law with the
EU rail acquis. The draft law also proposes to restructure ZRS to promote its financial stability,
and for the railway network to be integrated into the European network.

The draft law contains various articles related to principles of railway transport, roles and
responsibilities of the government and the infrastructure manager, and train operations.
Firstly, the draft law divides roles of the entity government, the infrastructure manager and
the train operator, introducing vertical separation in railway transport. The Ministry of
Transport and Communication (MOTC) develops policies for railway infrastructure including
the interoperability of railways (Article 3). The infrastructure manager prepares each annual
program of construction, reconstruction and maintenance of infrastructure (Article 4),
regulates railway transport providers, provides railway infrastructure to train operators and
protects public railway infrastructure (Article 5). The infrastructure management and train
operations should be separated functionally. The law states the railway infrastructure is
owned by the Entity and managed by the only infrastructure manager in RS, which is ZRS. The
infrastructure manager should separate its financial accounting from the train operation
(Article 8). The train operator should have a license to use railways from the infrastructure
manager and a safety certificate issued by the RRA. The infrastructure manager’s investment
program should be approved by the government (Article 9).

Secondly, the draft law introduces similar articles to those of the railways law on Bosnia and
Herzegovina for infrastructure management and train operations. The infrastructure manager
has responsibility to provide the railway for continuous and safe use and can suspend the use
of the railway with government approval if a train operation for passenger or freight becomes
unprofitable. The railway infrastructure can be used by any registered train operator which
holds a license to transport and a certificate for safety. The train operator should contract for
the use of railway infrastructure with the infrastructure manager four months before the
effective date of the new timetable. The infrastructure manager publishes the Network
Statement which includes general provision, terms and conditions for using use railways,
technical characteristics, principles of allocation of infrastructure capacity, types of services
and infrastructure charges.

Articles 20 to 26 indicate the infrastructure user fees as compensation for, at a minimum,
application processing costs, track access and the use of other railway facilities. However, the
draft law does not include principles for calculating these charges; or for calculating subsidies
from the government to support infrastructure maintenance in the case of shortfall of

                                               85
                               BiH Railways Policy Note - Annexes


revenues from infrastructure fees. As regards railway infrastructure, Articles 27 to 36 regulate
the construction, maintenance and capacity improvement of railways and Articles 37 to 68
regulate standards and management of railway track and facilities.

Thirdly, the draft law regulates train operations and safety. The transport of passengers and
goods on the railway can be performed by a public operator holding a license for transport, and
a certificate for safety of transport, based on market principles and railway infrastructure use
contracts (Article 69). The conditions for a license to be issued by the government include good
reputation, financial ability, competence and civil responsibility. Article 79 introduces the
concept of the public service obligations which can be defined by criteria like the existence of
public interest, the availability of other transport modes, the cost of replacement by other
transport modes and ability of train operators. The obligation and compensation for the public
service are regulated by the contract between the government and train operators.

Additionally, the draft categorizes the railway lines into main lines, regional lines and local lines
(Article 38), and railway transport into international, regional, suburban and urban passenger
transport (Article 78). However, the articles do not suggest the reason for categorization of
railway lines and transport, not referring, for example, to any differences in infrastructure fees
or conditions for licenses.

The draft law tries to introduce similar articles with the BiH railway law in terms of separation
of infrastructure management and train operations, and the permit and license system.
However, the draft law of the Entity may conflict with the national law because the latter gives
the power to authorize the infrastructure manager and train operator to the RRB (Railway
Regulatory Board) and the draft law of RS gives the powers to the Entity government. The
2016 draft law does not have articles related to the organization and functions of ZRS. It is
possible that the ZRS would remain as an integrated organization because the draft only
requires accounting separation between infrastructure management and train operation. The
law also does not state detailed procedures for a new train operator to enter the railway
market other than the general right previously mentioned.

To conclude, the draft law focuses on harmonization with the EU rail acquis but does not
provide any blueprint for corporate structural reform or change to ZRS. It is possible that a
separate legislative instrument would be needed for fundamental changes in organizational
structure.



Status of the ŽRS

ŽRS is a majority Entity-owned, vertically integrated joint stock company. Some 65 percent
of shares are owned by the Entity, 10 percent by an Entity Pension Fund, 5 percent by the
Restitution Fund of RS, and 20 percent by private shareholders. The private ownership of the
stocks was obtained by a voucher offer or subsequent trading on the Stock Exchange.

The company is responsible for both train operation and railway infrastructure management
and provides the following services:

       transport services for passengers and freight in domestic and international traffic;

                                                86
                                BiH Railways Policy Note - Annexes


         traction of trains and maintenance of locomotives, electric multiple units and vehicles;
         maintenance of railway tracks and technical surveillance of tracks; and
         maintenance of devices and facilities related to the railway.

ŽRS is empowered to raise income from operations, the Entity budget, financial loans, issuing
and trade of securities, and investments of domestic and foreign persons. In practice, the
company generally depends on commercial revenues (dominated by freight income) and Entity
budget support for its operations, and loans from International Financial Institutions for its
investments.

The company has a Director General and four Executive Directors for infrastructure, railway
operations, economy affairs, legal affairs and human resources.

I.5       Bosnia and Herzegovina Railways Public Corporation
Background of Establishment

The Bosnia and Herzegovina Railways Public Corporation (BHŽJK) was established on the basis
of ‘the agreement between the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republic of Srpska
on the establishment of a joint railway public corporation as part of transportation corporation
(the Agreement on the Establishment)’ and in response to Annex 9 of the General Framework
Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina (1995). The Agreement on the Establishment
stated that the Entities intended to institutionalize cooperation to permit a smooth, safe and
regular inter-Entity and international railway traffic, a condition of international assistance to
restore railway transport.

Mandates and Functions

The establishing Agreement empowers BHŽJK to harmonize train operations between Entities
by adopting suitable standards of railway network and rolling stock and exercising measures
to protect inter-entity train operations. Article 3 states that BHŽJK shall examine and decide
upon the following issues:

         the allocation of train paths for inter-entity and international traffic, and the
          establishment, publication and dissemination of inter-entity timetables;
         the harmonization of signaling, safety, telecommunications and other systems and of
          the rules and criteria used on the railway network of two Entities;
         the harmonization and determination of infrastructure fees, reflecting the transport
          policy for the different types of traffic and the maintenance cost of the railway
          infrastructure;
         the settling of accounts between railway companies as to the division of income
          collected between operations and infrastructure;
         the overall supervision of the compliance by the various actors involved in railway
          infrastructure and/or operations with the regulations on inter-entity and international
          traffic.




                                                87
                             BiH Railways Policy Note - Annexes


BHŽJK was also required to examine ways to improve inter-entity and international railway
traffic and co-ordinate railway companies with the international requirements for efficient
traffic on the two lines, Corridor 5c (Mostar ~ Slavonski Samac) and the line Zagreb ~ Banja
Luka ~ Doboj ~ Tuzla ~Zvornik. It was mandated to manage loans and grants from international
lenders and act as a common international railway representative of the Entities and the
railway sector in Bosnia and Herzegovina, respecting the particular membership of the railway
companies in international organizations. However, as a matter of practice, each Entity railway
is a separate member of the International Union of Railways.

Organization

The Management Board is composed of three members appointed by the Board of Directors,
the General Manager for administration and finances, the Deputy General Manager for
operations and the Deputy General Manager for infrastructure. BHŽJK headquarters are in
Sarajevo, but corresponding departments of two Deputy General Managers are located in
Doboj. Article 4 specifies the Board of Directors to be composed of the following 12 members:
6 ex-officio members; 3 representatives elected by the main railway trade union; and 3
members designated to represent railway customers. The Board of Directors determines the
policy and rules of the BHŽJK, adopts the budget, and approves the financial statement.
Budgetary sources of the BHŽJK are set out to include part of infrastructure fees from the
railway companies and subsidies paid by the Entities.

Figure I.3 Organization of BHŽJK




Relationship between the BHŽJK and Railway Companies of Entities

Article 8 of the Establishment Agreement sets out the relationship between the BHŽJK and
the railway companies BHŽJK and provides that the Entities shall take whatever measures are
necessary so that their railway companies, and particularly the infrastructure managers, act

                                              88

in conformity with the decisions of BHŽJK, maintain the railway infrastructure up to the
standards required by the regulations issued by the Institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina,
and abstain from taking any action that may be detrimental to railway traffic between the
Entities. BHŽJK- The allocation of train paths for inter-entity and international traffic, in a
non-discriminatory manner

- The harmonization of signaling, safety, telecommunications and other systems on the
railway network of the two Entities

- The setting of accounts between railway companies

- Allocation and managing with donations that are donated or borrowed

I.6     EU-Bosnia Stabilization and Association Agreement (2015)
The Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) signed by EU member states and Bosnia
and Herzegovina (BiH) aims to support the country towards becoming a member of the EU by
integrating BiH into the mainstream of Europe and improving its status to fulfil criteria set for
EU membership by the European Council. The Agreement identifies priorities for action to
support efforts of BiH to integrate more closely with the European Union and develop trade
and investment, economic restructuring and modernization.

PROTOCOL 3 on land transport

Article 59, Protocol 3, lays down the rules on land transport applicable to the relationship
between BiH and EU members. The scope of the protocol covers transport infrastructure,
market access, essential legal and administrative supporting measures, cooperation in
developing a transport system in alignment with environmental needs, and a regular exchange
of information on the development of the transport policies.

Articles 7 to 10 of Protocol 3 relate to rail and combined transport. The Parties agree to adopt
mutually coordinated measures for the development and promotion of environmentally-
friendly rail and combined goods transport. The Protocol suggests development of combined
transport of goods 47 by development or building of terminals, tunnel loading gauges
(dimensions that allow fully interoperable loaded intermodal freight wagons) and capacity as
the railway is modernized. The Parties recommend that their railways step up cooperation to
improve the quality and the safety of transport services. The Protocol provides for BiH to
encourage consignors to send freight by rail rather than road on a basis of fair competition
between modes, and for BiH to prepare the participation in the implementation and future
evolution of the Community acquis.

The Parties also agree to adopt mutually coordinated measures to develop a multi-modal
transport network for freight through BiH, particularly on Pan-European Corridor Vc and the
River Sava connection to Corridor VII. The EU may make financial contributions to
infrastructure works which may take the form of credit from the European Investment Bank

47
   In EU terms, intermodal or combined transport generally means the transport of goods between
Member States where the vehicle uses the road on the initial or final leg of the journey and, on the
other leg, rail or inland waterway or maritime services where this section exceeds 100 km as the crow
flies.


                                                 89
                              BiH Railways Policy Note - Annexes


and any other form of financing. The Parties also undertake to take all the steps necessary to
encourage the development of combined transport. The purpose of such measures is specified
to be:

   i.   to encourage the use of combined goods transport by users and consignors;

  ii.   to make combined transport competitive with road transport, in particular through the
        financial support of the Community or Bosnia and Herzegovina in the context of their
        respective legislation;

 iii.   to encourage the use of combined transport over long distances and to promote, in
        particular the use of swap bodies, containers and unaccompanied transport in general;

 iv.    to improve the speed and reliability of combined transport;

  v.    and, in general, take any other appropriate action.

Article 10 on the role of the railways states that, in connection with the respective powers of
the States and the railways, the Parties shall, in respect of both passenger and goods
transport, recommend that their railways:

   i.   step up cooperation, whether bilateral, multilateral or within international railway
        organizations, in all fields, with particular regard to the improvement of the quality and
        the safety of transport services;

  ii.   try to establish in common a system of organizing the railways so as to encourage
        consignors to send freight by rail rather than road, in particular for transit purposes,
        on a basis of fair competition and while leaving the user freedom of choice in this
        matter;

 iii.   prepare the participation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the implementation and future
        evolution of the Community acquis on the development of the railways.

Article 59 of the Agreement has provisions with regard to supply of transport services
between the European community and BiH to ensure unrestricted and non-discriminatory
transit traffic across BiH and the EU with progressive harmonization of the transport
legislation. BiH undertakes to adapt its legislation and administrative rules to those of the EU
in the transport field for mutual access to markets of the Parties and facilitation of the
movement of passengers and goods.

Article 106 provides that cooperation in the field of transport focuses on the Community
acquis, aiming at restructuring and modernizing the transport modes. Moreover, cooperation
between Parties is to improve the free movement of passengers and goods, enhance access to
the transport market and facilities, and support the development of multi-modal
infrastructure in connection with the main Trans-European networks, notably to reinforce
regional links in South East Europe (in line with the Memorandum of Understanding on the
development of the Core Regional Transport Network). The cooperation may facilitate
operating standards comparable to those in the Community, develop a transport system
compatible and aligned with the Community system and improve the protection of
environment in transport.

ANNEX II: Summary of EU acquis in the railways sector and status of
implementation in Bosnia and Herzegovina
II.1     The EU Rail Acquis
Market access developments in the European Union (then the European Community) railways
sector started in the late sixties with the elimination of exemption of the transport sector from
the application of competition rules48 and the issue of regulation of public service obligations
in transport by rail road and inland waterway, which should comply with the concepts of being
essential in order to provide adequate transport services, and with adequate financial
compensation to the operator. In 1970, the cases and circumstances under which state aid
would be compatible with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union were defined.

During the 1980’s and 1990’s the rail mode was losing market share to road transport,
impelling the Commission to launch a set of proposals to boost the railways market, aligned to
the 1985 Commission White Paper on completing the internal market. One of the proposals
led to the seminal Directive 91/440/EEC establishing some key principles for the sector:

    i.   accounts to be separated between rail infrastructure and train operations;
   ii.   public money for one of these sectors not to be used to cross-subsidize the other;
  iii.   the railways to be managed on a commercial basis, driven by market demand, and at
         arm’s length from government; and
  iv.    mandatory non-discrimination in access to railway infrastructure.


The member states were also required to address the problem of the historical debt of the
railway companies and to take all necessary measures to develop national railway
infrastructure. This directive was complemented in 1995 by Directive 95/18/EC on the
licensing of Railway Undertakings (basically, providers of rail transport services) 49 and
Directive 95/19/EC on the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of
charges.

II.2     The First EU Railways Package
Based on experience of the implementation of Directive 91/440, in 2001 the EC issued what is
known as the First Railway Package, to be implemented by the member states by March 15,
2003. It focused on introducing a wider competition framework for freight transport, initially
limited to the Trans-European Rail Freight Network (TERFN - representing 50 percent of EU
railway networks and 80 percent of traffic) and to be extended to the entire network in a later
stage. The Package also set the requirements concerning the relationship between the state
and the Infrastructure Manager, and between the Infrastructure Manager and Railway

48
   Exempting certain agreements, decisions and concerted practices from the application of Article
101(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
49
   A Railway Undertaking is any public or private undertaking licensed according to Directive
2012/34/EU, the principal business of which is to provide services for the transport of goods and/or
passengers by rail.




                                                  91
                              BiH Railways Policy Note - Annexes


Undertakings. It singled out some essential functions, such as granting licenses and deciding
on allocation and charges, which could not be carried out by any organization or firm providing
rail transport services. However, it still allowed vertically integrated companies to continue to
operate with accounting separation of infrastructure and train operations. It also required
separate accounting for freight and passenger services.

The components of the First Railway Package were: (i) Directive 2001/12 amending Directive
91/440, (ii) Directive 2001/13 amending Directive 95/18, and (iii) Directive 2001/14 for
infrastructure capacity allocation and charging, and safety certification.

Directive 2001/12/EC was designed to:

   i.   open the international rail freight market;
  ii.   establish a general framework for the development of European railways; and
 iii.   clarify the formal relationship between the State and the Infrastructure Manager and
        between the Infrastructure Manager and Railway Undertakings (railway operators).

Directive 91/440/EEC was designed to facilitate the adaptation of the Community railways
to the needs of the Single Market by ensuring management independence of Railway
Undertakings. Directive 2001/12/EC amended Directive 91/440/EEC by:

   i.   separating the management of railway operation and infrastructure from the
        provision of railway transport services;
  ii.   improving the financial structure of undertakings; and
 iii.   ensuring access to the networks of Member States for Railway Undertaking engaged
        in international intermodal transport of goods.

More specifically, Directive 2001/12/EC requires: the Infrastructure Manager must have
responsibility for its own management, administration and internal control, and must have
established a business plan that includes the investment program and that is designed so as
to ensure financial equilibrium and optimum use of infrastructure. Capacity allocation,
infrastructure licensing and charging must be undertaken by an organization that does not
provide transport operations to help assure non-discriminatory access to infrastructure.

The Member States must also ensure that compliance with safety standards are verified,
rolling stock and Railway Undertaking certified, and accidents investigated. Concerning the
financial statements of Railway Undertakings, revenues from Public Service Obligation (PSO)
must be shown distinctively and not be transferred to another item.

Directive 2001/13/EC sets out the conditions freight operators must meet to be granted a
license to operate services on the European rail network, and amends council Directive
95/18/EC. Directive 2001/13/EC states that the license-issuing body must be independent
from Railway Undertakings—and a Railway Undertaking can also refer to the commission if it
claims that the national requirements are applied in a discriminatory manner. In case of such
an appeal, the Commission must issue a statement.

Directive 2001/14/EC introduces a defined policy for capacity allocation and infrastructure
charging. It replaces Directive 95/19/EC. It defines the conditions for capacity allocation for
infrastructure capacity and management—and for access charge rules—and applies to the
entire network. According to the directive, the Infrastructure Manager must publish a Network
Statement that describes the condition and limitation of the network, details of the charging

                                               92
                             BiH Railways Policy Note - Annexes


scheme, rules governing the capacity allocation, and priority rules that apply in case of
conflicting demand. The Infrastructure Managers must also co-operate to ensure the
effectiveness of cross Member States transport operations.

Member States must also establish a charging framework and its specific rules. The calculation
of the charge and the collecting of that charge must be performed by the Infrastructure
Manager, which will receive the track access fees and will use them to fund its business. If the
Infrastructure Manager is not independent from a Railway Undertaking (that is, a service
operator), these functions other than the collection of the fees must to be performed by an
independent body. Finally, Member States must also establish an independent regulatory body
with the responsibility to receive claims and appeals to the decisions of the Infrastructure
Manager. This directive also introduces compulsory safety certificates for Railway
Undertaking.

II.3    The Second EU Railways Package
By the end of the transposition period in 2003, compliance with the First Package measures
was low. There were examples of absence of independence between Infrastructure Managers
and Railway Undertakings, as well as inadequate regulation of national authorities and of
setting of charges. In 2004, the Commission launched the Second Railways Package, providing
full liberalization of freight service access from 1st of January 2007 (by Directive 2004/51/EC,
replaced later by Directive 2012/34/EU). Increased competition and a small improvement in
modal share of rail freight has been observed since 2001.

The Second Railway Package also enhanced safety and interoperability, primarily by
establishing the European Railway Agency (ERA) to oversee technical standards on these
matters.

The components of the Second Railway Package are:

   i.   Directive 2004/51 further amending Directive 91/440;
  ii.   Directive 2004/49, the safety directive;
 iii.   Directive 2004/50 amending interoperability Directives 96/48 and 2001/16; and
 iv.    Regulation 881/2004 establishment of the ERA.

The Package also contains a recommendation covering the accession of the European
Community to the Intergovernmental Organization for International Carriage by Rail (COTIF).
The organization is responsible for further development of rail transport law in areas such as
contracts of carriage for the international carriage of passengers and goods and procedures
for the technical admission of railway vehicles and other railway material used in international
traffic; and for the removal of obstacles at international rail borders.

Directive 2004/49/EC (the Railway Safety Directive, now amended by Directive 2008/110/EC)
develops a common approach to rail safety. It lays down a clear procedure for granting the
safety certificates that every railway company must obtain before it can run trains on the EU
network. It harmonizes safety levels by, among other things, specifying what Infrastructure
Managers need to do in order to receive safety authorization.

It also obliges each Member State to establish binding national safety rules. Member States
must annually collect standard safety indicators and must establish a safety authority
independent from any Railway Undertaking, Infrastructure Manager, or applicant and


                                              93
                                BiH Railways Policy Note - Annexes


procurement entity in charge of issuing, renewing, and amending the safety certificates.
Moreover, Member States must also establish an investigating body independent from any
Railway Undertaking, Infrastructure Manager, or charging or allocating body. It must
investigate any serious accident and publish an annual report. Finally, any Railway Undertaking
must hold a standard safety certificate defined in the same directive, and any Infrastructure
Manager must obtain a safety authorization also defined in the same directive.

Directive 2004/50/EC amended Directives 96/48/EC and 2001/16/EC on the interoperability
of the European high speed and conventional rail systems respectively and is now updated by
Directive 2008/57/EC (the Interoperability Directive). This directive harmonizes and clarifies
interoperability requirements. These requirements concern the design, construction, placing
in service, upgrading, renewal, operation and maintenance of the parts of this system placed
in service after April 30, 2004, as well as the qualifications and health and safety conditions
of the staff who contribute to its operation.

Directive 2004/51/EC opens up both national and international freight services on the entire
EU network from 1 January 2007, and amends Directive 91/440/EEC. The Commission
expected these measures to lead to gains in terms of modal shift and the development of
international rail freight, and improve the efficiency of railways relative to other modes of
transport. The measures were also intended to facilitate sustainable transport between and
within Member States by encouraging competition and allowing entry of new enterprises.
Regulation (EC) 881/2004 (now amended by Regulation (EC) 1335/2008) sets up a steering
body to co-ordinate groups of technical experts seeking common solutions on safety and
interoperability. The Agency is a driving force in the policy for modernizing the European
railway sector. The range of often conflicting technical and security regulations among the
twenty-seven Member States handicap the development of the railway sector. The Agency will
work to gradually align these regulations and establish common safety objectives.

II.4    The Third EU Railways Package
The Third Railway Package was adopted in 2007, aimed at opening the market for
international passenger services by 2010, including rights of cabotage (the right to collect and
drop off passengers at any station, in any country). It also regulated the conditions for
awarding public service contracts50, granting exclusive right and/or compensation in exchange
for discharging PSOs. The duration of public service contracts was given upper thresholds by
the Regulation. It also established rules for the awarding of the passenger public service
contracts by means of transparent and non-discriminatory competitive procedures which
might be subject to negotiation. Low level or budget contracts were, however, exempt from
these rules. Member States should provide the Commission with all the information necessary
to determine whether the compensation allocated is compatible with this Regulation. Member
States were meant to implement the Regulation gradually, as the end of the transition period
was fixed at December 2019. This third package is composed of Directive 2007/58/EC,
Directive 2007/59/EC and Regulation (EC) 1371/2007.

Directive 2007/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of October 23, 2007
amends Council Directive 91/440/EEC on the development of the Community‘s railways and
Directive 2001/14/EC on the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of

50
  A public service contract is a written contract whereby a service provider provides services to a
contracting authority in return for pecuniary consideration.

                                                  94
                              BiH Railways Policy Note - Annexes


charges for the use of railway infrastructure. Railway Undertakings established in Member
States must by January 1, 2010 be granted the right of access to the infrastructure in all
Member States for the purpose of operating international passenger service. Railway
Undertakings must also in the course of an international passenger service have the right to
pick up passengers at any station located on the international route and set them down at
another, including stations that are located in the same Member State.

Directive 2007/59/EC lays down conditions and procedures for the certification of train crews
operating locomotives and trains. More specifically, it introduces an EU-wide driver license
allowing train drivers to circulate on the entire EU network (the certification of cross-border
drivers is foreseen as from 2009, and of all other drivers as from 2011). Drivers have to meet
basic requirements concerning their educational level, age, physical and mental health, specific
knowledge and practical training of driving skills. It also specifies the tasks for which the
competent authorities of the Member States, the train drivers and other stakeholders in the
sector, the Railway Undertakings, Infrastructure Managers and training centers are
responsible.

Regulation (EC) 1371/2007 on rail passengers' rights and obligations ensures basic rights for
passengers in such areas as insurance, ticketing, and passengers with reduced mobility. While
long-distance travelers will enjoy a wider range of rights, minimum quality standards will have
to be guaranteed to passengers on all lines. Regulation (EC) 1371/2007 establishes quality
standards in the following areas: non-discrimination toward handicapped travelers or persons
with reduced mobility; liability in case of accidents; availability of train tickets; and personal
security of passengers in stations. This regulation sets minimum requirements for information
to be provided to passengers relative to their journey, contract conditions, and the liability of
Railway Undertakings in cases of accidents, delays or cancellations of services.

II.5   Further developments and the Fourth Railway Package
In 2008, a recast of the texts concerning railway interoperability was made by Directive
2008/57/EC.50. The new Directive established the conditions to be met to achieve
interoperability within the Community rail system. In particular, it regrouped the procedures
for developing the technical specifications for interoperability concerning conventional and
high speed rail. It also clarified the relationship between the ERA’s Technical Specifications for
Interoperability (TSIs) and EU standards. The conditions encompass the design, construction,
placing in service, upgrading, renewal, operation and maintenance of the parts of this system
as well as the professional qualifications and health and safety conditions of the staff who
contribute to its operation and maintenance.

In 2010, following a European Parliament Resolution which stressed the shortcomings in the
application of the First Railway Package in the Member States and the lack of effectiveness of
its measures, the Commission made a proposal to recast the package. The purpose was to
improve the transparency of rail market access conditions and access to rail-related services
– for example, station, freight and maintenance facilities. A merging of the first three
Directives of the package was proposed, along with the clarification of some of the terminology
and an update for the legislation to accommodate new market conditions. In its turn, the
recast Directive, whose transposition time elapses in June 2015, is already subject to the
amendment proposals of the Fourth Railway Package.




                                               95
                              BiH Railways Policy Note - Annexes


The main objectives of the recast were largely focused on three areas: competition issues and
the need to improve transparency of the rail market access conditions; strengthening the
power of national rail regulators and establishing the obligation on these bodies to cooperate
with their counterparts on cross-border issues; and supporting the financial structure to
encourage investment. Directive 2012/34/EU54 is intended to complete the creation of a
single European railway area.

The efforts of the Commission to put forward proposals to enhance competition in the
transport sector had led to the adoption in 2011 of a new White Paper, conceived as a roadmap,
which included 40 concrete initiatives to create a true single European transport area through
a competitive and efficient transport system. For the railways sector, the major objectives
were the creation of an internal market for rail transport and an increase of the modal share
of rail transport in the market.

Despite earlier attempts of the Commission to establish an internal market for rail and improve
rail efficiency, the modal share of rail remained modest. This is partly due to comparative
economic advantage of road transport but also, according to the Commission, because of
obstacles to market entry in railways hampering competition and innovation, with insufficient
incentives for European and intermodal cooperation. With the Fourth Railway Package, the
Commission’s main goal is to remove obstacles to the efficient operation of Infrastructure
Managers, and thus complement the TEN-T policy, the new proposal for Connecting Europe
Facility (CEF) and the existing rules on Rail Freight Corridors (RFCs). The ultimate goals are: to
increase rail's capacity, efficiency and attractiveness for customers; to encourage modal shift
from road and air; and to complete the circle of market opening already achieved in the freight,
international passenger and other transport markets. The proposals of the Commission are
structured around a so-called technical pillar and a governance pillar.

The technical pillar covers updates to three important pieces of existing legislation. The aim
of the changes is to cut administrative costs for rail operators and make it easier for new
operators to enter the rail market. One of the main changes concerns the ERA. At the moment,
it plays a key role in promoting interoperability and harmonizing technical standards for the
whole EU market. However, national technical and safety rules remain alongside the EU ones
drafted by ERA, creating complexity for rail operators. The proposed revisions would make
ERA the sole body responsible for issuing vehicle authorizations and safety certificates across
the whole EU.

Alongside the changes in responsibilities for ERA, the 4th Railway Package also includes
updates to existing legislation on interoperability and rail safety. These changes aim to remove
the remaining administrative and technical barriers to the creation of a single European rail
area.

In addition to technical revisions, the governance pillar of 4th Railway Package proposes
reform in the areas of governance and market opening. These changes are covered in proposals
to update two existing pieces of legislation and to repeal a third legislative act which would be
incompatible with the changes. The aim is to open up domestic rail passenger markets to
competition, to attain improved quality and efficiency.

One of the main proposals is to introduce mandatory competitive tendering for public service
contracts for railways. This would make it easier for new companies and rail operators to enter



                                               96
                             BiH Railways Policy Note - Annexes


the market by offering competing commercial services or bidding for public service rail
contracts.

Alongside this, the governance pillar of the 4th Railway Package also proposes to strengthen
the governance of Infrastructure Managers. Infrastructure Managers and rail operators are
often still part of the same integrated structure, for example through holding company
arrangements. The proposed changes would separate Infrastructure Managers from rail
operators, except in specific circumstances where there are sufficient safeguards in place.

The European Council agreed on the proposals of the governance pillar on 8 October 2015. The
proposals will allow train companies non-discriminatory access to rail networks in all EU
countries to run domestic passenger services, either in open access or by bidding for public
service contracts.

The final trilogue meeting between representatives from the European Commission,
Parliament and Council concluded seven months of discussions to reach a compromise
between the amendments to the Commission’s draft legislation previously adopted by the
Parliament and Council. A provisional agreement was reached on April 19 2016. This was
subsequently endorsed by the Coreper committee of member state representatives on April
28, and formal ratification by both bodies is expected by autumn 2016.

The provisional agreement reached on April 19 aims to introduce a number of changes to the
proposals:

      to ensure impartiality of railway infrastructure managers, to guarantee non-
       discriminatory access to tracks for new railway companies, and to ensure better use
       of rail infrastructure;
      to improve financial transparency in order to remove the risk of cross-subsidy between
       infrastructure managers and transport operators;
      to open domestic rail passenger markets from 2020, so that railway operators can
       provide services across the EU. More competitive pressure is expected to lead to more
       frequent trains, and higher quality services better in tune with customer needs;
      more competition and performance targets for public service contracts, so as to
       improve cost-efficiency and get better value for money for taxpayers. Competitive
       bidding would become the norm from 2023 for the award of public service contracts
       to provide passenger rail services, which currently make up a large share of all rail
       services. Any contract awarded directly would need to meet specific performance and
       service quality targets.

The fourth package includes the following legislation:

      Proposed Directive on railway safety
      Proposed Directive on the interoperability of the rail system within the European
       Union
      Proposed Regulation on the European Union Agency for Railways, repealing
       Regulation 881/2004
      Proposed Regulation amending Regulation 1370/2007, concerning the opening of the
       market for domestic passenger transport services by rail

          Proposed Directive amending Directive 2012/34, as regards the opening of the
           market for domestic passenger transport services by rail and the governance of the
           railway infrastructure
          Proposed Regulation repealing Regulation 1192/69 on common rules for the
           normalisation of the accounts of railway undertakings



II.6       Status of implementation in Bosnia and Herzegovina
As described in Annex I.6, under the EU-Bosnia and Herzegovina Stabilization and Association
Agreement BiH undertakes to implement the Community acquis on the development of the
railways and its future evolution. In February 2016, BiH submitted its application to join the
EU. Table II.1 summarizes the broad compliance of the two BiH railways with the EU rail acquis.

Although BiH has started the process of implementing the EU railway acquis, in particular
creating the Railways Regulatory Body which is working with support from ERA to adopt the
common approach to safety and interoperability, many key aspects in particular regarding the
governance in the sector lag significantly. Railways Regulatory Body has the role of economic
regulator while the Public Railways Corporation, BHŽJK, is in charge of setting the track access
charges. However in practice they do not perform these roles.

On the separate management of Infrastructure and rail services, in both BiH railways these
activities are simply divisions of the same unitary companies. The railways of both Entities
have only an accounting separation between infrastructure and operations, and not a very
rigorous one. Also, no mechanism to reduce unsustainable debts of the rail operators, in order
for them to compete on a fair basis with third-party operators, has been implemented.

According to the railways laws of both entities (Annex I) third party access in permitted in
principle but it is not seriously implemented. Each railway has maintained effective exclusivity
of network use, neither Entity railway publishes a Network Statement and charge system to
encourage access, and track access charges effectively only an internal transfer in the financial
accounts from the rail operating division to the infrastructure division.

The EU railway acquis also requires clarity in the formal relationship between the government
and the Infrastructure Manager. This is often done via a Multi-annual Infrastructure Contract
(MAIC)51. As access charging is required to be based on marginal cost pricing, the access income
does not cover all costs and the deficit is paid from the public budget. Stable budget funding
may be assured through MAIC’s which are also required to set incentives to the Infrastructure
Managers to reduce the costs of the infrastructure service provision and the level of access
charges, and to maintain and improve the quality of the infrastructure services. A contract of
this type is in place for ŽFBH but in practice has not provided the agreed level of funding. There
is no such contract for ŽRS.

A notion of budget recompense for passenger services is in in place in both entities, but in
neither case is the EU acquis well reflected. In ŽRS annual lump-sums are paid from budget
that are not related to any level of service. Levels of service are specified in ŽFBH but the
amount paid does not reflect the net cost. In both Entities the accounting systems do not

51
  The EU railway acquis does not require that the infrastructure contract be on a multiannual basis
but it is suggested in EU supporting papers as best practice.

clearly show the allocation of the financial support and the Bank’s analyses shows that in both
cases the payments estimated and received are far less than a reasonable allocation of costs
of providing passenger services.

ANNEX III: Evaluation of Organizational Forms of Rail Enterprises
III.1     Introduction
This Annex provides more detail on the evaluation of organizational forms, the results of which
are summarized in the Main Report sections B.2.2. (FBH) and C.2.2 (RS). The aim is to present
options and recommend a structure which, while compliant with the EU rail acquis, appears
best suited to the conditions that exist in each entity.

III.2     Structure of state-owned railway companies among EU member states
Railways and railway industries around the world are organized in many different ways in
regard to their scale, transport role, ownership, competition between train companies, and
degree of separation by geography, traffic specialization or between infrastructure and
operations (World Bank Railway Reform Toolkit 52 ). The Bank does not advocate any one
particular international model of railway organization, either that of the EU or any other model.
The Bank recognizes that policy objectives, governmental structures, transport markets and
geographical factors vary markedly between countries and will influence the options that may
be available and which of those may work best in the circumstances. However, under the terms
of EU-Bosnia and Herzegovina Stabilization and Association Agreement (2015) BiH has agreed
to harmonize sector policies with the EU railway framework of directives and regulations (the
‘EU railway acquis’) and this is therefore the focus of railway policies explored in this Policy
Note.

Two impulses have driven the evolution of the EU railway acquis since 1991: first, to create an
integrated European railway area from the individual railway systems of each member state,
previously protected (and thereby isolated) to a greater or lesser extent through geographic,
institutional, economic and technical barriers; and second, to offer better performing rail
services and higher market share through the incentive of competition between railway
operators who might be either publicly or privately-owned.

Arguably the most fundamental principle underpinning the EU railway acquis is that access to
the European railway network should be provided on a non-discriminatory basis and to this
end Infrastructure Managers should be ‘independent’ of Rail Undertakings (rail transport
service operators). However, there is not only one way of achieving this. The relevant EU
directives have been transposed differently into national laws of different member states. A
recent report of the European Parliamentary Research Service (March 2016)53 summarizes the
alternative arrangements in place into essentially three main alternative approaches, which to
adapt and paraphrase are:

     i.   Separate Infrastructure Management and Transport Operating companies: with
          this structure the infrastructure manager and the service provider are fully
          institutionally and organizationally independent, with the Infrastructure Manager
          undertaking the infrastructure capacity allocation function. Countries adopting this

        alternative include Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Great Britain, Greece, Finland,
        Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Slovakia.

  ii.   Group structures with holding company: an integrated governance structure, where
        the infrastructure manager allocating track capacity and the rail operator are legally
        separate companies, fulfilling accounting separation requirements, but nevertheless
        remain within the same institutional structure, for instance within or as subsidiaries of
        a holding company. Countries adopting this alternative are Austria, Germany, Poland
        and Italy.

 iii.   Synthesized structures: these include a number of specific arrangements but
        generally characterized by the establishment of an Infrastructure Manager responsible
        for (if it is independent) capacity allocation functions or (if not independent) subject to
        the directions of a separate capacity allocation agency: in some structures functions
        such as infrastructure maintenance or train control are contracted to the state-owned
        rail operator. Countries adopting variants of these structures are Belgium, Estonia,
        France, Hungary, Latvia, Luxembourg and Slovenia.

There have been many claims by competitors that institutional links between infrastructure
and operating entities in the EU have contributed to unequal or discriminatory treatment. But
irrespective of the merits of specific claims of discrimination, the European Court of Justice in
a ruling in 2013 found that, in itself, the holding company model (as applied in Germany)
satisfied the EU requirements then applying for ‘independence’ of the Infrastructure Manager.
Nevertheless, because of the European Commission’s continuing concerns about possible
discrimination, the Commission intended as part of the 4th Railway Package to strengthen
Infrastructure Managers’ role and independence through a stricter separation (that is, towards
alternative i. above). In the face of opposition from a number of countries who prefer other
arrangements, including Germany and France, the call for separation was dropped from the
final agreement on the 4th Railway Package (see below).

Separation certainly provides the most transparent and least conflicted environment for
encouraging non-discriminatory access and competition between rail operators, though it
doesn’t guarantee it. Conversely, those supporting more integrated alternatives point to the
benefits of closer coordination between provider and main users of infrastructure, keeping
infrastructure managers ‘closer’ to final markets, better reflection of the interdependence of
infrastructure and rolling stock investment decisions although it is difficult to see how either
party gains such benefits in a group structure without some degree of interdependent
management and decision-making. Nevertheless, there is no clear weight of empirical
evidence in favor of any one of the three alternatives over the others in terms of overall
economic merits. Indeed there is great diversity of external circumstances within the EU and
it may well be that flexibility in transposition models provides a superior outcome to a ‘one-
size-fits-all’ approach. In addition, it seems likely that the quality of governance and
management of the individual state-owned rail entities in any country will have a much greater
impact on their performance than the nature of institutional links between them.

The informal agreement on the 4th Railway Package market pillar by representatives from the
European Commission, Parliament and Council in April 2016 has still to be approved by the full
Council and Parliament, and this is expected in late 2016. The Policy Note is essentially based

on its provision that that, while the existing alternatives applied in EU member states shall not
in principle be considered non-compliant, whatever alternative is used should ensure
impartiality of railway infrastructure managers in providing non-discriminatory access to
tracks, allow them to pursue their own strategies for better use of rail infrastructure, and
improve financial transparency in order to remove the risk of cross-subsidy between
infrastructure managers and transport operators. Detailed rules on each of these matters are
to be promulgated.



III.3   Evaluation of alternatives for application in BiH
The evaluation is aimed at identifying a structure that would be capable of complying with the
EU acquis while taking account also of the need to improve the financial sustainability of the
sector in BiH, the efficiency of various elements of sector management, and the ease of
implementation. There are eight criteria on which these options have been assessed, for each
of the entities, which are summarized in Table F1, and are rated from three stars (best fit with
criterion) to one star (least good fit to criterion). This is a subjective ranking but based on
judgement and experience of the Bank team preparing the Policy Note. The evaluation is judged
equally applicable to each entity.

   Ease of implementation: On this criterion, the group structure is ranked over separation
    while least highly ranked are more complex synthesized options, particularly if these
    require the establishment of an independent capacity allocation agency to interact with
    both infrastructure managers and operating companies. However, all three alternatives
    would appear to require new legislation (or legislative amendments).

   Impartiality of Infrastructure Manager: This criterion favors the separation option which
    eliminates formal links that may affect partiality (though that does not actually eliminate
    the possibility of partiality). A group structure is ranked lower because it contains in-built
    enticements to partiality that would need actively to be suppressed. The synthesized
    alternative, if it has an independent capacity allocation agency, minimizes the likelihood of
    partiality in allocating capacity but if the infrastructure manager contracts track
    maintenance and train control to an incumbent operator that operator can exert partiality
    between itself and other operators in numerous day-to-day operational decisions. The
    latter two alternatives are therefore ranked equally.

   Clarity and focus of roles: This criterion favors a clean separation between infrastructure
    manager and operating company. Each company would be accountable to its own Board
    for a distinct function, either infrastructure management or transport operations. A group
    structure would provide less clarity because a competent holding company management
    can influence distribution of management responsibilities and decision-making powers,
    and (through management advice or intervention) how actual decisions are made. The
    synthesized options appear to provide least clarity: they could be designed to create clear
    divisions such as by establishing an independent capacity allocation body but at the
    expense of creating a third institutional unit alongside the infrastructure manager and
    operating company (whether separate or grouped). Moreover, if an infrastructure manager
    then contracts train control and maintenance back to the operating company it would be
    creating a contractor/client relationship alongside a supplier/ customer relationship, which
    seems likely to create at least fuzzy edges in roles.

   Ability of infrastructure managers and operating companies to set own business
    strategies: An extension of the benefits of clarity and focus in roles is that they also allow
    the companies independence to determine their own business strategies. This is important
    to an infrastructure management company seeking optimum use and development of its
    railway network for all potential users. It is equally important to the train operating
    company which under EU structures will no longer be confined to the existing network but
    can compete for traffic, on its own or in partnership with others on a regional basis, and
    may wish to increase external equity participation to do so. The ranking here is adjudged
    the same as for clarity of focus and role, though it is harder to judge between the group
    structure and the synthesized alternative as it would depend on detailed design. On
    balance, if capacity allocation and utilization issues are taken outside of the company
    supplying the infrastructure this must be seen as detracting from management
    responsibilities.

   Protection of coordination benefits: In principle, a group structure would best preserve
    any coordination benefits that exist. The separation and synthesized options rank lower,
    though it is difficult to distinguish which might be best.

   Administrative efficiency (ministry): For the line ministry responsible for railways the
    group structure may look to be most efficient as it only has to deal with a single corporation
    rather than an infrastructure manager and an operating company. A countervailing risk is
    that the holding company will be better resourced and more powerful than the line-
    ministry and by default may end up ‘competing’ with the ministry with regard to dealing
    with rail policy matters. The synthesized alternative would require the line ministry to
    establish an infrastructure allocation agency in some form and this could be an unwelcome
    administrative challenge for a lightly resourced ministry.

   Management efficiency (railways): Separation is ranked as being best alternative. The
    railway industry in BiH’s entities is not sufficiently large or complex to justify adding
    another institutional layer (in the form either of a holding company in a group structure or
    an infrastructure capacity allocation unit in a synthesized structure) to a national railway
    industry already characterized by an abundance of institutions. In a group structure the
    best railway managers would tend to gravitate to the holding company instead of running
    the actual businesses where their skills are most needed. This would dilute the
    responsibility and accountability of the subsidiary managements. While in theory a group
    structure could provide some sharing of corporate services such as financial accounting
    and human resources management, these would reduce management independence at the
    subsidiary level. It is also likely that with current low levels of productivity, significant costs
    can be saved anyway in all functions during a well-planned separation process, a saving
    less likely if resources are simply regrouped into subsidiaries. In a synthesized structure,
    the infrastructure access agency or unit would draw off infrastructure utilization skills
    from the infrastructure manager.

   Regulatory efficiency (ministry and RRB): Regulatory efficiency refers to the burdens on
    the entity governments and the RRB to ensure compliance with the EU rail acquis. While
    the final rules of compliance have yet to be promulgated it is likely to be more onerous to
    demonstrate and monitor compliance with impartiality and financial transparency
    requirements in a separated system than in either a group structure or a synthesized
    alternative.

The FBH and RS entity government transport officials have better knowledge of their own
institutional and market environment and may legitimately assign different ratings to those
above, or ascribe different weightings to the individual criteria. However, it seems clear that
the separation and group structure alternatives are both superior to a synthesized alternative
which does not really perform better than one of the other alternatives on any criterion. On
the balance of evaluation criteria the Bank team expresses a preference for institutional
separation, arguably the simplest and most clear-cut solution. It is reinforced in this view by
the added weight the team gives to two factors in the evaluation criteria: first, that separation
will lead to better management of the infrastructure and transport operating companies; and
second it will enhance their ability to determine their own business strategies in the context
of a European railway system in which each will have different and sometimes different
interests. However, the evaluation recognizes that a group structure is a legitimate and
compliant option, and both alternatives are presented in the Main Report.

IV.1    The role of railways in FBH
Railway length and density
The railway network in FBH extends for about 600km and it is one of the smallest networks
in the West Balkan region54, similar in size to FYR Macedonia’s. Compared to land area, the
network density is a little less than half of that Croatia and Serbia, largely because the latter
two railways have a more extensive network of lightly-used branch lines. By contrast, most of
the FBH operational network consists of the main north-south trunk line.

Passenger Traffic
In 2014 ŽFBH carried 355,000 passengers for a total of 22 million passenger-km (an average
distance of 62 km) with the average train occupancy of 21 people55. Traffic gradually grew
from 2005 until 2008, when ŽFBH was carrying 528,000 passengers and 39 million
passenger-km, and remained near that level until 2011. During 2012-2014 passenger numbers
again declined significantly, reaching the level of 2005 in 2014. As a result, its share of FBH
total non-urban traffic has also reduced from 5 percent in 2012 to 2 percent in 2014 with
transfer to road-based public transport and private vehicle use. This reduction has occurred in
both segments of the rail market (domestic and international) with the greatest decline being
in the international market.
In 2014, domestic (incl. inter-entity) routes accounted for the largest share of passengers
transported - 98 percent (or 349,000 passengers/year) followed by only 2 percent (or 6
thousand passengers/year) on international routes. The main domestic routes are Sarajevo-
Zenica (4 pairs of trains per day), Sarajevo-Capljina (2 pairs of trains per day) and Sarajevo-Konjic

(2 pairs of trains per day). Inter-entity trains run between Doboj and Sarajevo and Doboj and
Tuzla once and twice per day in each direction respectively, but they carry very few inter-entity
passengers and most passengers are intra-entity. FBH is served by two international
passenger rail routes – Sarajevo- Zagreb and Sarajevo - Ploče, but most passengers on
international trains are relatively short-distance cross-border trips.

Freight Traffic
In 2014, ŽFBH carried 8.5 million tonnes for 885 million net tonne-km (ntkm) (an average intra-
entity distance of 104 km). Freight traffic has been increasing marginally since 2005 other
than a temporary drop in 2009 coincident with the global financial crisis. Domestic traffic
comprised 5.4 million tonnes (63 percent of the total) and 236 million ntkm (27 percent of the
total). Import and export traffic totaled 3.1 million tonnes (641 million ntkm) and transit traffic
0.05 million tonnes (8 million ntkm).

Freight traffic density in FBH - at about 1.4 million tonnes per route-km - is the highest among
the all countries in this region and nearly a fifth more than the EU average. However, passenger
traffic density is very low – under a tenth of most other South East European countries and
less than 2 percent of the EU average.

IV.2       ŽFBH Network assets
The operational network is standard gauge (1,435mm) and the majority is single track (89
percent of the total). More than 85 percent of the network is classified as D4 in terms of UIC
load categories, allowing maximum loads of 22.5 tonnes per axle. Around 73 percent of the
network is electrified at 25 kV. The only non-electrified part is located in the north-eastern
part of the country, around Tuzla.
The maximum designed speed on the network is generally 100km/h, however operational
speed is much lower and averages to 33km/h due to a mixture of traffic conditions, low-
performance train dispatching and control including train stops at level crossings. There are
over 100 level crossing on the ŽFBH network, out of which only 26 are actively protected with
lights and/or boom gates.
IV.3       ŽFBH rolling stock
ŽFBH has acquired little new rolling stock in the last twenty years, with the exception of a fleet
of freight wagons and Talgo passenger train-sets in 2008, the latter of which were arranged
at the government level with finance from Spain, and which have never been used in service.
As a result, the locomotive fleet and passenger carriages are very old and their condition is
generally poor. The number of locomotives in operation is small relative to the total stock. Out
of 97 locomotives only 40 are operational, reflecting the age structure - with the majority
exceeding 40 years. There are in total 2129 freight wagons owned by ŽFBH, of which 1372 are
currently in operation and 27 passenger coaches, of which only 15 cars are in operation.

Locomotive productivity, measured as traffic units per operational locomotive, stood at 22.68
million in 2014. This level of productivity is highest among all countries comparators in the
region though lower than the EU average by about 30 percent. Similarly, productivity of the
freight car fleet, measured as freight traffic units per total number of operational wagons, is
the highest among all neighboring countries, but also somewhat below the EU average (by 18
percent in 2014). Passenger coach productivity in 2014 was only around 33 percent of the EU
average and one of the lowest in the region.

IV.4   ŽFBH Human resources
In 2014, ŽFBH had 3,572 employees. Labor productivity has generally been trending upward
since 2005 as gradual staff reductions through attrition have coincided with some freight
increase. But the average traffic units per employee in 2014 was 253,000 – about 40 percent
of the EU average and lower than in most neighboring countries except Albania and Serbia.

IV.5     ŽFBH Financial performance
The financial performance of ŽFBH remains poor with financial losses incurred each year. Total
operating expenses of ŽFBH exceed total revenues for each year during 2007-2014, even after
factoring in the support from the Entity’s budget. The level of total revenues, including this
support, was sufficient to cover just cash operating expenses (the working ratio was 83
percent in 2014).

   Labor costs are a substantial share of the cost structure of ŽFBH. In 2014, the wage bill was
   61 percent of operating costs and 84 percent of commercial revenues (excluding Entity
   subsidies), growing in absolute terms by 19 percent during 2007-2014. Depreciation is the
   second largest cost item, but ŽFBH had no commercial revenue or budget support actually to
   fund depreciation provisions as a source of finance for annual renewals or investment.
   Basically, any infrastructure O&M costs are funded from the budget, which has not provided
   sufficient in practice to avoid deteriorating assets.

   During 2007-2014, ŽFBH earned a surplus on freight operations but made substantial losses
   on their passenger operations, for which the traffic volumes sharply declined. Based on railway
   cost allocations, ŽFBH unit revenues for freight transport increased from 9.4 fening in 2007
   to 10.2 fening in 2014. Unit cost remained only a fraction of unit revenues, however the margin
   got slightly smaller – from 30 to 27 percent measured as fraction of unit revenues during
   2007-2014. ŽFBH unit cost for passengers, at 99.2 fening in 2014, far exceeded unit revenues.
   Even with the budget support passenger unit revenues were not sufficient to fully cover unit

operating costs (the gap was 68.3 fening per pass-km in 2014). It should be noted that World
Bank estimates of passenger costs and losses (see Main Policy Note) are significantly higher
than those of the company.

IV.6         ŽFBH Financial Model
The World Bank team developed a financial model of ŽFBH to evaluate alternative
future strategies over the next 10 years (2016-2025) and to estimate the total amount
that the FBH budget would need to pay to sustain the railway financially though a
combination of capital outlays and net operating deficit. This section describes the
structure of the proposed business plan financial model inputs used for the analysis
and the sources from which they have been derived. The model generates consolidated
financial statements of ŽFBH and profit and loss statements for its three main sector
components (passenger, freight and infrastructure).

                                                                                         113
                            BiH Railways Policy Note - Annexes


ŽFBH Model Inputs

The inputs fall into five groups:

      general economic data
      traffic data and growth rates
      operating data
      financial data (operating costs and opening balance sheet)
      investment and funding data
The following sections describe each group of inputs in turn.
Economic Data

This data consists of forecasts of inflation, growth in annual real wages and changes
in the exchange rate between 2015 and 2020.
       Inflation:
       The model presents results in nominal terms (in the Policy Note section B3,
       these are converted to 2015 constant prices)
       Real wages:
       Growth in real wages is a major factor driving the operating cost projections,
       which combine changes in unit labor costs with assumptions on changes in
       physical productivity.
       Exchange rate:
       The exchange rate between the Euro and BAM affects both the cost of any
       project and the cost of servicing any Euro-denominated debt.
Traffic Data and Growth Rates

The base traffic data consists of the 2014 volume, task and revenue for each of the
passenger and freight sectors, together with annual growth rates. The base projections
were made following discussions with ŽFBH.
       Passengers:
       The forecasts are based on the train patterns for 2014 and assume no growth
       unless there is major investment to improve service levels.
       Freight:
       The projections also assume no growth unless there is major investment to
       improve freight service levels: however, a scenario showing impacts of ŽFBH
       winning additional market share (e.g. bulk oil products in Corridor Vc) is
       provided in the Policy Note.
       Infrastructure revenue:



                                           114
                           BiH Railways Policy Note - Annexes


       This includes a number of items which are associated with infrastructure
       management, such as rents, sale of scrap etc. These are assumed to remain a
       constant proportion of transport revenue.
       Infrastructure revenue also includes track access charges paid by the passenger
       and freight businesses to the infrastructure company. These have been set at
       rates which are comparable with other railways in the region.


       Government compensation:
       ŽFBH is assumed to continue to receive direct Government public service
       contract payments for passenger services and contractual payments for
       infrastructure maintenance and servicing of historic debt to international
       financial institutions. The PSC payments are calculated from the cash deficit on
       the passenger and infrastructure businesses (excluding debt service).
Operating Data

Operating data includes the main parameters which enable traffic projections to be
converted into the operating resources (car-km, train-km etc) which drive the
operating costs. These have been derived from ŽFBH operating statistics.
Financial Data

The financial data consists of three components:

      current annual operating costs, which form the basis of projected expenditure
      projections of changes in operating costs
      opening balance sheets for ŽFBH as a whole and for the three sectors: freight,
       passengers and infrastructure.

   Current operating costs:

   Current operating costs were derived from the ŽFBH management accounts for
   2014, supplemented by special analyses of rolling stock maintenance costs.

   Future operating costs:
   The projected changes in operating costs have two elements:

      changes in the unit cost of performing particular activities e.g. unit fuel costs,
       unit labor maintenance costs, etc.
      changes in the number of units of work required due to changes in the traffic
       task or operating plan, which affect operating costs through the assumed cost
       driver relationships.

   Opening balance sheet:
   The model includes a balance sheet for the consolidated accounts of ŽFBH, based
   on the closing balance sheet for 2014, together with notional balance sheets for the
   passenger, freight and infrastructure businesses derived by splitting the
   consolidated balance sheet and ignoring inter-business payables and receivables.
Investment and Funding
The projections allow for investment in both rolling stock and infrastructure. This is
assumed to be funded by government grant, although the model also has the facility
to assume loans, in which case it calculates interest and debt service payments.


Model Assumptions
Table III.4 summarizes the input assumptions used. For some variables only a single set
of assumptions was used while for others, such as labor productivity, several sets were
used. The precise combinations for the various scenarios are given in the Policy Note
main text.

ANNEX V: Operational and Financial Performance of the Railways of
Republic of Srpska
V.1    The role of railways in RS
Railway length and density
The railway network in RS extends for about 426km, of which 353 km is currently under traffic
operations. It is one of the smallest networks in the West Balkan region56, similar in size to
Albania’s. Compared to land area, the network density is a little less than half of that Croatia
and Serbia largely because the latter two railways have many more lightly-used branch lines.
Most of the RS network consists of the Entity’s main lines.

Passenger Traffic
In 2014, ŽRS carried 168,000 passengers for a total of 12 million passenger-km (an average
distance of 71 km). Traffic has steadily declined from its peak in 2008, when ŽRS was carrying
727,000 passengers and 39 million passenger-km. As a result, its share of RS total non-urban
traffic has also reduced from 8 percent in 2005 to 3 percent in 2014 with transfer to road-
based public transport and private vehicle use. This reduction has occurred in all three
segments of the rail market (domestic (intra-entity), inter-entity and international) with the
greatest decline being in the domestic market.

In 2014, domestic routes accounted for the largest share of passengers transported, some 77
percent (or 134,000 passengers), followed by inter-entity routes at 9 percent (or 15,000
passengers), and international routes at 14 percent (25,000 passengers). The main domestic
routes are Doboj – Banja Luka (4 pairs of trains per day), Doboj – Petrovo Novo (3 pairs of trains
per day) and Banja Luka – Dobrljin (2 pairs of trains per day). Together these routes in 2014
carried 91 percent of all domestic rail passengers with the average number of passengers being
estimated to be 14-25/train. Although inter-entity trains run between Doboj and Sarajevo and
Doboj and Tuzla once and twice per day in each direction respectively, they carry very few
inter-entity passengers and most passengers are intra-entity. Because of low utilization and

high costs, the number of international routes was reduced from four in 2006 to one return
trip daily between Sarajevo and Zagreb, with most international passengers being relatively
short-distance cross-border traffic. Average train occupancy on the international routes is low
(about 16 in 2014)57 and most trains are correspondingly small (typically one or two coaches).

Freight Traffic
In 2015, ŽRS carried 5.0 million tonnes for 450 million net tonne-km (ntkm) (an average intra-
entity distance of 90 km). Freight traffic has been increasing marginally since 2005 other than
a temporary drop in 2009 coincident with the global financial crisis. Domestic traffic
comprised 2.3 million tonnes (46 percent of the total) and 331 million ntkm (74 percent of the
total). Import and export traffic totaled 1.0 million tonnes (32 million ntkm) and transit traffic
1.7 million tonnes (87 million ntkm).

Freight traffic is dominated by bulk cargo. The main commodities include iron ore, bauxite,
aluminium, hydrated aluminium, alkali and coal. The iron ore is about 40 percent (or 2.26 million

tonnes) of the total 2015 volume by tonnes and is transported on two routes Omarska-Zenica
(in ŽFBH) and Omarska-Volinja (on the Croatian border) for onward shipment to (mostly)
Kosice in Slovakia. The main user of the iron ore and the largest client of ŽRS is Arcelor Mittal
Zenica (2.02 million tonnes transported in 2015). Other bulk commodities including coal,
bauxite, aluminium, hydrated aluminium and alkali are transported on various routes, mainly
to Alumina Zvornik Novi (0.46 million tonnes in 2015). Freight moving via ŽFBH to and from
the port at Ploce includes coke and coal for GIKIL Lukavac Novi. The general freight includes
steel products from Zenica Steel Mill to a range of destinations, plus relatively small volumes
of timber, scrap iron and chemical products, cereals, oil and oil products, sugar and fertilizers;
the total volume of these general freight transported by ŽRS in 2015 was 0.69 million tonnes.

Traffic density
Freight traffic density in RS - at about 1.0 million tonnes per km of route - is relatively high
compared to neighboring countries, and about 80 percent of the EU average. However,
passenger traffic density is very low – under a tenth of most other South East European
countries and less than 2 percent of the EU average.

V.2        ŽRS Network assets
The operational network is standard gauge (1,435km) and the majority is single track (94
percent of the total). More than 90 percent of the total active network is classified as D4 in
terms of UIC load categories, allowing maximum loads of 22.5 tonnes per axle. Around 320km
is electrified at 25 kV with the only non-electrified sections located in the east of Doboj. Some
sections are non-operational due to cessation of services or temporarily leased to other
parties.

The maximum design-speed on the network is generally 100km/h, however operational speed
is lower on some branch-lines (Novi Grad – Blatna, Omarska – Tomašica) and on the section
between Šamac – Doboj These sections are either industrial lines requiring only slow speed,
lines with curvatures that lower average speeds, minimum use lines or temporary restrictions
that require long term solutions. There are in total 278 level crossing on the ŽRS network, out

                                               121

of which only 23 are protected. The protection system (signaling & safeworking) is colored light
signalling on the mainlines with one exception being on the Doboj to Zvornik where train orders
are used, but with colored light protection at stations. This protection is mainly of the manual
variety (station master invoked) but with some stations having been converted to interlocked
automation. On lesser used lines train orders are used except around stations. Regardless of
protection system, stations still use “pointsmen” to monitor entry and exit of trains at the
turnouts, but this practice is more and more difficult to implement due to the lack of staff.
Ultimately there should be no need for this function once more sophisticated signalling is
installed.

V.3    ŽRS Rolling stock
ŽRS has acquired little new rolling stock in the last twenty years, with the exception of a fleet
of wagons for the Omarska iron ore traffic. As a result, the fleet, especially the locomotives
and passenger carriages, is old and its condition is generally poor. In addition, the fleets are
generally far larger than is required for the current traffic task.

The number of locomotives in operation is small relative to the total stock. Out of 73
locomotives only 54 are operational, reflecting the age structure - with the majority exceeding
40 years. The operational fleet includes 22 electric class 441 locomotives, with the remainder
being diesel (Classes 661, 643 and 642).There are 2438 freight wagons in total owned by ŽRS,
of which 1167 are currently in operation and 69 passenger coaches, of which only 11 cars are in
operation.

Locomotive productivity, measured as traffic units per operational locomotive, stood at 8.09
million in 2014. This level of productivity is lower than in all neighboring countries and all
countries comparators with the exception of Albania. Productivity of the freight car fleet,
measured as freight traffic units per total number of operational wagons, is comparable to all
neighboring countries in the region, but well below the EU average (by 54 percent in 2014).
Coach productivity seems even less favorable if to compare to the performance of other
railways. In 2014 its level of 0.63 million was only 14 percent of the EU average and one of the
lowest in the region.

V.4    ŽRS Human resources
At end-2014, ŽRS had 3,160 employers, of whom 2,099 were in the operations department,
739 in the infrastructure department and 222 in general departments (finance, personnel etc).
The average traffic units per total employee in 2015 was 146,000 - considerably lower than in
the EU and all other neighbouring countries except Albania. After increasing for a few years
after 2005, labor productivity has been declining since 2010. ŽRS has the highest number of
staff/route-km of any railway in the region.

V.5      ŽRS Financial performance
The financial performance of ŽRS remains poor with financial losses incurred every year. Total
operating expenses of ŽRS exceed total revenues for each year during 2007-2014, even after
factoring in the support from the Entity’s budget. The level of total revenues, including this
support, was sufficient to cover just cash operating expenses (the working ratio was 93
percent in 2014) and it remained relatively stable over the period mainly due to adjustments in
the level of budgetary support.

Labor costs are a substantial share of the cost structure of ŽRS. In 2014, the wage bill was 64
percent of operating costs and 108 percent of commercial revenues (excluding Entity
subsidies), growing in absolute terms by 22 percent by 2014. Depreciation is the second largest
cost item, but ŽRS had no commercial revenue or budget support actually to fund depreciation
provisions as a source of finance for annual renewals or investment. Basically, any
infrastructure O&M costs are funded from the budget.

During 2007-2014, ŽRS earned a surplus on freight operations but made substantial losses on
their passenger operations, for which the traffic volumes sharply declined. Based on company
estimates, ŽRS unit revenues for freight transport increased from 8.8 fening58 in 2007 to 11.1
fening in 2014. Unit cost remained only a fraction of unit revenues, however the margin got
smaller – from 40 to 11 percent measured as fraction of unit revenues during 2007-2014. ŽRS

unit cost for passengers, at 64.3 fening in 2014, far exceeded unit revenues. Even with the
budget support passenger unit revenues were barely sufficient to fully cover unit operating
costs in 2014 (negative gap during 2007-2011 being as high as 60 fening). It should be noted
that World Bank estimates of passenger costs and losses (see Main Policy Note) are
significantly higher than those of the company.

During 2009-2013 ŽRS invested on average 20 million BAM annually on rail infrastructure and
rolling stock. Infrastructure investments (66 million BAM in total for the six years) included
mainly overhaul and rehabilitation of track and modernization of signalling and telecom system
on some sections. Rolling stock investments were slightly more modest – 50 million BAM
during the 2009-2013 period and financed purchase of new and rehabilitation and overhaul of
the existing rolling stock. The financing was made available to ŽRS through foreign and
domestic loans.


                                                                            126

Persistent financial losses prevented ŽRS from funding a substantial share of its capital
expenditure and also servicing fully its debt obligations. As a result, the debt service payments
were made on the behalf of ŽRS by the Entity government but charged to the railway account.
In addition to the loans, ŽRS received annual subsidies for infrastructure however this amount
declined over the years from over BAM 28 million in 2008 to BAM 17 million in 2014.



V.6       ŽRS Financial Model
The World Bank team developed a financial model of ŽRS to evaluate alternative future
strategies over the next 10 years (2016-2025) and to estimate the total amount that
the RS budget would need to pay to sustain the railway financially though a
combination of capital outlays and net operating deficit. This section describes the
structure of the proposed business plan financial model inputs used for the analysis
and the sources from which they have been derived. The model generates consolidated
financial statements of ŽRS and profit and loss statements for its three main sector
components (passenger, freight and infrastructure).
Model Inputs

The inputs fall into five groups:

         general economic data
         traffic data and growth rates
         operating data
         financial data (operating costs and opening balance sheet)
         investment and funding data
The following sections describe each group of inputs in turn.
Economic Data

This data consists of forecasts of inflation, growth in annual real wages and changes
in the exchange rate between 2015 and 2020.
          Inflation:
          The model presents results in nominal terms. (In the Policy Note, section C3,
          these are converted to 2015 constant prices)
          Real wages:
          Growth in real wages is a major factor driving the operating cost projections,
          which combine changes in unit labor costs with assumptions on changes in
          physical productivity.
          Exchange rate:
          The exchange rate between the Euro and BAM affects both the cost of any
          project and the cost of servicing any Euro-denominated debt.
Traffic Data and Growth Rates

                                               127
                           BiH Railways Policy Note - Annexes


The base traffic data consists of the 2014 volume, task and revenue for each of the
passenger and freight sectors, together with annual growth rates. The projections
were made following discussions with ŽRS.
       Passengers:
       The ŽRS forecasts are based on the train patterns for 2014 and assume no
       growth unless there is major investment to improve service levels.


       Freight:
       The ŽRS projections also assume no growth.
       Infrastructure revenue:
       This includes a number of items which are associated with infrastructure
       management, such as rents, sale of scrap etc. These are assumed to remain a
       constant proportion of transport revenue.
       Infrastructure revenue also includes track access charges paid by the passenger
       and freight businesses to the infrastructure company. These have been set at
       rates which are comparable with other railways in the region.
       Government compensation:
       ŽRS is assumed to continue to receive direct Government public service
       contract payments for passenger services and contractual payments for
       infrastructure maintenance and servicing of historic debt to international
       financial institutions. The PSC payments are calculated from the cash deficit on
       the passenger and infrastructure businesses (excluding debt service).
Operating Data

Operating data includes the main parameters which enable traffic projections to be
converted into the operating resources (car-km, train-km etc) which drive the
operating costs. These have been derived from ŽRS operating statistics.
Financial Data

The financial data consists of three components:

      Current annual operating costs, which form the basis of projected expenditure
      projections of changes in operating costs.
      opening balance sheets for ŽRS as a whole and for the three sectors: freight,
       passengers and infrastructure.

   Current operating costs:




                                          128
                           BiH Railways Policy Note - Annexes


   Current operating costs were derived from the management accounts for 2014,
   supplemented by special analyses of rolling stock maintenance costs.

   Future operating costs:
   The projected changes in operating costs have two elements:

      changes in the unit cost of performing particular activities e.g. unit fuel costs,
       unit labor maintenance costs, etc.
      changes in the number of units of work required due to changes in the traffic
       task or operating plan, which affect operating costs through the assumed cost
       driver relationships.

   Opening balance sheet:
   The model includes a balance sheet for the consolidated accounts of ŽRS, based on
   the closing balance sheet for 2014, together with notional balance sheets for the
   passenger, freight and infrastructure businesses derived by splitting the
   consolidated balance sheet and ignoring inter-business payables and receivables.
Investment and Funding
The projections allow for investment in both rolling stock and infrastructure. This is
assumed to be funded entirely by government grant, although the model also has the
facility to assume loans, in which case it calculates interest and debt service payments.
Model Assumptions
Table IV.4 summarizes the input assumptions used for the ŽRS financial model. For
some variables only a single set of assumptions was used while for others, such as labor
productivity, several sets were used. The precise combinations for the various
scenarios are given in the Policy Note Section C3.
