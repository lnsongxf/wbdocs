I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:

       Assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in India
        perceive the Bank;

       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in India regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in India;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank in India;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank ’s effectiveness and results, knowledge
               and research, and communication and information sharing in India; and
            Perceptions of the World Bank’s future role in India.

       Use data to help inform the India country team’s strategy.



II. Methodology
In May thru July 2012, 1,445 stakeholders of the World Bank in India were invited to provide
their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country survey.
Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of the President or Prime Minister;
the office of a Minister; the office of a Parliamentarian; employees of a ministry, ministerial
department, or implementation agency; consultants/contractors working on World Bank-
supported projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of a
project; local government officials or staff; bilateral agencies; multilateral agencies; private
sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks; NGOs; community-
based organizations (CBOs); the media; independent government institutions; trade unions; faith-
based groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; and the judiciary branch. A total of 260
stakeholders participated in the country survey (18%).
Respondents received questionnaires via courier, post, or email and returned it accordingly, or
completed questionnaires with a representative of the fielding agency. Respondents were asked
about: general issues facing India, their overall attitudes toward the Bank; the World Bank’s
effectiveness and results; the Bank’s knowledge; working with the World Bank; the Bank’s
future role in India, and the Bank’s communication and information sharing in India.

Every country that engages in the Country Survey must include specific indicator questions that
will be aggregated for the Bank’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions are identified
throughout the survey report.

A. General Issues facing India: Respondents were asked to indicate which areas would
   contribute most to reducing poverty and generating economic growth in India.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with the World Bank, the Bank’s effectiveness in India, Bank staff preparedness, the extent
   to which the Bank should seek to influence the global development agenda, their agreement
   with various statements regarding the Bank’s work, and the extent to which the Bank is an
   effective development partner. Respondents were also asked to indicate the sectoral areas on
   which it would be most productive for the Bank to focus its resources, what they think is the
   Bank’s priority in India, the Bank’s greatest values and greatest weaknesses in its work, the
   most and least effective instruments in helping to reduce poverty in India, and with which
   groups the Bank should work more in India.
C. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which
   the Bank’s work helps achieve sustainable development results in India, the extent to which
   the Bank meets India’s need for knowledge services and financial instruments, and the
   Bank’s level of effectiveness across eighteen development areas, such as economic growth
   and urban development.
D. The World Bank’s Knowledge: Respondents were asked to indicate how frequently they
   consult Bank knowledge/research, the areas on which the Bank should focus its research
   efforts, and to rate the effectiveness and quality of the Bank’s knowledge/research, including
   how significant of a contribution it makes to development results, its technical quality, and
   the Bank’s effectiveness at providing linkage to non-Bank expertise.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
   a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as the World Bank ’s
   “Safeguard Policy” requirements being reasonable and the Bank disbursing funds promptly.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank in India: Respondents were asked to rate how significant
   a role the Bank should play in India’s development in the near future and to indicate what the
   Bank should do to make itself of greater value in India and at what level of Government the
   World Bank should engage more actively in India.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate where they
   get information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the Bank, their access to the Internet, and their usage and evaluation of the
   Bank’s website and PICs. Respondents were asked about their awareness of the Bank’s
   Access to Information policy, past information requests from the Bank, and their level of
   agreement that they use more data from the World Bank as a result of the Bank’s Open Data
   policy. Respondents were also asked their level of agreement that they know how to find
   information from the Bank and that the Bank is responsive to information requests.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their exposure
   to the Bank in India, and their geographic location.

In addition, when possible, responses from respondents completing this year’s country survey
were compared to responses from the 581 respondents (58% response rate) who completed the
country survey in FY 2004. Notations and/or charts are included when these comparisons were
possible.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve sustainable development results in India, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the eighteen specific areas of
effectiveness.
Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve sustainable
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve s ustainable
development results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of
effectiveness in one specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s
overall effectiveness or perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable
development results.
       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in India. The areas determined
        to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             The Bank’s effectiveness at environment;
             The Bank’s effect iveness at poverty reduction;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at urban development; and
             The Bank’s effectiveness at health.
             Of note, the areas determined to be key drivers of the Bank’s overall effectiveness
              in the FY ’04 country survey were:
                o The Bank’s effectiveness in helping to reduce poverty;
                o The Bank’s effectiveness in helping to bring about economic growth;
                o The Bank’s effectiveness in empowering communities to access basic
                    services in rural areas; and
                o The Bank’s effectiveness in improving access of the poor to health services.

       Achieving Sustainable Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest
        Pearson Product-Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to
        perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable development results in India,
        suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions
        of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable development results. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             The Bank’s effectiveness at environment; and
             The Bank’s effectiveness at rural development/ agricultural development/ food
                security.
