I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in Panama perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues Facing Panama
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Panama
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information

II. Methodology
From October 2015 to February 2016, 332 stakeholders of the WBG in Panama were invited to
provide their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion
survey. Participants were drawn from the Office of the President; office of a minister; office of a
parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments; Project Management Units (PMUs)
overseeing implementation of WBG projects; consultants/contractors working on WBG-
supported projects/ programs; local governments; bilateral/multilateral agencies; private sector
organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks; non-profit
organizations/community based organizations; the media; independent government institutions;
trade unions; faith-based groups; youth groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; the
judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 160 stakeholders participated in the survey
(48% response rate).

Some respondents received and completed the questionnaire online. Others received and returned
the questionnaire via mail. Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Panama; their
overall attitudes toward the WBG; the WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge
work and activities; working with the WBG; the WBG’s future role in Panama; and the WBG’s
communication and information sharing.

Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.

The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY’13 (response rate is 18%, N=51). Data were weighted to reach the same
stakeholder composition in two years, which allows for year comparisons. Stakeholder groups
which were not present in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents
who belonged to the “other” stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, means of
the FY’16 data and the total number of respondents in both years are slightly different from those
of the original data reported in appendices A, B, C, and E. For the weighted stakeholder
breakdown and year comparison results, please see appendix D (page 92).

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
      For further analyses, respondents from the Office of the President and office of a minister
       were combined, the financial sector/private banks were combined with those from private
       sector organizations. Respondents from private foundations, NGOs/CBOs, and faith-
       based groups were combined as “CSO.” Few respondents from the office of a
       parliamentarian, independent government organizations, and other organizations were
       included in the “Other” category. There were no respondents from trade unions, youth
       groups, or the judiciary branch.

Familiarity with the World Bank Group (continued)
     Stakeholder differences: respondents from PMUs and consultants working on WBG
      supported projects were significantly more familiar with the WBG than respondents from
      other stakeholder groups.
     Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
      with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Panama, the extent to which the
      WBG plays a relevant role in development in Panama, and the extent to which the WBG
      helps to achieve development results in the country.

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Panama, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twenty two specific areas
of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Panama. The areas
       determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at health;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at rural development; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Panama, suggesting that ratings of
       effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
       analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at rural development;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at agricultural development; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction.

Appendix D: Responses to Selected Questions by Year19
*All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means of the FY 2016 data and the total number
of respondents each year will be slightly different from those in FY 2013 appendices.

FY 2013 Number of comparable respondents = 47  FY 2016 Number of comparable respondents = 125

By weighting the FY 2013 data against the FY 2016 data based on the question about current position
(H1: stakeholder group), the two years’ data has the same stakeholder composition and thus is
comparable. Only stakeholder groups which were present in both years were included in the weighting
and analysis. Respondents from the “office of parliamentarian,” “ NGO/Community Based
Organization,” “trade unions,” “faith-based groups,” “youth groups,” “the judiciary branch,” and
“other” were therefore not included in the analysis below. The weighted stakeholder breakdown is
