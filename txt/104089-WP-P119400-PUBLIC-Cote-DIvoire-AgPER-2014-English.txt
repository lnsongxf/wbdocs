Introduction

This diagnostic review of basic public expenditure in the agricultural sector in Côte d’Ivoire
forms part of the World Bank’s assistance to Côte d’Ivoire through its Strengthening National
Comprehensive Agricultural Public Expenditure in Sub-Saharan Africa Program. This program,
which is backed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, was developed to support the
implementation of the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) in
the context of the commitment made by African heads of state in Maputo in 2003 to allocate at
least 10% of their national resources to agriculture with a view to attaining agricultural growth of
at least 6% per year. It encourages governments and development partners (DPs) to target public
expenditure in the agricultural sector as the most efficient way to stimulate growth in the sector
and thereby reduce hunger and poverty.

Drawing on empirical data, this basic diagnostic review lays the foundations for a potential series
of more in-depth studies and for the implementation of a medium-term expenditure framework.

This review sets out to:

   1. Undertake a detailed examination of basic public expenditure in the wider agricultural
      sector in Côte d’Ivoire;
   2. Issue recommendations based on observation data with a view to improving the
      efficiency and fairness of public expenditure;
   3. Build capacities to enable the relevant personnel to subsequently undertake examinations
      of public expenditure thanks to the development of a database and cooperation with the
      corresponding teams.

The agricultural sector is defined here according to the Classification of the Functions of
Government (COFOG) established by the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD).
The agricultural sector includes agriculture in the broad sense (plant and livestock production),
forestry, and hunting and fishing. However, the COFOG definition excludes some of the
activities of the key ministries concerned (in particular feeder roads) but includes those activities
of other ministries that support the sector (including research and trade) and off-budget
expenditure. The study covers a 12-year period (1999–2010).

Two consultants were assigned to assist an Ivorian technical team made up of representatives
from the ministries concerned, the agricultural sector, and the subsectors. Two junior consultants
assisted in data collection. The Ministry of Agriculture (MINAGRI) oversaw coordination of the
technical team as well as of the entire study.

Context

                                                 1
By chance, the initial study covered the period of unprecedented socio-political crisis in Côte
d’Ivoire that lasted from 1999 to 2010 and that came to an end in May 2011. A cursory study of
the period 2011–2012 was requested by the Government and subsequently included in the
review.

The Ivorian economy, which had posted stellar growth from 1960 to 1980 on the back of the
development of agribusiness export sectors (coffee, cocoa, bananas, timber), has experienced
difficulties since 1980, with per capita gross domestic product (GDP), which had doubled
between 1960 and 1980, declining considerably and falling lower in 2011 than in 1960. As the
Government withdrew from economic production by privatizing productive subsectors, public
investment in the sector declined substantially.

The strategies implemented during the period under review therefore sought to increase
agricultural productivity, promote the sector’s diversification, and build capacities among small-
farmers' organizations.

Database

The database created as per the terms of reference originated from four sources: (i) data from the
Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) via the Integrated Public Finance Management System
(SIGFiP); (ii) off-budget expenditure; (iii) national statistics; and (iv) international statistics.

The SIGFiP database, which is the most reliable, comprises eight (8) data series formed by four
groups and two categories of expenditure. The groups are distinguished: by ministry, region,
industry, and public or private good, while the categories include financing sources and types of
expenditure. Each series covers both the allocated (or current) budget and committed or
(assumed) expenditure.

Levels and Trends

Levels of agricultural public expenditure (APE) give an indication as to the priority the
Government gives to the agricultural sector and to the stance the country has adopted in this area
compared to other countries over similar periods.

Côte d’Ivoire spent on average only CFAF 51.97 billion (or 4% of national resources) on
agriculture over the period 1999–2010, well below the 10% Maputo target (Figure 1). In fact, the
Maputo target has proved very difficult to meet: since 2003, only seven African countries have
met or exceeded it: Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Guinea, Malawi, Mali, Niger, and Senegal.
Moreover, the exclusion of some expenditures such as feeder roads from the COFOG definition
makes this target even harder to meet.

Off-budget expenditure plays an important role (28% of total APE) in meeting the Maputo target.
However, this role is difficult to estimate and this study recognizes not only that are these data
not as reliable as the SIGFiP source but they are also incomplete as the European Union (EU)
and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) are the only development partners (DPs) with
this type of expenditure that have provided data for the period 1999–2010. (The 2001 peak stems
from large EU contributions toward coffee and cocoa price STABLEX stabilization). Although
their inclusion skews the trend, their exclusion would have been just as arbitrary. Better
knowledge of off-budget data is crucial for planning sector support.

The evolution of expenditure by the dominant ministry, MINAGRI (Figure 2), suggests a marked
deterioration in APE from 1999 to 2005 (average annual growth rate of -9%) and a slow
improvement from 2006 until 2010 (growth of 2%). The first sub-period was marked by the 1999
coup followed by disputed elections in 2000 and an armed rebellion in 2002. Donors suspended
their support for the country for a period between 2002 and 2006.

We note that the agricultural sector was not a government priority from 1999 to 2010, in light of:
(i) levels and trends in APE; (ii) its share of the national budget, national GDP, and agricultural
GDP (AGDP); (iii) its low level; (iv) its very thin distribution in terms of constant APE among
the rural population (CFAF 4,200 per person per year); and (v) international comparisons with
other countries.

Functional Composition

The breakdown of APE shows priorities within the agricultural sector, i.e., the allocative
efficiency of APE. The question posed is the following: Through its budget allocations, what
priorities does the Government implicitly assign to the different ministries, the main subsectors,
the regions, and public goods versus private goods? The quality of actual expenditure is reflected
by the types of expenditure (wage, non-wage) underlying these priorities.

Relative to the other ministries, MINAGRI overwhelmingly dominated APE throughout the
period, with an average share of 72% of the budgeted total (i.e. SIGFiP data excluding off-budget
expenditures). In fact, that dominance was even greater if we also take into account off-budget
expenditures, which is almost exclusively allocated to plant production. This dominance seems
excessive in light of the goal of diversifying the agricultural sector even though ecological
conditions in Côte d’Ivoire are much more conducive to plant production than to livestock or


                                                4
aquaculture production.

Over the period, total allocations of agricultural expenditures to the subsectors of the three key
ministries represented CFAF 172 billion, or 28% of total APE including off-budget expenditure,
of which CFAF 99.47 billion was budgeted and CFAF 72.23 billion was off-budget. In fact, off-
budget expenditure tilts the order of priorities given to the subsectors heavily. Agribusiness
priorities dominated these allocations at the expense of staple crops, which in terms of budgeted
APE were the second priority after cotton, which the government felt forced to support
vigorously in light of the damage suffered by this industry (Figure 3). This shows once again the
importance of considering off-budget expenditures in budget allocations.

Figure 3: Average allocation of actual APE by subsector in 1999–2010 (%)

The performance of each subsector was inconsistent with these levels of expenditure over the
period under review. The best-performing crops were cashew (21% growth rate), papaya (11%),
and rubber (7%). The worst performances were recorded by bananas (-2%), cotton (-5%), coffee
(-10%), and pineapple (-13%). Yet cashew, of which Côte d’Ivoire is the largest African
producer, and papaya were neglected by public expenditure (Figure 3).

Budgeted regional allocations from the ministries supporting the agricultural sector amounted to
CFAF 126.9 billion, which represented 28.7% of total actual APE excluding off-budget
expenditures. This amount also excludes activities deemed to be of “national interest,” which
encompass anything that cannot be attributed to a region or constituent part. The Savanes region,
long-considered abandoned, received relatively more resources (25% of expenditures if we

                                                5
consider the geographical region rather than the more confined administrative regions) followed
by Nzi-Comoé (11%) in the center of the country and Montagnes (6%) in the west (Figure 4).
Unfortunately, it was not possible to identify in the SIGFiP data the activities financed in these
regions.

Capital transfers by the ministries concerned (especially MINAGRI) to the departments and
municipalities in support of decentralization have been budgeted since 2003. They were modest
(CFAF 5.7 billion, or 4% of total regional allocations) but are set to grow as a result of the new
decentralization policy announced in 2011 (with 30 regions and two autonomous districts set to
replace the 19 former regions). The largest share went to the Lacs region (home to
Yamoussoukro, the capital), with Nzi-Comoé coming ahead of Lagunes, where Abidjan is
located. Unfortunately, there has been no follow-up in either the SIGFiP database or the
ministries to determine how these transfers were used.

Economic Composition of APE

What agricultural public expenditure is used for has a decisive impact on the quality of this
expenditure. The key is to analyze the balance between capital expenditure and recurrent costs
(wage and non-wage).

Budgeted APE was primarily (80%) used to meet recurrent costs (wage and non-wage) on
average over the period. The share of wages was 48%, while non-wage expenditure accounted
for 32% and investment 20% on average. As regards the allocated budget, intentions (which are
ineffectual in times of crisis) seemed to strike a better balance, with a larger share apportioned to

                                                 6
investment (36%) followed by non-wage (33%) and wage expenditure (31%). Note that off-
budget expenditure is included under investment.

However, the reverse is the case when we analyze the economic composition of APE allocated to
the subsectors. Broadly speaking, spending more on wages than on investment in the
development of subsectors, which have been severely neglected since 1989–1090, does not
constitute good use of public resources. The data indicate that on average, the share of wages
was 16%, or half that of investments (33%). However, with non-wage expenditure outweighing
the two other categories combined, the recurrent costs of sectoral allocations represented over
three-quarters of budgeted APE. If off-budget expenditure were taken into account, the share of
wages would have been much smaller, but non-wage expenditure and investment would have
been difficult to distinguish.

Research, outreach, inputs, and feeder roads are limiting factors in agricultural growth.
Although feeder roads are excluded from the NEPAD COFOG definition, they are vital for
getting agricultural produce to market and for the supply of inputs and therefore deserve
particular attention. Research, outreach, and feeder roads are public goods, the creation of which
is in principle the reserve of Government but which the private sector can also satisfy in
partnership with the Government. Although inputs are private goods, the Government may be led
to subsidize them under specific circumstances.

Input subsidies represented 9% of APE (excluding off-budget expenditure) over the period 1999–
2010. Almost all (around 98%) of these subsidies financed inputs for plant subsectors (primarily
pesticides: 68% of subsidies), mainly to protect cotton and cocoa crops, followed by staple seeds
(29%), whereas inputs for livestock production (vaccines and animal pharmaceuticals) received
only around 2% of these subsidies.

The level of input use remains well below the country’s potential needs. Barriers to accessing
inputs remain primarily financial, although technical know-how should not be overlooked. Over
time, support for the organization of the subsectors should lead them to totally (or partially)
manage inputs themselves.

Total public expenditure on research over the period came to CFAF 60.12 billion (83% of which
was met by the Treasury), or the equivalent of 10.7% of MINAGRI expenditure, 8% of APE
excluding off-budget expenditure, 0.43% of actual national expenditure, and 0.23% of AGDP,
which falls short of the NEPAD target for national investment in agricultural R&D (at least 1%
of GDP).

The National Center for Agricultural Research (CNRA), the leading institution for agricultural
research, is largely dependent on the private sector, with 68% of its funding provided by the
InterProfessional Agricultural Research and Advisory Fund (FIRCA) and 10% by the West
African Agricultural Productivity Program (WAAPP).


                                                7
In broad terms, scientific research and technological innovation in Côte d’Ivoire are
characterized by: (i) a lack of a framework law guiding scientific research and technological
innovation; (ii) a low level of funding for research activities (around 0.05% of GDP); and (iii) a
lack of researchers.

The restructuring of agricultural outreach and research services in the 1990s gave rise to the
creation of the National Rural Development Support Agency (ANADER), the CNRA, and
FIRCA, which was created in 2003 and introduced reform of outreach, a public good, with
market-oriented privatization under public-private partnership.

The lion’s share of ANADER’s resources over the period 1999–2010 was provided by the
Government (87% of its CFAF 126.35 billion in funding). Over the period, the Government paid
CFAF 109.40 billion to ANADER, or 27% of APE for all three ministries. In the past three years,
ANADER has mobilized slightly more than 20% of its funding. This was the case in 2002–2010,
when it raised a total of CFAF 10,290,853,069 over 417 agreements identified. FIRCA remains
the agency’s leading partner (12%).

FIRCA’s resources stem from: (i) business contributions; (ii) contributions from public, private,
or external bodies; and (iii) exceptional receipts, subsidies, and financial income. The total
amount of funds mobilized since business contributions began (the coffee and cocoa subsector
excepted) until December 31, 2010 came to CFAF 19.601 billion, of which CFAF 18.594 billion
(95%) went to the development support program for contributing subsectors and CFAF 1.008
billion (5%) to FIRCA’s operating costs.

Over the period 1999–2010, total APE for outreach amounted to CFAF 545,395 million, with
off-budget financing representing 124.64% of budgeted expenditure. This represented on average
1% of AGDP for expenditure excluding off-budget items and 2.13% including off-budget items.

The degraded condition of rural and feeder roads is one of the main drivers of the increase in
poverty, in particular in rural settings. For example, while it took one hour in the wet season to
travel the 17km of road to reach the village of Zamblekro in the 1980s, twice as long was needed
in 2009. Although cocoa remains transportable, the sale of staple produce no longer makes
economic sense.

Over the period 1999–2010, budgeted expenditure (excluding off-budget expenditure) on feeder
roads amounted to CFAF 2.414 billion, of which 34.63% was financed by loans and 65.33% by
the Treasury.

All sources combined, APE on feeder roads came to CFAF 52.581 billion, of which CFAF
22.305 billion (42.42%) was financed by the subsectors, i.e., by the private sector. The size of the
contribution of the Rural Investment Fund (FIMR), which amounted to 39% of APE on roads, is
especially noteworthy, as is the investment effort made by the Government over the period 2003–
2006 (emergency program), subsequently extended by the subsectors and the EU between 2007

                                                 8
and 2010. Expenditure on feeder roads over the period accounted for 10.49% of APE (COFOG+,
i.e. COFOG including feeder roads).

Regional allocations were primarily used for investment (43%), with a very small amount
going to wages (15%). This economic composition should give comfort to the key ministries that
support these regions, even though details of the regions’ actions are lacking.

The production of public goods in budgeted APE (68%) outweighed that of private goods (32%)
on the basis of a simple categorization drawn from the main SIGFiP data series (Figure 5).
Fundamentally, consumption of a public good (e.g., information, outreach) by an individual does
not reduce its availability to a corresponding number of others, whereas consumption of a private
good (e.g. a grant) by an individual reduces its availability to everyone else. This split between
public and private goods in APE is surprising because the opposite is observed in most other
countries. However, this can be explained by the Government’s marked withdrawal from the
subsectors, as reflected by the 22% of budgeted APE that went to the subsectors (not to be
confused with the allocation of 28% of total APE taking into account off-budget expenditure).
The economic composition of public and private goods also seems to corroborate this finding
since we note very little in the way of wages (18%) and more investment (34%) in private goods
than in public goods (62% and 14%, respectively).

Financing Sources

An analysis of financing sources sheds additional light on the need, which is reflected in the data
on the economic composition of APE, to establish a solid foundation based on own resources in
order to underpin growth in the agricultural sector over the long term.

                                                9
Budgeted APE fell by 40% at the onset of the crisis (before the armed rebellion) due to poor
programming of Treasury funds (Figure 6) and little mobilization of external funds. Until 2002,
the Government still relied on grants and loans representing at least 50% of budgeted APE.
Direct grants and loans remained modest (14%) on average over the period. This ratio must have
been one of the lowest in the region during that period.

Figure 6: APE budget allocated and actual expenditure, 1999–2010 (CFAF billion)

The Treasury covered on average 87% of APE excluding off-budget expenditure and 62% of
total APE if we include off-budget expenditure over the period. If we consider only off-budget
EU expenditure, the Treasury’s coverage of expenditure allocated to the subsectors amounted to
only 40%. This reflects the importance and the preferred targets of EU resources during the study
period (Figure 7).

APE Financing Sources and Economic Composition

What sources of financing (grants, loans, Treasury) backed what types of expenditure (wages,
non-wages, investment)? Donors are always guided by the basic principle of seeing their
resources spent primarily on investment rather than on wages. A study of the data shows that
though modest, grants and loans did play this role (Figure 8). Note that some investment projects
can cover wages that are necessary for carrying out the investment although without necessarily
changing the nature of the project.

Figure 8: Types of expenditure according to financing source, 1999–2010 (%)




Source: SIGFiP, consultants’ research




The supplementary study (2008–2012) noted no significant change from the findings for the
period 1999–2010. The same subsectors remained disadvantaged and the Maputo objective was
far from attained. That said, any increase in the allocation to the sector should be consistent with
the objectives of the National Agricultural Investment Plan (NAIP) rather than with a view to
simply meeting the Maputo target.

The diagnostic review should now give way to specialized studies that require deeper
investigation before an assessment of the technical efficiency of expenditure can be made. Also
note that this assessment of efficiency in achieving strategic outcomes was made with the use of
different tools, including surveys of public expenditure, cost-effectiveness, incidence analysis,
and impact studies.

Budget Implementation and Execution

The budget implementation process contains 12 steps, which are probably necessary but
contribute to making it lengthy (March–December) and prone to delays. It contains no step for

                                                11
drafting a budget for the agricultural sector as a whole but for isolated budgets for its
components to be drafted independently. There were long delays of up to six months in making
the budget available over the period. A return to normal was observed from 2008.

The budget execution rate measures the technical efficiency of the budget’s implementation. It is
not surprising that execution rates were very low during the country’s unprecedented crisis
(Table 1). This rate was better for wages, which are a priority for the ministries, and for the
Treasury, which the Government manages much better than it manages grants and loans.

Table 1: Average budget execution rate, 1999–2010 (%)

  Type of expenditure               Wage      Non-wage          Investment           Total
    Execution rate                  90.4%      62.3%              34.9%             62.0%

The budget execution rate improved considerably during the second half of the first study period.
In terms of financing sources, the improvement stemmed above all from better programming of
Treasury funds. However, the difficulties experienced in mobilizing grants and loans appear to
have just been significantly reduced. This execution trend was confirmed after the crisis when we
consider the rates for the three ministries concerned: MINAGRI, MIRAH, and MINEF (Table 2).

Table 2: Average budget execution rates, 2011–2013 (%)

                      EXECUTION	RATES

      2012            93.4        88.3           95.7
      2013            90.6        93.1           51.6
Source: SIGFiP

However, we note that in 2013, MINEF posted an overall rate of 51.6% due to a low execution
rate of its investments (10.8%).

Budget execution rates are set to remain at a very high level now that the new Government has
made them a priority.

A test of the public expenditure system revealed significant delays in the implementation of
budget execution procedures. In a test carried out on 274 files, only 85 (31%) requests for
commitment were returned within the standard timeframe (eight days). The average time for
requests for commitment to be concluded is estimated at 16 days.

Although only a case study, the findings of this test suggest that these shortcomings in the

                                               12
implementation of budget execution procedures had a negative impact on the overall budget
execution rate.

   •   The sector should continue with the strategy (1999–2015) aiming to develop the
       subsectors with emphasis on those neglected over the period: fisheries and aquaculture,
       sustainable livestock farming, and the restoration of forestry assets. Fortunately, as this
       diversification is already included in the NAIP, it is simply a question of putting it into
       action.

   •   The ministries concerned should set up with a consultation mechanism to discuss the
       budgeting and programming of public investment for the sector. This consultation
       mechanism could be set up by the secretariat of the NAIP, which would play a
       coordinating role in the execution of sector-wide public investment.

   •   The budget execution rate should be validated by a follow-up of the budget because it
       does not necessarily display technical efficiency even when it is correct.

   •   Compliance with budget execution rules must be systematically documented in order to
       improve budget execution. The new Time Management directive, which consists in
       electronically verifying files sent and dates received, should serve as a tool for estimating
       timeframes in budget execution procedures.

   •   It will be necessary to strengthen capacities for drafting and executing budgets among the
       agricultural administrations in order to improve sector performances.

   •   It will also be necessary to consider reforms to the decentralized services of the
       agricultural sector ministries in order to grant them allocations that are commensurate
       with the functions attributed to them, including agricultural research.

In terms of inputs:

   1. To improve agricultural productivity, the level and quality of input use must be improved
      through measures such as:

       − Targeted subsidies for fertilizer prices;

       − Targeted subsidies for the prices of innovative small equipment;

       − The creation of a distribution network to improve the availability of inputs;

                                                13
       − A credit guarantee fund accessible to banks; and

       − The development of skills in family farm management to help them modernize.

   •   Over time, support for the organization of the subsectors should lead them to totally (or
       partially) manage inputs themselves.

In terms of agricultural research:

   •   Budget conferences should enable consultation between the key ministries concerned and
       the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research (MESRSCI) and its centers.

   •   The system designed to disburse funds must show flexibility by taking into account the
       fact that agricultural research (in particular in plant production) is highly weather-
       dependent.

   •   Within the framework of the NDP, the Government should increase the share allocated to
       agricultural research. The search for financing through regional and sub-regional
       programs should be encouraged (e.g., WECARD).

   •   Negotiations should be undertaken with industry leaders to identify a mechanism for
       ensuring their continued contribution.

   •   As the agribusiness subsector does not contribute to FIRCA, it should be called upon to
       do so.

In terms of outreach:

   •   Sector budgets will need to improve the share they allocate to training. It would be
       worthwhile to carry out an in-depth study into the decentralization of the regional
       directorates in order to improve their structure and equip them with the means of making
       a significant contribution to the system of outreach and project follow-up.

With regard to feeder roads:

   •   The involvement of the subsectors in the maintenance of feeder roads should be
       encouraged, in addition to government investment.

   •   A strategy paper should also be drafted on the maintenance of equipment and investments
       in general.

Recommendations for the Ministry of Economy and Finance

   •   Above all, the mobilization of funds must be improved and the cap raised or its
       constraints removed. This cap means that even if the budget is considered in place, only

                                              14
       commitments up to a very low level can be made due to a lack of funds. Splitting bulk
       orders that could benefit from a reduction in wholesale prices leads to delays and cost
       overruns.

Recommendations for the SIGFiP

   •   The SIGFiP should carry out validation tests of the database in order to identify the
       source of the data inconsistencies noted in this review. This is why series of budget
       allocations and commitments should be drawn separately if they are to be consistent.

   •   It would be timely to update the SIGFiP software in order to make it possible to export
       data in a more current Excel format instead of the very limited Excel 95 format.

   •   In terms of classification, the SIGFiP should continue to fine-tune the content of headings
       and subheadings while documenting the process and ensuring transparency in
       classification. Otherwise, it will be difficult to replicate the same analyses and obtain the
       same results, which remains the essential test of scientific objectivity.

   •   Off-budget expenditure should be included in the SIGFiP database to enable adequate
       analysis of it. If not, the ministries concerned and the DPs should agree on standard
       formats for collecting information through a tracking system that provides the level of
       detail required for analyzing APE.

   •   With regard to off-budget expenditure also, large investments have been made in the
       sector by the First Lady, the Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration Agency
       (ADDR), the National Plan against Climate Change (PNRC), etc. Traceability of this
       financing and especially of the evaluation of its impact would improve the level of APE
       identified.

                                   I. INTRODUCTION
As part of the implementation of the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program
(CAADP), Côte d’Ivoire adopted a National Agricultural Investment Plan (NAIP) in July 2010
for the period 2010–2015. Drawn from the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), this
program aims to achieve the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The
following is a brief extract from the NAIP.

From 1960 to 1980, thanks to significant public support for the agricultural sector that was the
envy of other countries in the sub-region, Côte d’Ivoire’s agricultural sector grew by 4.5%, with
Agricultural Gross Domestic Product (AGDP) representing 33.78% of total GDP. However, from
1981 to 1993, agricultural growth dropped to 1.11% even though AGDP still represented 28.74%
of total GDP. Over the period 1993–1998, which was marked by the devaluation of the CFA
franc and the liberalization of the agricultural sector, agricultural growth resumed but then
declined in 1997 due to a decrease in exports. Although AGDP grew by 4.61% annually, its
contribution to national GDP fell to 24.41% (a predictable trend since the secondary and tertiary
sectors grew even more rapidly). Today, Côte d’Ivoire is emerging from an unprecedented
political crisis (1999–2011), the lessons of which have not yet been fully evaluated.

A retrospective review of agricultural public expenditure (APE) provides the opportunity to
examine key aspects of agricultural policy over the defined period and to establish an objective
baseline for the assessment of future APE. On the basis of this review, conclusions can be drawn
and recommendations made to refine and update agricultural investment programs as well as the
medium term expenditure framework (MTEF). The West African Economic and Monetary Union
(WAEMU) has asked its member countries to set up such public expenditure planning
frameworks as of 2017. Côte d’Ivoire was selected as a pilot country for initiating an MTEF for
the agriculture subsector (crop production) within the framework of the WAEMU directive. This
basic APE diagnostic review will allow Côte d’Ivoire to rapidly extend the MTEF to the entire
agricultural sector and help the country comply with the WAEMU directive.

At its own request, Côte d’Ivoire was selected to receive assistance from the World Bank as part
of the Strengthening National Comprehensive Agricultural Public Expenditure in Sub-Saharan
Africa Program in order to conduct a basic APE diagnostic review.

This program, which is financed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and implemented by
the World Bank, aims to improve the impact of the meager public resources devoted by the
governments of Sub-Saharan African countries. It encourages governments and development
partners (DPs) to target APE as the most effective way of stimulating growth in the sector,
thereby reducing hunger and poverty. It is implemented as part of the CAADP of the African
Union’s (AU) New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), which encourages African
governments to increase the share of the national budget devoted to agriculture, with an objective



                                               16
of at least 10%, in order to achieve annual agricultural growth of at least 6% (Maputo
Declaration, 2003).

Objectives of the APE Diagnostic Review

The objectives of the basic APE diagnostic review in Côte d’Ivoire are as follows:

   4. To conduct a detailed examination of basic public expenditure for the entire agricultural
      sector in Côte d’Ivoire;
   5. To formulate recommendations based on observation data in order to improve the
      efficiency and fairness of public spending; and
   6. To strengthen the capacities of the managers concerned so as to enable them to carry out
      subsequent public spending examinations by developing databases and cooperation with
      partners.

Methodology

The review draws upon the following: (i) previous World Bank public expenditure studies; (ii)
publications from the various directorates (budget, public procurement, economic forecasting,
etc.) within the Ministry of Economy and Finance’s (MEF); (iii) the National Development Plan
(NDP) as well as various reports from the Public Investment Programs (PIP) of the Ministry of
Planning and Development (MPD) related to the three key ministries involved in the sector,
namely the Ministry of Agriculture (MINAGRI), the Ministry of Livestock and Fishery
Resources (MIRAH), and the Ministry of Water Resources and Forests (MINEF); and (iv) the
aforementioned ministries’ strategy documents, notably the NAIP.

Interviews were held with senior members of the aforementioned ministries, agricultural industry
leaders, DPs, and those in charge of operations under supervision (research, outreach,
development, etc.).

Data were collected by compiling data series from the Integrated Public Finance Management
System (SIGFiP) database and information provided by donors and para-public organizations.
The initial study covered 12 years (1999–2010) because the SIGFiP database, the most consistent
and easily accessible data source, contains no data for the period prior to its creation on January
1, 1999. The data for 2012 were not available when the study was launched, while the data for
2011, a year in which budget implementation was especially disastrous due to the crisis the
country was experiencing, would not have had a significant impact on the study. Although the
SIGFiP database made it relatively easy to extract detailed annual budget data for the period, off-
budget expenditure from donors was provided in aggregated form based on total costs for the
duration of the projects in question. A cursory study for the (post-crisis) 2011–2012 period was
subsequently required to ascertain any new developments, notably implementation rates.

For the purpose of this review, two consultants were recruited to assist an Ivorian technical team
that included representatives from the ministries involved in the agricultural sector and
representatives of agricultural industries. Two junior consultants helped collect data. MINAGRI
was responsible for coordinating the technical team and the entire study.

         II. STRATEGIC CONTEXT OF THE DIAGNOSTIC REVIEW

National Strategic Context

An examination of global trends in Côte d’Ivoire since independence reveals two periods: a first
from 1960 to 1979, and a second from 1980 to the present. The first is considered the “golden
age” of the Ivorian economy, while the second is marked by two important episodes related to
the devaluation of the CFA Franc in 1994 and the significant political instability that lasted from
1999 to May 2011. The evolution of constant per capita gross domestic product (GDP) clearly
illustrates these two main trends, with this rate nearly doubling from 1960 to 1979 before
plummeting and ultimately falling below the 1960 level in 2011. Agricultural expenditure, which
represented 24.4% of the Government’s overall budget in 1981, fell to 13% in 1984, then 9.7%
over the period 2002–2007, or below the Maputo threshold.

With the elaboration and implementation of the 1960–1970 ten-year outlook and the 1971–1975
and 1976–1980 five-year plans, government action was structured around strategic decisions that
were well defined both transversally and vertically. Moreover, the country's leaders opted for a
liberal economy that was open to the rest of the world, with economic growth relying heavily on
both private and public investments and just as heavily on foreign labor.

The majority of investments were allocated to agriculture, infrastructures, and the timber
industry. Thus, in the agricultural sector, export crops such as cocoa, coffee, and cotton, which
benefit from natural assets (including fertile land and good rainfall), were supported by
investments and technical and financial support from the public authorities. These crops
represented approximately 70% of exports of goods and services, with the primary sector, which
represented 35% of GDP, employing over two-thirds of the population.

Beginning in 1980, Côte d’Ivoire’s dependence on world prices for these primary products and
the Government’s deep involvement in economic production plunged the country into a severe
economic crisis. Cocoa prices fell by 40% between 1978 and 1986 and even further after 1987,
whereas the processing of these products remained relatively weak. Since the economy was
highly government reliant, it quickly deteriorated along with the government funding that
supported it. At the same time, the country lost the support of private investors and savers. Yet
Côte d’Ivoire launched vast public investment programs, even going beyond Public Investment
Program (PIP) forecasts, many of which the country did not want to turn its back on (such as
transferring the country's capital to Yamoussoukro). However, the loans contracted to carry out
these investments led the country into over-indebtedness. In order to stabilize this ever-
worsening situation, structural adjustment programs were implemented from 1981–1986, the
liberalization of the economy, with saw the Government withdraw from export industries, was
introduced in 1989–1990, and the CFA Franc had to be devalued in January 1994 because its
overvaluation was rendering the stabilization and privatization measures ineffective.

                                                19
The devaluation had a positive impact and investments as well as constant per capita GDP grew
substantially from 1995 to 1998. Although a return to tighter and more transparent public
resources management and the Government’s disengagement from the economy in the early
1990s allowed Côte d’Ivoire to capitalize on the devaluation, these benefits quickly began to
fade in 1998 as public resources management gradually deteriorated, leading to inflation. Until
the early 2000s, average prices for commodity products (cocoa, coffee) gradually fell on the
international market, a situation exacerbated by a steady decrease in overall productivity.

The investment/GDP ratio plummeted after 1979 (to 16%), to hold steady at the lower end (3%)
of the ratio achieved in Sub-Saharan Africa, and the poverty rate increased from 10% in 1985 to
48.9% in 2008. Following the post-electoral crisis of 2011, over half of the population was living
below the poverty line. It was estimated that poverty increased by three (3) percentage points
each time per capita GDP growth fell by one point (elasticity of 3 compared to only 0.93 for the
WAEMU zone as a whole). Despite ranking Côte d'Ivoire as a middle-income country, the
UNDP Human Development Index (HDI) for the period 1980–2012 (approximately 0.4) placed
it below the average for Sub-Saharan Africa, and even below the average indicating low human
development.

Demographic growth, which was supported by high levels of immigration, remained strong,
creating pressure on social services such as healthcare, education, and housing. The commodity-
producing regions of the country benefited the most from this growth, which resulted in regional
disparities in the distribution of the gains from this growth, not to mention the negative impact
on the natural resources base. For example, the exploitation of forests and their precious wood
was no longer sustainable, and the forest cover dropped from 70% to 30%.

The political instability that characterized the period 1999–2010 covered by this study, was
marked by three serious crises: the coup of 1999 followed by the contested elections of 2000, the
military-political crisis of 2002 that led to the country’s partitioning, and the post-electoral crisis
that lasted from November 2010 to April 2011.

Sectoral Strategies

Several strategy documents, the majority of which target the year 2015, cover the period studied
and beyond in overlapping fashion.

The 1988–2015 Forestry Master Plan laid the groundwork for the Ivorian forestry sector’s
development after a diagnosis that revealed the deterioration of the country’s forest resources as
a result of the uncontrolled clearing of land for agriculture, uncontrolled bush fires, and the
timber industry’s systematic exploitation of forests. Its major objectives were: (i) to maintain the
natural forest’s exploitable potential; (ii) to restore the plant cover, with a focus on pre-forest and
savannah zones; (iii) to reforest and manage land use in classified forests; (iv) to increase
operating performance; and (v) to improve processing and marketing.


                                                  20
The 1992–2015 Agricultural Development Plan (ADP) had the following primary objectives: (i)
improved productivity and competitiveness; (ii) increased self-sufficiency and food security; (iii)
agricultural diversification; (iv) the development of sea and lagoon fishing; and (v) the
rehabilitation of forest resources.

Under this plan, the privatization of agro-industries continued until 1999, with nearly all of the
agri-food industries being ceded to the private sector. The marketing monopolies and oligopolies
were dissolved. The coffee-cocoa pricing mechanism was liberalized through automatic
indexation to world prices, and the same principle was applied to the majority of agricultural
commodity exports. Several actions were taken to encourage agricultural modernization, the
organization of agricultural stakeholders, and the implementation of more effective management
tools. These actions included the elimination of the Stabilization Fund (CAISTAB), the grouping
of agricultural support and outreach structures under a single National Rural Development
Support Agency (ANADER), the strengthening of agricultural research through the creation of a
single central entity, the National Center for Agricultural Research (CNRA), and the organization
of the sector’s operators and stakeholders through the creation of cooperatives and producers’
associations.

The 2009 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), which was drafted as part of a participatory
process, was adopted by the Government on March 26 of that year and approved by the
executive boards of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund on March 27 and 31,
2009,1 respectively. In addition to government revenues, the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) is
primarily funded from budget resources and support from development partners (DPs) in the
form of budget support and project and program grants and loans.

Amounting to over CFAF 40.4 billion in 2009, the budget allocations for the agricultural sector
dropped to CFAF 38.2 billion in 2010 and CFAF 34.2 billion in 2011. In all, for the period 2009–
2011, this sector received over CFAF 112.8 billion, or approximately 3.3% of actual expenditure
for the PRS. This percentage reflects how insufficient allocations for the sector were in view of
the Maputo commitment.

Investment expenditures primarily targeted: (i) the West African Agricultural Productivity
Program (WAAPP) for plantains, corn, yams, and traditional pork; (ii) the National Project for
Land and Rural Equipment Management (PNGTER), which aimed to improve the standard of
living and living conditions of rural communities by implementing a land policy that would
provide greater security for farmers and facilitate the resolution of land disputes as well as land
development and concerted land management by rural communities; (iii) support for small fruit
and vegetable farmers; (iv) hydro-agricultural developments in the Fromager and Haut Sassandra
regions; and (v) the revitalization of rice farming.2 The implementation of NEPAD’s CAADP

requires each regional economic community to draft a common regional agricultural policy and
each country to develop a National Agricultural Investment Plan (NAIP) through which to
implement this regional policy.3 Following the West African Economic Community Agricultural
Policy (ECOWAP), which was approved by member states of the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) in 2005, Côte d’Ivoire adopted its 2010–2015 NAIP in 2010, at an
overall cost of CFAF 624.367 billion.

The fundamental principle underlying Côte d’Ivoire’s NAIP was to define the essential
development actions that would reduce poverty nationwide, beginning with a thorough analysis
of the pace of economic growth in general and of the agricultural sector in particular. Seven
objectives were identified: (i) improve the productivity and competitiveness of crop, livestock,
and fishery productions; (ii) develop the sector’s industries; (iii) improve agricultural sector
management; (iv) strengthen the capacities of stakeholders involved in agricultural development;
(v) strengthen the activities of the fishery and aquaculture sectors; (vi) improve the sustainable
management of livestock production; and (vii) strengthen the activities of the timber and forestry
sector.

The 2012–2015 National Development Plan (NDP) is the new framework for public
interventions and political dialogue. For the purpose of improving the sector and reducing
extreme poverty and hunger, its key measures involve: (i) the elaboration, adoption, and
enactment of an agricultural framework act; (ii) the implementation of a farmer/breeder conflict
prevention and resolution mechanism; (iii) the identification of farmers, breeders, fishermen, and
their holdings; (iv) the implementation of a measure designed to enforce rural land law; (v) the
implementation of specialized funding channels for agriculture using long-term and cost-
effective resources; (vi) strengthening the technical capacities of those involved in the production
chain of agricultural, food and nutrition data; (vii) the renewal of coffee and cocoa plantations
and support for the creation of new intensive plantations; (viii) the revival of cotton, pineapple,
cashew, and rice production; and (ix) the strengthening of the fish and tuna products export
system.

The cost of funding for the agriculture, livestock, and fishery sector amounted to CFAF 940.338
billion for the period 2012–2015, or 8.49% of the total cost of the NDP (CFAF 11,076 billion).
The financing package earmarked for the Water Resources and Forestry sector is CFAF 46.588
billion, or 0.42% of the total cost of the NDP.4

Institutional Framework

Several ministries are directly involved in agricultural development, including: MINAGRI,
which is in charge of crop production and hydro-agricultural development; MIRAH, which is
responsible for livestock and fishery productions; MINEF, which is in charge of classified and
unclassified forests; the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research (MESRSCI),
which is responsible for agricultural training and research; and the Ministry of Trade (MC),
which supports the marketing of agricultural products.

In addition to these ministries, several para-public agencies, autonomous agencies, and
interprofessional organizations participate in the development of the agricultural sector,
including the following:

The Forestry Development Agency (SODEFOR), a State entity, is responsible for: (i) the
sustainable development of all classified forests entrusted to it; (ii) forest preservation through
monitoring and the involvement of local populations in forest management; (iii) replenishing
timber stocks through reforestation; (iv) the development and management of these forests using
their existing potential and taking all dimensions of the forest environment into consideration in
their sustainable management.

The National Agency for Rural Development’s (ANADER) is tasked with helping improve
living conditions in rural areas by devising and implementing appropriate agricultural training
tools and programs for the sector’s sustainable and controlled development in order to
professionalize the work of farmers and their interprofessional organizations. To carry out its
actions, ANADER relies on a vast network of supervisory and rural development agents based
throughout the country.

The National Center for Agricultural Research (CNRA) is the primary agricultural research
agency in Côte d’Ivoire. Its mission is to: (i) group agricultural research under a single yet
decentralized body in order to improve its effectiveness and bring it closer to farmers; (ii)
encourage cooperation between the Government and private farmers for research orientation,
management, and funding; and (iii) conduct research that reflects the concerns of Ivorian
agriculture and ensure that the results are applied effectively.

The National Association of Professional Agricultural Organizations of Côte d’Ivoire
(ANOPACI), created in 1998 to defend the collective interests of farmers, encompasses all
industries in the agricultural sector. These are represented by: the Interprofessional Livestock and
Small Ruminant Confederation, associations of hog producers and poultry farmers (IPRAVI),
coffee and cocoa producers, the National Rubber Professionals’ Association (APROMAC), the
Interprofessional Palm Oil Association (AIPH), the Pineapple and Banana Producers and
Exporters Central Organization (OCAB), non-traditional fruit farmers, cotton farmers
(INTERCOTON), food producers, cashew farmers, and a microfinance institution. Agro-
industrial chains such as AIPH and APROMAC have played an increasingly important role since
                                                23
the liberalization of the economy, especially in terms of feeder road construction and
maintenance.

The Interprofessional Agricultural Research and Advisory Fund (FIRCA), created in 2002,
is a funding mechanism for agricultural and forestry research programs, agricultural advisory
services, agricultural training programs, and programs designed to strengthen the capacities of
professional agricultural organizations. For example, FIRCA helps fund ANADER and CNRA.
In accordance with agreements with the various industries, FIRCA and the industries involved
have implemented mechanisms for collecting members' dues, which appear to be functioning
smoothly. According to these agreements, funds are allocated based on the nature of the
programs on the one hand and the FIRCA administration on the other, with this funding varying
by industry.

The National Rice Development Agency (ONDR), created in 2010, is responsible for
implementing the revised 2012–2020 National Rice Development Strategy (SNDR). It follows
the National Rice Program (PNR).

      III. COFOG CLASSIFICATION AND THE AGRICULTURAL PUBLIC
                       EXPENDITURE DATABASE

COFOG Classification for the Agricultural Sector

In order that comparisons with other countries can be made, the agricultural sector is defined
here according to the United Nations Classification of the Functions of Government (COFOG),
which forms the basis for NEPAD COFOG.5 For that purpose, the agricultural sector
encompasses agriculture in a broad sense, including crops and livestock production, forestry, and
hunting and fishing. Three characteristics of NEPAD COFOG apply:

(i) NEPAD COFOG excludes some expenditure from key ministries in the agricultural sector:
MINAGRI, MINEF, and MIRAH. The budgets and expenditures for the following are also
excluded: the management of national parks and wildlife and plant reserves, forestry activities
for non-timber forest products, police monitoring of high sea fishing operations, and feeder
roads.

(ii) It includes expenditures not administered by the sector’s key ministries but rather by other
ministries, whose actions have the explicit aim of supporting the sector. In this case, these
ministries are the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research (MESRSCI – support for
agricultural and fisheries research) and the Ministry of Trade (MC – actions in support of the
marketing of food products).

(iii) It also includes off-budget expenditures for the production of public goods that are not
recorded in the national budget but that contribute to the sector’s development. The team had
great difficulty collecting data about these off-budget expenditures from donors and non-
governmental organizations (NGOs). These off-budget expenditures come from the European
Union (EU), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), FIRCA (Interprofessional
Agricultural Research and Advisory Fund), ANADER (National Rural Development Support
Agency), and the National Rice Program (PNR), which became the National Rice Development
Agency (ONDR) in 2010. The team recognizes that the off-budget expenditures presented here
are incomplete and much less reliable than those provided by the SIGFiP database.

Thus constituted, the COFOG for the agricultural sector is not presented according to the
agriculture, forestry, hunting, and fishing definition but rather according to the SIGFiP
classification, that is, according to the structure of the sector’s key ministries and the other
ministries that support it. This enhances the clarity of the analysis and allows the current
ministerial structures to see how they compare with the other players in the sector. As concerns
these comparisons, it is important to note that some expenditures (for feeder roads, in particular)
are excluded from ministerial expenditure.

The APE Database

The database created for this diagnostic review of basic agricultural public expenditure (APE) is
composed of four elements, with the first two being more difficult to compile than the latter two:
(i) data taken from the SIGFiP database; (ii) estimates of off-budget expenditures; (iii) national
statistics; and (iv) international statistics.

SIGFiP is a software package that forms a network between all of the main public finance actors
(expenditures and revenues) in Côte d’Ivoire.6 It formalizes the interventions of all actors in the
chain within a single framework by digitizing and integrating all levels of action in a single
system consisting of authorizing officer, financial controller, and accounting officer. Each of
these actors has an entry key for the software. The system ensures the coordinated management
of Government revenues and expenditures. As concerns expenditure, SIGFiP makes it possible to
institute a monthly expenditure regulation and planning policy, which helps keep the
Government’s arrears to a strict minimum.

SIGFiP uses a 15-digit nomenclature composed of the following: the two-digit section code
(ministry), the nine-digit expenditure destination code (which comprises chapter and sub-
chapter), and the four-digit code indicating the economic nature of the expenditure (article,
paragraph, and line).

Eight (8) series are taken directly from the SIGFiP database:7 four grouped by ministry, and four
grouped by region. Each group includes the expenditure type (wage costs, non-wage costs, and
investments) and the funding source (grant, loan, or Treasury) for both the allocated (or current)
budget and the assumed costs (ACs) (or actual expenditure). For drawings from lines of credit
using the 15-digit SIGFiP classification code, each of the eight (8) series (for the ministries
concerned here) constitutes a table of over 16,000 lines and 41 columns of data. Eight (8) other
series were filtered from the main series: expenditure for the sector’s industries, and expenditure
for public and private goods. The database thus contains all 16 data series and was also used to
compile a series of expenditure types by funding source for the sector’s key ministries.

The SIGFiP database made adjustments designed to take into account ministries that had been
combined with others to create a “super ministry” or that had changed its name during the period
studied. In addition, data regarding the Ministry of the Environment, Urban Waste, and
Sustainable Development, which has existed alongside MINEF since 2008 but is not involved in
the agricultural sector, had to be removed. Expenditure related to the fishing agreements
established under MINAGRI was also adjusted by transferring it from MINAGRI to MIRAH.
However, it was difficult to separate central administration expenditures for ministries that were
split into two or merged with another ministry. While for a given ministry, the titles of some

    The same SIGFiP instrument is used by the other WAEMU member countries.
7
    Compiling this database took longer and was more difficult than expected due to the sophistication of the SIGFiP
    system, the size of the requests, and an initial lack of coherence in the data resulting from ministry name changes.

                                                           26
categories may have survived a merger with another ministry, the expenditures they contain may
no longer correspond to its title.

Despite the great care taken to adjust the data, some data may not have been fully adjusted.
While this may have a slight influence on the distribution between ministries, it should not affect
the sector’s total expenditure.

Data consistency was reestablished when SIGFiP treated the current budget and the assumptions
of costs as part of two separate files (thus creating the 8 main series mentioned above) rather
than as a single file. In the latter case, for a yet unknown reasons, the data were incoherent from
one file to the next and from one adjusted file to another. For example, the total of the allocated
budget by expenditure type may have been different from the total of the same allocated budget
by funding source.

The collection of data on off-budget expenditures posed yet another challenge. The data from
those development partners (DPs) who were able to provide their data on time were entered as
total costs for the duration of the project in question. The team thus had to estimate their annual
expenditure based on the project start and end dates. As concerns ANADER, FIRCA, and ONDR
(ex-PNR), the team had to avoid counting again expenditure already treated by the SIGFiP
database as well as expenditure already taken into account by the DPs in question, the EU, and
the FAO. The team also had to ensure that it did not count the FAO’s conventions with the EU
twice.8

The national statistics were collected from the National Statistical Institute (INS) and from
ministerial data. The international statistics were provided primarily by the World Bank and the
FAO.

In general, the government’s information system does not yet provide the means to consolidate
an APE database in a clear and coherent manner. The difficulties encountered with the SIGFiP
data and off-budget expenditure are a clear reflection of this position. These two aspects must be
improved if the database is to provide a detailed representation of agricultural public
expenditure.

    In accordance with COFOG, the Interprofessional Palm Oil Association’s expenditure on feeder roads was
    excluded. Given that the project names did not always reflect their precise actions, it was difficult to distinguish
    between expenditure for public and for private goods.

 IV. AGRICULTURAL BUDGET EXPENDITURE: LEVELS AND TRENDS
An analysis of levels of agricultural budget expenditure (ABE) shows the level of priority the
Government has assigned to the agricultural sector as well as the position reached by Côte
d’Ivoire in this area compared with other countries over similar periods of time. In particular, the
ABE share of the national budget is an indicator monitored by the government and its NEPAD
peers because in Maputo in 2003, they all committed to spending at least 10% of their resources
on the agricultural sector each year. Beyond the level of these expenditures, we know that a
steady rise and relative stability in ABE help encourage growth in this sector. Conversely, a
negative trend and great variability in these expenditures will not promote effective planning for
the sector’s development. The analysis also takes these considerations into account.

Share of Agricultural Budget Expenditure in the National Budget

Table 3 shows total actual ABE data collected according to COFOG criteria but presented
according to the local SIGFiP classification. As discussed earlier, the agricultural sector COFOG
(CFAF 52 billion on average for the period) includes expenditures by the key ministries in the
sector (CFAF 33 billion), those of other ministries that support the sector (CFAF 4 billion), and
off-budget outlays (CFAF 15 billion). It should also be noted that COFOG excludes feeder roads.

Actual expenditures, or assumed costs (AC – the document uses these two terms
interchangeably), consist of what the ministries and government agencies actually have available
for carrying out their activities. These expenditures must be distinguished from the budget passed
and allocated (or the actual budget), which can be viewed as an estimate, not all of which is
always made available to the implementing bodies. NEPAD requires using actual expenditures
rather than allocated budgets in calculating the Maputo indicator. These expenditures are shown
in Table 3.

*** Maputo Test based on allocated budgets



Over the 1999–2010 period, the share of ABE (excluding feeder roads but including off-budget
expenditures) in the national budget was around 4% on average, well below the minimum 10%
bar adopted by the Heads of State at the Maputo conference in 2003. In fact, Côte d’Ivoire’s
shortfall vis-à-vis this level actually increased after 2003. After a long period of decline, it was
not until 2008 that ABE found its 1999 level, supported in that by off-budget expenditures. In
contrast, the national budget underwent satisfactory, even remarkable growth (6.6%) during this
period of crisis, resulting in a downward trend in the relative share of ABE in the national
budget. However, it should be noted that the Maputo criterion has proved very difficult to meet
ever since it was introduced. In fact, over the 2003–2010 period, only seven countries on average
met or exceeded the Maputo criterion: Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Guinea, Malawi, Mali, Niger, and
Senegal (ReSAKSS, 2011, Country SAKSS report, and 2012 Plan).

                                                   29
It should be stressed that NEPAD COFOG considers only actual expenditure. Inasmuch as actual
expenditures are generally limited in relation to allocated budgets, it is worthwhile considering
the country’s intentions in drafting the budget. To do this, we need to compare agricultural and
national expenditures in terms of allocated budgets. (For comparative purposes, we added the
same off-budget expenditures to the sector’s current budget as in the Maputo test case based on
actual expenditures because we do not have the off-budget forecasts.) As Table 3 shows, Côte
d’Ivoire was fairly close to meeting the Maputo criterion and would easily have surpassed it in
2001. However, that was before the Heads of State took the stance they did in 2001. Moreover, it
would have been based on a very large off-budget European Union (EU) project that year.
Subsequently, as in the case of the level of actual expenditure, the gap increased as the study
period proceeded, averaging around 5%.

Off-budget spending, which accounted for 28% of total ABE, was dominated by EU funding,
which accounted for 52% of that amount over the period. According to the COFOG
classification, the estimate of EU off-budget amounts did not take into account: (i) expenditures
for feeder roads, or (ii) expenditures deemed to fall outside of the agricultural sector (drinking-
water supply, sanitation, village infrastructure, etc.).9 In addition, with regard to EU off-budget
spending, Table 4 shows a very high peak for the coffee/cacao STABEX in 2001, representing
47% of EU expenditures. Including other EU operations, off-budget spending for 2001
accounted for over 60% of total expenditure. Although such a proportion can distort any
calculation of averages and growth rates, so does arbitrarily not taking it into account. Off-
budget amounts from other sources were estimated while avoiding counting EU agreements
(involving the FAO and ANADER) twice as well as the national budget (ANADER, FIRCA, and
ONDR). The FAO share of off-budget spending was around 21% over the period, while FIRCA’s
was 11%, and ANADERs and ONDR’s 7%.

    Much more detailed data than those provided again recently by the EU might lead to a different classification of
    these expenditures and possibly to different amounts. The EU’s average share of off-budget expenditures would be
    32% rather than 52% if its 2001 contribution were arbitrarily not taken into account.

The impact of the EU’s 2001 off-budget expenditures can be seen in the change in ABE for the
period (Figure 9). The figure also shows that over the years, MINAGRI transferred some of these
expenditures to off-budget expenditures and others to other ministries included in the
composition of the ABE. Of these other ministries, the Ministry of Higher Education and
Scientific Research (MESRSCI) plays the key role (through specialized thematic studies) relative
to the Trade Ministry (MC).

The trend in total ABE is masked by great variability in off-budget spending (RSD: 103%). To
detect this, we need to consider changes in ABE excluding off-budget spending, and especially
changes in MINAGRI’s spending. Figure 10 suggests a significant deterioration in ABE from
1999 to 2005 (CAGR around -9 %) and slow improvement from 2006 to 2010 (CAGR around
2%) toward the levels reached in 1999 and 2000. This could be attributable to an improvement in
the crisis situation, which was marked by problems at the start of the period, including a coup in
1999, rebellion in 2002, and the Marcoussis accords of 2003, which were immediately followed
by tensions. It should be noted that Figure 10 does not suggest the same trend for MIRAH,
MINEF, or the other ministries.

The share of ABE in GDP AGDP was low (0.6% and 2.5% on average, respectively) and did not
begin to stabilize until 2006 after reaching its lowest point in 2005. ABE could not be maintained
at the GDP and AGDP level, as was the case in relation to the national budget. Although modest,
GDP and AGDP growth rates (3.6% and 3.9%, respectively) remained above that of ABE (2.0%)
over the entire period. These rates should be compared to those for growth in the national budget
(6.6%), which seems to flout the GDP and AGDP growth rates despite the crisis the country was
experiencing.

An international comparison of ABE (Table 6) reveals that in high-income countries with low
AGDP, the share of ABE in relation to GDP is low while its share of AGDP is very high. This
remains true even for middle-income countries, where the share of AGDP is moderate. In
contrast, in low-income countries, which are more dependent on agriculture, the share of ABE in
AGDP is low. Among these countries, Côte d’Ivoire generally ranks below its peers.

The agricultural orientation index also remained weak. The extent to which ABE reveals the
sector’s importance to the economy can be measured using this index. This standardized measure
of the importance of agriculture is calculated as the ratio of the share of ABE in the national
budget to the share of the agricultural sector in national GDP (Table 7). An index equal to parity
would indicate that ABE reflects the agricultural sector's contribution to the national economy.
Below parity, ABE is lower than its contribution, and above parity, it is more significant than is
reflected by the sector’s contribution to the economy. For Côte d’Ivoire, the agricultural
orientation index was relatively weak (0.17 on average) and even worsened (-6.3%) over the
period. This is not surprising considering the negative trend in the ABE's share of the budget,
whereas the share of AGDP in GDP remained relatively steady.

However, the agricultural orientation index is used far more often to compare countries with one
another rather than to necessarily indicate how the agricultural sector is treated in relation to
other sectors of a country’s economy. In practice, public expenditure is not necessarily allocated

                                                     35
to many other sectors in relation to the size of their contribution to national GDP.10 Compared to
other African countries, Côte d’Ivoire was one of the poorest-performing countries in terms of
allocating public resources to the measurement of the agricultural sector’s contribution to the
country’s economy (Table 7).

Per capita ABE remained low during the period. Figure 11 shows constant actual ABE (1996 =
100) per rural resident (CFAF 4,264 per year on average) to be falling compared to the slightly
upward trend seen in the distribution of current ABE (CFAF 5,445 per year). This is explained by
the fact that ABE at constant prices fell (-2.6 %) while the rural population (with an average of
9,543,776) grew modestly (by 0.5%) over the period. In terms of the distribution of the total
budget among the entire population for the period, the rural population still accounted for over
half (54.4%) of the total population despite urban growth (3.5%).

      It should also be noted that if a country manages to substantially mobilize private investment in the sector, it can
     choose to reduce its ABE. Although it would not achieve parity in agricultural orientation, it might not suffer
     substantially from this choice.

            V. FUNCTIONAL AND ECONOMIC COMPOSITION OF
                  AGRICULTURAL PUBLIC EXPENDITURE
Expenditure levels in agriculture and trends in spending reveal the priority given to the sector by
the national government relative to other sectors. Furthermore, analyzing the composition of
agricultural public expenditure (APE) reveals the priorities among subsectors and makes it
possible to measure the allocative efficiency of this expenditure. Functional composition in
expenditure refers in this instance to allocations to subsectors such as crop, livestock, or tree
production. (Spending allocated to research and development, training and outreach, inputs, and
feeder roads are addressed in detail in separate studies in annex to this summary report.)
Economic composition refers to spending on wages, non-wage operating costs, and investments.
In examining the government's budgetary allocations, what priorities can implicitly be assigned
to the various agriculture-related ministries, the major agricultural sectors (crops vs. others crops
and crops vs. livestock), the country’s various regions, and the creation of public goods relative
to private goods? In addition to analyzing spending levels, the quality of these expenditures can
also be assessed by reviewing what these funds actually bought. Data revealed that the largest
share of expenditure paid for operational or recurring costs (especially wages). The fact that
investments received the smallest share is worrisome since this points to a weak foundation for
future growth.

Subsector Allocation

In this report, the subsector analysis did not take into account off-budget expenditure since these
data were not broken down by the Ministry in comparable detail as in the SIGFiP data. This will
be discussed later. Table 8 presents APE for the period under review for each key ministry and
for ministries with an ancillary role in agriculture.

Over the period under review, MINAGRI dominated APE by a wide margin, accounting for 72%
of total expenditure on average. The other key sector ministries (MIRAH and MINEF) had far
smaller shares of total expenditure. This unequal distribution is not wholly surprising given that
environmental conditions in Côte d'Ivoire are far less favorable to livestock production than to
cultivation, the latter having severely encroached upon forested land. A review of the executed
budget of the three key ministries shows that MINAGRI’s share of total APE was 81% on
average over the period compared with 8% for MINEF and 11% for MIRAH. In fact, at the time
of budget allocation (current budget), the share earmarked for MINAGRI was even higher
(83%), even though MINAGRI’s share of expenditure fell following budget execution. This issue
will be addressed later in this report.

Off-budget expenditure was included in the sector analysis in order to provide a more complete
picture of spending. Although off-budget expenditure was not fully detailed, it was known, for
example, that the National Rice Development Agency (ONDR) provides assistance to the rice
sector and therefore contributes to MINAGRI's activities. A review of funding from the
European Union (EU) also showed that these funds were directed by and large to crop production
(98%), with a much smaller share going to livestock production (2%). In terms of funding from
the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the National Rural Development
Support Agency (ANADER), and the Interprofessional Agricultural Research and Advisory Fund
(FIRCA), it was estimated that 80% went to crop production and the remaining 20% to livestock
production. The trees and timber sector received substantial support from the Forestry
                                                39
Development Agency (SODEFOR), whose funds were estimated at over CFAF 120 billion for
the period. However, since these funds consist of the gross revenues of a private firm, they were
not taken into consideration.11

Functional Composition by Sector

Executed expenditure allocated to sectors represented a total of CFAF 99.4 billion during the
period, or 22% of total executed APE and 25% of expenditure by key ministries. These
budgetary allocations (excluding off-budget expenditures, which will be discussed later) were
intermittent. This appeared to reflect a policy begun in 1989–1990 of government divestment
from major traditional export sectors as much as a lack of funds. While the coffee/cocoa sector
received allocations for the 1999–2002 period and the rubber sector received allocations for the
1999–2000 period, the pork/poultry sector received allocations in 2004 and 2009 only, and the
cotton/sugar cane12 sector received relatively large allocations during 2002–2006 and 2008–2010
(with cotton receiving the bulk of these). Only the rice, food crops, trees/timber, beef, veterinary
health and reproduction, fishing and aquaculture, and palm oil sectors received allocations over
the entire period under review. The cashew sector, of which Côte d'Ivoire is now the leading
African producer, was strikingly absent from the inventory of sectors that received public
funding. Dedicated surveys should seek to understand the factors behind private sector-led
growth in certain agricultural industries.

To better capture the priorities given to the sectors, it is useful to compare planned expenditure
(allocated budget) to actual expenditure (executed budget). Table 9 shows that over 75% of the
allocated budget was earmarked for funding four sectors: over 28% for the rice sector,13 followed
by the food crops, cotton, and cattle sectors (in descending order). As a whole, although these
sectors received an allocated budget (76%), the order of priority changed in execution, with the
cotton sector overtaking the food crops sector as top recipient. In fact, food crops production fell
to last place, behind the livestock sector.

Contrary to planned expenditure, the cotton and sugar cane sectors were prioritized because they
were considered distressed and required assistance if they were to recover. The Ivorian Cotton
Corporation (LCCI), which managed the cotton sector, had gone bankrupt and had thus placed
the financial situation on the worst footing, and the government wanted to help the sector recover
with assistance from donors, including the EU.

    Note that direct transfers from the Government to SODEFOR are accounted for in SIGFiP data and are therefore
   taken into consideration in this report. However, this report does not track down any possible transfers from
   SODEFOR to the Government in order to calculate net transfers, as directed by the NEPAD COFOG
   methodology.
12
    Curiously, these two products are grouped in SIGFiP, as are palm oil/coconut and all fruits and vegetables.
13
    At one point, a case study of irrigation in agriculture was planned but was abandoned for lack of time. Such a
   study would have been useful for understanding changes in expenditure allocated to rice.

A comparison of allocated budget with executed budget shows that only the share of expenditure
for the crops sector fell despite considerable spending in the cotton sector. However, lower
expenditure in the crops sectors corresponded to higher expenditure in the livestock and fish
sectors rather than in the trees/timber sector (Figure 12). While the crops sector continued to
dominate expenditure, the other sectors received more than marginal shares of expenditure
during the 1999–2010 period, at least from the perspective of allocated budgets.

Off-budget expenditure funded by the EU was primarily directed to specific sectors, and these
additional resources must be taken into account if we are to attain a more complete picture. Of
the CFAF 85 billion14 disbursed by the EU to the agricultural sector in Côte d'Ivoire for the
period, almost 84% consisted of direct support to agricultural sectors. This direct support
amounted to CFAF 72.2 billion, and accounted for almost 73% of the government’s total
allocations to agricultural sectors. As noted in the analysis of expenditure levels and trends, a
lack of time prevented the consultants from reviewing in detail the CFAF 43 billion disbursed
under the STABEX coffee/cocoa heading. These funds represented over half of the EU’s
contribution to agricultural sectors. Among the other programs financed by the EU, priority was
given to revitalizing the distressed cotton sector and the struggling banana and sugar cane
sectors.

The technical support from the EU directed at the cotton sector sought to improve its financial
health (e.g., paying arrears due to LCCI producers, providing liquidity, reviving the seed
propagation, reviving draft animal power in agriculture, restoring producers’ organizations, and
rehabilitating the cotton fiber classification premises). For the banana sector, as for the sugar
cane sector, the objective was to increase competitiveness, with the longer-term goal of

      It should be noted that these sums exclude funds for feeder roads and some rural development projects that are not
     strictly agricultural, such as water supply projects.

eliminating preferential treatment by the EU (e.g., lower tariffs and no quotas) for former
colonies in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific (ACP), especially relative to Latin American
countries.

If off-budget EU-funded expenditure is taken into consideration, and especially funding directed
at the coffee/cocoa sectors, the order of priority changes in comparison to ranking sectors by
ministry expenditure alone (10). Not only did the crops sectors dominate allocations to the
agricultural sector, absorbing close to 80% of the total, but within the crops sector itself, priority
allocation favored traditional export sectors, including coffee/cocoa, bananas, cotton, and sugar
cane at the expense of rice production and other food crops sectors (Table 10).

However, performance in agricultural sectors during the period under review was not in line with
the level of expenditure15 (Figure 13). The sectors that saw the most growth over the 2000–2009
period were the cashew nuts sector, with an annual average growth rate of 21%, followed by the
papaya sector (11%) and the rubber sector (7%). None of the remaining sectors had an annual
average growth rate of more than 5%, indicating that the agricultural sector as a whole did not
meet expectations during the period. Of the sectors that received the most funding, only the rice,
food crops, and sugar cane sectors saw positive (albeit weak) growth. Other sectors, such as
pineapples, bananas, and cotton, were among those that contracted during the period.




15
      Note that this indicator remains imperfect. Lacking complete information, the consultants were unable to calculate
     the ratio of each sector's share of public expenditure to the sector’s contribution to agricultural GDP. A ratio that is
     greater than one suggests that the sector in question receives funding in excess of its contribution to agricultural
     GDP, all other factors being equal.

                                                              43

The two sectors that saw the largest gains received no (or very little) direct public assistance.
(Note that although the papaya sector is included in the fruits and vegetables group, it was not
targeted by any projects.) Growth in these sectors was therefore the result of private investment
alone (or mostly) over the period. However, it should be noted that cashew nuts production was
first introduced using government funds between 1960 and 1970 in line with an environmental
policy promoting reforestation and soil erosion control. Between 1972 and 1989, the economic
benefits of cashew nuts production were championed with the creation in the north of the country
of a state-owned corporation (which is no longer in existence) for developing the industry.
Cashew nuts production also benefited from infrastructure projects originally intended to
improve access to cotton-producing regions and from investments by cotton producers seeking to
diversify their activities following a slump in that sector. Various studies specifically evaluating
funding for research and development, outreach, and feeder roads, showed the considerable
contributions of private firms made through FIRCA to the sectors in which they operate (coffee,
cocoa, rubber, palm oil, etc.) in producing public goods that are normally the purview of the
government.

Growth in livestock production was modest during the 2000–2010 period (Figure 14), with the
exception of egg and poultry (broiler and cull) production, which grew by almost 5% and over
9%, respectively. Poultry production saw the largest gains when compared to all livestock
production. Fast-growing livestock production (namely in the poultry and pork sectors) received
direct public funding only in 2004 and 2009. However, these sectors benefitted from high tariffs

on imported poultry meat (CFAF 1,000 per kilo) the industry managed to have implemented in
order to protect the domestic sector.

Agricultural Inputs, Research, Outreach, and Feeder Roads

Research, outreach, inputs, and feeder roads are among the factors that have a direct impact16 on
agricultural growth. Although the provision of these public goods falls in principle to the
government, these goods can be provided by the private sector in partnership with the
government. Although research and outreach, for example, are funded by the government, an
increasing share is being funded by FIRCA. Created by the government, FIRCA is a private-
sector agency whose recurring costs, (especially wages) and a share of its investment budget are
funded by the government. FIRCA also generates its own funds through voluntary dues paid by
those doing business in the industry. This private revenue source allows FIRCA to fund research
conducted by the National Agricultural Research Center (CNRA) as well as ANADER's
agricultural advisory services for the benefit of producers. Feeder roads, which are also
considered public goods, are essential for transporting agricultural products to market and for the
distribution of inputs and therefore deserve special attention even if they are excluded from the
NEPAD COFOG methodology. For their part, although inputs are private goods, their purchase
can be subsidized by the government in specific circumstances. When the government decides to

16
      Although irrigation is another relevant factor, time limitations prevented the consultants from including it in this
     report.

                                                             45
do so, the relevant agricultural ministry (MINAGRI in the case of fertilizer and MIRAH in the
case of veterinary vaccinations) is charged with procurement and timely delivery.

Allocations for these inputs can be indicative of the role of APE in raising agricultural
productivity. The results from the series of studies conducted on these factors are presented
below.

Agricultural Inputs

Reflecting its size relative to the other agricultural sectors, crop production received the lion's
share (approximately 98%) of publicly subsidized inputs when compared with the other two
subsectors of water and forestry and livestock and fisheries. Nevertheless, the level of inputs
being used still falls short of the country’s potential need by a wide margin.

Constraints on accessing agricultural inputs were essentially of the financial kind, although
technical knowledge on how best to use inputs should not be underestimated.

For the period, public spending captured by the SIGFiP database indicated that crop production
accounted for the largest share (Figure 15). Input subsidies represented 9% of APE for the crops
sector. Subsidies are mainly directed at plant health and pest control (approximately 68%) for
cotton and cocoa production and seed for food crop production. The cotton sector led the
consumption of both simple and compound fertilizer (57%), followed by other cash crop
production (cocoa, pineapples, palm oil). However, all fertilizer consumption combined
represented only 2% of potential consumption in the country.

Certain conditions with respect to inputs are necessary if agricultural productivity is to be raised:

Input Conditions

                                                 46
   1. Improve access to inputs by modernizing the production of improved seed in farming
      communities, introducing innovation in financing methods for farmers’ associations, and
      providing access to technical and trade information for distributers and purchasing
      advisors. This requires direct collaborative effort by producers’ organizations, input
      distributors, agro-industrialists, and the financial sector;
   2. Improve the cost-effectiveness of inputs by revising technical recommendations that
      take into account production systems and the cost of inputs and by encouraging the
      integrated management of soil fertility and predators. The reliable support of research and
      outreach agencies is also necessary;
   3. Improve the regulatory and fiscal environment in the sector by applying community
      regulations and fiscal provisions, which would make the production and free circulation
      of quality inputs in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) zone
      easier. It is also essential to direct support toward government structures and professional
      associations overseeing the sector in close collaboration with regional institutions.

Financing of Inputs

The success of a program in improving agricultural productivity depends in part on the amount
and quality of inputs. Modernizing family farms and sustainably scaling up production systems
are recognized as essential for the development of the sector.

On this subject, the Abuja declaration (June 12, 2006) recognized that support for modernizing
family farms and sustainably scaling up production systems must occur through a system of
regional co-financing in order to achieve growth in agriculture. This regional co-financing
mechanism consists of a number of actions member states can choose to implement with support
from regional ECOWAS co-financing. It includes four (4) actions that aim to address the
following challenges:

   •   Reduce the cost of fertilizer through targeted subsidies;
   •   Reduce the cost of innovative small equipment through targeted subsidies;
   •   Improve the availability of inputs by creating a distribution network; and
   •   Improve access to credit through guaranteed funds accessible by banks.

To these actions should be added the development of management skills on family farms so as to
effectively contribute to their modernization. Over the long term, support directed at sector
organization should result in the sector managing its own inputs partially or completely.

Agricultural Research

A review of the 1992–2015 (2008) agricultural development plan concluded that the scaling-up
of agriculture was far from being achieved in Côte d'Ivoire, the framework structures had not
significantly improved sector performance, agricultural financing remained a major constraint,
and synergy between research and development remained too low.

                                               47
Today, the CNRA, which was formed through the restructuring of research and management
arrangements in Côte d'Ivoire (PNASA, 1994) and accounts for over 66% of the country’s full-
time equivalent (FTE) researchers, produces the bulk of agricultural research in the country.

Principal sources of financing for agricultural research in Côte d'Ivoire are the following: (a)
government funding; (b) sale of products and services; (c) research contracts; and (d) donor
funding.

Public funding sources during the 1999–2010 period broke down as follows: the Treasury
covered 82.76% of research spending, while loans (16.8%) and grants (0.37%) constituted a
modest share of external financing.

While the government’s contribution was considerable, amounting to a total of CFAF 60.2
billion over the period, research is also privately funded. For example, the CNRA's activities are
financed in large part through private funding. In 2012, it raised CFAF 3.91 billion from the
private sector, compared to CFAF 5.01 billion received through public funding on average per
year over the 1999–2010 period. For its part, FIRCA accounted for 68% of this private funding
from its own resources and 10% through funds sourced from WAAPP, which is funded by
donors and which FIRCA coordinates.

For the 2004–2007 period, the planned budget for the CNRA was CFAF 21.63 billion. However,
according to SIGFiP data, it received only CFAF 14.35 billion (of which half consisted of arrears
from previous years), or 66.34% of program costs. For the remainder of its budget and to the
extent possible, the CNRA financed itself.

FIRCA is a unique and exemplary financing system in Africa. Created by decree No. 2002-520
of December 11, 2002, it is an instrument whose design was inspired by the provisions of Bill
No. 2001-635 of October 9, 2001 relating to the Agricultural Development Fund (ADP). It
improved demand-oriented research, and its solidarity mechanism enables it to guarantee the
availability of research funds to support production sectors for which membership volume in
FIRCA is weak.

On December 31, 2011, the share of allocated and executed expenditure in research represented
17.44% of available funds, compared with 60.82% for agricultural advisory services. The coffee,
cocoa, and rubber sectors were the largest recipients of this funding.

An analysis of budget sub-headings and budget lines for the three key agricultural ministries
(MINAGRI, MIRAH, and MINEF) and the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific
Research (MESRSCI) reveals the share of expenditure devoted to research activities. Public
expenditure over the period broke down as shown in Table 11.

Despite the relatively balanced distribution of expenditure (39.11% for wage expenditure,
25.89% for non-wage expenditure, 35% for investment expenditure), the downward trend and
annual variation point to inconsistent funding for research programs. For the period, investment
spending contracted by 3.4% on average per year.

Over the period, total public expenditure on research amounted to CFAF 60.12 billion. This
figure represented 10.7% of MINAGRI’s total expenditure, 8% of the agricultural sector’s
expenditure (excluding off-budget expenditure), 0.43% of the government’s overall executed
expenditure, and 0.23% of agricultural GDP. However, this last figure falls short of NEPAD’s
national investment objective for agricultural research and development (at least 1% of GDP).

Generally, scientific research and technological innovation in Côte d'Ivoire are characterized
by:

    •   A lack of policy on scientific research and technological innovation;
    •   Low levels of funding of research activities (around 0.05% of GDP); and
    •   Insufficient numbers of researchers.

In the past years, the uncertainty caused by the suspension of foreign aid and deteriorating public
finances have seriously reduced spending in agricultural research in the country. As a result of
long-term instability, privatization targets agreed under the National Agricultural Services
Support Program (PNASA II) were not achieved, and the CNRA, the principal institution for



                                                49
agricultural research, continued to depend financially on government funding and commercial
revenues from its own products.

Even with new prospects, forecasts for the financing of scientific research under the National
Development Plan (PND) for the 2012–2015 period represented only 0.76% of the cost of the
NPD. The share of agricultural research will be even smaller.

Funding for agricultural research has not been consistent with the objective defined in the 1992–
2015 Framework Agricultural Development Plan (PDDA), which was to develop applied
research.

Nevertheless, during the period under review, these sectors played an important role in funding
research through dues payable to FIRCA. However, as sector revenues are dependent upon
global prices, there is no guarantee that dues will constitute a long-term funding source.

The principal research institutions fall under the administrative control of the Ministry of Higher
Education and Scientific Research (MESRSCI). Budget conferences should allow for
consultation between key sector ministries, MESRSCI, and these institutions.

Administrative monitoring of agronomic research could be transferred to MINAGRI for
improved performance of value chains.

As agricultural research, especially in crop production, is highly dependent on the climate,
arrangements for implementing funding should allow for flexibility in taking this
constraint into consideration.

Outreach

Since 1992, the Ivorian government has worked to reform the provision of agricultural services
through PNASA, a large-scale project undertaken with support from development partners
(DPs), especially the World Bank. Launched as part of a structural adjustment policy, this
initiative seeks to correct weaknesses revealed by prior analysis. PNASA’s medium and long-
term objective is to implement viable, demand-oriented structures for research and outreach, with
the beneficiaries contributing significantly to the funding of services and the government
emphasizing the strengthening of competencies and the provision of public services (Doumbia,
2009). Its implementation was organized into two phases as two separate projects: PNASA I and
PNASA II.

ANADER

The reorganization of agricultural outreach services and research was finalized in 1998 and
resulted in the creation of the National for Rural Development Support Agency (ANADER) and
the CNRA. Originally, PNASA was designed as a long-term program to be implemented over an
11-year period. However, following the December 1999 coup, the World Bank, the main donor,

                                                50
withdrew from the project. ANADER then became a public limited company with capital of
CFAF 500 million distributed between the government (35%) and professional farming families
and related private companies (65%). Its objective is to contribute to promoting rural
communities through the professionalization of agricultural producers (crops, trees, livestock,
fish farmers, and fishermen).

Since 2011, ANADER has focused on the following objectives: (i) adapting and strengthening its
capacities; and (ii) implementing a sector-based approach as a strategy for providing advisory
support to producers.

Over the past several years, outreach has undergone adaptations so that this public good now
makes use of market-oriented approaches. In the agricultural sector, FIRCA constitutes the
exemplary model of this process.

FIRCA

Created by decree No. 2002-520 of December 11, 2002, FIRCA is an instrument whose design
was inspired by the provisions of Bill No. 2001-635 of October 9, 2001 relating to the
Agricultural Development Fund.

The government and industry professionals collaborate through FIRCA, namely in: (i) evaluating
producers’ needs for agricultural services; (ii) encouraging growth of a range of services; and
(iii) monitoring and assessing programs, services providers, and agricultural professions.

An example of private sector involvement in outreach is the agreement between FIRCA and the
National Rubber Professionals Associations (APROMAC).

Non-Governmental Organizations and Consultancy Firms

Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and consultancy firms are also involved in agricultural
outreach. INADES-Formation Côte d’Ivoire is involved with promoting family farms,
mobilizing internal financial resources, and encouraging decentralization and local development
with the financial support of DPs.

SIGFiP data can be used to track changes in APE in training, decentralization, and various
programs and projects (Table 12).

For the period under review, the main source of funding was the Treasury. Training received only
minimal funding from outside sources, whereas decentralization was funded entirely by the
Treasury. Up to 20% of projects and programs were funded by grants and loans. The world
economic crisis that took place during the period resulted in a significant reduction in APE on
outreach in comparison with 1999.

Limited funding resulted in reduced expenditure on training, especially on the regional
directorates and decentralized services of the three key ministries. The share of spending on
outreach remained above 50% for the period under review (the average for the period was 60%).
Despite this downward trend, funding was prioritized for specific projects and programs.

SIGFiP data show relatively abundant funding for the reorganization of outreach services and
ANADER (50.48%), as shown in Figure 16.

ANADER’s Funding Sources

By and large, the government provides most of ANADER’s funding. From 1999 to 2007
(excluding 2000), ANADER received 87 to 94% of its budget from government funding. Recent
trends indicate that in the past three years, ANADER generated a little over 20% of its funding
through the sale of various services.

For the period, the government transferred CFAF 109.4 billion to ANADER, or 27% of the three
ministries’ public expenditure on agriculture. While this amount is significant, ANADER’s
managers noted that disbursements were often very late.

ANADER seeks to increase its revenues by signing research agreements with partners. For the
2002–2010 period, it signed 417 agreements with fifteen (15) different entities worth a total of
CFAF 10,290,853,069. While the number of clients points to a prudent diversification of funding
sources, it also represents a challenge in maintaining a timely outreach schedule.

FIRCA remains ANADER’s leading partner, accounting for 12% of total contract value.

FIRCA Funding Sources and Sector Financing

FIRCA’s funds are composed of:

    •   Professional agricultural subscriptions paid according to legal requirements by producers
        in the crops, trees, and livestock sectors, agro-industrialists, and other first-stage
        processing industrialists in various sectors;

                                               53
   •   Contributions, whether public, private, or from external organizations intended to fund
       applied research and professional agricultural advisory and support organizations; and
   •   All extraordinary revenues, subsidies, or financial instruments.

Limiting the analysis to the ten (10) sectors participating formally in FIRCA’s professional
subscription mechanism (except for the coffee/cocoa sector), the total amount of funding
generated from December 31, 2011 to date was CFAF 25.573 billion, of which CFAF 24.064
billion (95%) was earmarked for the development of subscribing sectors and CFAF 1.310 billion
(5%) for FIRCA’s administrative costs.

At least 75% of the total subscriptions collected in a given production sector was allocated to
financing programs that benefit that sector. The remainder was used in large part to fund
solidarity initiatives and to a much smaller extent FIRCA’s administrative costs. Overall, this
distribution has remained steady.

Funds for solidarity initiatives are intended to finance programs designed for production sectors
for which the volume of subscription is weak or for which the structure is not conducive to the
setting up of direct debits. A financial reserve is constituted from FIRCA's annual revenues.

off-budget expenditure.

For the period, off-budget funding (CFAF 25,218 billion) represented 124.64% of APE
calculated based on SIGFiP data. The data showed that APE (excluding off-budget funding) for
outreach fell in 1999. Including off-budget funding into the calculations results in relative
stability in expenditure over the period.

                                                 55
For the period, spending on outreach represented on average 1% of agricultural GDP excluding
off-budget expenditure and 2.13% if off-budget expenditure is included (Figure 17).

Figure 18: Growth rate for agricultural GDP and public expenditure on outreach, 1999–2010

There was no clear correlation between spending on outreach and growth in agricultural GDP
(Figure 18). However, it would be premature to conclude that causality does not apply. Instead,
the lack of correlation suggests possible hypotheses that will require further analysis of the
impact of research on sector development.

Feeder Roads

The poor condition of roads is one of the main reasons for rising poverty, especially in rural
areas. The lack of road infrastructure providing access to villages and newly farmed land has
severely slowed agricultural development, constraining these populations to subsistence
agriculture. The situation is exacerbated by the slump in sales of agricultural products and falling
farmgate prices. Poor roads directly correlate with a reduction in rural populations’ principal
sources of income. “In the 1980s, it took 1 hour to travel the 17-km road to the village of
Zamblekro during the rainy season. In 2009, it takes more than 2 hours. Cocoa can still be
transported, but the sale of food crops no longer makes business sense.”17

Agricultural Public Expenditure on Feeder Roads by Funding Source

For the period, SIGFiP data on feeder roads for various projects indicate that CFAF 2.414 billion
was spent on feeder roads, of which 34.63% was funded by loans and 65.33% by the
government.

With all funding sources combined, APE on feeder roads reached CFAF 52.581 billion, of which
CFAF 22.305 billion was provided by the sectors (42.42%). The Rural Investment Fund's
(FIMR) significant contribution represented 39% of this expenditure.

Feeder roads represented 10.49% of APE for the sector (COFOG+) for the period under review.
This sum includes expenditure by the government during the 2003–2006 period (emergency
spending) and subsequent expenditure by the sectors and the EU between 2007 and 2010.

Regional Allocation of Agricultural Public Expenditure

Regional allocation of APE should reflect in part the government's regional priorities in terms of
agricultural policy. However, these allocations may or may not reflect allocations to sectors since
some regions are characterized by dominant sectors while others host a diversity of sectors. For
agricultural production found across several regions, there is no direct relationship between
allocation by sector and allocation by region.

The category of operations deemed to be of “national interest,” which represented on average
71% of executed APE, contains information concerning allocations to sectors. Unfortunately, it is
difficult to break down these expenditures by region. The remainder of expenditures was

                                                     57
distributed among the country’s 19 regions (which were the administrative divisions in effect
during this period) and among the major regions, an even older categorization that included the
Savanes, Côtière, and Forestière regions.

Regional allocations examined in this report relate to spending that does not fall under the
heading of “national interest operations” and excludes national representation expenditures,
which can be considered as placeholder sums so as to arrive at the same total regardless of
categorization (by ministry or region). These regional allocations amounted to CFAF 126.92
billion, representing 28.7% of total executed APE (excluding off-budget expenditure) for the
period. In the interest of readability, Figure 19 shows only those regions for which the share of
expenditure was equal to or greater than 1% of this total. The results suggest that priority in
funding was given to Savanes region (22% of total expenditure), followed by Nzi-Comoé (11%),
and Western Montagnes (6%). In fact, the geographical region of Savanes includes Korhogo,
Bafing, and Zanzan and encompasses around a quarter of the country. The region was for a long
time considered neglected, and this explains its relative importance in regional allocations today.

Regional allocations also included expenditure on regional projects as well as decentralization,
which began during the period under review. At the time, the country was divided into regions,
departments, municipalities, districts, and general councils.18 The transfer of funds from

ministries' budgets to departments and municipalities began in 2003. Totaling CFAF 5.7 billion,
or 4% of total regional allocations, these transfers were modest. However, they are expected to
increase with the implementation of the new decentralization policy announced in 2011.

The Lacs region, which includes the country’s political capital of Yamoussoukro, and the
Lagunes region, which includes the country’s economic capital of Abidjan, received the most
transfers of all departments and municipalities. Thus, the Savanes region (Korhogo) was not the
recipient of the largest transfers. The fact that the share of Nzi-Comoé (Dimbokro) was greater
than that of Lagunes was surprising. Taking into consideration regional populations,19 the Lacs
and Nzi-Comoé regions received the highest per capita transfers (CFAF 1,900 and 1,000,
respectively), whereas the average per capita transfer for the remaining regions was
approximately CFAF 300.

Economic Composition of Agricultural Public Expenditure

Investigating what APE purchased is crucial to assessing the quality of that expenditure. This
includes analyzing the distribution of expenditure between investments and recurring costs

(wage and non-wage) given that spending on investment builds the foundation of economic
growth while spending on recurring costs, if used correctly, maintains this foundation, research
and outreach, and monitoring.

The best part of budgeted APE (close to 80%) was used primarily to cover recurring costs (wage
and non-wage expenditure), with wages accounting for 48% on average of total budgeted
expenditure. Investment in the agricultural sector received the smallest share (Table 15).
Although investment expenditure on development projects also included recurring costs, it
should be noted that these operational costs are often mandated, for example in the case of
counterparts, to ensure that investments on projects are managed and maintained adequately. As
a result, non-wage expenses can contribute to better implementation of investments when, for
example, these costs cover transportation for monitoring and maintenance purposes. (A detailed
analysis of categories of investment and non-wage expenditure exceeds the scope of this
diagnostic review of APE).

The economic composition of expenditure for the 1999–2005 period was clearly different from
that for the following period (2006–2010) (Figure 21). A review of changes in the composition of
expenditure shows a decrease in expenditure on wages and investment expenditure. Lower
spending on both wages and investment was counterbalanced by higher spending on non-wage
costs. Overall, recurring costs accounted for a greater share of expenditure relative to investment.

Table 16 highlights the recurring costs of off-budget expenditure. Including off-budget
expenditure in the analysis shows that the economic composition of expenditure observed was
more evenly distributed than would be suggested by a review of budgeted expenditure alone. In
fact, the even distribution in terms of economic composition was what was aimed for at the time
of budget allocation. The share of expenditure allocated to each expenditure type was practically
the same, with the greatest share going to investment (36%) followed by non-wage expenditure
(33%) and then wages (31%).

An alternative analysis considers all off-budget expenditure to be investment expenditure. In this
case, recurring costs (wages, fuel, vehicle maintenance, travel costs related to monitoring, etc.)
are considered an integral part of investment since they are necessary for maintaining those

                                               61
investments. In fact, these recurring costs end with the completion of off-budget expenditure
projects and are no longer incurred. If it is accepted that off-budget expenditure is a form of
investment expenditure, then investment largely dominated APE during the period under review.

Economic Composition of Agricultural Public Expenditure by Ministry

The dominance of the wage bill in budgeted APE was especially marked at MINAGRI. This
ministry had the highest expenditure, with wages representing half of that spending. As a share
of total expenditure, MINAGRI also had the lowest investment (less than 20%) compared with
the other ministries, where that share exceeded 20% of expenditure (Figure 22).

The composition of expenditure was evened out thanks to substantial EU funding. Off-budget
funding of expenditure went to the development of crop sectors and thus came under the purview
of MINAGRI. These allocations funded investment (if all off-budget expenditure is considered
investment expenditure).

Economic Composition of Expenditure by Sector

It was expected that public expenditure on wages would be minor in the sectors that experienced
privatization in 1989–1999. Consequently, public expenditure should have been allocated to
investment and non-wage expenses instead. As indicated in Table 18, allocations to investment
were generally twice as high as those to wages. However, in the cattle and food crops sectors,
allocations for wages surpassed those for investment. These findings, which for lack of time
were not analyzed in detail by the consultants, should signal to the ministries concerned that
support for developing sectors should be better structured. The figures also showed that in the
cotton sector, which received considerable support relative to other sectors, allocated expenditure
was used solely for non-wage spending. Spending in this sector tended toward emergency
initiatives designed to help this distressed sector to recover. For the remaining sectors, a share of
allocations went to investment.

Allocations to sectors over the 1999–2010 period remain investment-oriented when off-budget
expenditure is taken into account. As noted previously, this is related to the very nature of off-
budget expenditure.

Economic Composition by Categorization as Public or Private Good

Reviewing expenditure by categorization as public or private good is relevant because public
spending should encourage the production of public goods for greater equity and shared
development. Research20 conducted some ten years ago in Latin America concluded that
countries that allocated more resources to private goods showed worse outcomes for the
agricultural sector than countries that favored public goods. A public good is for collective use
(non-excludable) and is such that consumption by one individual does not reduce its availability
to another individual (non-rivalrous), whereas a private good is for personal use (excludable),
and its consumption by one individual reduces its availability to another individual (rivalrous).
Table 19 provides a few examples of public and private goods.

                      Excludable                                         Non-excludable

                      subscribers)


Public and private goods should be distinguished from public and private services. A public
service can provide both a public good (e.g., training and outreach) as well as a private good
(e.g., seed and fertilizer). Similarly, the private sector can provide a public good (e.g., feeder
roads, agricultural research) and of course private goods. In principle, it is precisely because
private initiative is unable to produce public goods in a satisfactory manner (due to the free-rider
problem) that the government is forced to provide these goods.

For the purpose of this report, this analysis relied upon the relatively simple filtering of data with
the aim of distinguishing between pure public goods and pure private goods. It was considered
that the ministries produced no club goods and that common goods were treated as pure public
goods. The development of sectors as well as subsidies for inputs or the purchase of agricultural
equipment were considered private goods.21 Public goods included administration, research, and
outreach.

Based on the previously defined categories, the production of public goods appeared to dominate
private goods based on their respective shares of the budgeted APE (68% and 32%, respectively).
The same result was observed in Cameroon but not in Malawi or Zambia. Such heavier spending
in the production of public goods might be explained by the fact that the government disengaged
almost entirely from these sectors and that privatization is now complete. It was observed that
allocations to sectors (considered private goods) in budgeted APE was only 22%. While this
broad analysis should be pursued in greater detail, this question was relevant since the collection
of data from SIGFiP created a data series for public and private goods that could be used and
analyzed just like any other dataset.

An economic comparison of private and public goods revealed no surprises. Figure 23 shows the
small share of allocations to wage expenditure (18%) compared to non-wage (49%) and
investment (34%) expenditure. This economic composition is consistent with that of the
spending proportions for specific sectors in the preceding sections of this report. The economic
composition of public goods was as expected, with the share of wages being 62%, that of non-
wages 24%, and that of investment only 14%. A smaller share devoted to wages in private goods

     Note that as already noted, this simplified categorization is not universally accepted.

                                                             65
was expected. Wages in private goods were funded by subsidies to entities such as FIRCA and
accounted for over 50% of allocations received.

These results are also reassuring. It is acceptable that public spending be used predominantly for
wages (62%) in order to produce public goods for the largest number of recipients. It would be
disturbing to see wages dominating in the production of private goods, which are for the
exclusive benefit of a small number of actors.

                                       VI. FUNDING SOURCES
An analysis of funding sources sheds additional light on the perceived need in reviewing the
economic composition of ABE to build solid foundations for sustaining long-term growth in the
agricultural sector. The more Côte d’Ivoire generates its own resources with which to grow its
agricultural sector rather than depending heavily on external resources, the more it ensures the
sector’s sustainable development provided these resources are properly utilized. SIGFiP data can
help examine the following two concerns simultaneously: which funding sources went to support
which types of expenditure?

For Côte d’Ivoire, which faced an internal conflict for most of the 1999–2010 period, we should
not expect substantial foreign aid to have been granted directly to the Government. Table 20,
which shows ABE excluding off-budget amounts, appears to confirm this assessment as nearly
87% of ABE on average was provided by the Treasury, with a minimal contribution from
donations of around 3%.

Note: The lack of grants and loans in 1999 makes it impossible to calculate the growth rate for the period.

Despite their domestic origin, grants and loans played a major role in ABE. The data collected
show that external contributions kept ABE from suffering as much as expected from the sharp
drop (40%) in Treasury funds from 1999 to 2002. Table 20 shows that even though budgeted
external contributions were low, the total drop in ABE observed as a trend has to do mainly with
the weakness in the Treasury funds mobilized to fund the agricultural sector. Even in current
terms, the Treasury’s contribution never again reached its 1999 level during the study period.


                                                         67
The huge gap between budget estimates (allocated budget) and the actual assumption of ABE
(Figure 24) at the start of the crisis affected Treasury funds. It would seem that it was not until
after 2006 that the Government had a better grasp of its fiscal revenues for a more realistic
allocation of Treasury funds to the agricultural sector. (Examining which other sectors to which
this finding might apply is beyond the scope of this study.)

This gap would have been smaller had budget estimates for grants and loans been accurate.
Undoubtedly, based on its experience before the crisis, the Government placed a great deal of
hope in grants and loans. In fact, their contribution was to rise to over half of ABE until 2002, as
shown in Table 21. Concomitantly with its better grasp of Treasury funding estimates, beginning
in 2006, the Government took a more realistic view of contributions from donors.

No review of funding sources would be complete without the inclusion of off-budget
expenditures. EU and FAO off-budget expenditures consist of external contributions equivalent

                                                      68
to grants, while for ANADER and FIRCA, these were drawn from domestic resources. On
average, 62% of ABE was covered by the Treasury (Figure 25). This corresponds to the crisis
Côte d’Ivoire was experiencing when donors repeatedly suspended their funding (2000, 2004).
However, it should be noted that COFOG excludes feeder roads both in the national budget and
off-budget.

Funding Sources by Ministry

MINAGRI is the ministry that drew the most from all sources of funding for its expenditures.
SIGFiP data indicate that MINEF did not receive any loans over the period and that grants
contributed negligibly to the funding sources of the other ministries (Figure 26). In fact, most
off-budget expenditures were used to support crop production.

Figure 26: Funding sources of key ministries

Funding Sources by Subsector

Budgeted expenditures for the subsectors came mostly from the Treasury (74%), including for
cotton and sugar cane. Although fruits, vegetables, and fisheries have a coverage rate by the
Treasury of less than 40% of their expenditures, the remaining subsectors have far higher
coverage rates. Over the period, the total rate of coverage by the Treasury was 74%, the share of
grants 9%, and that of loans 17%.

The largest source of subsector funding consisted of off-budget expenditures rather than the
Treasury. If we take EU funding into account (treating it as a grant),22 the rate of coverage by the
Treasury falls to 39%, far less than the allocations of budget expenditure to the subsectors noted
above (74%) and below the coverage rate for all ABE (51%). Hence we see that the subsectors
owe the majority of their funding to external resources and more particularly to the EU (Figure
27).

     We could not verify whether the grant from Belgian Cooperation aiming to support milk production to the amount
     of CFAF 1.5 billion over the 2005–2008 period was taken into account by SIGFiP data.

Funding Sources by Economic Composition of ABE

Here, the aim is to ascertain which funding sources (grants, loans, Treasury) contributed the most
to which type of expenditure (wages, non-wage expenditures, and investments). The proper use
of external resources is that they be used to support investments rather than wages. In fact,
donors always make this a basic principle.

The Treasury funded almost all wages (96%) in the budgeted ABE (Figure 28). However, it also
funded most other expenditures given the very low level of grants and loans mobilized directly
by the country during the 1999–2010 period.

billions)




Source: SIGFiP, consultants' research



What were donors' grants and loans used for? Figure 29 approaches the question from the
standpoint of expenditures by funding source. The results show that most of the grants (73%)
were allocated to investments, with less than 4% going to wages. Similarly, loans were heavily
allocated to investments (44%), even if more than half went to cover recurring costs (56%), with
wages receiving the smallest share. As noted, Treasury resources were used mainly to pay wages
(54%), with very little left over to cover investments.

These findings show that overall, funding sources were used as hoped, which should be of some
comfort to donors. However, it should be noted that the very small amounts represented by
grants and loans for the period prevent us from drawing major conclusions in this respect.

  VII. KEY ASPECTS OF AGRICULTURAL BUDGET EXPENDITURE IN
                    THE POST-CRISIS PERIOD


This section describes key aspects of agricultural budget expenditure (ABE) during the 2008–
2012 period, covering two crisis and two post-crisis years. According to the initial study’s terms
of reference, as indicated in the introduction, the analytical review of agricultural expenditure
covers the years 1999–2010, corresponding unfortunately to the country’s socio-political crisis.
However, in view of delays in the process of appropriation and finalization of the study's
findings, the Ivorian authorities expressed the desire to have the post-crisis years included in
order to measure any improvement in ABE performance in the aftermath of the crisis. Given the
impossibility of going through the entire review again for the 1999–2012 period because of
scheduling conflicts on the part of the consultants, this supplementary analysis covers the years
2008–2012.

To save time in collecting data and at the request of the ministries dealing with the agricultural
sector, it was decided to include spending on feeder roads in current budgets and expenditures
rather than excluding them, as required by NEPAD COFOG. In addition, this analysis is based
on more complete data for off-budget expenditures (as compared to the initial study) thanks to
closer collaboration with the development partners (DPs). This section analyzes ABE both
excluding and including off-budget expenditures based on data obtained from SIGFiP.

SIGFiP Data

Composition of Expenditures

Figure 30 shows the composition of ABE in the current budget, while Figure 31 shows that
composition for the sector’s three key ministries.

Source: SIGFiP




There was no real change in terms of direction as current expenditure (wages and non-wages)
account for at least 60% of current budgets, even if a slight improvement in the share of
investments can be seen in 2012.

Actual expenditures (Figure 31) confirm the trends seen in the current budget.

Implementation Rate

Figure 32 shows the results of budget implementation by the three key ministries.

This figure shows a clear upward trend, especially for MINAGRI. For the most part, MINEF
achieved the best implementation rate for the 2008–2012 period.

Share of the Three Technical Ministries in the National Budget

Figure 33 shows the relative importance of the three ministries measured by the share of each
ministry in current budgets and cost assumptions in the corresponding national budgets for the
post-crisis period only (2011–2013).




                                               76
Figure 33: Share of the three ministries in the national budget, 2008–2012 (%)




Source: SIGFIP




The three ministries accounted for 3.53% of the current national budget in 2013, which
represents progress, albeit modest compared to 2011 (3.08%).

Expenditures accounted for between 2.09% (2011) and 3.25% of the corresponding national
budgets. Even if we include off-budget funding (see the following tables), despite a qualitative
leap of around one percentage point, Côte d’Ivoire remains far short of the Maputo bar (10% of
the national budget to be devoted to the agricultural sector).

Other Ministries Supporting the Agricultural Sector

Table 22 shows the distribution of current and investment expenditures outside of the three
ministries participating in developing the sector. Unlike the initial study, which was based on
COFOG norms, in this study, ABE includes the Rural Investment Fund (FIMR).

Off-Budget Expenditures

Based on the available data, the EU contributed 50% of off-budget support for development by
all of the DPs over the 2008–2012 period (Table 23). The main beneficiaries were the banana
sector in Moyen, Sud Comoé, Agnéby, and Lagunes (51%), the sugar sector in Marahoué and
Bafing (11.5%), and the cotton sector in savannah regions, Worodougou, and Bandama Valley
(37.31%).FIRCA channels remain the main sources of funding for this sector.

Share of Subsector Funding in the National Budget

Table 25 summarizes the distribution of ABE, excluding off-budget expenditures, by subsector.
For the 2008–2012 period, rice remained heavily subsidized, to the detriment of the food crops
and livestock and fishery subsectors.23 This study found no significant change over the 1999–
2010 period, with the same subsectors remaining disadvantaged and the Maputo criterion still far
out of reach.

     The performance of recent investments in these subsectors, especially as regards rice and food crops, which could

This basic analysis must now give way to specialized studies requiring further investigation so as
to ascertain technical efficiency in expenditure. In particular, how efficient is it to create strategic
products and outcomes? Other areas to be examined are budget implementation, unit costs, and
waste.

Such an assessment should be conducted using a range of instruments, including follow-up
surveys of public expenditure, measures of cost-effectiveness, impact analyses, and impact
studies.

The following sections refer to the initial basic analysis for the 1999–2010 period.

              VIII. BUDGET PREPARATION, IMPLEMENTATION, AND
                            MONITORING, 1999–2010


The levels of agricultural budget expenditure (ABE) actually implemented in the field depend on
the process of preparing and implementing the budget. The allocative efficiency of expenditures
is the result of arbitration and negotiations within and between the ministries and of the time it
takes to effectively prepare the expenditures. However, the last word determining the impact of
ABE comes not from the assumption of expenditures by the Treasury but rather following an
assessment of expenditures in the field that can be documented only through appropriate
monitoring and assessment.

Budget Preparation

The budget preparation process involves twelve steps, which are undoubtedly necessary but
which contribute to the long period of time the process takes. This process includes both a
technical and a political aspect.24

Drafting the macroeconomic guidelines: The Directorate General of the Economy (DGE) in
cooperation with the National Statistical Institute (INS) prepares macroeconomic estimates for
the current year. Based on these estimates and taking into account the Government’s political,
economic, and social policies, it generates projections for at least the next three years. Forecasts
of economic growth (including agricultural growth) make it possible to forecast tax revenues,
with these forecasts being then reviewed with the financial administrations.

Approval of the macroeconomic guidelines: The Government announces its acceptance of the
macroeconomic guidelines, making adjustments if necessary or issuing new directions as the
social, political, and economic situation evolves.

Drafting of the budget guidelines: The Directorate General of the Budget and Finance (DGBF)
then draws up the budget guidelines, that is, a balancing statement that matches the
Government’s commitments to available resources, which consist of domestic revenues (fiscal
and non-fiscal) and external contributions (loans and grants).

Approval of the budget guidelines: The Government reviews and approves the choice of
expenditures and the amount of resources available. This opens the way to a distribution of
allocations among the decentralized ministries, institutions, and communities.

Setting budget allocations: The DGBF translates the overall goals spelled out in the budget
guidelines into sector objectives and determines the budget allocations to be made to the
decentralized ministries, institutions, and communities. In making this determination, it

considers: (a) the level of appropriations made available during the previous management period;
(b) the level of consumption of the appropriations made during that period; and (c) new
operations approved by decision of the Cabinet or by other decision-making bodies and the
commitments made with the development partners (DPs).25

Prime Minister’s budget guideline document: The Prime Minister’s budget guideline
document informs the decentralized ministries, institutions, and communities of the overall
budget allocations being made to them. These budget allocations are then distributed by these
actors according to their own needs, taking into account the guidelines set by the Government.
The budget guidelines therefore represent a summary of the budget, which is composed of major
government expenditures (taking into account the Government’s own economic and social
priorities as well as its outside commitments) on the one hand and major Government resources
on the other. It serves as a frame of reference that can be readily supported by a results
framework.

Internal budget conferences with DAAF: Each decentralized ministry, institution, and
community holds three- or four-day budget conferences with the Directorate of Administrative
and Financial Affairs (DAAF) and the technical departments to review the proposed allocations
and request adjustments.

External conferences and arbitration: This step marks the end of the involvement of the
technical services. The DGBF receives additional requests from the internal conferences and
compiles a summary of these requests. It then holds external budget conferences involving itself
and the representatives of all of the decentralized ministries, institutions, and communities for
arbitration of their requests.

Drafting the budget: The DGBF then draws up a draft budget that is submitted to the Ministry
of Economy and Finance (MEF), which is responsible for the budget. This step marks the end of
involvement by the technical departments in the budget preparation process. After arbitration, it
sets the total level of the draft budget, which is then submitted for assessment and approval by
the Cabinet.

Adoption of the draft budget by the Cabinet: The Cabinet’s adoption of the draft budget
marks the end of involvement by the executive branch in the budget preparation process, up to
this point without the contribution of the legislative branch.

National Assembly review of the budget: The National Assembly examines and if necessary
amends and then approves the draft budget presented by the Prime Minister. Once approved, the
draft budget becomes the Finance Bill for that year.




25
     For these reasons, major increases in expenditure from one year to the next are not automatic.

                                                           82
Promulgation of the Finance Bill: Once adopted, the Finance Bill for that year is promulgated
by the President of the Republic, published in the Official Journal, and made enforceable.
However, it can be amended by corrective Finance Bills. When the Finance Bill is adopted and
promulgated, the decentralized ministries, institutions, and communities receive their budget
allocations as passed.

This process calls for the following remarks.

There is no preparation of a specific budget for the agricultural sector but rather the independent
preparation of isolated budgets for its component parts. The budget preparation process does not
give the agricultural sector’s ministries a chance to work together to prepare a budget for the
sector as defined in this study. The budget conferences in which these ministries could meet to do
this remain focused on the specific activities of each ministry, which in turn remains focused on
its own remit when arbitration is taking place with the MEF. For this reason, the MEF has the
best overall view of the agricultural sector when the budget is being prepared after negotiating
with the sector ministries in succession. In view of this, this analytical review should be as
beneficial to MEF as it is to the sector’s ministries.

This process demands rigor in adhering to a schedule for preparing the budget. Like any
precision mechanism, such an elaborate process requires special attention on everyone's part as
well as stability in order to function. The process is supposed to begin in March (i.e., in the first
quarter of the previous budget year) and to end with the passage of the Finance Bill in October,
or no later than December (for a maximum of six months) so that the new financial year starts
with implementation of a new budget.

In the past, this budget process followed the schedule quite closely, with the exception of
election years, when there was often a one- to two-month delay, leading the Government to adopt
the principle of budget implementation by provisional twelfth. This enables government agencies
to implement essential expenditures before the year’s budget is put in place. However, since
1999, social and political instability has seriously interfered with the preparation and adoption of
the national budget, leading to significant delays in adopting the budget of up to six months
(Table 26).

 (days)



This table shows that budget preparation was repeatedly and significantly delayed until 2007.
With the process taking around nine (9) months to complete, it is remarkable that after the budget
                                                  83
was prepared six months late in 2007, the preparation of the 2008 budget was completed three
days early in 2008. In fact, preparation times then continued to improve, which seems to indicate
that the schedule has been mastered under conditions that are still less than optimal. It should be
noted that the table includes 2011, which falls outside of the period studied, in order to illustrate
the adverse effect of unstable situations (here, the post-election crisis of 2010–2011) on budget
preparation. (That is why this exceptional year was not included in the study.)However, budget
preparation does not end with the distribution of the approved budget to each ministry. Further
adjustments are made to the approved budget before it becomes the current allocated budget
based on which expenditures are implemented. This means there is an overlap between budget
calendars, not only for budget specialists but also for the ministries and technical departments.
Even as implementation begins on the budget for the current year, preparation also starts on the
budget for the following year. In fact, as shown in Table 26, preparation of the budget for the
year often starts before completion of the budget for the current year.

Budget Implementation

The budget implementation rate measures the technical efficiency of the budget preparation
process. Referring to assumptions of costs as actual expenditures is a reminder of this feature.
Despite the minutiae of budget preparation, the budget approved according to the Finance Bill and
allocated after adjustments is not the budget taken over by the Treasury so that it can pay for ABE
goods and services. For the 1999–2010 period, the budget implementation rate was 62% (Table
26). However, as Table 27 shows, the budget implementation rate is much higher for wage-related
expenditures (90.4%) because the payroll needs to be met first regardless of problems involved. It
is also higher for the Treasury as the funding source (83%) because the Government has greater
control over its internal resources than it does over external loans and grants.

It is surprising (or perhaps not) to find a lack of correlation between budget preparation time and
implementation rate. In fact, one would expect that the longer the preparation time, the less time
the ministries will have to use up budgets completed late. However, it seems that this does not
occur because at the end of the year, as in many countries and institutions around the world,
explicit orders are given to spend all available26 resources before the end of the year. However, the


26
      Excessively draconian caps to expenditures at the start of the year result in significant available funds at the end of
     the year.

                                                              84
quality of expenditures, which inevitably suffers from this haste in spending, can only be
identified by tracking expenditures. Meanwhile, the level of budget implementation has improved.

In fact, the budget implementation rate improved markedly toward the end of the period studied.
From 54.7% during the 1999–2005 sub-period, which corresponded to the height of the crisis
prior to 2011, it rose to 77.7% during the 2006–2010 period as the new Government made
improving the budget implementation rate a priority. Table 28 shows the results of the
complementary study covering the 2011–2013 period.

Source: SIGFiP

As Table 28 shows, there was a marked improvement in the implementation rate, though MINEF
achieved only 51.58% in 2013. Meanwhile, the implementation rate for capital expenditures was
abnormally low (10.78%).

This study sought to determine the sources of improvement in the budget implementation rate
from 1999–2005 to 2006–2010 by analyzing SIGFiP data. In terms of funding sources, the
efficiency gain came mainly from better anticipation of Treasury funds. This could be seen in the
analysis of funding sources mentioned in the previous chapter. During the 2006–2010 period, as
also noted immediately above, it seems that the Government continued to find it difficult to
harnessing the budgeted external resources. However, while there was only marginal
improvement in the scheduling of loans, grants fared somewhat better.

In terms of expenditure types, as the implementation rate in terms of wages was already
satisfactory, the improvement in this type of expenditure was relatively slight. The relative
improvement came primarily from better scheduling of off-wages expenditures and somewhat less
from investments even if the gain for this latter component was significant.

Table 29 compares budget implementation rates among the ministries in terms of type of
expenditure. MINAGRI did less well than the others because it was forced to reduce its budget
allocations the most during the period. Meanwhile, MINEF managed a very good score in budget
implementation for wages, seemingly because of a special provision the team does not yet fully
understand.

There are several reasons for the overall low rate of budget implementation. These include the
lack of liquidity, which implies either a lack of realism in terms of projections or budget
conferences as well as adverse circumstances that affected the amount of revenue or external
support received during the year, or most likely a combination of the two. However, there is also
inefficiency in the process of implementing expenditures, which includes four steps:

The commitment is the act by which a public body creates or acknowledges an obligation from
which a cost will result. It has a legal dimension (creation of an obligation on the part of the

                                                    87
supplier) and an accounting dimension (assignment of part of budget funds to implementation of
the expenditure).

Liquidation is intended to verify the reality of the debt and to determine the amount of the
expenditure. As the Government pays only after the service is rendered, the calculation is done
only after the order is delivered, and the controller is therefore entitled to verify delivery of the
order.

The order to pay is given to the public accountant by the party empowered to authorize the
expenditure, in this case the MEF, or the entity authorized by it (DAAF, prefect). (Note that when
SIGFiP refers to the order to pay coming before preparation of the current budget has been
completed, it means approved budget.)

Payment is the payment of funds by the public accountant to the Government’s creditor. The
public accountant and the party who issues the order to pay are two different authorities. For this
reason, SIGFiP does not record payment transactions but rather the amount of the charges
assumed, which the creditor will use in order to be paid by the public accountant.

An analysis of the public expenditure cycle reveals significant delays in applying the budget
implementation procedures summarized above (Table 30). A statistical test was conducted on a
sample of 274 expenditures, including 110 by MINAGRI, 42 by MINEF, and 122 by MIRAH for
fiscal years 2009 and 2010. The test compares the time elapsing between budget implementation
and the norms set by the Government for performing these tasks.

In the commitment phase, when the controller had eight (8) days to approve the draft purchase
order, about 70% of commitment applications were approved after the specified period of time.
Only 85 of the 274 commitment applications sent in were returned within the prescribed period.
The average time for approval of commitment applications is estimated at 16 days, with a
variation coefficient (VC) of 0.83 and a peak of 88 days, or over ten times the mandated period.

                                                      88
In the order-to-pay phase, DAAF is more responsive, with the average time taken to complete
this task meeting the target. However, it should be noted that despite the 5-day average, the
variation factor remains high (0.90). For the accounting step, the average time for assuming the
expenditure, which is 16 days, is well in excess of the regulatory five days.

It was not possible to determine the respective degree of responsibility of the authorizer and the
financial controller (as a result of missing documents in the applications sent by DAAF for
approval and delays in reviewing the application by the latter). However, it is clear that such
delays, when imposed on an agricultural activity such as purchasing inputs, lead to failure of the
farmer’s crop for the season. This is where the technical efficiency of the agricultural sector’s
budget will become apparent. Even if the budget is completed late and a relatively significant
portion of the allocated amounts is unavailable (because of caps), greater effort should be made
to avoid delays in the implementation process.

In terms of improving budget implementation, a Public Expenditure Management and Financial
Accountability Review (PEMFAR) review was conducted for 2008.

In view of the weaknesses found, a public finance reform plan was prepared involving nine (9)
strategic themes, which the new administration is currently implementing:

   1. Improving the legal and institutional framework of the public finance management
      system;
   2. Enhancing transparency in the management of the public finances;
   3. Optimizing resource allocation;
   4. Improving budgetary discipline;
   5. Improving the traceability and monitoring of budget implementation;
   6. Developing accountability mechanisms;
   7. Improving the legislative and regulatory framework for government contracts;
   8. Enhancing the institutional framework for government contracts; and
   9. Enhancing the operational framework for government contracts.

Points 3 to 5 and 9 are the most important for the agricultural sector.

                IX. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS


Conclusions
Agricultural Public Expenditure Levels and Trends

The agricultural sector was not the government’s dominant priority over the period 1999–2010.
This is reflected by the Maputo target, which Côte d’Ivoire never met as the share of agricultural
public expenditure (APE) in the national budget averaged 4%, well below the 10% agreed on by
the Heads of State in 2003. It can also be seen in the fact that over the period, the rural
population still accounted for 54% of the total while the average distribution of APE among that
population was less than CFAF 6,000 per rural resident per year. Lastly, while Côte d’Ivoire was
a leader in terms of support for the agricultural sector from 1960 to 1980, it fell behind in that
area compared with other countries during the study period.

However, Côte d’Ivoire was not the only country to fail to honor its Maputo commitment. As of
2010, only seven NEPAD countries (Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Guinea, Malawi, Mali, Niger, and
Senegal) met the Maputo target.

   •   The exclusion of feeder roads from COFOG does not mean that Côte d’Ivoire should
       seek to meet the Maputo target by cutting expenditure on these roads;
   •   Côte d’Ivoire should seek a consistent and steady increase in APE year on year for better
       planning of this expenditure. The medium-term expenditure framework should help with
       this;
   •   It would also be misguided to focus on the share of AGDP within GDP because this ratio
       tends to decrease naturally as agriculture modernizes and changes with the creation of
       value added being captured by other sectors and the weight of these other sectors in the
       economy grows.

Composition of APE

A comparison between ministries confirms MINAGRI’s dominance, accounting for 80% of
the expenditure of the key ministries (MINAGRI, MIRAH, and MINEF). This reflects the
country's environmental conditions, which are more conducive to plant production than to
livestock production while large tracts of forest were cleared to make way for plantations.
MINAGRI’s predominance is even greater when we take into account expenditure targeting the
plant subsectors in its objectives. However, this concentration seems excessive given the need to
promote diversification in the agricultural sector and the expectation that the private sector will
play a greater role in agribusiness sectors with a view to guarding against the difficulties
encountered under similar circumstances in the past.


                                                90
The functional composition of APE, including off-budget expenditure, suggests that high
priority was awarded to plant sectors. Large funds were allocated by the EU and the government
in support of agribusiness sectors, such as coffee/cocoa, and subsectors considered distressed,
such as cotton. These sectors therefore supplanted rice and staple crops. Aside from the argument
that these distressed subsectors required particular attention, the priority given to them was at
odds with their performance, with sugar growing a modest 1% over the 2000–2010 period but
bananas declining around 2%, cotton falling around 5%, and pineapples recording the sharpest
fall of all at around 13%. Interestingly, the best-performing subsectors received no direct support
from the government or from off-budget EU expenditure. This concerns in particular cashew
nuts, whose average growth rate over the period 2000–2009 was spectacular (21%), followed by
papayas (11%) and rubber (6%). It should probably be recognized that investment played a major
role in the development of subsectors such as cashew nuts, rubber, and non-traditional fruits.

The regional allocation of APE suggests that priority was given to the savannah region. This
impression is corroborated if one examines off-budget EU expenditure in support of a number of
subsectors set up in the savannah areas (in particular cotton). As for transfers to the departments
as part of the decentralization process, these began in 2003 and amounted to too low a level for
sound conclusions to be drawn. However, as they play a role in development in principle, they
should be monitored. Tidying up the SIGFiP classification will enable a more detailed analysis of
regional APE allocations and reveal priorities not granted to the regional decentralization of
administrative services.

The economic composition of budgeted APE (not including off-budget expenditure) generally
reveals the features we would expect (or fear), that is, a balance heavily tilted in favor of
recurrent expenditure (80%), including wage (48%) and non-wage expenditure (35%) on average
over the period. However, in budget allocation, the intention was to strike a balance between
expenditure types, with precedence given to investment (36%) followed by non-wage
expenditure (33%) and the smallest share going to wages. The extra contribution from off-budget
expenditure helped strike this balance.

Input subsidies represented 9% of sector PAE (excluding off-budget expenditure) over the
period 1999–2010. Almost all (around 98%) of these subsidies were used to finance inputs for
plant subsectors, primarily pesticides (68% of subsidies) followed by staple seeds (29%). Inputs
for livestock production (vaccines and animal pharmaceuticals) received only around 2% of
these subsidies.

Total APE on agricultural research over the period came to CFAF 60.12 billion (83% of which
was met by the Treasury), or the equivalent of 10.7% of MINAGRI expenditure, 8% of APE
excluding off-budget expenditure, 0.43% of actual national expenditure, and 0.23% of AGDP.
The latter outcome falls short of the NEPAD target for national investment in agricultural R&D
(at least 1% of GDP). The National Center for Agricultural Research (CNRA), the leading


                                                91
organization dedicated to agricultural research, is largely dependent on the private sector, in
particular FIRCA.

Over the period, APE on feeder roads (all sources combined) totaled CFAF 52.581 billion, of
which CFAF 22.305 billion (42.42%) was financed by the subsectors, i.e., by the private sector.
The size of the contribution of the Rural Investment Fund (FIMR), which amounted to 39% of
APE on roads, should be noted. The government also made a noteworthy investment effort over
the period 2003–2006 (emergency program), which was subsequently carried on by the
subsectors and the EU between 2007 and 2010. Expenditure on feeder roads over the period
accounted for 10.49% of APE (COFOG+, i.e., COFOG including feeder roads).

Total APE on outreach amounted to CFAF 545,395 million, with off-budget financing
representing 124.64% of budgeted expenditure. This expenditure represented on average 1% of
AGDP for expenditure excluding off-budget items and 2.13% including off-budget items. Two
entities played a large role in this area. Although ANADER drew most of its funding from the
government (87% of its financing of CFAF 126.35) over the 1999–2010 period, over the past
three years, it has mobilized slightly more than 20% of its funding, while 12% came from
FIRCA. The large contributions by the subsectors to FIRCA (CFAF 19.60 billion over the
period) made it possible to finance research and outreach (public goods) from private funds. As
regards the economic composition of allocations to the subsectors, as hoped at the subsector
level, expenditure on wages made up the smallest share (16%), with one-third spent on
investment and more than half allocated to non-wage expenditure. Here too, off-budget
expenditure favored achieving these desired results. At the regional level, resources were
allocated above all to covering non-wage expenditure. In terms of public and private goods,
the economic allocation was also largely as expected in that wages were predominant (more than
60%) in the production of public goods. Meanwhile, the share of investment was smaller (less
than 20%), whereas in the production of private goods, the share of wages was the lowest (less
than 20%), with a sizable share going to investment (close to 40%).

Financing Sources

During the period of crisis from 1999 to 2010, the Ivorian public Treasury was the main source
of financing for budgeted APE (around 87% on average). Taking into account off-budget
expenditure, the Treasury covered slightly over 60%. For the subsectors, off-budget expenditure
was the largest source of financing.

Financing Sources and Economic Composition

We would expect grants and loans to be spent primarily on investment and much less on
recurrent expenditure and on wages in particular. This is one of the principles or even conditions
underpinning donor financing. It is therefore comforting to see that this expectation was borne
out by the results, with the lion’s share of grants (73%) going to investment while only 4% went


                                               92
to wages. With regard to loans, 43% was allocated to investment and 18% to wages. With regard
to the Treasury, 54% of resources was used to pay wages and only 14% went to investment.

Budget Implementation, Execution, and Follow-Up

There is no room in the steps involved in budget implementation for consultation between the
key ministries. Intense budget conferences are held within each ministry and between
representatives from each ministry and the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF).

The calendar for the implementation of the budget was not often abided by during the
period. These steps (from macroeconomic projections to budget trade-offs, the publication of the
finance bill, and budget allocation) are undoubtedly necessary but are very time-consuming.
Several months, in some cases as many as six months, were needed to organize the budget so that
the budget of the following year needed to be prepared even as the budget for the current year
was not yet in place. However, in 2008 and 2009, the budget for the current year was set in the
final quarter of the previous year. This shows that it is possible to rein in the budget
implementation process.

Budget execution rates were very low during 1999–2010: only 62% on average over the
period. As one would expect, budget execution was much better (though not perfect) for wages
(90%) and good for the Treasury (83%) as wages are the first priority and the government
managed the resources of the public Treasury much better than the direct resources received from
donors during this period of socio-political crisis. MINAGRI had the lowest execution rate
(57%). We note that this rate improved markedly from the period 1999–2005 (55%) to 2006–
2010 (78%). After the new government made this indicator a priority, the rate in 2012 improved
further. However, this indicator of technical efficiency can paint a misleading picture. We
note that the timeframe for setting up the budget does not appear to have been consistent with the
budget execution rate, which was not necessarily worse when delays were long. This may be
because sector administrations hurried to commit the balance of funds as the year end
approached. Accordingly, while a poor budget execution rate is a sign of poor performance, a
good rate does not necessarily indicate good performance.

Execution norms do not appear to have always been observed. Based on a sample of
commitments, we note that the average time needed to receive the approval of the financial
controller of requests for commitment (draft orders) submitted by the Directorate of
Administrative and Financial Affairs (DAAF) was 16 days. This is twice as long as the eight (8)
days set aside for this operation. In one case, this process took as many as 88 days. For
agricultural activities (requiring, for example, the procurement of seeds or fertilizer), such delays
could thwart a growing season because the inputs are not delivered on time.

Database and Collection



                                                 93
As per the terms of reference, this basic diagnostic review of APE drew on empirical data. This
mainly involved SIGFiP and estimates of off-budget expenditure from the EU, FAO, ANADER,
ONDR, and FIRCA.

Despite a solid structure and highly capable staff, SIGFiP has a number of flaws. For a while,
verification of data consistency posed a problem, and the information concerning the budget
allocated and actual expenditure changed from one extraction to another. Adjustments designed
to reconstruct complete and consistent series for previously merged but now split ministries also
posed a challenge. Name changes for the five ministries concerned by this study (including a
code change for Water Resources and Forests) generated confusion for a long time. It is possible
that after the ministries split, some headings were kept in one ministry and not in another but
with lines of expenditure that no longer matched the names of these headings. It is likely that the
adjustment will never be perfect, especially with regard to the distribution of the administrative
expenditure of the formerly merged ministries. However, while these adjustments may affect the
expenditure of the ministries in question, they do not fundamentally change overall APE for the
sectors covered by these ministries.

Data for off-budget expenditure by development partners (DPs) play a large role in APE. Yet it is
very difficult to obtain these, and the data gathered do not have the level of detail required if they
are to be used at the same level as SIGFiP data in analyses of the composition of APE. It is not
always execution levels that they reflect but rather amounts made available to the country.

Recommendations

Recommendations to the Ministries Concerned

Broadly speaking:

   •   The sector should pursue the strategy (1999–2015) designed to develop the subsectors
       with emphasis on those subsectors neglected over the period: fisheries and aquaculture,
       sustainable livestock farming, and the restoration of forestry assets. Fortunately, as this
       diversification is already included in the NAIP, it is simply a question of putting it into
       action;
   •   The key ministries should set up with a consultation mechanism for discussing the
       budgeting and programming of public investment for the sector. This consultation
       mechanism may be set up by the NAIP secretariat, which would perform a coordinating
       role in the execution of sector-wide public investment;
   •   The budget execution rate should be confirmed by a follow-up of the budget because it
       does not necessarily display technical efficiency even when it is correct;
   •   Compliance with budget execution rules must be systematically documented in order to
       improve budget execution. The new Time Management directive, which consists in
       electronically verifying file send and receipt dates, should serve as a tool for estimating


                                                 94
       timeframes in budget execution procedures;
   •   It will be necessary to strengthen capacities for drafting and executing budgets among the
       agricultural administrations in order to improve sector performances;
   •   It will also be necessary to consider reforming the decentralized services of the
       agricultural sector ministries in order to grant them allocations that are commensurate
       with the functions attributed to them, including in agricultural research.


In terms of inputs:

   •   To improve agricultural productivity, the level and quality of inputs used must be
       improved through measures such as:

           − Targeted subsidies for fertilizer prices;
           − Targeted subsidies for the cost of innovative small equipment;
           − The creation of a distribution network designed to improve the availability of
             inputs;
           − A credit guarantee fund accessible to banks; and
           − The development of skills in family farm management to help them modernize;

   •   Over time, support for the organization of the subsectors should lead them to totally or
       partially manage inputs themselves.



In terms of agricultural research:

   •   Budget conferences should enable consultation between the key ministries and the
       Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research (MESRSCI) and its institutions;
   •   The mechanism for disbursing funds must show flexibility by taking into account the fact
       that agricultural research (in particular on plant production) is highly weather-dependent;
   •   Within the framework of the NDP, the government should increase the share allocated to
       agricultural research. The search for financing through regional and sub-regional
       programs should be encouraged (e.g., WECARD);
   •   Negotiations should be undertaken with industry leaders in order to identify a mechanism
       that would lead to ensuring their continued contribution;
   •   As the agribusiness subsector does not contribute to FIRCA, it should be called upon to
       do so.

In terms of outreach:

   •   Sector budgets will have to improve the share allocated to training. It would be
       worthwhile to carry out an in-depth study of decentralization to the regional directorates

                                               95
       in order to improve their structure and equip them with the means to make a significant
       contribution to the outreach and project follow-up mechanisms.

With regard to feeder roads:

   •   The involvement of the subsectors in the maintenance of feeder roads should be
       encouraged, in addition to government investment;
   •   A strategy paper should also be drafted on the maintenance of equipment and investments
       in general.

Recommendations for the Ministry of Economy and Finance

   •   Above all, the mobilization of funds must be improved and the cap raised or the
       constraint on it removed. This cap means that even if the budget is considered in place,
       only commitments up to a very low level can be made due to a lack of funds. Splitting
       bulk orders that could benefit from a reduction in wholesale prices leads to delays and
       cost overruns.

Recommendations for the SIGFiP

   •   The SIGFiP should carry out a validation of the database to identify the source of the data
       inconsistencies noted in this review. This is why series of budget allocations and
       commitments should be drawn separately to be consistent;
   •   It would be timely to update the SIGFiP software to make it possible to export data in a
       more current Excel format than the very limited Excel 95 format;
   •   In terms of classification, the SIGFiP should continue to fine-tune the content of headings
       and sub-headings (and document the process) in order to ensure transparency in
       classification. Otherwise, it will be difficult to replicate the same analyses and obtain the
       same results, which remains the essential test of scientific objectivity;
   •   Off-budget expenditure should be included in the SIGFiP database to enable adequate
       analysis of it. If not, the ministries concerned and DPs should agree on standard formats
       for collecting information through a tracking system that provides the level of detail
       required for analyses of APE.
   •   With regard to off-budget expenditure also, large investments were made in the sector by
       the First Lady, the Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration Agency (ADDR),
       and the National Plan against Climate Change (PNRC). Traceability of this financing and
       especially an evaluation of its impact would improve the level of APE identified.
