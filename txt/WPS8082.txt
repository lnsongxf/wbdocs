           A substantial amount of research has been done on the impact of the financial system on
economic outcomes since the 2008 financial crisis. Attention has mostly been focused on the
financial system’s contribution to productivity, innovation and growth on the one hand, and to the
nature of recessions accompanying financial busts on the other. Related to the latter strand of study
is the impact of financial sector activities on economic volatility, another area that has been of
interest. The benefits of deep financial systems in supporting growth has long been recognized in
both theoretical and empirical economics. Policy makers have supported enhanced access to credit
for households as well as firms, with a view to support consumption smoothing and investment
decisions by households. More recently, research has focused on whether finance in all forms
supports growth and whether fast growing financial sectors support growth in all contexts or only
under certain conditions. Researchers have asked whether certain financial sector activities should
be constrained or regulated differently or whether growth of overall credit should be slowed
because (a) the resource allocation that occurs in certain contexts is not productivity or growth
enhancing, or (b) because the economywide cost risks associated with financial activities outweigh
the benefits of individual risk-taking.

           This paper examines whether credit to different types of borrowers, namely, households
and firms, has differential effects on external balances. The reason for the differential effects would
spring from the presumption that households and firms tend to borrow for distinct purposes.
Households primarily borrow for consumption2 while firms would borrow for production, part of
which might be exported. In the first instance, therefore, trade balances would tend to be more
negatively affected by consumer credit, while export shares to GDP would not be affected, or
would be affected negatively if credit is diverted to imports for consumption. Part of firm credit
may support export related activities, though overall, the effect is ambiguous. Rising credit may
affect domestic demand to such an extent that the export facilitating effect is subsumed by the
import effect.

           This paper builds on recent research that examines the link between financial systems and
economic outcomes by extending the types of outcomes affected by finance and also by
distinguishing by borrower type. The paper uses panel data covering 42 countries over the period

they are households or firms – matters in terms of how credit affects economic outcomes.

Related Literature

       This paper builds on studies that analyze the impact of financial activity on growth and
volatility. Studies on finance and growth are plenty. Levine (2005) and Demirguc-Kunt and Levine
(2008) discuss the many channels through which finance supports economic activity, including
through higher investment, supporting innovation, and enabling consumption smoothing and risk
sharing. They discuss both theoretical and empirical papers that demonstrate how finance supports
growth. King and Levine (1993), Levine et al (2000), Rousseau and Wachtel (2000), and Beck et
al (2000) also discuss the impact of finance on growth. Rajan and Zingales (1998) and Demirguc-
Kunt and Maksimovic (1998) use industry and firm level data to explore the positive impact of
finance on growth. More recently, Levine and Warusawitharana (2014) find that external finance
supports productivity growth in their sample of European countries.

       However, a number of recent papers revisit the finance-growth relationship and find more
nuanced effects. Gazdar and Cherif (2015), looking at countries in the Middle East and in North
Africa, find that finance is more likely to support growth in good institutional contexts.
Demetriades and Law (2006) find that financial development has larger effects on GDP per capita
when the financial system is imbedded within a sound institutional framework. Barajas et al (2013)
find that the beneficial effect of financial deepening on growth varies across countries; lower
income countries benefit less because their regulatory and supervisory systems are less developed.
Aizenman, Yinjarak and Park (2015) find a nonlinear effect of finance and growth and an uneven
effect across sectors. They compare East Asia and Latin America, concluding that both the quantity
and quality of finance matter in determining the impact of finance on economic activity. When the
financial system channels resources to the most productive sectors of the real economy, then
growth in finance and real output is expected to be positively correlated. Arcand et al (2012) find
that there is a threshold size for the financial sector beyond which finance does not have a positive
impact on growth. Shen and Lee (2005) show that stock market development has a positive effect
on growth but banking development does not; they find that the conditioning variables of financial
liberalization, high income level and good shareholder protection mitigate the negative effects of
banking development on growth. Cecchetti and Kharroubi (2012, 2015) find that the impact of

                                                                                                   3
finance on growth is nonlinear (very large financial sectors can have a negative relationship with
growth) and that a fast growing financial sector has a negative impact on aggregate productivity
growth. In their theoretical model, this is because (a) low productivity (and high collateral) projects
are more likely to be financed by banks seeking collateral, and (b) the financial sector may take
away human resources from more productive sectors. Their empirical work covers advanced
economies.

       Few papers have differentiated between the impact of credit going to households versus
firms. Yet in recent times, there has been increasing attention given to the fast increases in
household credit (that have occurred in US and some European credit markets). Much of credit to
households is mortgage credit, a type of credit that increases relative to enterprise credit during
asset price booms, but other credit has also increased. There is an ongoing move to support further
financial inclusion, that is, not just providing consumers with a savings source, but also facilitating
the extension of household credit, as a means of improving welfare.

       Theory is ambiguous with respect to the effect of higher household credit on growth.
Results vary according to whether it is assumed (or demonstrated) that higher household credit
raises consumption and lowers savings (and therefore investment), or whether it raises investment,
for example in human capital. The former scenario is analyzed by Jappelli and Pagano (1994),
while the latter is made by Galor and Zeira (1993) and De Gregorio (1996). For the period 1994-
2005, Beck et al (2012) analyze the relationship between household credit and growth empirically.
Examining the contribution of household credit to economic growth, they find that household
credit has no positive relationship with growth, but that firm credit does. Moreover, enterprise
credit growth is associated with faster reductions in income inequality, while household credit is
not. BIS (2006) discusses the implications of rising household credit for financial and
macroeconomic stability in mature markets. IMF (2006) highlights the additional risks associated
with rapid household credit growth in emerging markets, where weaknesses in financial
institutions and regulatory capacity can heighten risks. The IMF report concludes that access to
credit should be accompanied by measures to enhance resilience and safety of the financial system.
BIS (2006) examines the rise of housing finance pre-2008, raising concerns about the rise of
subprime mortgages. It highlights the important role that governments play, particularly through
tax and subsidy systems for housing and land, in affecting housing market developments, and

documents the rise of borrowing/lending for houses. Both the IMF and BIS papers focus on risks
– for example debt-financed household borrowing leading to larger current account deficits on the
one hand, and excessive borrowing in situations where there is little regulation to protect
households or banks from taking on risks that they are unable to manage.

       The link between financial development and trade and/or exports has been studied in
previous papers. For example, Beck (2002, 2003) investigates whether financial development
translates into comparative advantage for industries that use external finance. Using industry- level
data, he finds that countries with better developed financial systems have higher export shares and
trade balances. His paper follows the notions developed in Kletzer and Bardhan (1987) and
Baldwin (1989) in which financial markets are a source of comparative advantage, particularly in
industries with higher external financing needs. Some papers examine the role of financial
constraints in explaining trade patterns in the wake of the recent financial crisis and come to
varying results. Amiti and Weinstein (2011), Ahn et al (2011), and Chor and Manova (2012)
conclude that credit frictions contributed substantially to the collapse in trade. Levchenko et al
(2010) and Eaton et al (2011) do not find significant impacts of the credit channel. Coban (2015)
finds finance to be important in supporting exports in Turkey. Contessi and Nicola (2013) review
the literature on the role of finance in international trade and, after accounting for the heterogeneity
in methodologies, measures of access to and dependence on finance, and find an important impact
of finance on trade, particularly at the extensive margin.

       Building on this theoretical and empirical research, this paper researches the relationship
between borrower composition, external balances and GDP composition. It expands earlier
research on the topic.

Data and Methodology

       The data for household and firm credit are taken from the Bank for International
Settlements (BIS). Most regressions cover the period 1964-2013, for 42 countries. All other data
sources and time periods are described in the annex, Table A1. The relationships are estimated
using OLS and 2SLS, though only the 2SLS versions are shown.

       Table 1A below shows indicators of financial sector development from 1994-2013, using
credit ratios to GDP as the measure of financial sector development. The period before the most

                                                                                                      5
recent financial boom (1994-2005) and the period covering the boom, crisis and recovery periods
(2006-2013) are separated. The average for the entire period is shown in Annex Table A2. As the
table shows, total credit to GDP increased in all countries in the sample, save five (Argentina,
Germany, Japan, Mexico, and Thailand), and in some cases, substantially, for example, Denmark,
Ireland, Luxembourg and Spain, to name a few. In about a quarter of the sample (11 countries),
the share of household credit in total credit has remained the same or fallen, when comparing the
two periods. Interestingly, the countries in which the share of total credit has fallen are not the
same countries where the share of household credit in total credit has fallen (save Germany).
Examining the scatterplot of the household credit share against GDP per capita over the two
periods (Figure 1A) shows a mostly unchanged association between the pre- and post-boom
periods. In contrast, the association between nonfinancial corporation credit share and GDP per
capita is stronger in the post-boom period than before.

           Table 1B shows how real credit evolved in the years immediately preceding and following
the financial crisis of 2008 (average of annual growth rates of real credit). The household credit
booms of China (56% growth), the Russian Federation (53% growth) and Turkey (40% growth)
during 2004-2008 are remarkable. Other countries with credit growth equal to or above 15% are
Argentina, Brazil, the Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary and Poland.3 Interestingly, during the
same period, growth rates for firm credit were much lower in comparison. For example, real credit
growth to firms was only 9% in China, 19% in Russia and 18% in Turkey. Firm credit growth was
lower than 10%, in some cases, much lower, in the other countries that saw large increases in
household credit growth. Correspondingly, household credit growth rates were generally lower in
the years including, and since, 2009, so that the mean decline in growth rates over all countries
(average of the 2009-2013 column below) is 7% for household credit and 5% for firm credit. The
changing composition of credit, reflecting different spending patterns, might be expected to have
substantial impacts on the economy. These impacts may show in the composition of GDP as well
as in external balances, aspects that are analyzed in this paper.

           Tables 2 and Figures 1A and 1B show the changing correlation between household and
firm credit and GDP per capita during different time periods. While there is variation across
countries, there is substantial correlation between income level, trade openness, financial openness
and credit growth relative to GDP, especially for firms. This correlation changes over time. For
example, the correlation coefficient between NFC credit and GDP per capita during the period
before the credit boom was 0.51 and had jumped to 0.69 during the period 2004-2013. At the same
time, the correlation with trade and financial openness increased substantially for NFC credit, but
not for credit to households. Clearly, other factors besides openness became more important in
later years in terms of determining household access to credit;4, 5 for example, a housing market
boom or other factors increasing credit, such as a period of “excess” global liquidity.

  The data on household credit shares were compared with that in a recent paper by Beck et al (2012) for the period
1994-2005. For the countries that overlap, the Beck et al figures are usually larger. However, the averages for the
period 1994-2013 (used in this paper) are generally substantially larger for several countries than their averages,
reflecting the fact that these ratios rose over time.

  Note that only four countries (Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, and United States) have data beginning in 1964. The
correlations and regressions (not shown) are also done for the period 1994-2013.

using the following equation:

an interaction term with initial GDP per capita and the log of private credit, institutions, and

inflation, among others. DVFC is a dummy variable representing the proportion of years in a
banking crisis. DVCX is a dummy variable that takes the value 1 if the country is a commodity
exporter. The relationship between the trade balance and credit is investigated using the following
relationship:

         (2) Trade balance to GDP = a + b ln (initial GDP p.c) + c ln (household credit/GDP) +
             d ln (firm credit/GDP) + e DVFC + f (financial openness) + g (DVCX) +
             h (foreign direct investment) + i (terms of trade) + jZ

         A number of controls are also used (as above). Table 3A below shows the estimated
relationship between total private credit as a share of GDP and the export share of GDP. In almost
all specifications, the relationship is significant. In specifications that control for the share of years
that a country has been in a financial crisis, the estimates show a much larger effect of private
credit on export shares. The financial crisis dummy variable is large and significant, as expected.
As expected, foreign direct investment is positively related to the export share in GDP.

         Table 3B examines how the relationship between credit and the export share may depend
on borrower type. The results clearly vary depending on whether credit is provided to households
or firms. Household credit is not robustly related to export shares; in several specifications, the
relationship is not significant. In cases where there is a significant relationship, it tends to be
negative. Providing credit to households does not support export growth, as might be expected.
However, the situation is very different with credit to firms, which has a robustly significant (and
substantial) impact on export shares. FDI continues to be a strong explanatory variable as does the
FCDV.6 The effects are not small. In regression (1) of Table 3A, a 1 percent increase in total
private credit as a share of GDP is associated with an estimated 0.1785 percentage-point increase
in export share in GDP, holding all else constant (the average is 0.2). In regression (1) of Table
3B, a 1 percent increase in firm credit as a share of GDP is associated with an estimated 0.3873
percentage-point increase in export share in GDP, holding all else constant. The size of the
coefficient is much larger than for total private credit, averaging 0.42.7



6
  Note that a 1 percent increase in total private credit as a share of GDP is associated with an estimated /100
percentage-point increase in export share in GDP, holding all else constant.
7
  The coefficients remain substantial and significant when the shorter period, 1994-2013 is used as a robustness
check. However, the coefficient size for firm credit is on average 0.32.

                                                                                                                   11

         Table 4A explores the relationship between the trade balance and credit. In this case,
private credit has a significant relationship with the trade balance, only once the years in financial
crisis are accounted for with a dummy variable. However, examining the relationship between
credit and the trade balance more closely by separating credit by type of borrower shows that the
household credit share is consistently, significantly and negatively associated with the trade
balance while the firm credit share is positively related (Table 4B).

         In regression (1), a 1 percent increase in household credit as a share of GDP is associated
with an estimated 0.0320 percentage-point decrease in trade balance as a share of GDP, holding
all else constant; while a 1 percent increase in firm credit as a share of GDP is associated with an
estimated 0.0611 percentage-point increase in the trade balance as a share of GDP, holding all else
constant. Commodity exporter status has a large positive, significant association with the trade
balance.8 While the estimates vary, the impact of firm credit on the trade balance is larger and
positive, while the share of household credit is negatively related to the trade balance. Net exports
and FDI are positively related, as are financial openness and net exports, though the latter are not
consistently so.

         External balances reflect the pattern of domestic consumption and production as well as
international market forces. Thus, this paper also analyzes whether private credit provision affects
the composition of GDP, apart from the impact on export shares. For this estimation, the variables
normally used in growth regressions are used (as in the export share regression) with numerous
control variables:

         (3) Share in manufacturing = a + b ln (initial GDP p.c) + c ln (household credit/GDP) +
             d ln (firm credit/GDP) + e DVFC + f (trade openness) + g (enrolment) +
             h (foreign direct investment) + i (terms of trade) + jZ




8
  In the regressions using the shorter data set (1994-2013), the negative relationship between the trade balance and
the household credit share is not robust, and the positive relationship with the firm credit share is significant only
after controlling for the financial crisis dummy.

                                                                                                                     14

         First, a regression uses the share of total private credit as an explanatory variable (Table
5A). The relationship between total private credit to GDP and the share of manufacturing in GDP
is positive, but the relationship is not robust, being significant in only specifications (1) and (6)
below. Table 5B shows the relationship between household and firm credit shares and the
manufacturing output share in GDP. Credit to firms is significantly and consistently related to the
manufacturing share in GDP. However, household credit is negatively related and significant in
only one specification. The coefficient sizes are relatively stable across specifications except in
regression (4) where both the sample size and coefficients are smaller. To get an idea of the size
of the impact, regression (1) is used. In regression (1), a 1 percent increase in firm credit as a share
of GDP is associated with an estimated 0.0750 percentage-point increase in manufacturing value
added as a share of GDP, and 0.0623 percentage-point change in equation (5), holding all else
constant. These effects are not negligible.9 In terms of other variables, the share of manufacturing
is inversely related to the initial level of GDP per capita. FDI shows a consistently negative relation
with the share of manufacturing in value added; this association may reflect the fact that much of
FDI may have been in infrastructure, including telecommunications and energy, and in
construction, instead of manufacturing. However, the coefficient on the FCDV is never significant.
The same exercise was conducted for the share of services in GDP. No credit variable was
significantly and robustly related to the share of services in GDP.

         This paper revisits the relationship between the financial sector, specifically credit, and
both exports and the trade balance. It also examines whether borrower composition, proxied by
the ratio of household and firm credit shares in GDP, matters for these variables. Finding that both
variables are positively related to the share of firm credit in GDP, it further explores to what extent
the relationship might be affected by the composition of production. It finds that while there is a
positive association between manufacturing shares to GDP and firm credit, there is no evidence
showing a significant relationship between the share of services and credit variables.

  Similar regressions covering a subset of countries over a shorter timeframe show a less robust relationship – when
the financial crisis dummy variable is added, the significance disappears.

Conclusion

       This paper has examined the relationship between financial system development and
macroeconomic outcomes, specifically external balances, adding to recent research on the various
effects of credit on aggregate outcomes. There is a substantial theoretical and empirical literature
examining the role of the financial sector in raising GDP growth and in managing risk in the
economy. This literature got a substantial boost after the 2008 global financial crisis. In addition,
policies to enhance the positive effects of financial system development (growth, consumption
smoothing) and diminish the potentially negative consequences of financial system growth
(unmanageable risks, and misallocation of resources from their most productive use, etc.) were
developed and debated. These included various types of macroprudential regulation, and
regulations on capital market transactions (financial system development being closely linked to
cross border capital flows in recent times), and banking regulations, among others.

       The paper extends existing research and finds that private credit is positively associated
with the export share in GDP, the trade balance and even the share of manufacturing in output.
Separating credit into household and firm credit shows that credit provided to households does not
affect the export share, though credit provided to firms is strongly related to export shares. Looking
at overall external balances, the relationship between private credit and the trade balance is not
generally significant; however, the ratio of household credit has a significant and robust
relationship with the trade balance. Household credit shares are negatively, and often significantly
related to the trade balance. This is presumably because household credit provision encourages
consumption of imports. Finally, part of the differential impact of household and firm credit may
be through the varying effect on manufacturing shares in output. This tends to increase with the
share of firm credit and is not affected by the household credit share in GDP. While these results
are preliminary, they are instructive in that they suggest that the impact of credit on the economy
depends on who borrows as well as other factors found in the literature by previous authors. The
analysis in this paper can be refined as data over longer time periods and for more countries
become available.
