       Executive Summary

1. The Palestinian people face an increasingly uncertain political environment, and an economy that
   is failing to generate the jobs and incomes that are needed to improve living standards.
   Restrictions on trade and the access to resources, along with a decade long blockade of Gaza have led
   to a continuing decline in the productive base of the economy - with the share of Gross Domestic
   Product (GDP) in manufacturing halved in the last twenty-five years. Unemployment is now
   approaching 30 percent on average, with youth unemployment in Gaza twice as high. Although 2016
   witnessed an improvement from the economic recession of 2014 - driven by a surge in reconstruction
   activity in Gaza – this is not sustainable nor sufficient to raise per capita incomes of the Palestinians.
   Looking forward GDP growth is expected to hover around 3.3 percent leading to a near stagnation in
   per capita income.1 Further increases in unemployment are also expected.

2. The fiscal position continues to be a source of risk for the economy. A series of one off receipts in
   2016 reduced the size of the fiscal deficit. However, with a continuing decline in donor budget support,
   the prospects for 2017 are grim, and the Bank projects a historically high financing gap of close to
   USD0.8 billion. The financing gap has in the past led to additional arrears to the private sector – posing
   significant risks to the economy – and the size of the current year gap raises the prospect of delayed
   wage or social assistance payments.

3. Risks surrounding the banking sector remain, but there have been positive recent developments.
   While the banking sector has been relatively stable, the derisking behavior of the Israeli correspondent
   banks poses a significant threat. Encouragingly, the Government of Israel (GoI) has provided short
   term cover for the Israeli banks, and the Palestinian Authority (PA) has been working actively to
   strengthen its systems to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Embedding
   improvements in the systems will be crucial prior to an international assessment that is currently
   scheduled for 2020. The direct and indirect exposure of the sector to the PA also needs to be monitored
   by the Palestine Monetary Authority (PMA), although the exposure has stabilized recently.

4. The Palestinian economy can only reach its full potential after a resolution on final status is
   reached, yet there is much more that can be done now to increase growth and improve the
   situation of the Palestinian people. Creating a supportive environment for investment in the
   productive sectors of the economy is critical. Increased investment can enhance the capacity of the
   economy, inspire entrepreneurial effort, and generate the jobs that are needed – especially for the large
   numbers of unemployed youth.

5. These points have been made at past Ad Hoc Liaison Committee (AHLC) meetings but actions
   to date have been inadequate. In this report we have again taken stock of progress in addressing past
   Bank recommendations to the AHLC and while there are developments, overall progress from the GoI
   and the PA has been minimal, and the core constraints on the economy remain. In a deteriorating status
   quo, the effectiveness of donor resources could be enhanced if more decisive policy moves are
   undertaken by all parties.




1   Medium term growth projections are produced by the IMF.

                                                              4
6. What is needed is a paradigm shift with measures from all three parties to create a mutually
   reinforcing momentum for change:

        a) The PA can make policy changes to mitigate risks and enable a more dynamic
           environment for private sector development, job generation, and growth. The fiscal risks
           posed by a USD0.8 billion financing gap are acute. These have to be addressed by taking
           policy decisions to make government spending more efficient and effective (especially with
           respect to the payroll and pension payments), and revenue reform is needed to address the weak
           and inequitable performance of the domestic tax system. Through policy reform the PA can
           also improve the investment climate to lower the cost of doing business, ensure a level playing
           field for all investors, and help new (small) companies enter the market.

        b) The GoI can improve the situation of the Palestinian people (especially the youth) by fully
           implementing existing agreements to facilitate movement and access to resources, and
           addressing the PA’s claims on losses on revenues. It is not in anyone’s interest to have high
           levels of Palestinian unemployment - especially among the youth. Opening up access to Gaza
           and removing the obstacles to trade, and allowing access to the resources in Area C would help
           improve the competitiveness of Palestinian businesses and encourage the jobs and investments
           that are needed. Much can be done to improve the performance of the economy within the
           existing Paris Protocol agreement and without putting at risk Israel’s security. In addition,
           progress has stalled in addressing the fiscal losses under the Paris Protocol that were identified
           in our April 2016 report and which could make an important contribution to the PA’s fiscal
           position.

        c) International donors can create a supportive environment if there is a greater will to
           implement the changes that are needed. Donor support has been on a declining path within
           a deteriorating status quo – with budget support falling from 32 percent of GDP in 2008 to
           close to 6 percent in 2016. A resolve on the part of the PA and GoI to address the constraints
           on the economy would be reinforced by additional donor support. In particular, additional
           budget support would be critical to assist the PA through the needed fiscal adjustment. There
           is also a challenge in the short term to create a more positive view of investment in the
           Palestinian territories. The donor community could help with innovative financing schemes
           that mitigate the political risks, and act as a catalyst for increased private sector investment.

7. Against an already bleak economic picture, this report focuses on the energy sector where supply
   shortages are further constraining growth prospects. Energy is already severely rationed in Gaza,
   and restrictions in parts of the West Bank apply during peak periods. World Bank demand projections
   are for electricity growth of 3.5 percent annually until 2030, with Gaza’s electricity needs almost
   doubling in that period. Increased imports and investment in domestic generation and transmission are
   critical to allow much needed services to be delivered (to the people of Gaza in particular), and to avoid
   having economic growth stunted by energy shortages. In particular, the Bank has assessed that
   addressing energy constraints has the potential to add on average 0.4 percentage points to Gaza’s annual
   GDP growth rate through to 2025.

8. Private sector investment will be crucial to meeting the energy shortfall but will depend on actions
   from both the PA and GoI to create a facilitating enabling environment. The new electricity
   agreement provides momentum for improving the sector but more is needed. A short term priority is
   to complete negotiation of the interim power purchase agreement in order to energize the Jenin power
   station. Opportunities to establish a payment arrangement that allows the 161kV line to Gaza to be
   connected should also be explored. Beyond these short term measures, it is vital for the PA to address
   institutional reform to ensure that energy suppliers are paid for their service – which is critical for both

                                                      5
    energy imports and investment in generation. On the side of GoI, while authorization has recently been
    provided for construction of the 161kV line, more can be done to facilitate imports of energy and
    equipment to Gaza. In the West Bank GoI can do more to ease access to land, to allow distribution
    companies and the Palestinian Electricity and Transmission Company (PETL) to operate efficiently,
    enhance transmission efficiency, and facilitate exploitation of efficient solar generation in Area C.

9. Finally, with respect to the reconstruction of Gaza, donor support has now reached 51 percent of
   the amount pledged at the Cairo Conference - but further increases will be limited unless there
   is an improved performance from the largest pledging donors. By the end of December 2016 total
   disbursement of pledges had reached USD1.796 billion which is almost USD200 million more than the
   amount reported in our last update to the end of July 2016. However, the disbursements fell USD1.4
   billion short of planned disbursements by this time, and were particularly weak for a number of the
   largest pledgers at the conference. With most of the small donors now having met their pledge there
   needs to be a stronger performance from the larger donors. Within the contributions, disbursements in
   support of the Detailed Needs Assessment (DNA) were only 37 percent of total disbursements, and
   more effort is needed to ensure that the critical reconstruction needs are addressed. For example,
   although around 56 percent of partially damaged houses have been repaired by mid-March 2017, only
   30 percent of the totally damaged housed have been completed to date. There is a funding gap of
   USD316 million to start repairing the more than 4,000 totally destroyed and close to 59,000 partially
   damaged housing units.

10. The main body of the report is organized in two chapters with two supporting annexes. Chapter I
    focuses on recent economic developments in the real, fiscal and banking sectors, while providing a near
    term outlook that highlights critical challenges facing the Palestinian economy. Chapter II discusses
    key challenges in the energy sector with critical messages for GoI, and the PA on steps to create an
    environment conducive to the needed private sector investment in the sector. Annex 1 assesses the
    status of the World Bank recommendations to the AHLC meeting over the years. This section is a
    follow up to the stock take in the September 2016 report to the AHLC, and will be a standard feature
    of our future reports. In Annex 2 there is an update on the disbursement of pledges made at the Cairo
    conference in October 2014 on reconstructing Gaza.

I.      Recent Developments
A.      Growth, unemployment and poverty
11. The Palestinian economy is suffering from volatile and unsustainable growth. For such a small
    economy, achieving a sustainable growth path depends to a large extent on its capacity to compete in
    regional and global markets and increase its exports of goods and services. The Palestinian economy,
    however, has been losing this capacity as a result of a poor business climate mainly driven by
    externally-imposed restrictions on trade and access to resources in addition to the lack of political
    stability. In fact, the structure of the economy has substantially deteriorated since the 1990’s. For
    instance, the manufacturing sector, which is usually one of the key drivers of export-led growth, has
    largely stagnated and its share in GDP has dropped from 19 percent in 1994 to 11 percent in 2015. The
    share of the agriculture sector has also declined from 12 to 4 percent over the same period. In relative
    terms, most growth occurred in public sector services over the past two decades. Private investment
    levels, averaging about 15 percent of GDP in recent years, have been low and concentrated in low
    productivity activities less affected by political risk. Palestinian exports are focused largely on low
    value added products and services and their share in the economy has been low and stagnant at 17-18
    percent. The substantial amounts of financial assistance from the international community received
    over the last two decades have so far helped mitigate the impact of the restrictions on growth, but aid
    has significantly declined in recent years (from 32 percent of GDP in 2008 to about 6 percent of GDP
    in 2016) and cannot continue to substitute for a poor business environment.

12. Since the Gaza war, the Palestinian economy has grown slowly, albeit driven by unsustainable
    factors. The severe economic impact of the Gaza war pushed the Palestinian economy into recession
    in 2014. Since then, the economy has rebounded with real GDP growth reaching 3.5 percent in 2015
    and an estimated 4.1 percent in 2016. Drivers of the recent growth, however, are not sustainable. The
    latest figures by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) show that growth in the Gaza Strip
    reached 7.7 percent in 2016 driven by a surge in construction activity following an increase in the
    amount of construction material entering the Strip. In the West Bank, the economy is estimated to have
    expanded by 3.0 percent mainly due to an increase in household consumption financed by bank loans.

13. The short term improvement in the Palestinian economy has not led to generation of jobs to
    absorb all the new labor market entrants, resulting in high and stubborn unemployment. Over
    the last two decades, the number of Palestinians in the labor force increased by 800,000, while 500,000
    additional formal jobs were created by the private and public sectors. As a result, the number of the
    unemployed increased significantly, resulting in an extremely high unemployment rate, fluctuating
    between 20 and 31 percent over the post Oslo period. This poses risks for peace and stability in the sub-
    region. Most recent data for 2016 shows that the unemployment rate reached 27 percent: 42 percent in
    Gaza and 18 percent in the West Bank, despite recent steps by the GoI to increase the number of permits
    for West Bankers.

14. The Palestinian labor market suffers from structural problems of inclusion particularly for
    young people and women. Currently, only 40 percent of those aged between 15 and 29 are active in
    the labor market, reflecting high pessimism regarding employment prospects. Despite a low
    participation rate, unemployment amongst this category reached 27 percent in 2016 in the West Bank
    and a staggering 56 percent in Gaza. Another concern in the Palestinian labor market is related to
    dramatic differences in labor force participation by gender. Male participation rates reached 71 percent
    in 2016 (not far from the average in other lower middle income countries), while women have long
    been under represented in the Palestinian labor market with recent participation rates of 18 percent –
    compared to an average of 39 percent in other comparators. Anecdotal evidence indicates that mobility
    restrictions play a key a role in keeping Palestinians from entering the labor market, particularly women
    as it is considered unsafe for them to cross a checkpoint in search for a job. Hence, most women are
    left with very limited opportunities in their localities discouraging them from joining the labor force.
    Data also confirms that higher education does not improve employment opportunities for women in the
    Palestinian territories, while it does for men. In fact, 50 percent of women holding bachelor degrees
    and higher certificates are unemployed compared to less than ten percent of women with lower
    educational attainment.

 Box 1: Improving the Business Environment
 The Ministry of National Economy (MoNE) has been taking concrete steps towards reforming the business
 enabling environment in the Palestinian territories with support from the World Bank and the Palestinian Market
 Development Program (funded by United Kingdom- Department for International Development (DfID) and the
 European Union (EU)).

 To ensure a sustained and systematic engagement, the MoNE obtained a Cabinet decision to establish a Ministerial
 Committee with the mandate of overseeing the implementation of reforms relating to the business environment.
 The Committee, chaired by the Minister of National Economy, consists of ministers from relevant ministries, the
 PCBS, in addition to representation from the private sector. Among the first actions taken by the committee was
 to establish a Technical Committee to implement a reform action plan. The Technical Committee has met several
 times since its establishment – most recently in March 2017. A series of laws and regulations relevant to the private
 sector have been identified as priority reform areas, including the Secured Transactions Law, which was signed
 and enacted in mid-2016, and the new Companies Law which is expected to be approved in 2017. In addition,
 consideration is being given to the procedures for business licensing, which remain onerous and time consuming
 due to the clearances required by the relevant authorities, and outdated legislation such as the Law of Crafts and
 Industries of 1953.

 A Citizens Service Center was recently established at the Ramallah Municipality to provide services normally
 provided by the Municipality (i.e., applying for a construction permit, obtaining a tax clearance, obtaining a
 business license etc. The Center became operational in January 2017, offering more than 45 services under the
 Municipality’s’ mandate.

15. Progress in poverty reduction in the Palestinian territories remains a challenge as political shocks
    and episodes of conflict frequently erode welfare gains and increase the risk of the vulnerable
    falling below the poverty line. Economic growth, social assistance and a well targeted cash transfer
    program run by the PA have helped reduce poverty in the Palestinian territories in the years following
    the second Intifada. However, political instability and multiple episodes of war in Gaza over the last
    ten years have significantly eroded these welfare gains. For example, following the 2008/9 war in Gaza,
    poverty in the Strip increased by 20 percentage points, pushing up the overall poverty rate in the
    Palestinian territories. Latest available poverty data is for 2011 and it shows that poverty levels in Gaza
    were not able to recover to prewar levels, and have remained very high at 38 percent. Poverty in the
    West Bank, however, was much lower at 18 percent in 2011. This clearly indicates a significant spatial
    disparity in poverty rates, with a large and widening gap in living standards between the West Bank
    and Gaza. Poverty rates in Gaza are also more volatile because a large share of Gazans live very close
    to the poverty line and remains at a constant risk of falling into poverty with any economic shock or
    episode of war. Given that poverty is highly correlated with labor market outcomes, and given that the
    unemployment rate has been on the rise in recent years, it is anticipated that poverty levels in the
    Palestinian territories has increased since 2011, especially in Gaza.

16. Progress in improving shared prosperity has been stagnant in the Palestinian territories. Shared
    prosperity - a concept introduced by the World Bank to promote equity and inclusive growth - is
    evaluated through progress in achieving faster income growth amongst the bottom 40 percent relative
    to the rest of the population. According to latest available data, income of the bottom 40 percent of the
    Palestinian population2 has been growing at the same rate as the rest of the distribution. Hence, income
    levels of the less privileged have not become closer to those earned by the rest of the population,
    resulting in stagnant shared prosperity.

17. Given that recent growth has been driven by unsustainable factors, the economic outlook remains
    worrying with projected growth levels insufficient to improve living standards. Assuming that the
    current restrictions remain in place and that the security situation stays relatively calm, the real GDP
    growth rate of the Palestinian economy in 2017 is projected at 3.4 percent: 2.7 percent in the West Bank
    and 5.5 percent in Gaza. In the medium term, real GDP growth is projected to hover around 3.3 percent.3
    This growth level implies a stagnation in real per capita income and an increase in unemployment.
    Moreover, downside risks remain significant. First, despite some progress in recent months, setbacks
    to the reconstruction process in Gaza are possible. The resumption of armed conflict cannot be ruled
    out and if this happens, the Gaza economy is expected to slip back into recession. Second, the outcome
    in the West Bank may be worse than expected if the decline in donor support exceeds current
    projections. Also, if tensions erupt again throughout the West Bank, they will result in elevated security
    risks that may negatively impact economic activity.


B.          Public Finance
       While the fiscal performance in 2016 was better than anticipated, this is not sustainable and the Bank
       projects a substantial financing gap in 2017.

18. In 2016, public revenue increased by close to 25 percent mainly due to one-off transfers by the
    GoI and advance telecom license payments. Following the Israeli-Palestinian ministerial level
    discussions in early 2016, the GoI transferred to the PA a total of NIS1.2 billion (on a net basis) to
    offset fiscal leakages accumulated over the years under the existing revenue sharing arrangements

2   Given that data on income is not available, consumption per capita was used as a proxy.
3   GDP projections were prepared in consultation with the IMF.

                                                                  9
     between the two parties.4 The PA also received NIS558 million from Paltel, a telecoms operator, as
     part of the company’s license fees for the next twenty years. These one-off payments in addition to
     higher petroleum excise from Gaza were the main contributors to public revenue growth in 2016, while
     collections from most domestic tax categories witnessed a decline. For example, income tax and
     domestic Value Added Tax (VAT) receipts each fell by 8 percent in 2016, and excise on tobacco
     declined by 6 percent. The key role that one-off payments played in driving revenue growth in 2016
     raises sustainability issues and highlights the need for accelerating revenue reform.

19. Public expenditure growth was high reaching 5 percent mainly due unanticipated wage increases.
    The wage bill, the largest spending item, grew by 5 percent in 2016, due to a 1.25 step increase across
    the board, additional increases for teachers, engineers and security personnel and a net increase in the
    number of public employees. Data provided by the PA show that public employees increased by 1,047
    in 2016, on a net basis, due to additional recruitment in the West Bank (mainly in the education sector)
    while net employment in Gaza actually decreased last year.5 Expenditure growth was also driven by a
    7 percent rise in transfers following an increase in social spending in Gaza. Net lending6 also grew by
    3 percent as Palestinian utility distributers continue to accrue dues to the Israeli suppliers, particularly
    for water and sewage, while the share of electricity net lending has been maintained at the 2015 level.

20. Despite a significant decline in the PA’s deficit year-on-year, fiscal stress continued to be high in
    2016 due to a major drop in budget support. Strong revenue growth offset the increase in spending
    and led to a 26 percent decline in the deficit in 2016, which amounted to USD1.09 billion (8 percent of
    GDP). Aid received reached USD761 million: USD607 in budget support and USD154 million in
    development financing. Notably, financing received for the PA’s development spending in 2016
    exceeded its 2015 level by more than two thirds. Receipts for budget support, however, were 16 percent
    lower year-on-year due to a fall in aid from both Arab as well as international donors. As a result, the
    PA ended up with a financing gap of about USD330 million (2.5 percent of GDP) and resorted to arrear
    accumulation to finance it.

21. According to the 2017 budget, the financing need will remain large. The budget projects a 14
    percent increase in revenues compared to 2016 (after discounting one-offs) mainly due to additional
    receipts from tobacco taxation from Gaza estimated at USD167 million.7 In addition, the PA plans to
    increase some of the government fees it charges such as licenses for gas stations, and this is expected
    to generate an additional USD50 million in revenues. Also, installments from the recently signed
    telecoms deal with Paltel are expected to reach USD75 million in 2016. As for PA expenditure, it is
    budgeted to decline by 2 percent as a result of a drop in operational spending and net lending by 20 and
    8 percent, respectively. In contrast, the wage bill is expected to grow by 3 percent in 2017 despite a
    decision to maintain a zero net hiring policy. The increase will be driven by a 1.25 step increase that is
    mandatory by law, retroactive Cost of Living Adjustments for 2015 and 2016 in addition to yearly
    promotions. The recurrent deficit is projected to reach USD702 million. Development expenditures
    are expected to total USD427 million, leading to a total deficit of USD1.13 billion (8 percent of GDP).

4 The first Israeli transfer was made in early 2016 and amounted to NIS580 million covering some VAT receipts collected on
imports to Gaza in addition to a refund on the 3 percent fee charged to handle Palestinian imports. The second transfer was made
in September and it covered accumulated Allenby bridge exit fees (NIS58 million) and equalization and health fees collected from
Palestinian workers in Israel over the years (NIS593 million), as part of the electricity deal signed between the PA and the GoI.
5 According to the PA’s employment numbers for 2016, 1965 employees were hired in the West Bank while 926 departed from the

labor force in Gaza, on a net basis. The number of employees abroad increased by 8. Net employment in the health and education
sectors increased by 302 and 1146, respectively, while it was reduced by 244 in the security sector.
6 Net lending represents deductions by the GoI from clearance revenues it collects on behalf of the PA for unpaid utility bills by

Palestinian public utilities and local governments.
7 The PA plans to license a private tobacco company that will be in charge of all local tobacco sales to Gaza. This company will be

located in the West Bank, and taxed by the PA, increasing receipts from tobacco excise from Gaza.

                                                               10
    The budget assumes that aid will amount to USD650 million (USD508 million in budget support and
    USD142 million in development financing), resulting in a financing gap of about USD479 million. The
    budget assumes that the PA’s stock of arrears will be reduced by USD305 million, further widening the
    financing gap to USD784 million. Unless additional financing sources are identified, the PA’s stock of
    arrears is expected to grow.

22. The World Bank projects the financing gap for 2017 to approach USD0.8 billion. The budget
    revenue target is seen as too high particularly as additional receipts from tobacco taxation are projected
    to be much lower than the budgeted amount. On the expenditure side, the budgeted decline appears to
    be optimistic particularly for operational spending and net lending. Therefore, the 2017 deficit could
    be higher than assumed by the budget at USD1.39 billion, or about 10 percent of GDP. Aid inflows are
    projected to reach USD661 million, and hence, the size of the financing gap could reach USD772
    million (5.6 percent of GDP), prior to any arrear repayment. Notably, this projection has high risks
    associated with it particularly if some of the panned revenue and expenditure measures do not
    materialize or if donor aid ends up being even lower than expected.

23. As mentioned earlier, the financing gap for 2017 is unprecedented in terms of its size, and risks
    significant economic and social consequences if it is not closed through additional finance or
    policy measures. If no additional financing is identified, the PA would need to decide which
    commitments it can pay. One option would be to accumulate further arrears to the pension fund and
    private suppliers. Debt to the pension fund already stands at 12 percent of GDP and additional arrears
    could cause the PA to falter on its dues to pensioners, as the Bank projects that the fund will become
    insolvent in a few years. The stock of arrears to the private sector currently constitutes about 5 percent
    of GDP and is highly damaging to the economy. Additional private sector arrears could further worsen
    the PA’s fiscal situation as private companies run out of cash to pay their taxes to the government. An
    alternative option, would be for the PA to not meet its wage commitments and its social transfers to the
    poorest of the population. Both options would risk social unrest. These options could also spill to the
    banking sector if the PA and its employees are unable to repay their loan installments in due time.

24. While the PA needs to accelerate reforms that align its spending and revenue capacity, in the
    short term actions by the PA alone will not be enough to close the financing gap, hence the urgent
    need for additional donor financing. On top of the above-mentioned planned measures for 2017, the
    PA needs to limit growth of its wage bill and fully constrain non-priority spending. The results,
    however, will not be enough to close the 2017 financing gap. Some financing may be available through
    borrowing from domestic banks as the PA still has some space (about USD160 million) before reaching
    the limit set by the Palestine Monetary Authority (PMA), but this will also not be sufficient to close the
    gap. Therefore, in the short term, there is no feasible alternative to budget support as a key source of
    financing. Donor support during these critical times is essential to sustain reforms and enable provision
    of services to the Palestinian population. Long term fiscal sustainability, however, cannot be achieved
    without a prudent and stringent fiscal consolidation program by the PA. This program needs to address
    reform areas such as the pension system, civil service reform, and untargeted transfers.

25. Additional actions by the GoI to reduce the PA’s fiscal losses under the Paris Protocol will also
    have significant fiscal benefits. The Israeli-Palestinian ministerial meetings in early 2016 managed to
    achieve good progress in clearing a large part of the stock of fiscal leakages owed to the PA.
    Nevertheless, a systematic mechanism to stop the accumulation of these leakages is yet to be put in
    place. Efforts should focus on implementing the Paris Protocol’s provisions regarding full information
    sharing on trade that takes place between both parties, including Israeli sales to Gaza. As stipulated by
    the Protocol, this could be done through setting up an “interconnected computer system” between the
    Israeli and Palestinian VAT authorities. Moreover, the fee currently charged by the GoI to handle
    Palestinian imports needs to be revised as the current rate of 3 percent is excessive relative to actual

                                                     11
     costs incurred by the Israeli customs authority. These two measures alone would be expected to
     generate in excess of USD150 million per year in additional revenues for the PA, which would ease the
     fiscal stress.

C.       Money and Banking

     In the context of a difficult economic backdrop, the Palestinian financial sector remains relatively stable
     but derisking by the correspondent banks is a major challenge.

26. The Palestinian banking system experienced steady growth in 2016. PMA data as of December
    2016 indicate a 13 percent increase in net assets compared to December 2015, reaching USD13.9
    billion. Direct credit grew by just above USD1 billion in 2016, which is consistent with historical
    growth trends, reaching USD6.8 billion by the end of 2016. Unlike trends in previous years, direct
    lending to the PA did not experience a net growth, stabilizing at approximately USD1.4 billion, with
    the bulk of new lending in 2016 going to the private sector. Notwithstanding the growth in credit
    facilities experienced in 2015 and 2016, the overall credit-to-deposits ratio continued to be within the

                                                          12
    regional range, and slightly above the historical range, at 65 percent. Liquidity in the sector remains
    high as confirmed by both credit-to-deposits ratio and the results of PMA stress testing. In line with the
    sector’s historical data, the banking system maintained its risk averse lending position as reflected by
    a nonperforming loans ratio of slightly over 2 percent. Despite the high political uncertainty permeating
    the Palestinian economy, the Palestinian banking sector maintained a profitability in line with previous
    years, achieving a return-on-equity of 9 percent.

27. The Banking system’s credit exposure to the public sector moderated in 2016. Over recent years,
    the PA’s reliance on financing from the banking sector have raised concerns over credit concentration
    risk. The stock of PA loans was flat in 2016. Total credit grew by approximately USD1 billion from
    USD5.8 to USD6.8 billion resulting in a decline in the proportion of government loans from 25 percent
    in 2015 to 21 percent in 2016. The PMA sets an informal PA exposure limit equivalent to the banking
    sector’s total owners’ equity. As of December 2016, PA debt is equivalent to 84 percent of the banking
    sector’s total owners’ equity. It’s important to note that the banking sector’s exposure to the PA is not
    limited to direct credits to the PA. Borrowing by PA employees grew approximately 50 percent over
    the two-year period of 2015 and 2016, reaching USD1.3 billion. When combined, PA and public
    employees account for USD2.7 billion, or 40 percent of total banking sector credits.

29. A constant cause for concern for the banking system and the Palestinian economy is the potential
    negative impact of de-risking by Israeli banks. Citing money-laundering and financing of terrorism
    (ML/TF) concerns, key Israeli banks signaled plans to limit or terminate correspondent banking
    services to Palestinian Banks. Such termination of correspondent banking relationships (CBRs) by
    Israeli banks could have significant economic impact due to the highly interlinked structure of the two
    banking systems, and the use of Israeli Shekel as the primary currency in the Palestinian economy. In
    January 2017, the GoI assumed part of the financial risk by approving an indemnity and immunity
    package for Israeli banks working with Palestinian banks to alleviate the potential for disruptions to
    CBRs between the two banking systems. The PMA has also been taking steps, with International
    Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank support, towards upgrading the Palestinian anti-money
    laundering and combating financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) system to be more in line with
    international practices.

30. With technical assistance (TA) from the World Bank, the PA is conducting its first self-
    assessment of ML/FT risks. This TA aims to enhance the ability of relevant AML/CFT stakeholders
    in the Palestinian territories in identifying, assessing and understanding the money laundering and
    terrorism financing risks they face. Going forward, the authorities will be able to take appropriate
    measures to manage and mitigate these risks at national and institutional levels and implement a risk-
    based strategy for AML/CFT in line with international standards. Such a strategy would allow the
    authorities to target the allocation of resources in high-risk areas, as well as develop simplified
    AML/CFT requirements in proven low risk areas, including to promote financial inclusion. The risk
    assessment is being coordinated by the Financial Follow-up Unit, with involvement of the Ministries
    of Finance and Planning, Justice, Interior, and Foreign Affairs, and the Public Prosecutor’s Office,
    Customs Services, and other relevant stakeholders. In parallel to the self-assessment process, the PA
    requested, and has been granted approval for an evaluation of its AML/CFT regime by the regional
    Financial Action Taskforce (MENAFATF). The evaluation, currently scheduled for 2020, in
    combination with the self-assessment, represent key milestones towards aligning PA’s AML/CFT
    systems with international standards.

Box 2: Remittances Market Assessment
The Palestinian territories rank as the second largest source of international migrants in relation to its population in the
world, after Syria. The magnitude and importance of remittance inflows to Palestine are undeniable. According to World
Bank estimates, remittance inflows to the Palestinian territories were USD2.2 billion in 2015. This estimate does not
include compensation of Palestinian employees working in Israel, which, according to the PMA, are an additional the
USD1.2 billion. Remittance inflows are also significant when considered relative to the size of the economy and other
important financial flows. Inward remittances are about 17 percent of GDP , making the Palestinian territories one of
the top 20 most remittance-dependent countries in the world. If compensation of Palestinian workers in Israel is
included, the inward remittance flows rise to 26 percent of GDP. Further, inward remittances are twice as large as exports
and comparable to aid including transfers to non-governmental organizations. Remittances exceed Foreign Direct
Investment by a factor of 10 to15.
                            Figure 6: Officially Reported Inflows to the Palestinian territories




According to the World Bank Remittance Prices Worldwide (RPW) Database, which tracks the cost of sending
remittances along 300 corridors, the global average cost of sending USD200 was 7.52 percent in Q1 2016. The cost of
sending remittances to the MNA region was recorded at 7.46 percent in the same quarter – broadly in line with the global
average cost, but more expensive than in some other regions.

Taking into account that most regulated flows are channeled through Western Union or MoneyGram, the average total
cost of sending USD200 to the Palestinian territories via these 2 Money Transfer Operators (MTOs) is equivalent to
nearly 12 percent of the amount sent – over USD23 to send USD 200 – and nearly 4 percentage points higher than the
global average for MTOs. This average cost includes the cost of cash-to-cash services offered by Western Union and
MoneyGram across a small sample of sending countries, including Saudi Arabia, USA, UK and Jordan. If the cost of
sending remittances using MTOs or other providers would be in line with the rest of the world, as indicated by
the International MTO Index, the Palestinian economy could have saved USD80 million in 2015 alone.

 31. Results of stress testing by the PMA are in line with previous findings and confirm the banking
     system’s resilience. The PMA regularly conducts stress testing, in line with the Basel II principles, to
     ensure the resilience of the Palestinian banking system against potential shocks. According to the latest
     available data (December 2016) the PMA reports that the banking system is well capitalized and is able
     to withstand a wide range of shocks including economic, political and liquidity shocks.

II.      Securing Energy for Development in The Palestinian territories

With the economy already struggling the development challenges facing the Palestinian energy sector are
an important factor when considering the future economic prospects. First, energy is already in short supply
with severe rationing in Gaza, and restrictions in parts of the West Bank during peak periods. With further
energy demand growth projected, increased imports and investment in domestic generation and
transmission are critical to avoid having economic growth stunted by energy shortages. Second, private
sector investment will be crucial to meeting the future energy needs. However, this investment will not
materialize unless the PA and GoI create a suitable enabling environment. The section examines some of
the institutional and access challenges facing the sector, outlines the demand needs and opportunities, and
identifies key steps needed to mobilize this investment.

A.       Institutional and Financial Challenges

33. Over the last two decades, the Palestinian energy sector has been consolidating, modernizing and
    strengthening its power sector institutions with sustained support from the international
    community. The Palestinian Energy and Natural Resources Authority (PENRA), established in 1995,
    launched key institutional reforms including the consolidation of numerous small municipality and
    village councils’ (MVC) electricity services into larger distribution co mpanies (DISCOs) to benefit
    from economies of scale. In 2009 the Palestinian Electricity Regulatory Council (PERC) was
    established with a mandate of regulating and monitoring the energy sector. In 2013, the Palestinian
    Electricity Transmission Company Ltd (PETL) was established with a mandate to be the single buyer
    and Transmission System Operator (TSO) for the Palestinian energy sector. The political division
    between the PA and the Hamas led authority in Gaza reduces the ability of PENRA, PETL and PERC
    to exercise their jurisdiction in Gaza.

34. The electricity sector suffers from operational and financial problems due to high losses and low
    collection rates. In 2015, DISCOs in the Palestinian territories billed consumers for 76 percent of the
    power they purchased from suppliers with the other 24 percent lost and never billed due to the poor
    state of the infrastructure, and due to illegal connections and theft. Of the electricity billed to consumers,
    DISCOs collected 84 percent of invoices with 16 percent accumulating as outstanding debt from
    consumers to DISCOs. Although DISCOs are far from cost recovery, they have seen a major
    improvement since 2011 when their average losses were 3 percent higher and collection rates 5 percent
    lower as compared to 2015. It is imperative that DISCOs continue improving their performance so that
    they can honor the payments to their suppliers and consequently have access to increased power supply.

35. Bill collection rates are particularly low in Gaza and in refugee camps in the West Bank due to
    difficult living conditions and a culture of non-payment. In Gaza, with armed conflict every 2-3
    years and the highest unemployment rate in the world at 42 percent,9 and a poor quality electricity
    service, paying electricity bills is not considered a high priority. Refugee camps in the West Bank are

9World Bank press release on May 21, 2015: “Gaza Economy o n the Verge of Collapse, Youth Unemployment Highest in the
Region at 60 Percent”

                                                         17
     also challenging as they have unprecedented levels of per capita consumption but the lowest rate of bill
     payment. According to a recent survey, underlying reasons for non-payment of electricity bills are the
     high cost of electricity, low income, poor quality of service, and perceived exemption due to refugee
     status. Moreover, the poor security conditions in the camps make it difficult for DISCO staff to enter
     to enforce revenue collection or disconnect service.

36. The PA has been compelled to subsidize electricity distributors for their non-payment of
    electricity purchases from Israel Electric Corporation (IEC) through a mechanism known as “net
    lending”. Imports of electricity from Israel, which accounted for 99percent of electricity supply in West
    Bank and 64 percent in Gaza in 2015 – see Table 2. Given weak revenue collection, some DISCOs and
    MVCs only partially pay for electricity supplied by IEC, while others do not pay at all: preferring to
    use the collected revenues for financing municipal activities. For years, the PA has indirectly paid a
    portion of the outstanding bills owed by DISCOs and MVCs to IEC, through a mechanism called ‘net
    lending’.10 Outstanding payments owed to the IEC are either (i) deducted from the PA’s clearance
    revenues by the Israeli Ministry of Finance and registered as “net lending” or (ii) are accumulated as
    debt owed to the IEC. Net lending reduced the PA’s available revenues by an estimated NIS1 billion
    in 2012 (USD280 million), representing 13.5 percent of the PA’s total revenues – although actions
    taken by the PA have reduced the share of revenues to closer to 7.5 percent in 2016. This mechanism
    sets a precedence in which service providers continue to receive electricity from suppliers, and
    consumers continue to receive electricity from service providers even if they do not pay their bills, with
    an assurance that the PA will pay on their behalf reducing a sense of responsibility and accountability.

37. A new electricity agreement between GoI and the PA has settled past debt and plans to pave the
    way for improvements in the Palestinian energy sector. As the unpaid portion of outstanding bills
    from IEC to the Palestinian service providers continued to accumulate year after year, IEC made
    payment of past debt a pre-condition for energizing new high voltage substations. On September 13,
    2016, the PA and the GoI signed an agreement to settle past electricity sector debt, which stood at
    USD534 million (NIS2.03 billion), and created joint committees to work on three key issues: i)
    energizing the new high voltage substations to bring more power to the West Bank, ii) signature of a
    long term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) at a lower wholesale tariff rate, and iii) transfer of over
    250 connection points to PETL in order to have a single point of transaction (single-buyer) between
    Israeli and Palestinian sides. A key determinant of the success of the new electricity agreement will be

10 As explained earlier, ‘Net lending’ refers to the process by which Israel deducts a portion of unpaid electricity bills, owed by
Palestinian distributors, to the IEC – which supplies over 95percent of the energy to WBG. This process essentially forces the PA
to indirectly pay for the outstanding bills of distribution companies through collection revenues destined for the national budget.
The PA considers this payment to be on behalf of the distributor and reports this as “net lending” reflecting an obligation from the
distributor to the PA.


                                                                18
     the ability of PETL to pay for 100 percent of the power purchased from IEC. In turn, DISCOs and end
     consumers need to follow-suit along the value chain. This requires major cultural and behavioral change
     and a strong commitment from the PA and PENRA to increase accountability and enhance transparency
     in the electricity revenue cycle.

38. In the short term, a priority of the two parties is to sign an interim PPA to energize the new high
    voltage Jenin substation. In view of the dire need of additional electricity supply in the north of the
    West Bank, the negotiating parties have agreed in good faith to initially complete an interim PPA for
    the Jenin substation whose immediate energization is critical to avoid power shortages during the
    upcoming summer. An interim agreement would unlock a series of positive outcomes that would help
    move the Palestinian energy sector past its current impasse and set the scene for future negotiations on
    the larger and longer term PPA. The signature of the interim PPA and energization of the Jenin
    substation would not only bring desperately needed additional power supply to the West Bank, but also
    provide at least a 10 percent discount simply by switching from medium to a high voltage tariff. In
    addition, receiving power at the high voltage level would reduce the losses from the oversaturated
    medium voltage network enabling DISCOs to bill for a larger portion of the purchased power. Finally,
    the most immediate result will be in avoiding mass protests and civil unrest during the coming summer
    peak load as was seen during the past winter peak load which resulted in power cuts in the Northern
    West Bank.

39. PETL must start operating on a commercial basis and take ownership for fixing the gaps in the
    revenue cycle as their first priority. PETL is expected to be financially self-sufficient following the
    energization of the substations in the West Bank. At that point PETL would be able to purchase cheaper
    power at high voltage levels from IEC and sell it to Palestinian distributors. The entire value chain
    suffers from extensive leakages which significantly undermine the sector’s ability to gain financial
    independence. Once the value chain becomes more efficient, PETL would generate revenues and
    become operationally sustainable, which would attract Independent Power Producers to sign PPAs with
    PETL allowing the Palestinian energy sector to increase diversification and independence. The current
    Palestinian sales tariffs need to be reviewed in order to ensure cost recovery while keeping in mind that
    the poor and vulnerable need to be protected.



B.       Energy Security Issues

40. The Palestinian territories face significant energy security challenges, already severe in Gaza, but
    also emerging in the West Bank. Limited power supply is rationed through rolling black outs which
    are increasing in frequency in the West Bank and in duration in Gaza. In Gaza, the available power
    supply only meets half the demand resulting in the rationing of power through rolling blackouts with 8
    hours of power supply followed by 8 hours of power cuts. During peak summer and winter load
    conditions, the power schedule is reduced to 3-4 hours per day. Although the West Bank generally
    enjoys 24 hours of power supply, in recent years it has also begun experiencing power shortages during
    peak winter and summer months. Electricity shortages in both West Bank and Gaza are often met with
    mass protests and demonstrations.

41. Options for expanding electricity supply have been quite constrained. In the West Bank, the
    energization of new substations that will bring an additional 600 MVA of power from Israel is pending
    the agreement of a new PPA between the IEC and PETL, following the recent settlement of a
    longstanding debt problem, as mentioned above. In Gaza, despite recent Israeli approval, the



                                                     19
     completion of an additional 161 kV interconnector with Israel has been on hold for a long time as the
     responsibility and mechanism for payment of purchased electricity are being decided.


42. Meanwhile, electricity demand continues to grow; potentially doubling in Gaza by 2030.
    Electricity demand in the Palestinian territories has been growing at an annual rate of 7.2 percent from
    2001-2013. Due to projected lower GDP growth, forecast demand growth for 2016-2030 is significantly
    lower at 3.5 percent, though much higher in Gaza (4.9 percent) than the West Bank (2.9 percent) owing
    to the need to satisfy current suppressed demand estimated at about 36 percent of existing consumption
    in Gaza. The implication is that Gaza’s electricity needs will almost double by 2030.

43. Without a timely resolution of energy constraints, economic recovery in the Palestinian territories
    will be stunted. The results of an economic modeling exercise for the Palestinian territories show that
    addressing energy constraints is an important element in promoting economic growth in the Palestinian
    territories which has the potential to add on average 0.4 percentage points to Gaza’s annual GDP growth
    rate through to 2025. According to recent enterprise surveys, 47 percent of firms in Gaza rely on their
    own gasoline or diesel-based generators for about 42 percent of their energy needs. Running such
    generators is estimated to cost upwards of $0.75 per kilowatt-hour or about five times the current utility
    tariff.

C.       Pathways to Enhance Energy Security

Improving energy security will entail increasing, and possibly diversifying imports, as well as
developing further domestic generation capacity.


Increasing and Diversifying Imports

44. Israel will likely continue to be a major source of electricity for the Palestinian territories. The
    IEC is the main supplier of electricity both to the West Bank and Gaza at a rate of $0.09-$0.10/kWh.
    IEC supplies electricity to the West Bank through more than 250 separate low and medium voltage
    connection points most of which are nearing saturation. Investments in four high voltage substations
    will allow more Israeli imports to the West Bank from IEC. In Gaza, IEC supplies electricity through
    10 connection points; however, all import feeder lines are completely saturated and cannot transmit any
    more power. Israeli and Palestinian sides are discussing the possibility of extending a 161 kV
    transmission line to Gaza which would bring an additional 100-120MW of power to the strip.

45. The increasing weight of Palestinian electricity consumption on IEC’s balance sheet could
    exacerbate the company’s existing debt problems. The share of Israeli Independent Power Producers
    in the total Israeli power production increased from 1 percent in 2009 to 16 percent in 2014, and is
    estimated to reach 40 percent by 2020. As Israeli demand shifts away from IEC towards Independent
    Power Producers, Palestinian demand – already IEC’s largest and most rapidly growing customer –
    will carry increasing weight in the company’s revenue stream. IEC already suffers from a large
    accumulated debt primarily from the Israeli electricity sector. Any accumulation of additional debt from
    the growing Palestinian consumers will be harmful to the company’s bottom line.

46. Diversification of electricity supply from other neighboring countries needs to be pursued but is
    hindered by problems of land access, security and payment risk. The West Bank already obtains 1
    percent of its electricity from Jordan, while Gaza obtains 13 percent from Egypt. Both neighboring
    countries have gone through recent power supply crises, but both are also emerging with major

                                                     20
    investments in generation that will lead to significant reserves. In principle, existing interconnectors of
    20 MW with Jordan and 30 MW with Egypt could be upgraded to supply additional electricity.
    Jordanian power, generated largely from liquefied natural gas (LNG) at present, is significantly more
    expensive than the IEC, currently at $0.14-$0.15/kWh. This cost is expected to come down as Israeli
    natural gas reaches Jordanian power stations and additional solar power plants come online. However,
    restrictions of access and construction in Area C are major obstacles to build and upgrade
    interconnectors with Jordan. The cost of electricity generation in Egypt is potentially more competitive
    than Jordan; however, security issues in Sinai affect the reliability of this source. For both Egyptian and
    Jordanian supply, the lack of payment security presents a major risk as neither country has access to
    the ‘net lending’ mechanism available to Israel to compensate for default on payments. Currently, the
    power supply from Egypt is paid for, in large part, by donations through the Arab League on a rolling
    basis.

Among domestic generation possibilities, the two key options are natural gas and renewable energy.


Expanding Natural Gas Possibilities

47. At present, only Gaza has any significant domestic generation capacity, but this has become a
    significant financial burden which affects the provision of electricity. While the Gaza Power Plant
    (GPP) provides 23 percent of Gaza’s total energy supply, it runs on expensive diesel fuel. In addition
    to the cost of fuel, the GPP PPA stipulates that a capacity charge payment must be paid regardless of
    the level of operation of the plant. It costs almost 3 times more to produce 1KWh from GPP than to
    import 1KWh from IEC. In terms of repairs and operation and maintenance, GPP faces major obstacles
    as specialized spare parts and chemicals, as well as expert technicians, must be brought to Gaza from
    abroad. This is especially difficult considering the blockade on Gaza.

48. The additional 161kV power line from IEC to Gaza would bring much needed relief; however,
    the question of payment has not been resolved. Currently, the PA pays for all electricity imports to
    Gaza from IEC. Any additional power imports would lead to higher levels of net lending without any
    promise that increased revenues collected from consumers in Gaza would be passed on to the PA. Until
    an agreement is reached between the PA and Hamas in Gaza on the transfer of collected bill revenues
    additional power supply to Gaza from IEC will face a roadblock.

49. Given the abundance of local natural gas resources, bringing gas to both the West Bank and Gaza
    is now feasible. The Israeli gas market, already well-developed as a result of the Tamar field, is poised
    to expand considerably as the much larger Leviathan field commences production. Tamar (reserve of
    10.9 trillion cubic feet (TCF)), Leviathan (reserve of 21.9 TCF) and a handful of other Israeli gas fields
    with a total combined reserve of 38.2 TCF are more than enough to fully meet Israeli gas demand and
    export excess to neighboring countries. The Israeli government has already given its approval for
    natural gas to be transported within 15 kilometers of Jenin in the north of the West Bank using the
    Israeli domestic gas transportation network Israel Natural Gas Lines (INGL), from where it could be
    delivered through the construction of a small spur. A project to extend a modest 20 kilometer gas
    pipeline from Ashkelon in Israel to the Gaza Power Plant is also under preparation.

50. The arrival of natural gas to the Palestinian territories could bring significant advantages. In the
    case of Gaza, the plan would be to convert the Gaza Power Plant from diesel to natural gas, which
    would allow the cost of generation to fall significantly from current levels of around $0.30-$0.40/kWh

                                                      21
       to $0.10-0.13/kWh, resulting in savings of USD45 million per year, and making a further expansion of
       capacity a potentially attractive option. In the case of the West Bank, the construction of a 450 MW
       combined cycle gas-fired power generation plant is already in the planning stages at Jenin in the north
       of the West Bank.

51. Eventual development of the Palestinians’ own gas field – Gaza Marine – would further add to
    Palestinian energy security as well as boosting fiscal revenues. Since 2000, it has been known that
    1.3 TCF of proven natural gas reserves lie 36 kilometers off-shore of Gaza in the Gaza Marine field.
    Given the size of the field, its development would currently require the identification of markets that
    go beyond the Palestinian electricity sector. Although as gas-fired power generation capacity is
    developed in the Palestinian territories, gas demand could grow from 0.35 billion cubic meters per year
    to 1.00 billion cubic meters by 2030.11 A higher level of domestic demand could help to underwrite the
    development of the field. In addition, the development of Gaza Marine could generate a significant
    income stream to the PA from taxes and royalties.

Harnessing Renewable Energy

52. As the cost of solar energy continues to decline, the option looks increasingly attractive for the
    Palestinian territories. Since 2009, the cost of utility scale and residential solar Photovoltaics (PV)
    has dropped more than 8012 percent with neighboring Jordan receiving bids as low as $0.06/KWh which
    is equal to half the price of IEC imports. The Palestinian territories are located in a region rich with the
    sun’s energy with large potential in exploring the yet untapped solar sector. In fact, solar energy
    represents the only truly independent form of power supply which does not rely on imports of fuel or
    electricity and brings wider environmental benefits.

53. Land availability is however a major constraint for tapping into solar energy production. In the
    West Bank, access to land for solar power generation is a problem since most of the land suitable for
    ground-based solar PV is located outside the heavily populated Area A. In particular, Area C has
    significant potential for large-scale roll out of ground-based solar PV plants; however, access to this
    land is severely limited. In Gaza, due to the small size and high population density, the potential for
    ground-based solar PV is small. Given the land scarcity, rooftop solar may provide an attractive scalable
    alternative that could reach several tens of MW in the Palestinian territories.

Developing Transmission Infrastructure

54. As domestic generation develops, Israeli and Palestinian sides must work together to decide the
    best mode of evacuation through the power grid. The transfer of bulk energy between the IEC’s
    power plants and Palestinian consumption centers has remained under IEC’s responsibility through its
    high voltage transmission network. The Palestinian electricity distributors have been importing power
    from IEC through low and medium voltage connection points, but this is about to change. The
    energization of the high-voltage substations under PETL’s management will start a consolidation
    process of the existing connection points. Palestinian territories have not previously had any high
    voltage transmission infrastructure, but rather focused only on low and medium voltage local
    distribution. To create a Palestinian high voltage transmission network that would evacuate domestic
    Palestinian generation, large and contiguous infrastructure would need to be built traversing Areas A,

11    In 2016 natural gas demand in Israel accumulated to some 9.5 BCM and in Jordan to 3 BCM (estimates).

                                                               22
    B and C. Logistically and operationally this would be a complex endeavor requiring construction
    permits at multiple locations, interconnection studies to identify impact on neighboring power grids,
    agreements on grid operation and supply-demand balancing with neighboring transmission system
    operators.

55. In the short to medium term, the two sides could agree on wheeling arrangements to use the
    Israeli transmission to minimize the transmission costs and ensure that power supply expansion
    continues to grow as a top priority in order to keep pace with demand growth. In the longer term,
    as the Palestinian energy sector becomes more stable and bankable, the two sides can work together to
    build a long term vision of establishing a high voltage transmission network. Given the inherently
    interwoven nature of the Israeli and Palestinian energy sectors, with or without a Palestinian
    transmission network, both sides must rely on each other to ensure grid stability.

Investment Needs and Constraints

56. The overall investment needs associated with improving energy security in the Palestinian
    territories amount to USD2-3 billion through to 2030. Of this, about 90 percent is related to power
    generation and 10 percent to network infrastructure. The 90 percent related to power generation, which
    would include gas fired generation and solar farms, could potentially be private sector financed. The
    remaining 10 percent of power sector investment needs for enforcing and expanding the local
    distribution network would need to be publically financed. Given the weak financial position of the
    sector, these investment needs would entail donor support.

57. Attracting private sector financing for the development of energy projects in Palestine, however,
    depends critically on the creditworthiness of PETL. The ability to raise private capital at reasonable
    cost depends on keeping the risks of these projects at a tolerable level. The largest risk associated with
    these types of contracts is the payment risk associated with the PPA, which in turn depends critically
    on the creditworthiness of the off-taker PETL. While it may be possible to mitigate this risk to some
    extent in the short term through credit enhancements of various kinds, such as guarantees, this will
    further increase the financing cost and is no substitute for an improvement in the sector fundamentals.



D. Key Messages

58. The reforms in the Palestinian electricity sector during the last two decades have laid the
    foundations to move towards clean, abundant and affordable electricity services. To achieve these
    objectives, however, significant changes are still required. The reforms spearheaded by PENRA, with
    the support of the donor community, have included the creation of new institutions, i.e. a DISCO to
    consolidate fragmented power supply in the north of the West Bank; an electricity regulator (PERC) to
    stabilize the sector and a public company (PETL) to transmit the electricity from the source –imported
    or domestic- to distribution entities. The deployment of technological solutions combined with resolute
    government action have improved the collection rate of customer’s electricity bills by DISCOs to over
    80 percent on average. Despite these achievements, the reforms need to be accelerated and sustained in
    order to achieve private sector-led transformational impact.




                                                     23
59. Major reforms in the Israeli power market bring further opportunities for shaping the future of
    the power trade with the Palestinian territories. The Israeli electricity sector is in the midst of a
    major power sector reform process, partly in response to the chronic accumulation of debts by IEC.
    Independent Power Producers are providing a growing share of the Israeli market and as Israeli demand
    shifts away from IEC, Palestinian demand – already IEC’s largest and most rapidly growing customer
    – will carry increasing weight in the company’s revenue stream. Although, in the future the Palestinians
    could also consider purchasing power directly from Israeli Independent Power Producers.

60. A new electricity debt agreement between the GoI and the PA provides momentum for improving
    the Palestinian electricity sector. In September 2016, the PA and the GoI signed an agreement to
    settle around USD550 million of past debt owed by the Palestinian electricity distributors to the IEC.
    The agreement of a long-term PPA between IEC and PETL at a lower wholesale tariff was identified
    as a priority, as well as the energization of new high voltage substations built in the West Bank. In view
    of the dire need for electricity supply in the north of the West Bank the parties have agreed to initially
    complete an interim PPA for the Jenin substation. The signature of the main long term PPA is expected
    to follow suit and relieve the West Bank from a looming energy crisis.

61. Improving the creditworthiness and payment discipline along the electricity supply chain is a
    pre-requisite for harnessing private investments to increase electricity supply. Palestinian
    electricity distributors have a poor payment track record to their main supplier, IEC, which is not
    conducive to attracting private capital to develop new generation projects. The improvement of the
    DISCOs operational and commercial performance is a first step towards increasing their payment
    capacity and service improvements. Following the signature of the interim PPA, attention can be
    focused on the management of PETL as a commercial company in order to strengthen the company’s
    credibility vis-à-vis electricity suppliers, including IEC. PERC can review the current electricity tariff
    methodology and structure, including affordability issues, to ensure that the cost of developing the
    sector are transparently passed on to consumers. Moreover, the PA needs to continue its efforts to
    improve the municipal finances to prevent further diversion of electricity revenues to broader local
    government expenditures. This may require additional revenue sources for MVCs, including a regular
    fiscal transfer, but also increasing expenditure efficiency in basic local service delivery.

62. Easing the access to land for Palestinians would help to improve the efficiency of the electricity
    sector. Restrictions on access to land prevents Palestinian DISCOs and other electricity distributors
    from operating their businesses efficiently. The lack of access to Area C, which constitutes most of the
    land area in the West Bank, represents a major missed opportunity for the development of renewable
    energies.

63. In Gaza, in the short term, the construction of a high-voltage (HV) line from Israel to Gaza is a
    low-hanging fruit that could relieve the energy crisis. Despite having the necessary authorizations
    from the Israeli government, construction of a new HV line has not started yet. The uncertainties around
    payment obligations of purchased power through this new infrastructure could be reduced by increasing
    the imports to Gaza in gradual phases. In the mid-term, the scale-up of solar rooftop photovoltaic could
    be a more reliable and affordable solution to existing alternatives to keep the lights on. The conversion
    of the Gaza Power Plant to gas, together with investments in transmission infrastructure, would lead to
    a significant increase in power supply for the population and savings for the government.




                                                     24
64. Transformation of the PA energy institutions is critical to enable key energy sector development
    in the Palestinian territories and to reduce the debt with IEC. Transforming the Palestinian energy
    sector depends in part on enhancing and motivating institutions to fulfill their roles in a restructured
    sectoral environment. While reform must be policy based, it also needs to be pragmatic and reflect
    operational realities. Enhancing the transparency of information and fostering an accountability
    environment among key stakeholders would also help to create the right incentives. While outside help
    can facilitate change, the leadership for change must come from within. PETL, DISCOs, municipalities
    and the PA must believe in the process of change, own it and internalize it in order to make reform
    work. Finally, the PA must maintain its will to see a commercially self-sufficient power sector. By
    embracing constructive change in the power sector, the government has yet another opportunity to make
    a tangible and measurable improvement in the lives of Palestinians by providing affordable and reliable
    electricity, supporting economic development, and freeing up the large sums now spent on subsidies so
    they can be applied to better social purposes.

Annex 1: Stock take of World Bank Recommendations to the AHLC meeting
65. As identified in Chapter I, the Palestinian economic outlook is worrying and renewed efforts are
    needed by the PA, the GoI and the donor community. Until there is a permanent peace agreement,
    the Palestinian economy will continue to perform below its potential and this will impact the economic
    and fiscal performance. However, there is more that can be done to enhance the performance of the
    Palestinian economy and improve the fiscal situation.

66. Many needed actions have been identified in previous reports by the World Bank to the AHLC
    meeting but implementation of these measures has been limited. In our 2016 report to the AHLC
    we conducted a stock taking of all previous World Bank recommendations to the meeting. The stock
    take was intended to provide a baseline for evaluating progress in achieving the Palestinian territories’
    development priorities. In addition, it was hoped that it would galvanize the reform efforts of all parties
    to address the immediate crisis while setting in place reforms that will deliver over time.

67. In this report we have updated the stock take to show progress since September 2016 using the
    same three pillars 1) fiscal sustainability, 2) economic development and 3) Gaza reconstruction
    and recovery. Many of the PA actions are foreshadowed in the National Policy Agenda (NPA) which
    was released in February 2017. The main developments in these pillars are:

Fiscal Sustainability

68. While the fiscal performance was stronger in 2016 this was largely driven by one off revenue
    receipts and there has been little progress on the structural reforms needed to achieve fiscal
    sustainability. On the expenditure side there has been some progress on controlling health referrals
    with the arrangements earlier developed for Israeli hospitals now extended to six East Jerusalem
    hospitals and three West Bank hospitals. Progress has also been made on steps to control electricity net
    lending – although the problem is now emerging with other utility payments. There has been a recent
    step to reduce payments to Gazan employees, but these have not been formalized and while there is
    policy work underway, there have been no structural changes to control the wage bill or implement
    parametric reforms to support the pension systems sustainability.

69. On the revenue side progress has stalled since the initial one off payments by Israel to address
    past fiscal leakages. Immediate areas of focus are the handling fee, the crossing fees and systematic
    transfer of the health and equalization levies. To date there has not been a positive GoI response to
    requests in these areas, although proposed senior official talks are a promising development. Talks are
    also now underway between GoI and the PA to initiate the introduction of bonded warehouses for
    Palestinian imports and the transfer of some customs authority to the PA over the coming years. This
    is a potentially positive development, although care will be needed in the implementation to ensure that
    the revenues are protected and no additional costs are imposed on the Palestinian private sector.
    However, these talks should not be at the expense of addressing the real issues on fiscal losses identified
    earlier.

70. Finally, efforts to boost domestic revenues have been inadequate and the domestic revenue
    performance has been extremely weak. In fact, growth in domestic tax receipts has been lower than
    GDP growth in 2016, which highlights the need for revenue reform. The 2017 budget included an
    increase in various administrative fees and charges which is a positive step. However, on the broader
    tax system, even though the PA has focused its efforts on increasing the number of taxpayers, this has
    not translated into an increase in tax collections. The failure is because the majority of those newly
    added are low earners and the cost to administer their tax files is high. A focus on increasing the number
    of large taxpayers, particularly high earning professionals, would be more productive. Alongside this

                                                      26
       more could be done to change the basic approach to tax administration by placing the onus on taxpayers
       to comply with the system, and applying penalties for non-compliance. This approach has been
       successful in other countries.

71. There has not been any material progress in improving the public financial management (PFM)
    system in recent months, although the PA has in that period prepared its first comprehensive
    PFM strategy. It is intended that this will guide a more active reform agenda in the coming years.

72. Budget support from donors has continued to decline and this has been a key factor behind the
    large financing gap. As a share of GDP budget support has fallen from 32 percent in 2008 to under 6
    percent in 2016. The PA has budgeted for a further fall to under 5 percent in 2017.

Economic Development

73. The GoI constraints on movement and access continue to be the main impediment to economic
    growth leading to a sustainable recovery. A recent report from Israeli and Palestinian academics13
    highlighted the potential for economic development in both Gaza and the Jordan Valley, which
    recognizes Israel’s security concerns and does not interfere with final status negotiations. With respect
    to Gaza the report includes proposals for a new deep water port, a link between Gaza and the West
    Bank, and the opening of Rafah for trade, with mitigating measures to address security concerns. For
    the Jordan Valley, there are proposals to ease planning restrictions on land, increase Palestinian access
    to water, and encourage investment in agriculture, tourism and industry.

74. At a domestic level, the PA has initiated steps to reduce the cost of doing business and improve
    the business climate but these have yet to be fully implemented. A draft Companies Law has been
    developed following extensive consultation, and is expected to be passed into law during 2017.
    Similarly, a draft competition law has been prepared although the timing of its implementation is less
    clear. The abolition of land titling fees has led to an increase in land registration while consideration
    is also being given to new institutional arrangements to accelerate land registration but no decisions
    have yet been made.

Gaza Reconstruction and Recovery
75. Gaza reconstruction is progressing, although too slowly. While good progress has been made in
    some sectors, such as in the water sector in which reconstruction is almost completed, the transition to
    recovery is slow given the limits on funding and material entry. Disbursements after the Cairo
    conference in October 2014 have reached a plateau at around 50 percent which is causing a funding
    shortage that curtails progress particularly in those sectors with the highest financing needs identified
    in the DNA, e.g., in the housing sector. Good progress has been made in developing a results tracking
    mechanism to complement the pledge tracking under the leadership of the National Office for the
    Reconstruction of Gaza (NORG). However, more needs to be done to strengthen NORG’s institutional
    set-up and ensure a sustainable financing arrangement embedded in the PA’s structure. The shortage
    of materials remains an issue and despite the requests the Gaza Reconstruction Mechanism (GRM) has
    been able to process under the shelter and residential stream, progress and workability of the system
    for more complex infrastructure projects remains limited. Interruptions and long delays remain
    prevalent and no delivery monitoring has been established yet.

Annex 2: An overview of disbursement of pledges made at the Cairo
Conference on Palestine “Reconstructing Gaza”, Cairo 12th October, 2014


1.   By the end of 2016, almost two years and a half post the 2014 Gaza war, total disbursement of
     pledges to support Gaza is estimated at USD1.796 billion,14 and the overall disbursement ratio
     reached 51 percent. Based on available data, 31 participants, out of the total 53 participants, have
     already fully delivered their original pledge at Cairo Conference to support Gaza. However, these are
     generally the smaller donors and their overall disbursements (USD858 million) represent only a quarter
     of the overall support to Gaza announced at the Conference. Total disbursements to date by the top 7
     donors amounted to USD1.128 billion – and represents only 41 percent of their total original pledge.15

2.   Actual disbursements as of end of 2016 fell short of planned disbursements by USD1.4 billion.
     Figure 1 below shows the actual and expected flow of funding of Support to Gaza over the period 2014-
     2016. The disbursement ratio by the end of 2016 was supposed to reach around 91 percent as opposed
     to the actual disbursement ratio of 51 percent by the end of 2016.

3.   If donor funding continues to be disbursed at the current pace, pledges are estimated to be fully
     disbursed by the end of 2019; two years behind schedule. Since the September 2016 AHLC report,
     disbursements have increased by USD200 million (13 percent). This is consistent with recent periods
     but extent of delayed funding is growing.


14
   Disbursement figure may change once further data is collected from donors who have not yet provided information
about disbursements and allocation of pledges. Support to Gaza figure refers to pledges made at the Cairo Conference
and therefore does not reflect all support spent in Gaza after the 2014 war.
15
   The largest seven donors are Qatar, Saudi Arabia, European Union, USA, Kuwait, Turkey and UAE.

4.   Only 17 percent of the total recovery needs have been addressed as of today. Out of the USD1.796
     billion that has been disbursed, only USD670 million is directly attributed towards priority
     interventions outlined in the Gaza DNA and Recovery Framework, which covers 17 percent of total
     recovery needs.16 When compared to the end of July 2016, the financing of DNA interventions has
     increased by 9 percent or USD58 million. The infrastructure sector attracted the largest portion of funds
     with actual disbursements estimated at USD425 million.
