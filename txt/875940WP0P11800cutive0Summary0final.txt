Executive Summary

1.   INTRODUCTION

1.      Benin is one of the world’s least-developed countries, with an annual per capita
income of US$749 in 2012. Benin’s economy is driven largely by unofficial re-export trade with
Nigeria, transit trade with neighboring countries to the north, and agricultural production, cotton
in particular. Informal re-export trade with Nigeria makes up roughly 20 percent of GDP, while
agriculture accounts for over 30 percent of GDP and provides nearly 70 percent of the country's
employment. Less than 10 percent of the economically active population in Benin is engaged in
salaried employment, as over 90 percent are involved in informal activities. Over half of the
workforce is under-employed. On the other hand, the informal economy tends to be innovative,
entrepreneurial, and where women play a large role – less than 5 percent of economically active
women hold salaried employment. Despite moderate average annual GDP growth of 4 to 5
percent over the past two decades, in an environment of 3.5 percent population growth, growth
has been insufficient to meaningfully reduce poverty.

2.       While poverty rates remain relatively high, Benin has made notable progress in
maintaining macroeconomic stability, ensuring social stability and in advancing
democratic development. Three out of eight MDGs are considered attainable by 2015, namely:
(i) halting and reversing the spread of HIV/AIDS, (ii) reducing under-5 mortality by two thirds;
and (iii) reducing by half the proportion of individuals without access to safe water. More
specifically, child mortality has decreased from 184 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 70
in 2011. Tangible progress has also been achieved in access to basic education as the gross
enrollment rate (GER) for primary education increased from 93 percent in 2005/06 to 119.7
percent in 2011/12, and girls' participation experienced the same trend with GER increasing from
86 percent in 2005/06 to 116.8 percent in 2011/12, thus reducing the gender gap. Elections have
been held regularly, peacefully and government transitions have been without incident.

3.      This Executive Summary highlights the key findings of the report entitled
“Evaluation de la Pauvreté au Bénin”, (INSAE 2014). The full report assesses the recent
evolution and trajectory of poverty in Benin, provides insight on poverty dynamics, identifies
linkages between growth and poverty reduction, as well as the links between services provided
by the state and poverty reduction outcomes, including the impact of public spending on poverty.
The assessment provides analysis disaggregated by gender, region, sector of activity, and other
demographic and social variables. It also provides particular insight into the poverty challenges
faced by female-headed households and the economic empowerment of women in Benin.

2.   DATA AND POVERTY LINE MEASUREMENT

4.     The poverty assessment relies primarily on data from the 2006, 2009 and 2011
versions of the Integrated Modular Survey of Household Living Conditions (EMICoV) as
undertaken by INSAE. The 2006 EMICoV household survey was a baseline survey conducted
through four quarterly collection exercises over 2006/07 among 18,000 households (10,560 rural


                                            1
    and 7,440 urban). The 2009 survey, again 18,000 households, was a follow up household survey
    conducted in a single collection exercise on the same households as in 2006 (though with some
    attrition). The 2011 EMICoV survey was the beginning of another baseline survey of 18,000
    households and included a 70 percent new household inclusion rate. As such, the 2006 and 2009
    surveys provide panel data for the analysis of poverty dynamics.

    5.     The poverty line is constructed to capture the minimum level of expenditure
    required for an individual to meet basic needs, food and otherwise. In Benin, this is based on
    two components: a food component and a non-food component. The poverty line is obtained by
    summing the food and non-food minimum thresholds.

    6.      The food threshold was established as a normative caloric threshold of 2400 calories
    per adult individual. To meet this threshold a basket of food items was determined in line with
    prevailing food consumption habits. This basket was determined for each commune to reflect the
    dietary habits of each region. Consequently, the food poverty line differs by commune, with each
    commune having its own poverty line reflecting consumption habits unique to that region.

    7.     For conversion into monetary terms, the valuation of this consumption basket was
    then determined from price information collected in local markets at the time of the
    survey. The determination of the non-food consumption threshold was obtained by simply
    multiplying the food poverty line by the typical ratio of food to non-food expenditure for those
    households falling below the median. As a result, there is no single poverty line unique to the
    country as whole and the poverty line reflects regional consumption and price conditions.

                        3.    THE EVOLUTION OF POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

    Key Findings:
   The poverty rate was 36.2 percent in 2011 and has changed little in recent years.
   Poverty is more prevalent and more severe in rural areas. Strong regional disparities persist.
   The $1.25 per day poverty rate remains high at 50.9 percent in 2011.
   Asset-based poverty has shown steady improvement over recent years.
   There is a strong correlation between poverty and certain population characteristics such as: area of
    residence (urban versus rural); employment status and sector of work; socio-professional status;
    household size; educational attainment; and sex of household head.
   Households headed by women are less poor than those headed by men, but appear more vulnerable to
    falling into poverty.


    8.      After declining by 2.3 percentage points between 2006 and 2009, the poverty rate
    increased by 1 percentage point between 2009 and 2011. The poverty rate was 36.2 percent in
    2011, compared to 35.2 percent in 2009 and 37.5 in 2006 (Table 1). Poverty is more pronounced
    in rural areas and strong disparities persist at the regional level (Figure 1).

9.     As in many other developing countries, including in West Africa, households headed
by women seem less exposed to poverty and the gap is widening (see Figure 2). Understanding
why this is the case is challenging and deserving of further attention.

10.   One potential explanation for why female-headed households are less poor may be
because they are typically significantly smaller (in terms of the number household
members) than male-headed households. Female-headed households average 3.71 persons,
while male-headed households average 5.47 and poverty rates are highly dependent on
household size (see Table 2).

11.    Lower levels of poverty among female-headed households could also arise through a
process of self-selection. In this instance non-poor female head-of-households may remain as
such by choice, while poor female head-of-households may seek to change their status, i.e., seek
a partner. This can be noted in Table 3 where never-married and divorced/separated female-
headed households are less poor. In contrast, households headed by widows and married women
are more vulnerable to poverty, possibly because the loss of an economically active member of
the household may undermine household finances and push it into poverty.

12.    Furthermore, it appears an increasing number of women are taking advantage of
opportunities that have a direct impact on living standards, such as access to credit (for
instance, through the microcredit program for the poorest (MCPP)); opportunities that can be
conducive to income generation as well as the diversification of income-generating activities and
may help them escape poverty.

US$1.25 per day Poverty Trends

13.     Poverty, defined by the international standard as those living under $1.25 per day,
follows a similar trend.1 The $1.25 per day poverty rate stood at 50.9% in 2011 against 45.9%
in 2009 and 61.7% in 2006, reflecting a 15.8 percentage point drop between 2006 and 2009 and a
subsequent reversal of 5 percentage points between 2009 and 2011. The significant increase
between 2009 and 2011 may reflect the impact of the severe floods encountered in 2010 and the
effect of that natural disaster on income and consumption levels.

14.     As shown in Figure 3, $1.25 per day poverty exhibits strong regional disparities. It is
significantly higher in rural than in urban areas. In 2011, 64.4% of the rural population fell below
the $1.25 per day consumption threshold, while only half as many were considered to be poor by
this standard in urban areas.

15.    In 2011, of the twelve regions in the country, eight had a higher $1.25 per day
poverty rate than the national average of 50.9 percent2. Of these eight departments, seven
were at least 5 percentage points higher than the national average: Atacora (77.0%), Donga
(75.7%), Alibori (68.0%), Zou (64.2 %) Couffo (64.1%), Borgou (60.1%) and Collines (59.4%).
Ouémé (27.8%) and Littoral (6.3%) exhibited the lowest rates of extreme poverty in 2011.

1
  $1.25 per day poverty is calculated as a daily consumption expenditure of less than $1.25 per day (2005 prices).
This is based on an annual minimum consumption basket for a tolerable level of life. It corresponds to the average of
the poverty lines found in the 15 poorest countries in terms of per capita consumption (Chen and Ravallion, 2008).
International comparisons can be made as poverty levels are expressed in purchasing power parity terms (PPP).
2
  It should be noted that in contrast to the domestically calculated poverty line, the $1.25 line is not corrected for
differences in regional costs of living. As such, regional differences will be more notable in the case of the $1.25
poverty line.


                                                    5
Asset-Based Poverty

16.    Recent literature has indicated that measuring the level of household assets, both
productive assets and those that contribute directly to quality of life, may provide a better
indication of household poverty than flow variables such as consumption or income. The
relevant indicator used in this case relies on household asset data (automobile, radio, moped,
bicycle, television set, refrigerator, hi-fi system, VCD/DVD player, tape recorder, stove,
generator, computer, cell phone, or land line) and housing characteristics (floor-, wall-, and roof-
materials, power, sanitation, waste disposal, and drinking water).

17.    In contrast to other measures, asset-based poverty has demonstrated a continual
decline. Asset-based poverty affected 29.5 percent of the population in 2011, compared to 44.1
percent in 2006, thus declining by 14.6 percentage points over the period. Urban-rural and
regional differences were notable.

18.     This can possibly be explained by falling prices of consumer goods. In an
environment of falling prices for assets such as cell phones, motorbikes, televisions, etc., a
household’s stock of assets could be increasing faster than incomes. Thus, income or
consumption based poverty levels could remain relatively static, yet households could be
benefiting in an asset sense by falling prices as their relatively stable income can now purchase
more assets. This is particularly the case for goods such as cell phones, motorbikes, consumer
electronics, etc.

19.    From an asset-based measure of poverty, women-headed households are poorer
than male-headed households, a finding in contrast to a consumption approach. While asset-
based poverty rates have declined for both male- and female-headed households, the decline is
more pronounced among male-headed households.

20.     This difference between male- and female-headed households may be due to an
economy of scale influence. Using an asset-based measure of poverty may allow for the
expression of such an effect whereby larger households appear less poor as they may have more
assets, albeit distributed across a greater number of individuals. An alternative explanation is that
this highlights women’s choices to focus more on the well-being of their households through a
strong focus on allocating income to consumption rather than asset accumulation. This is an area
deserving of further analysis, and again may indicate that household size is a key driver of
poverty outcomes.

                                       4.     POVERTY DYNAMICS

    Key Finding:
       For many households, poverty in Benin appears to be mainly a temporary phenomenon. Only 15
        percent of households were in a state of poverty in both 2006 and 2009.


21.    In Benin, it could be said that poverty is largely a temporary condition.3 Between
2006 and 2009 22.3 percent of individuals fell into poverty, while 18.9 percent moved out of
poverty. This is compared to the 15.5 percent of individuals who were in a permanent state of
poverty, i.e., poor in both 2006 and in 2009.

22.     Generally speaking, households that exited from poverty were more likely to have
lived in urban areas, were small, and headed by women or by young persons (under 30). In
this group, heads of household tended to be qualified workers (managers or senior executives,
salaried employees or skilled laborers) engaged in the secondary or tertiary sectors.


3
  EMICoV surveys for 2006 and 2009 consisted largely of the same households and this panel data allowed for a
direct comparison of poverty states of individual households over time. Households were characterized as “never
poor” (households who were non-poor in both periods), “always poor” (households in poverty in both periods),
“entered poverty” (poor in 2009, but non-poor in 2006), or “exited poverty” (poor in 2006, but non -poor in 2009).


                                                    7
23.    Households that fell into poverty, or had always been poor, tended to be those in
rural areas and, generally speaking, were large, headed by men, usually aged, and working
in the primary sector (agriculture, livestock production, or fishing) as self-employed or as
laborers or apprentices. These households also often experienced a reduction in the number of
employed household members or suffered biophysical shocks (floods or droughts) between 2006
and 2009. Overall, the socio-demographic and socio-economic factors that most affect the
poverty transition of households are the life cycle, the educational level and gender of the head
of household, among others. Furthermore, members of households whose heads are unemployed
are more affected by persistent poverty. Almost all households that enter poverty or are
chronically poor are headed by informal sector workers, most of whom are underemployed.

24.    In particular, household size again seems to pose a major challenge in terms of
wealth creation and a household’s ability or likelihood to exit from poverty. The rate of
population growth continues to increase in Benin: from 2.8 percent in 1979-1992, to 3.2 percent
between 1992 and 2002, and 3.5 percent between 2002 and 2013. This trend is expected to create
considerable social demand in the face of persistently weak and only moderate economic growth.
Poverty reduction will prove challenging in such an environment.

                           5.     LINKS BETWEEN GROWTH AND POVERTY

    Key Findings:
       Economic growth in Benin can be said, in a limited sense, to be pro-poor -- the very poorest
        households (lowest two deciles) benefit from growth to a greater extent than do other households.
       However, growth has not led to poverty reduction as those households close to the poverty line
        (third, fourth, fifth deciles) benefit little from growth.
       Growth in agriculture primarily benefits those in the first (poorest) decile, as growth has been based
        largely on expanding the land area under cultivation rather than on increased productivity. As such,
        it has benefited the very poor, but has led to stagnant, or even declining, productivity.
       Redistribution appears a more important factor than growth in reducing poverty.


25.     While the growth sectors identified by the Government in its Growth for Poverty
Reduction Strategy (SCRP) target the majority of the poor, poverty reduction results have
been limited. In 2011, the priority sectors employed approximately 82 percent of the population
and accounted for 87 percent of national poverty compared to, respectively, 82 and 78.4 percent
in 2006. This highlights the significance of those sectors, agriculture in particular, in poverty
reduction strategies. Yet, as Figure 6 illustrates, periods of sustained growth in most of these
sectors (agriculture, trade, and logistics) have not led to a reduction in poverty4. These findings
suggest that changes in poverty appear largely unrelated to sectoral growth rates and that growth
overall has not been favorable to the poor or to vulnerable households in terms of poverty
reduction.

 It can be noted in Figure 6 that for several sectors, including agriculture, positive economic growth is associated
with increases in poverty over the same 2006-2009 period, i.e., positive economic growth yet increased poverty.

26.     There are several potential explanations for this disconnect. One may be simply that
economic growth, at 3 or 4 percent annually, was simply too low to make a significant difference
in the poverty rate, particularly given a 3.5 percent population growth rate. Indeed in such an
environment we would expect the impact of growth on poverty to be negligible. Another
explanation may lie in the high degree of informality, low productivity and very high levels of
under-employment in the economy; all of which contribute to low and stagnant wages,
employment and livelihood vulnerability, and difficulty in escaping poverty despite periods of
growth and high levels of employment.

27.    However, while not reducing poverty, there is evidence that economic growth has
benefited the very poorest households and in this limited sense can be considered pro-poor.
At the national level, the standard of living of the poorest population groups has risen more than
the average. The poverty rate, however, has decreased little because the impact of growth
appears to have had the greatest impact on the poorest two deciles of the population, which
remain well below the poverty line. In this sense, while benefiting the very poorest, growth has
been insufficient to lift households above the poverty line.

28.    As evidence of the pro-poor, though not poverty-reducing nature of economic
growth in Benin, Table 4 notes that while the poverty rate has remained relatively stable,
the depth of poverty (P1) has steadily declined. The indicator P1 measures how far the average
poor household falls below the poverty line in terms of the percentage of the poverty line. In
2006 the average poor household’s consumption was 11.6 percent below the poverty line;
improving to 10.4 and 9.8 percent in 2009 and 2011 respectively.

29.     Figures 7 and 8 illustrate the growth incidence curves by area of residence and by
sector of activity respectively. These curves note the level of consumption growth experienced
across the income distribution from poorest to richest households over the period 2006 to 2009.
As such, higher growth in consumption at the lower end of the curve, i.e., closest to the vertical
axis, indicates that poorer households increased consumption levels at a higher rate than those
households at higher initial income/consumption levels. The growth incidence curves note the
substantial increases in consumption among the lowest decile households and only limited
increases, or in some cases decreases, among households close to the poverty line.

30.     As can be noted, economic growth has benefited the very poor in both urban and
rural areas, in that the very poor have benefitted proportionally more than the non-poor from
gains in growth. In absolute terms, however, growth has been pro-poor in urban areas only,
where consumption increased across almost all percentiles of the consumer expenditure
distribution, with the exception of the richest decile. In rural areas, on the contrary, growth
benefited only those households at the very bottom of the distribution, while being of little or no
benefit to other households. As a result, the decline in the poverty rate has been negligible.

31.     In sectoral terms the story is much the same. Growth in consumption was most notable
among the very poorest households, while the bulk of households experienced little growth and
the richest households experienced a decline in consumption. This pattern was consistent across
sectors with the exception of the agri-food processing sector where poorer households fared
worse. These sectoral results are illustrated in Figure 8.

32.     To achieve significant declines in the poverty rate, growth must not only benefit the
poorest population groups, but particularly those vulnerable groups whose per capita
consumption expenditures are close to the poverty line and those who are vulnerable to
sliding into poverty. Thus, a prerequisite to any substantial reduction in poverty is the
development of opportunities for raising the incomes of a broad segment of the population,
particularly poor and vulnerable households with incomes close to the poverty line.

33.     At the macro level, a possible explanation for these results may be declining total
factor productivity at national and sectoral levels over the period 1983-2008 (Balaro et al.,
2010), especially in agriculture. This may also help explain the relatively high rate of poverty
in Benin, particularly in the agricultural sector, despite moderate growth. Table 5 presents
changes in total factor productivity across sectors, while Figure 9 highlights the case of
agriculture in greater detail.

34.     Figure 9 suggests that poverty reduction may require greater emphasis on
agricultural productivity, not simply on agricultural production levels. It would appear that
growth in agriculture has largely resulted from increased land brought under cultivation and not
from productivity improvements. Thus, more labor has been employed in planting more land
area, perhaps moving on to less productive land, and stretching inputs thinner in the process.
This has resulted in some increased income for the very poorest, but no overall increase in
returns to labor in agriculture and hence limited poverty reduction. This highlights the need to
redefine priorities towards agricultural growth based more on increased productivity and less on
an increase in the area under cultivation.

35.     Indeed, it is evident that agricultural productivity should be an essential component
of efforts to reverse the noted trends (FARA, 2006). Improved productivity in agriculture
would increase the incomes of agricultural households and help satisfy non-food needs (inter
alia, health care and education), raise employment and living standards in rural areas, and boost
the sector’s contribution to national economic growth. In this regard, the Government has
identified increased productivity and competitiveness in the agriculture and rural sector as one of
the two major challenges6 to be met by 2015.

        6.   HOUSEHOLD SHOCKS, VULNERABILITIES, AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES

    Key Findings:
        Shocks are important determinants of poverty and include economic, biophysical and social
         shocks.
        Biophysical shocks are more predominant in rural areas and affect proportionally more transient
         poor households (those entering poverty) and chronically poor households, while economic shocks
         occur more frequently in urban areas.
        Strategies adopted by households to cope with shocks are generally financial and food related.


36.     In 2009, 61.8 percent of the country’s households experienced a shock of some type .
Economic shocks7 affected 41.7 percent of households; biophysical shocks (caused by climate-
related or other natural disasters) 31.9 percent and social shocks (a serious illness, an accident
involving a household member, or the death of a key household member) 14.3 percent.

37.    Biophysical shocks are more frequent in rural areas, while economic shocks affect
mainly urban areas. Biophysical shocks affected 39.6 percent of rural and 20.1 percent of urban
households, while economic shocks affected 46.9 percent of urban and 38.3 percent of rural
households. In Cotonou, prevailing economic shocks affected more than half of households. The
country’s southern departments were more affected by shocks in general than the northern
departments.

  Economic shocks are considered those economic shocks that simultaneously affect numerous households, i.e., that
are covariant across households. Examples would be the global food and fuel price shocks that were experienced
over the 2006 to 2009 period. This is in contrast to economic shocks to individual households, such as employment
loss, loss of savings, etc., i.e., shocks that impact individual households.


                                                  13
38.     Biophysical shocks affect households that are temporarily poor (recently entered
poverty) or chronically poor (i.e., always poor) more frequently than other households.
Covariant shocks (those that affect numerous households simultaneously), particularly
biophysical ones (floods, droughts, etc.), affect household groups largely in accordance with
their sector of activity.
              Table 4: Prevalence of Shocks (% affected) by Status of Households

39.      The strategies adopted by households to overcome shocks are generally financial
and food-related. On a priority basis, such strategies involve: (i) consuming less expensive or
less preferred food; (ii) spending from savings; and (iii) borrowing money. When faced with
economic shocks, households prefer to consume less expensive or less preferred food and spend
from savings. When faced with social shocks, most households spend from savings, borrow
money, or consume less expensive food. Strategies for dealing with biophysical shocks involve
consuming less expensive or less preferred food, spending from savings, purchasing food on
credit, and reducing the volume of food consumed at each meal.

40.     Unfortunately, risk management strategies adopted by households in response to a
shock tend to be only partially effective. Most households indicate that the recovery achieved
following a shock is only partial. This reveals the limited effectiveness of current strategies
adopted by households to deal with shocks and highlights the typical short-term impact of
responses. It also brings to the fore the need for households to have access to more suitable
mechanisms to effectively manage risk, and for further analysis into mechanisms that could: (i)
improve the well-being of individuals and society at a given moment (static analysis); (ii)
contribute to economic development and growth over time (dynamic analysis); and (iii) be key
factors to real and sustainable poverty reduction (Holzmann, R., and Jorgensen, S., 2000).

                         7.    EMPLOYMENT POLICY AND POVERTY

  Key Findings:
     Labor market participation is not a key determinant of poverty and raises the question as to the
      overall quality of employment in Benin.
     The salaried employment rate is low (less than 10 percent) and well over half of the employed
      population in Benin is underemployed.
     Young persons encounter particular challenges in the labor market.

41.     Analysis of the interaction between the labor market and poverty reveals a Beninese
paradox. In 2010, despite a low unemployment rate (0.5 percent according to International
Labour Organization (ILO) metrics), the poverty rate among employed workers was relatively
high (30.1 percent). The highest poverty rates among employed persons occurred in the
agriculture (38.9 percent) and agri-food (31.2 percent) sectors, and affected women more than
men. This indicates that the labor market is not fully playing its role with respect to poverty
reduction, largely perhaps as a result of the prevalence of the informal sector and high levels of
underemployment (see Table 7).

42.     Young persons encounter considerable difficulties in the labor market. Among
young persons, 30.4 percent are visibly underemployed based on hours of work, 63.2 percent are
invisibly underemployed through precarious or inadequate remuneration, and only 7.9 percent
hold a salaried job. These rates highlight the difficulties in absorbing the supply of young
workers into the labor market.

heads of household active in the labor force work in the agricultural sector.
9
   According to the ILO, persons underemployed in terms of hours of work include all job holders meeting the
following three criteria during the reference period: (a) “willing to work additional hours,” (b) “available to work
additional hours” (i.e., ready to work more hours during a specified later period, if offered that possibility), and (c)
“having worked less than a working time threshold” (i.e., persons whose “hours actually worked” in all jobs during
the reference period, as defined in current international guidelines regarding working time statistics, were below a
threshold to be chosen according to national circumstances).
10
   Invisible underemployment is characterized here by “low income, underutilization of skills or low productivity”
(see paragraph 15 (2) of the resolution concerning statistics of the economically active population, employment,
unemployment, and underemployment, adopted by the Thirteenth International Conference of Labour Statisticians
(ICLS), annex II).

43.    Employment, particularly of young persons, occupies an important place in poverty
reduction policies in Benin. This is largely due to the youthfulness of the Beninese population,
of which 46.8 percent are under 15 and only 5.5 percent are 60 or older (General Population and
Housing Census, 2002). Persons under 35 account for 72 percent of unemployed persons.
Addressing this issue is therefore critical; as the promotion of decent employment for young
persons affects the majority of the population, and is central to reducing the number of poor.

           8.     GENDER-BASED INEQUALITY OF ACCESS AND OPPORTUNITY


  Key Findings:
     Women are characterized by low economic power compared to men.
     Large family sizes highlight the burden of unremunerated work on women and predisposes them to
      relatively weak economic power.


44.     Compared to men, women wield limited economic power, but seem less vulnerable
to poverty. The analysis is based on the African Gender and Development Index (AGDI) and
focuses on inequality of access between genders, particularly with regard to women’s economic
power. Despite having less economic power, women may be less vulnerable to poverty partly
because of the nature of the shocks to which they are exposed. Households headed by women
tend to be more prone to economic shocks that have a more limited impact on poverty. In
contrast households headed by men tend more affected by biophysical shocks, one of the primary
factors leading to poverty. Moreover, certain poverty programs, such as the microcredit program
for the poorest, appear to have benefited women more than men.

45.     Gender-based obstacles that underlie inequality of opportunity in terms of economic
power in Benin are related to educational level, household size, type of employment, socio-
professional category, area of activity, place of residence, age, and migration status. These
are important determinants of poverty that affect both men and women, but appear to have a
greater impact on women. Household size, in particular, highlights the burden of unremunerated
work which falls on women and predisposes them to relatively weak economic power.

                        9.    POVERTY MONITORING MECHANISMS

46.     Poverty monitoring, evaluation, data collection and analytical mechanisms used in Benin
are largely relevant. Poverty monitoring is based on a household data collection system involving
the modular integrated survey of household living conditions (EMICoV) established by INSAE
in 2006 and forms part of the National Strategy for the Development of Statistics (SNDS), 2008-
2012.

47.     Nonetheless, the findings of this evaluation have helped identify certain needs in this
regard. In particular the poverty assessment identified and suggested the following, the details of
which are included in the full report: (i) expand the indicators used; (ii) adopt appropriate
methodological approaches for the calculation of new indicators considered; (iii) revise or
expand some methodological approaches previously used to calculate indicators; (iv) revise or
adapt the EMICoV modules to incorporate variables intrinsic to the proposed new indicators; (v)
ensure more regular data collection; (vi) conduct rigorous and specific impact assessments; and
(vii) ensure the sustainability of current data collection and analysis systems.
