  BOX 1: The Trucking Industry “Bubble” in Sudan
  The Sudan trucking industry went through a boom and bust cycle over the past decade. In 2005, there were about 4,000 trucks
  registered at the Union of Chambers of Transportation. The freight was US$75–80/tonne on average in the trucking industry.
  At that time, the government took an initiative to promote the trucking industry. The government and the Central Bank of Sudan
  (CBS) supported the sector by providing loans for individuals to purchase trucks. As a result of this initiative many trucks were
  purchased and introduced into the market. The number of registered trucks jumped to 22,000 by the end of 2007, which
  translated into an estimated capacity of eight million tonnes per year. However, demand did not change much over the same
  period and consequently, there was an excess of supply of trucks that led to a drop in the transport prices. By 2007 the price of
  freight had fallen to less than US$30/tonne on average. The problems faced were compounded by sanctions that increased the
  costs to the operators for obtaining imported spare parts. As a result, many small trucking enterprises were not able to sustain
  their operations and went out of business.
     Since then the sector has stabilized at a lower level of supply. The number of operators registered with the Union has fallen
  back to 151 after having risen from 60 in 2005 to 260 between 2007 and 2009. The current level of supply is despite the
  continuation of some of the incentives to expand the trucking sector in the form of a tax exemption. Imports of 10 trucks or more
  are exempt from the duty payment and the operator benefits from a three-year income tax exemption. For 50 trucks or more
  trucks, in addition to the duty exemption, the operators are also exempt from paying income tax for 10 years.

  BOX 2: Technical Committees for Standards
  Members of technical committees are appointed by the General Manager responsible for Standards Administration according
  to tightly defined guidelines laid out in the Standards and Metrology act of 2008. The act makes provision for a cross-section of
  membership from the private sector, academics and industry experts, consumer protection societies, and regulators. Committees
  are kept small (limited to 7 persons) although allowance is made for additional members to join upon request. However, this is
  subject to approval.
     SSMO has good participation by its stakeholders represented on its technical committees. The technical committees
  cover most areas of the economy with each covering quite a wide spectrum of work and meet on a very regular basis; the
  organization claims that the committees each meet every week (which is well above international practice). Representatives
  serving on the committees are recompensed at a defined rate; this is not uncommon in countries where the majority of
  standards users are more likely to be affected by standards than driving an agenda to set standards to their own advantage
  (Standards “takers” rather than standards “makers”) but the market relevance of the standards being developed can
  sometimes be questioned. The technical committees fall into the areas as follows
     Standards development is currently dominated by the regulators, drafts are not publicly circulated, insufficient time
  is allowed for comment, and the standards do not generally follow international standards. The work is carried out in
  committees of not less than 7 (seven) members who represent the interests of the different stakeholder groups although it
  should be noted that the interests of regulators tend to dominate these committees with Industry being represented by a
  single seat from the Businessman’s Federation and consumers on the whole are very poorly represented. During the final
  enquiry phase of the development process, drafts of the standard are circulated to parties who the committee identifies
  as “possibly having an interest” for their comment and approval, drafts are not circulated publically or made available
  to possible stakeholders outside of Sudan (the code of good practice requires that a public enquiry forms part of the
  process). The prescribed comment period of 60 days for members of the public or interested parties outside the country
  who may be affected by the publication of the standard is not maintained. The draft standards and technical regulations
  are not currently being “Notified” to the WTO TBT committee via the National Enquiry point as required in the WTO TBT
  agreement. Most of published Sudan standards are not adoptions of international standards. The WTO Code of Good
  Practice strongly advises that international standards be used as the basis for technical regulations. Furthermore, the current
  standards work program across all the committees is not made available publicly within Sudan or to the trading partners
  of Sudan as required by the code.
     Overall, there is scope to review committee procedures in order to improve the openness of the process and to ensure
  full compliance to the substantive provisions of the WTO TBT Code of Good Practice for standards development. This
  would allow stakeholders who have a legitimate interest in the standards being developed to make their input and have
  their voice heard either directly or through legitimate representative structures.

     Note: The figure shows scatter plots of average services value added as a percentage of GDP against the log of average GDP per capita in pur-
     chasing power parity (PPP    , current international USD) for the periods 2000–2002 (left panel) and 2010–2012 (right panel). The line indicates the
     fitted values obtained by a linear prediction of the relationship between share of services in total value added and income per capita. This line re-
     flects a stylized fact that in richer countries the services sector tends to represent a larger share of the economy. The figure can be used to analyze
     whether the share of the services sector is higher or lower than what it should be given a country’s level of development.

  BOX 3: Domestic Regulation in Professional Services in Sudan
  In Sudan’s accounting sector there are mandatory continuing education requirements for members of the profession, while for both
  the accounting and the legal sector there are additional requirements include passing the professional examinations to become a
  full member of the profession. There are practical training requirements to become a full member of the accounting, engineering
  and legal professions: one year for law practitioners, three years for accounting professionals and five years for engineers. In
  addition, the accounting and the legal professions are also subject to other educational or vocational requirements over and above
  the academic degree to enter the profession (example, the legal profession requirement is a one-year post-graduate course).
     All three sectors also regulate access to the profession through compulsory licenses or authorization granted by the Sudan Bar
  Association in legal services, the Accountancy and Audit Profession Organization in accounting services, and the Engineering
  Council for engineering services. Licenses are renewed periodically (for example, every two to five years for engineering).
     In the engineering sector, although there are no requirements for passing a professional examination to become a member,
  there are requirements pertaining to practical training (a few years for engineering technicians and five years for engineers). All
  these requirements are in addition to the mandatory university degree obtained to practice legally.
     In Sudan, engineering and legal services are not subject to exclusive rights of practice by engineers or lawyers; the scope of
  exclusive rights is broader in accounting services. Highly skilled professionals in professional services sectors have exclusive rights
  to perform certain activities (e.g., auditing, representation of clients before courts, advice on legal matters, feasibility studies, design
  and planning). The argument in favor of exclusive rights is that they can lead to increased specialization of professionals and
  guarantee a higher quality of service. But the negative price and allocation effects of exclusive rights, which act as monopolies,
  can be substantial, especially if they are granted for standardized services that can be provided at a lower cost by less-regulated
  or non-regulated providers, such as the middle-level professionals in these sectors.
     In the accounting sector, except for matters related to management consultancy services, investment advice, legal advice
  and representation, and expert witness in accounting, all other accounting type works fall under the exclusive rights domain of
  certified accounting professionals. The following activities are specifically provided by accounting professionals only: traditional
  accounting (bookkeeping); statutory audit; non-statutory audits; audit of mergers and of contributions in kind; insolvency practice;
  international audit; tax advice, and tax representation
     Regulation affecting the conduct/operations of professional services providers in Sudan seems to be less severe than in many
  neighboring countries. In all professional services, fees tend to be negotiated freely between practitioners and clients, but there
  is a Fee Committee at the Bar Association that deals with complaints from clients.
     All types of legal entities are permitted in engineering. By contrast, only sole proprietorship and general partnerships are
  permitted in accounting. Also, advertising is prohibited in accountancy but seems to be allowed in engineering and legal services.

            one of optimism, investment and success. The president spent much time in the U.S. courting businessmen and showing a
            different face to the one people were expecting.
        2.	 They practiced what they preached. These were not empty promises and fabricated successes. Each positive story that came
            out could be witnessed and validated, lending huge credibility and a real sense of optimism and change to the nation brand.
            In a digital age where everyone has a phone and can be a reporter, this truth becomes more and more important.

           The country was also very successful in positioning itself around its primary tourism draw: highland gorillas. With limited financial
        resources to conduct its branding campaign, the country utilized creative and cost-effective mechanisms. For example, it enlisted
        the support of Hollywood celebrities such as Sigourney Weaver (who played Dian Fossey in the movie “Gorillas in the Mist”) and
        Daryl Hannah. It also generates a large amount of international press by inviting international luminaries to participate in Kwita
        Izina, the annual gorilla naming ceremony.

  BOX 5: UK Visa Reform Targets Chinese Tourists
  In a targeted attempt to lure Chinese tourists to the UK, the Government has simplified the visa application process for Chinese
  nationals. Tourism body Visit Britain recently calculated that 61 percent of Chinese people who chose not to come to Britain were
  put off by the visa process. As Chinese visitors spend around three times as much as other visitors, the UK believes they should
  be doing anything they can to attract more in order to help to boost the economy. The UK attracted around 149,000 visits from
  China in 2012, but European rivals such as France and Germany outperformed it. Visit Britain is looking to increase this number
  to 382,000 visits by 2020.
     New measures include a shortened online application form, with translated forms available by April 2013, dedicated embassy
  staff to help business travelers with their applications, reduced documentary requirements and the option for applicants to keep
  their passports while visas are processed. The Government identified all these measures as areas where they could out-compete
  the visa requirements of the Schengen member states, as well as Australia and the U.S.
     “China is a key growth market for international tourism and a market in which Britain needs to compete effectively to ensure
  that we continue to be in the top 10 of tourism destinations. Improvements in the visa process will support our ambition to attract
  40 million visitors a year by 2020.” Visit Britain, January 2013.
