 The Country Profiles produced by the Enterprise Analysis Unit of the World Bank Group provide an overview of key business environment indicators in each economy, comparing them to
 their respective geographic region and group of countries with similar income levels. The same topics are covered for all countries with slight variations of indicators. All indicators are based
 on the responses of firms. To learn more about the Enterprise Analysis Unit and to obtain Country Profiles for other countries, please visit www.enterprisesurveys.org

   1.    The sample for each economy is stratified by industry, firm size, and geographic region. The level of detail of the stratification by industry depends on
         the size of the economy. Stratification by size follows the three levels presented in the text: small, medium, and large. Regional stratification includes the
         main economic regions in each economy. Through this methodology estimates for the different stratification levels can be calculated on a separate basis
         while, at the same time, inferences can be made for the non-agricultural private economy as a whole. For more details on the sampling strategy, review
         the Sampling Note available at www.enterprisesurveys.org.
