Introduction
The Guidebook for developing analyses on marginalized communities: identifying the needs and providing
potential solutions (‘the Guidebook’) was prepared for the purpose of informing the development and
evaluation of analyses on marginalized communities, as basis for the implementation of viable and
sustainable development projects in such areas. The document is mainly aimed at assisting the future
applicants for projects targeting marginalized communities, by means of providing an extended set of
quantitative and qualitative research instruments, relevant social indicators and recommendations of
research options to be used both for the validation marginalized areas, and for the identification of
problems and solutions specific to such territorial clusters. Moreover, the Guidebook is also meant to
serve as a reference document for the evaluators of projects that include analyses on marginalized
communities – and therefore comprises suggestions on sets of criteria based on which the evaluators may
assess such analyses.
In Romania, 4.5% of the population (more than 900 thousand individuals) lives in marginalised
communities (3.2% of the urban population and 6.2% of the rural population). 1 By definition,
marginalised communities are areas accumulating low human capital (such as lack of education), high
unemployment rate and inadequate housing. Marginalised areas qualify as ‘problematic’ areas on account
of a mixture of factors: inadequate housing, insalubrious or non-existent streets, high number of
households in extreme poverty, very low level of education, precarious state of health, single or underage
mothers, large number of children, low-quality and/or segregated schools and high rates of
misdemeanour occurrences. In these areas, public services are lacking or of poor quality. Apart from being
marginalised, such categories are also confronted with territorial stigmatisation, a situation whereby their
chances to adequate education or decent employment is further diminished. In general, the interests of
these areas are underrepresented amongst the local-level policy decision structures.
Given that the Roma population is over-represented within the areas referred to above and is
confronted with social exclusion problems of a more stringent nature compared to non-Roma
population, the interventions targeting Roma marginalised communities are considered a priority.
The Background Study for the National Strategy on Social Inclusion and Poverty Reduction 2015-20202
reveals that: (i) the self-identified Roma population is extremely concentrated at territorial level within
marginalised communities3, (ii) within the same types of communities (rural or urban, marginalized/non-
marginalized and with similar shares of Roma people within the community), Roma people are much
more often socially excluded from education and employment4, (iii) in general, the higher the share of

3 ‘In rural areas, nearly 39% of self-declared Roma people live in marginalised communities (accumulating low human

capital, limited formal employment and precarious living conditions), compared to the percentage of persons of
different ethnicity, which is below 5%. In urban areas, nearly 31% of self-declared Roma people live in marginalised
areas, while the share of non-Roma people is of only 2.6%.’ (Teșliuc, E., Grigoraș, V., Stănculescu, M.S. (coord.) (2015b),
page 329).

are, at most, graduates of primary education, account for 83% in the case of Roma people, while this percentage
decreases to 52% in the case of non-Roma people.’ (Teșliuc, E., Grigoraș, V., Stănculescu, M.S. (coord.) (2015b), page
330).

Roma population within a marginalised community, the lower the values of all social exclusion indicators5.
Under these circumstances, the development interventions should be targeted with priority to Roma
marginalised areas, so as to reduce the gap between such areas and the rest of the population.
The European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI Funds)6 are key-instruments supporting the
efforts made by Member States for improving the life of vulnerable groups, including Roma
people. Specifically, the Human Capital Operational Programme (HCOP) provides funds amounting to
Euro 4.7 billion (of which Euro 4.3 billion from the European budget), to finance projects that contribute to
poverty reduction and social inclusion, with specific focus on youth, Roma population and population
living in the most disadvantaged areas. Priority Axis 4 of HCOP, by means of its integrated measures, will
help vulnerable groups and disadvantaged persons – including Roma – to have access to the labour
market, by improving their competencies and by providing support to social enterprises, amongst other
measures. Apart from the Roma vulnerable group, the specific challenges faced by several other
vulnerable groups are also addressed – homeless persons, people with drug dependencies, victims of
domestic violence or human trafficking, prisoners or ex-prisoners, elderly people and persons with
disabilities.
Considering the low absorption rate and the limited impact of projects targeting marginalised areas that
were financed during the 2007-2013 programming period, the Romanian Government, through the
HCOP Managing Authority, strives to strengthen the capacity and knowledge of staff involved in
designing the Call for Proposals and evaluation. In this context, in September 2016, the Romanian
Government, through the Ministry of European Funds, requested the Work Bank to provide assistance for
the training of HCOP evaluators in charge for the evaluation of projects implemented under Priority Axis 4
(under the specific objectives 4.1. and 4.2.) related to the challenges faced by marginalised communities.7
This Guidebook is a part of the support provided to the Ministry of European Funds under the
Reimbursable Advisory Services8.
The Guidebook may represent a useful instrument9 not only for the team of evaluators involved in the
selection of projects under the first Call for Proposals for objectives 4.1. and 4,210, but also for the local
authorities or NGOs that will be involved, in the future, in the actual writing of projects . Local
authorities and NGOs engaged in interventions targeted to such areas have the practical experience

group do not go to school and are at most graduates of primary education, this percentage, in the marginalised
communities with a Roma population of above 40%, is of 65%’. (Teșliuc, E., Grigoraș, V., Stănculescu, M.S. (coord.)
(2015b), page 332).
6 Mainly the European Social Fund (ESF), the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the Cohesion Fund (CF)

and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).
7 Upon the preparation of the Guidebook, the first round of Calls for Proposals under objectives 4.1. and 4.2. had

already been closed (the Guide for Applicants was prepared, the applicants’ projects had already been submitted into
the system, and the Managing Authority staff was about to engage in project evaluation).
8 This Guidebook was accompanied by two training sessions for the team of evaluators (approximately 100 persons

attending the first session and 70 the second session) and accompanied by help-desk services supporting the
analyses of marginalised communities during the 6-month contractual period.
9This Guidebook shall be construed as a source of reference, of non-mandatory nature, and shall be treated as a

document meant to complement the HCOP standards and guidelines underpinning the implementation of EU policies
and Romanian regulations.
10 The specific information pertaining to the Calls for Proposals that were already launched, and which are not

applicable also to other situations, will be specifically marked within the Guidebook in blue boxes (for example:
definition of the intervention area, criteria used for needs or methodology assessment or the validation of the
marginalised community by using Table 1 in the Guide for Applicants).
                                                                             This is a translation from Romanian

                                                                                                 Page 10 of 220
required to work with these communities, but they do not have – at all times – the necessary technical
information needed to develop the methodology for data collection and analysis necessary for mapping
the problems faced by the marginalised communities where they want to intervene. Therefore, the
Guidebook was developed so as to provide instruments for future Calls for Proposals, irrespective of
whether the projects are financed from European funds or other sources. Furthermore, the Guidebook
may represent a useful reference instrument even for the stakeholders possessing specialised knowledge
in social research, as it allows for a significant reduction of financial and time resources required for the
development of research instruments dedicated to marginalised areas, while also allowing for the
validation of the applied methodology.
However, it must be emphasized that the information covered by the Guidebook is highly specialized, and
technical, even if it may appear to be simple because it implies also activities that are often carried out by
the applicants, such as the meetings or public gatherings with beneficiaries, the understanding of the
needs of the communities, interviews with stakeholders, analysis of indicators, etc. However, the analysis
of marginalized communities, as it was proposed in the Applicant’s’ Guide for Specific Objectives 4.1. and
4.2., requires a systematic approach for data collection, analysis, and reporting both for validating the
marginalized community and for understanding its needs and solutions for them. Therefore, if a similar
approach is embraced for future calls, it is recommended the Guidebook to be complemented by specific
support to applicants such as training sessions, and hands-on technical assistance.
The Guidebook starts with a justification as to the need to conduct analyses on the marginalised areas
and with an overview onto the methods that can be used for this purpose (Chapter 1). The document
continues with the presentation of the methodology used for the identification of urban and rural
marginalised areas, followed by a description of the typology of these areas and of the specific problems
faced by each type of area (Chapter 2). Chapter 3 includes recommendations on the research
methodology required to validate the marginalised areas, where the identification thereof needs to be
conducted at present (either because the areas show a different profile compared to the one identified
during the 2011 census, or on account of the fact that the areas are not perfectly overlapping the census
sectors identified as marginalised in the two Atlases). As each community presents its own specific
characteristics (both in terms of needs, and in terms of possible solutions to those needs), the Guidebook
describes the types of quantitative and qualitative data and the participatory methods that can be used
for the mapping of those problems and solutions (Chapter 4). Chapter 5 describes the issue of segregated
marginalised communities and proposes specific interventions in such areas, while also signalling to
potential stakeholders (applicants and evaluators) the possible slippages that could lead to a deepened
segregation. Chapter 6 presents the approach that can be used to identify Roma communities and their
specific features (including in terms of solutions). Chapter 7 underlines the importance attached to impact
evaluations of such interventions and the importance of ensuring project sustainability after the end of
financing. The Annexes comprise a wide range of instruments templates that can be used by future
applicants for a better understanding of problems faced by marginalised communities and of solutions.

1. Why is the analysis of marginalized community necessary?
Each community has its own particularity – or even particularities – of marginalization, discrimination,
exclusion, etc. An intervention project can only be efficient if it takes into account the local context and
particular needs of the community and target group, and if it relies on consultations with the population
in order to reach the final solutions. Therefore, introducing this condition for projects targeted at
marginalized communities is aimed at guaranteeing a participative knowledge as detailed as possible of
the beneficiary population. This helps to avoid not only the mere application of successful projects from
other areas or sectors, but also to projects driven by the intention to help a disadvantaged population
without an appropriate justification.
Carrying out an analysis of the marginalized community for the justification of the project necessity and
the proposed solutions:
o     Forces the applicants to connect more deeply with the communities, groups and individuals and know
      their needs, problems and expectations “live”;
o     Allows the communities to become familiar with the project and its operators;
o     Facilitates communication (applicants and beneficiaries come to “speak the same language”), thus
      increasing the chances for better trust and cooperation in the future.

1.1. Why is attention focused on the participative approach?
A participative approach is a “process whereby people, in particular disadvantaged people, may exercise
their influence on the issuance of policies, design of alternatives and versions, for the performance of
investments, management and monitoring of interventions conducted with a view to developing the
communities”11. The express requirement for a participative approach in the analysis of the community
thus takes into account engaging the community both in the process of learning the needs, and in the
decision-making process, of finding solutions. Such participation is meant to avoid the occurrence of
abstract, general solutions or solutions which “have worked elsewhere”, thus compelling the applicant to
validate the results and solutions proposed through systematic consultations with the potential and actual
beneficiaries of the project. Furthermore, through the consultations with the population with regards to
the proposed solutions, the risk of involuntary effects of community (re)segregation is decreased (see
Section 5. Segregation of marginalized communities).
At the same time, community participation is a method of “empowerment”, of assuming liability and
increasing the involvement of the community and direct beneficiaries. From the same perspective,
community participation represents the method of raising the awareness on responsibilities, the
distribution of roles and obstacles to be surmounted in the implementation of the project. That is why it is
important to insist, during the consultations with the community, on the perceived role of various social
actors (Government, town hall, church, services, etc.), but also of the community and/or certain of its
members in settling the problems/needs of the target group. In brief, introducing the condition of a
participative approach is aimed at guaranteeing a partnership with the targeted community, partnership
that is deemed mandatory for the success of such a project.

1.2. How is the analysis performed at the level of the marginalized
community?
The analysis of the envisaged community shall address the following three categories of requirements:
o      Requirements of identification and validation, proving that the target group falls in the category of
       marginalized communities, in accordance with the terms and criteria set out in the financing program;
o      Requirements of social knowledge, through various and optional methods of statistical and on site
       research, providing a detailed and thorough description of the level, fields and factors of
       marginalization/discrimination existing at local level and the particular needs of the (intended)
       community;
o      Requirements of community participation, ensuring information of the community on the outcome
       of research, expected solutions and to receive feedback from the members of the community, both as
       regards the identified needs, and in respect of expected solutions.
       At the same time, community participation shall also be a method to increase the responsibility and
       involvement of direct beneficiaries. In that regard, the applicant may use the following research
       instruments and methods:

o      Support instruments. The applicants may choose between two basic instruments designed by the
       World Bank: the Atlas of Marginalized Rural Areas and Local Human Development in Romania and the
       Atlas of Marginalized Urban Areas and Local Human Development in Romania . These allow a
       preliminary identification of marginalized areas and may provide reference data in the cases where
       the selected marginalized community is contained in the data base of the atlases;
o      Instruments for validating the marginalized community. In order to comply with the criteria for
       validation of the marginalized community, the applicants can consult the list of indicators used for the
       identification of marginalized areas. In order to test if a community is marginalized or not, the
       applicants can apply the recommended research methodology and one of the questionnaires
       proposed among the annexes (Annex 6, Annex 7 and Annex 8).
o      Secondary data analysis. Applicants may use the existing statistical and administrative data (census,
       records of the administrative and territorial unit, available investigations, etc.) in order to obtain a
       series of necessary information on the targeted community. However, it shall be corroborated and, if
       necessary, verified through new research, because not all is complete, up to date or valid;
o      Quantitative, qualitative and participative research methods. Applicants should conduct an on-
       site survey in the form that they choose. The selection of research instruments depends, in the first
       stage, on the existing reference data. Thus, for instance, the target group (analysis unit) may be found
       in full or not in one of the atlases, in the census data or in the records of the town hall. Depending on
       the above, the applicant may use or not a poll, or shall have to conduct or not a “census”12.
       Furthermore, the applicant should opt for the quantitative and qualitative analysis variants and for
       their manner of combination in such a way that they achieve an image as comprehensive and
       integrating as possible of the situation and of the problems facing the marginalized community,
       however, without unnecessarily doubling the quantitative data with the qualitative data. The selection
       of such corresponding methods and instruments also depends on the size and specificity of the

     community, accessibility of informants, etc. so that the applicant may set out from a minimal
     preliminary knowledge, through observation participation, of that community.
     In addition to the information acquired further to the secondary analysis of data, applicants should
     generate their own information, by using the following:

o    Quantitative methods (for example, a poll), to provide statistically representative data for the target
     groups (observance of questionnaire design, sampling and statistical data processing rules); the use of
     a questionnaire on “some” people in the community, randomly, is not representative and therefore
     shall have no value on the analysis of the community;
o    Qualitative methods (for instance interview, focus group, participative observation), which does not
     provide statistically representative data on all of the community, but adds to the information on the
     community by a series of significant elements concerning values and practices, individual to or shared
     by it, deep motivations and expectations of individuals or groups, etc. ;
o    Participative methods, referring to various forms of involving the community (consultations,
     brainstorming, debate forum, etc.). Their main purpose is to provide useful feedback on the validity
     and realism of the solutions taken into account by the applicant.
     In brief, the applicant should follow the steps below addressing the following key issues:

o    Know the criteria for identifying marginalized areas to be used in the financing program.
o    Identify and validate the marginalized community: Is it really “marginalized” in accordance with
     existing regulations and those adopted in the financing program? Which is the evidence submitted in
     this respect?
o    Organize the existing data: What is already known (atlases, census, town hall data, data from other
     researches etc.)? Is this sufficient? Is the data valid?
o    Establishing the research design and collecting data for the needs analysis: how can the missing
     necessary information be collected, through the appropriate use of quantitative and qualitative
     research methods.
o    Elaborate and validate solutions, mainly by using participative methods.
     Consequently, the analysis of marginalized community shall include, for the identification of genuine
     needs of the marginalized community, the informed substantiation of the intervention action
     proposed by the applicant. Certain elements to be considered are also the eligibility criteria13; the
     quality of the analysis as a whole is a key criterion in project assessment, guaranteeing the relevance,
     appropriateness and feasibility of the intervention proposed in the applicant’s project.

Annex B represent compulsory eligibility criteria.

1.3. How to best use the Guidebook
The Guidebook has been written with two types of beneficiaries in mind: on the one hand, (i) the
applicants to projects from EU funds and other stakeholders interested in finding out the challenges of
specific marginalized communities and identifying solutions, and on the other hand, (ii) the evaluators of
the project proposals that include analyses of marginalized communities, in particular the evaluators of
the projects to be financed from HCOP, specific objectives 4.1. and 4.2. (the Guidebook was designed to
answer the specific questions regarding the Projects’ Call launched in 2016, but it can be adjusted and
applied to other calls as well). Below are listed the steps that each of these actors need to take in meeting
their specific objectives, as well as the chapters from the guide that describe how these steps could be
achieved.

2. Defining marginalized areas
There is a wide variety of disadvantaged urban and rural areas. Some of them are disadvantaged based on
the size of infrastructure or habitation, however the population in such areas is not subject to human
capital or employment level significantly different from the population in other areas. Examples in that
respect are old house neighborhoods in towns (districts of poor quality blocks built in the 60s or 70s and
predominantly occupied by retired persons) or emerging areas located in the suburbs of towns, where the
town hall has given under concession land plots with houses to people selected in reliance upon a set of
criteria (Law 15/2003) and which were not yet connected to utilities (Figure 1 A2). Other areas, such as
most villages in towns14, are disadvantaged both in respect of infrastructure and of access to services
(Figure 1 A1) however, human capital and the level of employment for residents do not significantly differ
from those of other inhabitants. A series of other areas are disadvantaged based on the size of
employment, but not on the size of habitation or human capital. This is the case of several small mono-
industrial towns in which the factory hiring most of the population was closed and only small companies
were developed (in general, trade).
Various criteria may be determined to define and classify all these types of disadvantaged areas. An
analysis15 of existing studies in connection with the “poor communities”, “segregated communities” and
„the marginalized communities” in Romania has revealed that almost all studies, irrespective of the
research method used,16 point to three main criteria in defining and analyzing the various types of
disadvantaged, or marginalized areas, in particular: (1) human capital (usually, education, health condition,
size and components of the household), (2) formal employment degree of manpower and (3) housing
conditions. Starting from these three main criteria, in 2014-2015, the World Bank has developed a new
methodology (combining quantitative and qualitative research methods) to identify the marginalized
areas both in urban and rural areas.
This Guidebook refers to marginalized areas consisting of territorial poverty concentrations and differing
from disadvantaged areas (Table 1, below). According to the World Bank’s methodology, both in urban
and rural areas, “marginalized areas” are defined as areas inside the communities (communes, towns and
municipalities) that do not meet an appropriate standard in any of the three criteria, in particular human
capital shortage, low level of formal employment and providing precarious housing conditions (please see
Figures 1 B1 and B2 below). On the contrary, “disadvantaged areas” are, by definition, areas inside the
localities, which do not reach the appropriate standard in one or two of the three envisaged criteria.




14 Only 81 towns (out of the 320 in Romania) do not include villages. On the other hand, 88% of small towns recently
declared (between 2002 and 2006), 80% of the other small towns and 62% of average-sized towns include between 1
and 21 villages. There are, for instance, small towns in the mountains, where villages are scattered over a radius of
more than 10 km from the town center. Many small towns have small populations and are marked on the map as
agglomeration of distant settlements, with poor road connection among them. (Teșliuc, Grigoraș and Stănculescu,
coord., 2015: 308-315).
15 Swinkels et al., 2014

16 Most studies referred to the rural environment and estimated that “community poverty” and/or the “community

deprivation” at the level of administrative unit (most often, at the level of a commune). A very low number of studies
looked into marginalization in urban areas, at the level of sub-locality (neighborhood, area etc.), and most of them
have been performed by means of qualitative research.

have been taken into account. Although, theoretically speaking, several combinations of criteria would be possible,
the analysis of census data and on-line studies have revealed that only the combinations in the table above are typical
for the Romanian urban areas.

Marginalized areas refer to extreme poverty17 (multidimensional) and not to relative poverty (insufficient
revenues/consumption). World Bank studies on marginalized areas, conducted in 2014-2015, have
reconfirmed the research18 conducted in Romania since 1990, revealing that extreme poverty is not
merely an individual or family phenomenon, but a geographical one, as it usually focuses on marginalized
areas, both rural and urban, where extreme poverty goes from one generation to the next.
Thus, urban and rural marginalized areas are deemed “problematic” from the perspective of social policies
and actions, precisely because they share the following features:19
o Statistical overrepresentation of large households,20 with many children,21 and also single-parent
    families (in particular single mothers, including underage mothers);



17   Extremely poor families often face various other constraints, in addition to pecuniary poverty, including long-term
unemployment among adults and no jobs, inappropriate food for children, high risk of child neglect or child abuse
(associate with abuse of alcohol by parents), with inappropriate behavior in children education, with single-parent or
extremely young families, unstable marriages, poor health condition or disabilities, low school attendance or school
dropout, inappropriate housing or absence of shelter, domestic violence, misdemeanor and discrimination. There are
also issues related to the low level of expectations and self-esteem and acquired helplessness. Families facing extreme
poverty are, therefore, a major challenge, not only in respect of skills and physical capital, but also in relation to
psychological disorders.

o    Low level of education among adults and weight much above average of school children who do
                                               22

     not attend school (never enrolled in the education system or who have abandoned school/left school
     early), in particular as regards children older than 14 and Roma children;
o    Weight above average of adults who are neither employed, not enrolled in any form of education or
     training, in particular women and Roma; 23
o    Statistical overrepresentation of persons who self-identify as Roma. There is a large variety as regards
     the weight of Roma in marginalized areas, among virtually 0% and 100% of the residents. At any rate,
     the average weight of persons who self-identify as Roma in the overall population is approximately
     21% in marginalized urban areas, in particular 27% in marginalized rural areas. Given that certain
     Roma individuals are reluctant to declare their ethnicity, it is expected that the weight of Roma in
     these areas is, in fact, higher. According to the national study on Roma population,24 conducted by
     the Life Quality Research Institute in 1998, the ratio between hetero-identification and self-
     identification, in the case of Roma, is as follows: for each 100 persons hetero-identified by the
     authorities as Roma, 56 in urban areas and 64 in rural areas self-identify as Roma. Therefore, by
     applying this hetero-identification- self-identification ratio, it follows that the weight of persons
     hetero-identified as Roma would increase up to approximately 37% in marginalized urban areas and
     to 42% in marginalized rural areas;
o    A large ratio of houses in the area are made of cheap construction materials (for instance, adobe,
     wood, plastic and other non-traditional materials) and are poorly equipped with urban utilities: they
     are not connected to the water supply,25 are not connected to sewerage, do not have electricity.26 In
     addition, in urban areas, a large part of the houses are not owned by the inhabitants,27 a ratio almost
     three times higher than the urban average at national level;




20 In marginalized urban areas, the average size of a household is 3.2 people, as compared to the national average at
urban level of 2.53 people, and the average number of children per household is 1.0 in marginalized areas, as
compared to only 0.37 in non-disadvantaged areas (and 0.44 the national average at urban level). In marginalized
rural areas, one household out of four contains at least five members, as compared to only 15% in non-marginalized
areas, while 16% of the households have three children, as compared to only 5% in non-marginalized areas.
21 As a result, the average percentage of children (0-17 years of age) out of the total population is more than 31% in

marginalized urban areas, and respectively 34% in marginalized rural areas (as compared to a national average of
approximately 22%). Corresponding percentages of elderly aged over 65 account for merely 4%, and respectively
13%.
22 In marginalized urban areas, almost half of adult inhabitants (+18) have graduated eight grades or less. In

marginalized rural areas, approximately 80% of the adults have graduated no more than eight grades, and among
them 35% only primary school.
23 The percentage of employed individuals out of population aged between 20 and 64 reaches almost 63% at the

national level in the urban environment, but drops to approximately 48% in marginalized urban areas and even
further, down to 35%, among women, respectively 31% for Roma in such communities. For the same indicator, the
national average in the rural environment is merely 36% and drops down to 12% in marginalized rural areas,
respectively no more than 5% among Roma women in such communities.
24 Zamfir and Preda (coord.). 2002.

25 In marginalized urban areas, 30% of houses are not connected to water supply (as compared to 6.3% national

urban). In the rural environment, 72% of houses are not connected to running water in marginalized areas, with the
percentage increasing up to 88% among Roma in such areas (as compared to 38% national rural).
26 In marginalized urban areas, more than 4% of the houses do not have electricity (as compared to 0.4% at the

national urban level). In marginalized rural areas, 5% of the houses do not have electricity, the percentage increasing
up to 10% among Roma in such areas (as compared to 1% national rural).

o      Low access to services by residents, more often than not the area is described by the local population
       as an “infection center” ignored by health experts, and a large number of the children in the area are
       forced to attend segregated schools, where only poor families enroll their children;
o      A high probability to be source communities for the special children protection system, because they
       deliver in the system significantly more children than other areas;28
o      Communities marked by fear, domestic violence, small crimes and stigma from the local population,
       thus further reducing the residents’ chances to get rid of poverty.


 Box 3. Living conditions in marginalized rural areas
 Almost half of the marginalized rural areas are Roma communities, usually referred to a gipsy town,
 shanty town or slum (mahala). The other half of marginalized rural areas largely consists of local people
 communities who used to work in a factory in a nearby town. Given that factories were closed, they have
 become unemployed, have become poor and started to work in agriculture. Most of the times, these
 communities are named after the village or another geographic element, such as a valley, river meadow,
 forest and others.
 Marginalized areas are in general, inhabited by stable communities living in the same community since
 before 1990. Less than 10% of marginalized rural areas were formed after 1990 or are emerging.
 Most marginalized communities comprise of young families with children, earning their living from
 agriculture, day work and social benefits, in particular children allowance and minimum guaranteed
 wages or pensions for agricultural workers.
 In almost half of the marginalized rural areas under review, there are minor thefts, disturbance, disputes,
 fights, scandals, domestic violence and some kind of disorder generated by the large number of children
 and lack of fences.
 Almost all houses in marginalized areas are made of adobe or are improvised shelters, mostly
 deteriorated and which need repairing. In approximately half of the marginalized areas, there are reports
 of ownership document problems (for land or for the houses), 10% of the inhabitants do not possess ID
 documents.
 In certain areas, access to drinking water is an issue. Waste collection services are very rare. Floods and
 landslides seem to be extremely frequent.
 Nevertheless, in most marginalized rural areas, the main problem identified by local sources is by far the
 insufficient work places. This derives from the low level of adult education and from the low attendance
 of children in school, from the lack of revenues and lack of infrastructure, in particular roads and water
 supply.

2.1. Identifying marginalized areas
Methodologies developed so far in identifying marginalized areas vary significantly, beyond the three
main criteria - human capital, employment and housing. Differences refer to the data used, level of
analysis, selected indicators and aggregation method. This Guidebook refers to the latest methodology,
developed by the World Bank in 2014-2015 and applied in the Atlas of Marginalized Urban Areas 29 and in
the Atlas of Marginalized Rural Areas.30
The two atlases provide a data base necessary for making well-grounded decisions and for public policy
and actions addressing urban and rural communities with the most stringent shortcomings in Romania, so
that interventions at community level, created with a view to mitigate poverty and social exclusion, are as
efficient as possible. Thus, the atlases are instruments for targeting certain areas, monitoring and
assessing anti-poverty programs and interventions and promoting social inclusion, at national, (micro-)
regional, county, and local level. Since marginalization is defined not only in terms of poor revenues, but
in particular depending on the human capital (education and health), employment and housing
conditions, the usefulness of the atlases extends to also cover programs relating to education, health,
infrastructure and social houses, such as early school leaving , primary healthcare services, family planning,
parental education, domestic violence and other risks / vulnerabilities spread among the marginalized
communities.
Both in urban and rural areas, the methodology of the World Bank has relied on the Census of population
and households of 2011. In order to reach the smallest sub-locality territorial units, the chosen level was
the census sector (map) containing, as a matter of rule, approximately 200 people, but it may be smaller in
rural areas. Therefore, for the purpose of the analysis, micro-data of the 2011 census aggregated at the
level of census sector have been used.
It is important to highlight that the data at sub-locality level should be interpreted carefully, because the
overlap between the actual marginalized communities and census sectors usually is only partial. In other
words, an actual marginalized community may consist of only a part of a census sector or may cover two
or more census sectors (meaning marginalized areas identified in the two atlases). Consequently, the
features of an actual marginalized community may not always be analyzed at the level of census sector.
The figure below illustrates several typical examples for this situation. Example 1 illustrates the case where
a large community covers several census sectors. Example 2 describes a situation where a community
covers parts of two or several census sectors. Example 3 corresponds to a situation where a small
community is included in a census sector, together with other population groups. And, finally, example 4
describes a community located at the outskirts of the town (for instance, improvised shelters, located near
landfills), partially on intra muros land, and partially on extra muros land. Census data is not the most
appropriate to identify situations similar to this last example. In such areas, certain inhabitants did not
provide answers to the census, and those who did were distributed in the existing census sectors, located
nearby. Therefore, by using aggregated data at the level of census sector, only a part of this type of
communities may be identified or reconstituted.

Furthermore, in the rural environment, the validation study 31 of the marginalized areas identified on the
basis of census data has revealed that precisely because census sectors are not “natural" communities,
local authorities and local leaders face challenges in separating them in the territory. Certain local
authorities no longer possess the local maps created for the census 2011. In other communes, census
sectors determined in 2011 did not comply with a territorial unit, but were made up of groups of
households scattered in several parts of the village, as indicated in Figure 3. The situation is simpler only


31The World Bank team has conducted an extensive validation study, relying on a combination of several qualitative
methods. On-site research was conducted in May-June 2015, in two counties, Călărași and Vaslui. The sample
consisted of 68 communes gathering 232 villages and respectively 1123 census sectors, out of which, in theory, 82 are
marginalized rural areas. The validation study revealed that: (a) Inclusion errors account for 11% in all theoretically
marginalized rural areas subject to test, when the assessment was made by local sources and 26% when it was made
by the research team; (b) Exclusion errors account for 2% of all theoretically non-marginalized areas. Teșliuc, Grigoraș
and Stănculescu (coord.) (2015).

when the census sectors overlap the villages (however, in most cases, a village contains two or more
census sectors).
The key indicators used for the three main criteria defining the marginalized areas have been determined
in reliance upon the relevant literature and empirical analysis of census data.32
Thus a set of key indicators resulted, including both common indicators, and indicators specific to urban
and rural areas, as shown in Table 2 below. Overall, 7 indicators have been selected: 3 indicators for
human capital (1 common indicator for urban and rural areas and 2 indicators specific to urban areas); 1
indicator for formal employment which is common for urban and rural areas; and 3 indicators for housing
conditions (1 common indicator and 2 indicators specific to each of the two residential areas).
Both for urban and rural areas, by definition, marginalized areas refer to census sectors which cumulate
disadvantages in all of the three criteria. In order to determine the “disadvantaged” sectors, first of all, the
value of each of the key indicators was calculated for each census sector, in urban, respectively rural areas.
In the second stage, a national urban/ rural threshold was determined for each key indicator. By using the
common indicators, major discrepancies are revealed between urban and rural areas.33 For instance, the
20% value registered between the sectors with the highest percentage of population aged 15-64 having
graduated no more than 8 grades is above the 22.1% threshold, while the most disadvantaged communes
in that respect account for more than 59.3%. In the third stage, for each of the census sector, it was
determined whether the value exceeded the threshold per indicator and the residential environment. In
the fourth stage, it was determined for each census sector whether it is or not “disadvantaged” for each of
the three criteria, by using the algorithm described herein below:

                 used indicator has values exceeding the               used indicator has values exceeding the

32 Further details on the selection of key indicators are available in Annex 4 of the Atlas of Marginalized Urban Areas
(Swinkels et al., 2014).
33 The analyses tested thresholds at the 70th, 80th and 90th percentile for each of the key indicators. The final decision

took into account the most appropriate result, indicating a percentage of the overall population in marginalized areas
that was neither too small, nor too large, in such a manner as to identify the most disadvantaged communities and
simultaneously allow a strong and sustainable public intervention in such areas. In urban areas, the threshold was
determined as the 80th percentile for all criteria, while, in rural areas, the threshold was set as the 80th percentile for
the criteria concerning human capital and employment and the 90th percentile for the criteria concerning housing.

In the last stage, any census sector qualified as “disadvantaged” in all of the three criteria – with a low
level of human capital, with a low level of employment in the formal sector and with inappropriate
housing – was deemed a marginalized (urban or rural) area.

When we look at the distribution of the communities and their coverage at national level, we observe that:
o    As a whole, in the towns and municipalities of Romania, 1,139 census sectors34 fall under the criteria
     determined for marginalized areas, being located in 264 towns and in Bucharest. In these areas, there
     are 342,933 inhabitants. At the national level, 3.2% of urban population, 2.6% of households in urban
     areas and 2.5% of houses in urban areas are located in marginalized areas (census sectors).
o    In total, in the communes in Romania, 2,244 census sectors35 have met the criteria to be deemed as
     marginalized rural areas, and there are more than 564,000 inhabitants living in them. At the national
     level, 6.2% of the rural population, 5.3% of all rural households and 5.2% of all rural houses are
     located in marginalized areas (census sectors).
The Atlas of Marginalized Urban Areas and the Atlas of Marginalized Rural Areas contain a list of localities
with marginalized areas (census sectors). The urban Atlas contains information on the towns/
municipalities with marginalized areas and the percentage of people in these areas. The rural Atlas
contains a list of villages with marginalized areas, a range for the estimated number of people in the
marginalized census sectors and an indication of whether communities have at least 20% Roma or not (as
per the census data).

2.2. Types of marginalized areas

2.2.1. Types of marginalized urban areas

The Atlas of Marginalized Urban Areas36 identifies four main types of marginalized areas which may be
found in all types of towns, be they small, average or large, in all counties and regions of the country.37
These four main types of marginalized urban areas are described below.



34 Out of all 50,299 census sectors in the urban areas, in the census conducted in 2011.
35 Out of the 46,547 census sectors in the areas registered for the 2011 census, 2,523 sectors were not included in the
analysis, because they have fewer than 50 inhabitants (2,473), or because there were no sectors with households.
36 Swinkels et al. (2014).
37 In 56 towns, no marginalized areas have been identified, out of which only one with 20,000 inhabitants and more.

To the other extreme, in five towns, more than one third (up to 47%) of the population lives in such areas. These
towns are: Aninoasa (Hunedoara), Podu Iloaiei (county of Iași), Budești (county of Călărași), Băneasa (county of
Constanța) and Ștefănești (county of Botoșani). In 14 towns, the residents of marginalized areas account for between
20% and 31% of the overall population, and in 50 of the towns, the percentage reaches 10-19% of the entire
population. In the other towns and municipalities, the rate of residents in marginalized areas is below 10%.

2.2.1.1. Ghetto type areas or former workers’ colonies
In Romania, ghetto type areas refer to low quality blocks of flats (comfort level III or IV), built before 1990
for the workers of large socialist factories. More often than not, these are small or average areas (150-500
inhabitants), consisting of one– two buildings that look bleak. The main issues found here are the massive
over-crowdedness, exercising major pressure on shared installations, and debts to utilities providers
(electricity, water, sewerage and garbage collection).
The apartments in ghetto type areas usually consist of only one room, 9-15 square meters,38 over-
furnished and including big families with many children. In general, these small rooms act as bathroom,
dining room, office and kitchen for large households, with up to 11 members. Nevertheless, inside, many
of them are well organized and clean. Bathrooms may be shared (one per floor) or individual. Common
areas and installations (electricity, sewerage, water, etc.) are old, deteriorated and/or unsanitary. Utilities
are either absent, or disconnected because of unpaid bills.
In ghetto type areas, ownership status over houses and/or agreements concluded with utilities companies
may take various forms. In certain areas, the inhabitants are the house owners and have agreements with
the utilities concluded in their own name. However, in others, the inhabitants are the owners of the rooms
where they live, but have a common utilities agreement, or the rooms are leased from the town hall, but
utilities agreements are individual, both the apartments, and the utilities agreements are owned by the
town hall or another public institution (such as the county council).

Some ghettos are located in former workers’ colonies. In such cases, living conditions and access to
infrastructure are even more challenging. Houses are often falling apart, with ruined walls, cracked roofs


38In   rare cases, rooms may have a surface area of approximately 30 square meters.
                                                                             This is a translation from Romanian

                                                                                                 Page 27 of 220
and infiltration when it rains. The extremely inappropriate living conditions (moisture, mold, cold, dirt,
pests) endanger the health of most inhabitants in the area. Consequently, this entails risks in relation to
the health of inhabitants (please see Figure 4 above). Nevertheless, local authorities rent such buildings to
poor families as social houses. The infrastructure is almost inexistent. In the example in the photo, it may
be noticed the only infrastructure available in the area, in particular a water pump acting as the only water
source for the entire neighborhood. Cost of water is covered by the town hall, but, having regard to the
high consumption, the representatives of town hall declare that the water bill is a burden for the local
budget.
The inhabitants in ghetto type areas are facing three major challenges: (1) payment of utilities (electricity,
water, sewerage and sanitation), (2) constant fear of eviction or losing their house because of arrears and
(3) insufficiently developed support networks and bad reputation of the area (low social capital). Ghetto
type communities are split between owners and tenants, between “the bad” and “the good”, between self-
proclaimed leaders making the law of the fist and the “weak”. They are characterized by low self-esteem,
mistrust in other people and in (public or private) institutions. These communities are predominantly
characterized by helplessness, increased by the permanent shame of living in a bad reputation area and
associated to a strong sentiment of disdain and discrimination by most population. Many inhabitants of
ghetto type areas do not disclose their address precisely in order to gain respect.

2.2.1.2. Slum type areas with improvised houses and/ or shelters
Usually, these are old neighborhoods, at the outskirts, which have extended after 1990, with extremely
poor communities (Roma, but not exclusively). Thus, in addition to poor quality houses (made of adobe),
many improvised cottages and/or shelters have been built (made of plastic and cardboard with any kind
of wooden structure) either in the yards of old houses, or on the public domain in the close vicinity of the
neighborhood.
Although the houses and the shelters are usually very small, with a surface area ranging between 6 and 40
square meters, they are inhabited by big families, with many children. Houses are located in disarray, one
next to another, with very little distance between them. This type of area is usually found near a river or
dismantled railways. Not all slum areas are adjoining old neighborhoods. Some of them have been built at
the beginning of the 1990s by people in the area who had lost their apartments because of overdue
payments to utility providers.
                                                                               This is a translation from Romanian

                                                                                                   Page 28 of 220

In slum type areas, the community is scattered over a wide territory, which makes it even harder to settle
their problems. In certain slum areas, there is virtually no trace of infrastructure (at best, a tap that
provides the required water for the entire area), and in others, there is infrastructure on the main area,
however, not available in the rest of the area (not even electricity). Consequently, many of these areas are
insanitary and face climate risks, such as rainfall or floods. Because of the poor quality of construction
materials and the proximity between houses (which are attached to one another), a fire as small as it may
be, broke out in one house could cause damages to other tens of houses in the area.
The main challenges for these areas, in addition to extreme poverty and squalid living conditions, consist
of the lack of identification and ownership documents. The issue of identification documents was settled
in most areas, as stated by local authorities. However, there are still areas, in particular those of
improvised shelters, in connection with which not even the number of inhabitants is known. Therefore,
such areas are in fact at least partially “invisible” (in administrative terms) insofar as the inhabitants in the
area do not claim welfare. Consequently, the inhabitants are talking of human trafficking and prostitution,
claiming that they are at the mercy of strong leaders of opposing gangs acting in the area. Certain slum
areas are quiet, in particular old neighborhoods, while other are quite unsafe and dangerous, may people
being virtually “slaves” to informal leaders.
The issue of ownership documents over the land is common for all slum type areas. In old neighborhoods,
people have inherited the houses from parents or grandparents, but do not hold legal documents over
                                                                              This is a translation from Romanian

                                                                                                  Page 29 of 220
the land. Their children have built a cottage as appendix or in the garden of the old house without,
however, holding ownership documents, in their turn.
Much more complicated is the situation of people living in plastic and cardboard shelters, located on
public domain. This is a major legal challenge even in the opinion of institutional representatives. The law
does not allow municipalities to confer the status of owners and the legal right to use the public domain.
The issue may only be settled by means of the domestic law, in particular a framework allowing the
mayors to resort to that option.
Usually, in the slum type areas, there are several leaders fighting for supremacy. These communities are
highly segmented in more or less segregated groups, each with their own leaders. The law of the fist is
very prevalent. In addition, owners of small shops, selling on credit and having their entire community in
their book, hold significant influence in these communities.
Participative actions are difficult to organize in slum type areas. The main issues that should be resolved
require either huge investments (in infrastructure and town planning, for instance), or a nation-wide
approach, such as the legal matters pertaining to land ownership. The issue of low school attendance or
school dropout by children should become a national priority and needs to be addressed, in cooperation,
by the town hall, local schools, Roma leaders, Roma experts, education experts and the organizations of
civil society. Therefore, such average to large communities, with significant fluctuating population and
extending trends, require a national frame, well-coordinated local actions for the average and long term,
the involvement of many local actors who are well aware of this situation, as well as considerable budgets.

2.2.1.3. Areas of upgraded social houses
The areas of upgraded social houses were created through integrated projects, combining social actions
with extended investments in new real estate and infrastructure. This type of areas benefits from good
infrastructure (sometimes, even better than in other areas of the corresponding towns), however, they are
only inhabited by poor people, with difficult social circumstances. Consequently, the payment of utilities is
still a major challenge for these poor inhabitants. It does not suffice for social houses to be modern and
equipped with utilities, but they need to be affordable. Rehabilitation of buildings and the provision of all
utilities to destitute population are sustainable interventions only where there is a mechanism in place
able to ensure affordability for such housing. When the monthly bill for only one utility (usually, electricity)
exceeds the family income, then the investment is not at all sustainable because the inhabitants cannot
afford the house maintenance costs. In fact, the areas of upgraded social houses reveal a major risk
associated to integrated projects, in particular further segregation by upgrading the infrastructure. When
these types of houses are located outside the borders of the town, closer to a neighboring village than to
the town in which the citizens lived and were raised, under dangerous environmental conditions, and the
relocation of population took place without appropriate information and permanent consultation,
negative effects could ensue, such as deeper segregation.
                                                                            This is a translation from Romanian

                                                                                                Page 30 of 220

Upgraded social houses shall comply with all technical regulations in terms of size and infrastructure, but
should also pay attention to the following issues: (1) geographical location at the level of urban territory,
(2) information and consultation before relocation and (3) ethnic component of relocated population. If
the area of social houses is located in a territory disconnected from the vital tissue of the town, far from
employment opportunities, and is inhabited by only one socio-economic and/or ethnic group, then the
area is segregated and has very low development potential, irrespective of how up to date such houses
may be. Segregation is exacerbated if the formation of the area results from imposed relocation.
Mention is to be made that, in many marginalized areas, residents declare that they live in permanent fear
that they will be relocated by the town hall, a concern expressed particularly by people living in
improvised shelters or social houses (either in ghettos, slum or upgraded houses). Roma, in particular, fear
that they would be relocated outside the town. Mayors of several town plan to remove “the areas of
poverty installed inside the town” and relocate the poor population, in particular Roma, to compact
building complexes, well-endowed and with pleasant appearance, somewhere outside the town, on a hill,
near an old factory, near a forest, in an old poultry farm and so on. However, such projects would only
further cleave the social isolation in which such people live (families with children) and not promote social
inclusion.

2.2.1.4. Historical (central) areas
The “historic center” or “historical areas” of towns/ municipalities are the forth type of marginalized urban
areas and refer to areas of individual houses, nationalized during the communist period, in an advanced
state of degradation which, after 1990, were used as social houses (or with social nature). Most of these
houses were given by local authorities to poor families, either before 1989, or at the beginning of the
1990s or, in the case of ruined buildings, they were illegally occupied by homeless. Thus, these
communities are the consequence of the housing policy adopted by the Communist party and of the local
authorities in post-Communist times. This refers to rather old neighborhoods, with people having lived in
the same house for more than 30-35 years, some of them were even born in that house.
Figure 8. Historic center type area

Except for the downtown position, the living conditions in these communities are much similar to those
existing in slum type areas. Given that these houses are located in areas that are appealing for investors,
with high real estate potential, the former owners (or their heirs) have tried their best to recover. Law No
10/2001 stipulates that these houses be retroceded to their old owners (or their heirs). The inhabitants
were allowed five years to find a new house, or were otherwise evicted. On the other hand, certain people
were allowed to continue to inhabit some of the ruined buildings, however without being given
identification documents placing them at such address (since the building is registered in administrative
books as ruined). There are therefore people who lived there for 10-15 years and only holding temporary
identification documents in which they appear to have “no domicile,” and in that case the individual at
issue may not find employment, is not entitled to health care or welfare and so on.
Unlike the other types of marginalized areas, the historical areas of towns are not inhabited by strong tied
communities, intense daily interactions or leaders. In exchange, in these areas, there are small cores of
neighbors to be treated individually when directly subject to intervention. In addition, the interventions to

the buildings in the area may require very high prices, given that they are classified as historical
monuments.

2.2.2. Types of marginalized rural areas

The Atlas of Marginalized Rural Areas39 identifies two main types of marginalized areas scattered
throughout all counties and regions of Romania.40 These two main types of marginalized rural areas are
described below.

2.2.2.1. Geographically isolated villages
This type of marginalized rural areas refers to villages containing predominantly Roma population,
isolated "beyond the hills" "down, in the valley, on the bank of the river" "beyond the forest". These
communities usually communicate with the rest of the world by a non-asphalt road, sometimes cobbled,
not practicable in the cold season. The situation is even more severe when, in addition to isolation, there
is also difficult or impossible access to fresh water.

Low attendance of school, early school leaving and dropout are major challenges in these isolated
communities. Absence or poor quality of roads results in reduced school attendance and poor school
results among children, as well as a high rate of dropout after the fourth grade. Even in the communes
where there is a school bus, in periods of bad weather, the service is no longer available for children in
marginalized communities.
Apart from the road connecting the area to other villages, inland roads are very narrow, and they do not
allow access for firefighters or ambulances. However, the image of the village as a whole is rather bucolic.
Poor, but well-organized households. Unpretentious houses, but white washed and clean yards. Simple
but well-kept fountains. The entire area has a rather agricultural nature. Many sheep and cows running
free, poultry, vegetables and fruit trees in every yard. Horses and carriages are the main means of

40 Marginalized rural areas may be found in 991 communes (or 35% of all communes in Romania), respectively in
1,605 villages (13% of all villages). Consequently, most communes/villages in Romania do not have marginalized
areas. On the other hand, in 157 communes (accounting for 5.5 % of all communes), more than one third of the
population lives in marginalized areas. As far as the villages are concerned, in 663 villages, more than half of the
inhabitants live in such areas.

                                                                                                         Page 33 of 220
transportation. Even small children drive the carriage, work the field or tend to animals. In many of these
areas, there is not even telephone coverage.

2.2.2.2. Suburbs of well-connected villages
These marginalized rural areas refer to areas located on the outskirts of villages well connected to the
village that is the center of the commune and/or to a national or European road.

These areas are usually characterized by local sources as Roma communities. Most of the times,
inhabitants are usually referring to themselves as “Roma”, “gypsies” or “rudars”. These areas are clearly
demarcated from the rest of the village. Usually, at the entry to a marginalized suburb area of this type,
the asphalt-coated road ends abruptly and is continued by a cobbled or earth road. As a general rule,
most of the existing infrastructure in the village only reaches up to the boundary and only to the main
road of these marginalized areas, but rarely to peoples’ houses. Some inhabitants are not interested in
using that infrastructure, while others cannot afford to or have been disconnected because of debts. For
instance, even in the villages with local running water network, most of the inhabitants in marginalized
areas carry water from a public fountain.
Although physical access to public services is good, they are seldom used. Youth drop out of or leave
school early, even if there is a school within a ten-minute walk. The lack of clothing, footwear and
appropriate school supplies is the main reason invoked by parents, followed by discrimination.
The general appearance is rather that of disarray, many houses with damaged roofs, no windows or doors,
no fences and a lot of more or less useful items scattered everywhere. There are carpets and blankets all
over the place. Children and adults stay in the street. Vegetable gardens and yard animals are rare. Dogs
and pigs wandering free are most of the animals. All villagers, not only the inhabitants of the marginalized
area, throw their garbage at the outskirts of the area.
Given that these areas are located in well-connected villages, the population has access to black market
employment and work as day laborers. Most of them gather scrape iron or plastic bottles or are ambulant
sellers. Furthermore, since the road to town is easily accessible, some of them commute to construction or
sanitation companies in town.

                                                                                                    Page 34 of 220
Key aspects to consider by project applicants and evaluators carrying out analyses of marginalized
communities
Applicants    Marginalized communities are territorial areas that are simultaneously                      highly
              disadvantaged in terms of housing, employment and human capital.
              The marginalization indicators are different in urban areas from rural areas. If an applicant
              needs to carry out their own research, they should compute the indicators specific to the
              area from which the community is*.
              In order to prove that an area is marginalized or not, the applicant should test whether the
              values for the marginalization indicators are higher in that community than the thresholds
              calculated at national level (at the 80th percentile).
              Each marginalized area has its own specificity, and it is important to understand the profile
              of each area in order to tailor the programs for it. Qualitative research show that, in urban
              areas the marginalized communities can be divided into: (i) ghetto type areas/former
              workers’ colonies, (ii) slum type areas with improvised houses and/or shelters, (iii) areas of
              upgraded social houses, and (iv) historical (central) areas; rural areas can be broadly
              divided into: (i) geographically isolated villages and (ii) suburbs of well-connected villages.
Evaluators    A territorial area is not marginalized unless it is deprived on the three dimensions
              (housing, employment, human capital) simultaneously: the values of the indicators specific
              to the residential area to which the community belongs (rural or urban) are higher than
              the thresholds listed in Table 2.
Note: * However, in the case of the Call for Proposals on the Specific Objectives 4.1. and 4.2., the indicators and
thresholds from urban areas were asked to validate both urban and rural marginalized communities.
                                                                                This is a translation from Romanian

                                                                                                    Page 35 of 220



3. Validation of marginalized communities
As indicated above, marginalized areas identified at the level of census sectors only partially overlap with
the specific marginalized communities. Territorial concentrations of extreme poverty may, in fact, be part
of a town/municipality neighborhood or part of a village and, in certain cases, may cover an entire
village.41 These, in turn, may fully or partially overlap with one or several census sectors, but rarely is the
overlap complete (please also see Figures 2 and 3).
Consequently, the mere comparison between the locality/village addressed in the project and the
localities/villages in which there are marginalized census sectors, as per the two Maps, does not
automatically validate the marginalized area. The comparison shall be conducted at the level of the
census sector (in reliance upon their delineation in accordance with census maps, made available by local
authorities or by the National Agency for Cadaster and Land Registration).
Nevertheless, in order to validate that a specific community is marginalized, according the the
Applicant’s Guide for Specific Obijectives 4.1. and 4.2, it was compulsary for a reference study to be
conducted in the respective community. The study was recommended all the more as the factual
realities of 2016 may largely differ from 2011 (the year of the census), and a good understanding of the
characteristics of the community is paramount in designing an efficient intervention.
However, in the future, for similar situations, it is recommended to consider more carefully if the use of
the Atlases of rural and urban Marginalized Communities is not enough to validate the marginalized
community (in this case, new analyses could be allowed if the marginalized communities could not be
found in the Atlases). This approach would have a number of advantages: (i) it would allow the
stakeholders that do not have highly analytical skills to apply for projects and be more confident that they
can receive the financing, (ii) it would extend the intervention area not only to a marginalized area but
also to its neighborhoods, not encouraging segregation, (iii) it would decrease the costs for data
collection and would maximize the energy of the applicants on the identification of the needs of the
communities.

3.1. Performance of validation study for marginalized communities
The validation study of marginalized areas may rely on qualitative research methods. For instance, the
validation study of the World Bank42 for marginalized rural areas (sectors identified in reliance upon
census data) relied on a combination of several qualitative methods. In each selected commune, a visit
was first paid to the town hall. One or more interviews were carried out with the mayor, vice-mayor,
secretary or social assistant from the Public Social Assistance Department. In each commune, a brief
introduction of the study was made, followed by a presentation of the methodology for the identification
of marginalized rural areas, together with the theoretical results. Starting from a map of the commune,
census sectors were identified and some statistical data were collected, as well as opinions on the
theoretically marginalized areas, on several topics (please see Table 3, the first column). In the next stage,
the theoretically marginalized areas were visited and discussion groups were organized on site with the
locals on the topics included in the second column of Table 3. At the same time, the research team made
direct observations in the community, by using the list of indicators in the third column of Table 3. All the

41 Within the meaning of the Guide of Applicants for Calls 4.1. and 4.2., it may be construed that marginalized
communities also include entire communes, having regard to the thresholds for the indicators used– please see Table
1 of the Guidelines.

data collected was encoded and registered in a set of data in view of a quasi-statistical analysis. In
addition, photos were taken in all marginalized areas, to contribute to the decision-making process. In
reliance upon all the information above and by applying the inter-rater reliability method, the research
team decided whether to validate or not the theoretical marginalized areas.

The first useful observation: informants from the local level have difficulties in delineating census sectors,
and therefore, as a matter of rule, they provide chance estimates when asked about statistical data (such
as population, number of Roma, houses, etc.) in connection with such areas. A large part of the local
representatives does not possess systematic information in relation to the areas in the town/commune, in
particular as regards the education of inhabitants, their employment, children not attending school and so
on. At best, they have results from the 2011 census and information only at the level of administrative unit
(town/commune) or village. Therefore, most tend to limit their assessment to visible issues, in particular
the infrastructure and public services. On the one hand, if an area is located near a road or has access to
any infrastructure, marginalization is simply excluded. On the other hand, most tend to assess the entire
neighborhood/village as poor, instead of outlining and identifying a certain area as marginalized.
The second key observation: a validation study according to the template above, however useful,
would not suffice to receive financing from EU funds. For that purpose, the study shall also verify
whether the values of key marginalization indicators in the community are above the thresholds in
table 2 (please see above) determined at the national level and by residential area, in reliance upon
census data. Qualitative data is not enough; it needs to be supplemented by quantitative data.
To conclude, the steps required to validate the marginalized community are as follows:
                                                                           This is a translation from Romanian

B.   Preparation of the research design;
C. Data collection on site and data analysis.

3.1.1. Development of the research instrument for validation

In order to verify, for the envisaged area, the values of each key indicator for marginalization (please see
Table 2), a research instrument needs to be developed, to be applied at house level and included
information on households and individuals. For instance, for urban areas, the indicators in Table 2 contain
information at the level of: (i) persons aged between 15 and 64; (ii) children (0-17 years); (iii) persons,
irrespective of their age; (iv) household; and (v) house. Consequently, the questionnaire shall contain
information on all of the levels above.
The best solution is to fill in a questionnaire for each household, to include information on each
member (adults and children), as well as data on the household.
As deriving from the methodology used by the National Institute of Statistics in investigations, the
household is defined as:
Household: a group of one or more individuals, with or without children, which usually live together,
generally are connected by family ties and manage their affairs in common, by providing full or partial
contributions to the household’s revenues and expenses budget. As the case may be, the members of a
household farm the land or grow animals together, jointly use and capitalize on the goods obtained.
Household may also consist of a group of two or more individuals, with or without children, not
connected by family ties, but which declare that, by mutual agreement, they live together and share a
budget. The individuals not belonging to another household and who live and manage their affairs
individually shall be construed as single-person households.
The following shall be deemed members of the household:
o Present individuals, temporarily absent or departed for a longer period of time from the household,
   but not for more than 6 months (for education purposes in other localities, on vacation, to relatives,
   rest houses, admitted to hospitals or nursing homes);
o Children under the care of individuals outside the household, nurseries or kindergartens, in camps,
   etc.;
o Individuals who left on business (in Romania or abroad), but who did not set up another household or
   did not establish their domicile in another locality;
o Institutionalized individuals (retirement homes, hospital-homes for the disabled, orphanages,
   monasteries, etc.) forming part of a household, absent in the reference month, but not absent from
   the household for more than 6 months;
o Individuals deprived of their freedom (in detention or arrest) forming part of the household, absent in
   the reference month, but not absent from the household for more than 6 months;
o Children under placement with foster family or entrusted for a period longer than 6 months;
o The elderly and other individuals who are dependent of the household;
o Persons living on rent or lease, contributing to the expenses of the household and living together with
   the members of the household for a period of at least 6 month or who are not domiciled elsewhere;
o Individuals employed to supply household services, contributing to the expenses of the household
   and living together with the members of the household for a period of at least 6 month or who are
   not domiciled elsewhere.
                                                                           This is a translation from Romanian

                                                                                               Page 38 of 220
The following shall not be deemed to be members of the household and shall not be subject to the
analysis:
o Individuals/guests temporarily found in the household;
o Individuals whose budget is separated from that of the household members;
o Individuals who permanently live in joint housing units, retirement homes, disabled homes, workers’
   houses, nursing homes, etc.
A fiche of the community is useful in order to find out, for instance, data concerning access to services,
but does not suffice in order to verify marginalization criteria. Research instruments shall be designed for
the residence environment to which the area intended to be validated as marginalized pertains. Minimal
questionnaires at household level, as well as the extended one available in the annex (Annexes 6, 7
and 8) may be used in order to validate the community as marginalized, both in the urban and in
rural areas.


    Attention! For the validation of marginalized communities according to the Guide for Applicants for
    specific objectives 4.1 and 4.2, only marginalization indicators from urban areas were used (and their
    corresponding thresholds) for both rural and urban marginalized communities. Because of this, in the
    case in which the future calls will use the same methodology for the identification of marginalized
    communities, the minimal questionnaire at household level for urban areas should be used for
    communities from both urban and rural areas.



3.1.2. Preparation of research design and its implementation

Census or poll?
Census or poll to collect data necessary for validation ? The answer depends on the size of the
community for which the marginal character needs to be validated and on the resources available for data
collection.
      For marginalized communities with a low number of households- under 120-150 households - it is
      recommended and most of the times possible, to use the census.
o     For larger communities, polls may be used.
o     Both polls and census may focus on all three categories of indicators necessary to identify
      marginalization (human capital, employment, housing) or only for those indicators for which there is
      no data available. For example, in some localities, information on the number of members in each
      household and the dwelling surface can be systematically collected from the city hall. Similarly, the
      information about the proportion of households that do not hold ownership of the dwelling can be
      documented without resorting to poll or census data.
o     As a matter of principle, it is recommended for the on-site research (by poll or census) to be
      performed both in order to validate the marginal character of the target community, and to identify
      the features relevant for the project, at the level of the community for intervention.

Volume and quality of the sample
                                                                                     This is a translation from Romanian

                                                                                                          Page 39 of 220
A sample has a higher representativeness       43
                                                    if:
1.   The compliance between its socio-demographic characteristics (age, gender, education, employment,
     ethnicity, etc.) also referred to as “statistics”, and those of the population from which it was excerpted
     (”parameters”) is higher;
2.   Its volume is higher; and
3.   It allows the selection of interviewed subjects by probabilistic procedures, not mainly associated to
     low costs for reaching the interviewees (improbable methods)44.


The research team carrying out the analysis of the marginalized community may easily determine the
required volume for the sample, by specifying solely the volume of population from which the sample
shall be collected and the acceptable error margin (1%, 3%, or 5%). The excel calculation method may be
found by activating the excel table in Annex 2. Depending on the resources available, it is recommended
for the sample to the calculated for an error margin as low as possible (1% or 3%) and implicitly, for a
volume as large as possible.


Calculating the sample volume for a simple random sample
The sample volume (n) is calculated to be pro-rata with the variability of the defining feature for the
sample (p*q), the size of statistical t or z associated to the level of trust selected, and inverse proportional
to the allowed error limit ( . A correction factor shall be added to the denominator of the above formula
in order to take into account the volume of population (N) out of which the sample is collected. The
sampling feature shall be considered to be of the dichotomy type, maximum variability p=q=50%. The

calculation formula, actually used in order to determine the sample volume, shall be:                          .


Best practice in designing and conducting the poll
Best practice in poll research are valid irrespective of who designs them and applies the poll
methodology.
1.   Involvement of expert poll takers, irrespective of the size of the data collection sample, is
     paramount45:
     o   The presence of an expert or of an institute specializing in polls (in designing the sample
         necessary for data collection and, afterwards, for assessing the sample quality) is the best
         solution.


43 For a less technical introduction to the matter of sampling, please see (Sandu, 1992), whose volume may be
consulted online on the author’s page on Academia.edu (at Statistica in stiintele sociale. Probleme teoretice si aplicatii
pentru invatamantul universitar, 1992) and (Babbie, 2010).
44 Preferred methods are those of probabilistic types (random route sample or selection from lists of individual/

households/ dwellings combined with a stratified and/or cluster sampling. Improbable methods that are not desirable
to validate the marginalized community are: snowball sampling (respondents who selected each other), the
opportunity sampling (any individuals/households are willing to answer questions) or quota sampling (selection of
subjects in different areas proportional to the size of their area, without the subjects being selected systematically
within areas).
45 The purpose of these benchmarks in correct sampling is to provide the project applicant with a simple guideline to

check the way in which the individuals designing the sample and implementing it in a poll should work.
                                                                                    This is a translation from Romanian

                                                                                                        Page 40 of 220
     o   Over time, the process of conducting complex polls at the local and/or micro-regional level
         should be fostered, to create substantiation data for development or poverty or precariousness
         control projects. Partnerships among significant local actors could ensure the financing necessary
         in that respect.
     o   In case of absence of experts directly involved in the performance of the polls, the preparation of
         a poll plan (designing a sample, questionnaire, data collection method, validation and analysis
         method) to be previously discussed with the relevant expert in the field is recommended.
2.   The quality of the sample may substantially be improved by adopting a layering46 or prior
     classification procedure for the population from which the sample is collected. If, for instance, the
     envisaged marginalized community includes census sectors in the village acting as the center of the
     commune (in the territory of which the town hall of the commune is located) and in a marginal village,
     then it would be useful for the community population to be known on such separation line and the
     sample to be designed in “layers”, one referring to the areas in marginal villages, and the other
     referring to the village acting as the center of the commune.
3.   Collection of on-site data, after designing the sample and after the preparation of the questionnaire,
     is recommended to take place in accordance with a probabilistic scheme, by using a sampling frame,
     with lists of corresponding addresses, to select the subjects on which the questionnaire shall be
     applied or a semi-probabilistic method, such as the one of random route. An option for the selection
     steps of households for the random route method can be found in Annex 3.
     o   In both alternatives for collecting data on site, it is important for data collection to be organized
         in such a manner that the operators applying the questionnaire have as little as possible freedom
         to choose the subjects (as the case may be, following the counterproductive rule of the indulgent
         operator “I’ll go where it is easy to reach and I’ll look for those I know”).
     o   Questionnaires shall strictly be applied to people randomly selected from constituents (or similar)
         lists or following rules specific to the random route method (please see the materials in the
         previous footnote).
     o   Operators filling in the questionnaires on site shall be trained in advance so that to comply with
         deontology and professional performance rules specific for the field (shall not replace subjects to
         be interviewed in accordance with the interview protocol with individuals who could more easily
         be interviewed in their households, strict observance of the answers given by the subjects,
         refraining from any influence thereof in their answers, etc.).
     o   If the selection is made starting from the voters registered in constituents lists, the practical
         working method shall aim at: determining the selection pace from the lists by dividing the
         number of voters in the reference constituency to the number of individuals to be interviewed in
         that constituency. If the first individual selected is supposedly the third name on the first page of


46 In the case of stratified sampling, members of the population are divided before the start of the selection process
into groups (relevant to the research objective), named strata. The two conditions which must be fulfilled in the case
of stratified sampling are: (i) each unit (e.g. household/ dwelling) belongs to a single stratum, and (ii) probabilistic
samples (most frequently simple random) are selected within each stratum. The strata must be as homogeneous as
possible within and heterogeneous in the exterior according to variables relevant for the study (for example, if we
expect a marginalized community to be divided into two sub areas distinct as profile, then it would be useful for
distinct samples to be selected from each area. Stratified sampling can be proportional or non-proportional –
stratified sampling is proportional when the weight of a group within the sample is equal to the weight of the same
group in the total population.

                                                                                                            Page 41 of 220
           the constituency list; the following shall be the number given by 3+ the value of the selection
           pace determined in accordance with the bullet above.
       o   Irrespective of the manner in which data is collected on site, starting from the sampling frame or
           through the random route method, the operator shall draw up a table, similar to the one at item 8
           in the Guidebook for the performance of poll through the random route method in Annex 3, so
           that the manner in which the actual works were performed in applying the sampling scheme and
           the questionnaire can be verified.
4.     It is recommended that the questionnaire:
       o   Includes questions regarding the necessary indicators for the validation of the marginal
           community and those for the identification of needs and possibilities of development for the
           community;
       o   Does not include, in the wording of its questions, technical terms, difficult to understand by the
           interviewees. Phrasing of questions shall be made in such a way that words and phrases are
           intelligible for the interviewees with a minimum level of education.
       o   Is pre-tested, in order to ascertain the extent to which its questions are understood by the
           subjects and, also, to pre-determine the duration for which the questionnaire is to be enforced.
       o   Does not suggest, by the wording of its questions, the answer, in any one form or another (”Isn’t it
           true that........”). This kind of questions should not be found in the questionnaire, or in the manner
           in which the questionnaire operator phrases the questions.
       o   At least 15% of the questionnaires filled in shall be controlled in the territory for correct
           enforcement. Control as to the manner in which questionnaires are applied shall be notified to
           interview operators in advance. The idea that the factual questions (such as educational level,
           income or dwelling characteristics) which, apparently, could be given a simple answer, not
           possible to be influenced by the operator, cannot pose any difficulties in the poll has no merits
           most frequently in the poll practice. If, for instance, the questionnaire also includes a question
           concerning the ethnicity of the respondent, then all of the above-mentioned requirements in
           connection with the interviewer’s behavior fully reveal their significance.
       o   Control of filled in questionnaires shall take place not only on site, but also before their input into
           the computer (to identify any filling-in errors), and by verifications of the filling in logical type,
           after data is input into the computer (to identify questionnaire data entry errors).

Drafting the research component as part of the project
It would be ideal for a technical annex to the analysis of the marginalized community to refer to the
sampling design and its implementation. Specifically, this annex should indicate: the sampling scheme
(probabilistic-semi-probabilistic, single- or two-stages, layered or not layered, etc.), the comparison
between the features of the collected sample and those of the population (on a series of relevant
variables existing at the population level or from census data or other actualized data sources), who
applied the questionnaire, how was the compliance with the sampling scheme on site checked.
Access of certified assessors to micro-data (data at individual level deriving from the poll or from the
census, after appropriate redaction) is also a solution of direct testing for the quality of data used in order
to estimate the indicators of validation of the marginalized community47.


47   Under the Call for Proposals for Objective 5.1, the access of evaluators to microdata is compulsory.
                                                                             This is a translation from Romanian

                                                                                                 Page 42 of 220
Data quality
The mere fact of collecting data through a poll or by census does not automatically lead to a better
validation of the marginalization of target communities or to a better research of the whole intervention
section of the project (in situations in which the marginalized community only represents a sub-area of
the intervention area). The sampling scheme may have been good, but its application on site faulty. The
questionnaire may include questions appropriate for the topic, but their topic may have given rise to
failures of communication or understanding in relation to the interviewees. For these reasons, it may also
be necessary to conduct a validation of collected data.
o      The sample was appropriately designed and the application of the questionnaire and of the sampling
       scheme was correctly performed provided that the data obtained is “consistent”, “is connected to one
       another” as expected in theory. For example, we expect the percentage of the population with a low
       level of education in these areas not to be lower than the one observed for the population at
       community or village level or for the percentage of the population without utilities from marginalized
       community to also be lower than the one registered in rural areas or at the level of the commune to
       which the community belongs.
o      Also, it would be useful for marginality indicators, to be linked to indicators as close to them as
       possible such as meaning, deriving from other research or data bases (education stock, infant
       mortality rate, index of local human development, etc.).


3.2. Assessment of condition to prove that the community is
marginalized
How can communities considered marginalized - in projects fighting poverty and social exclusion - be
validated through quantitative social research? Does the marginalized area include all marginalization
characteristics? Are those communities - very poor and with a high probability of social exclusion -
defined in line with the atlas type of social research48?
This section of the Guidebook mainly aims at providing case-by-case answers to the questions related to
the assessment of the validation method for the inclusion of territorial micro-zones in the category of
marginal communities (please see Figure 10). Additionally, this section aims at developing a mind frame
to guide the evaluators in selecting and grading the projects in terms of their degree of substantiation
through quantitative research. The cases which may be found on site, in terms of the relationship between
the target community and the marginal community already identified through one of the two Atlases,
rural and urban, should consider some of the following aspects:
1.     Full compliance between the target community for the intervention and one or more marginalized
       communities already identified as being marginalized. The target community, assumed to be
       marginalized, exceeds in size one census sector, has the dimension of a village, commune or town
       and is comprised of census sectors, of marginalized type. In these cases, a specific validation
       research for marginality is no longer required.
2.     The community assumed to be marginalized only partially overlaps a census sector having the
       status of marginalized area.

                                                                                                            Page 43 of 220
3.   The target community, assumed to be marginalized, overlaps a census sector; however, the latter,
     for whatever reason, was not assessed as marginalized before (no registration in the census, faulty
     registration, lack of data in quantitative analysis, fundamental changes after 2011 etc.).
Even simpler, there are three types of situations that the project applicant and, implicitly, the evaluator,
shall take into consideration: a) full coordination between the census sector and the marginalized
community starting from census sector level data from the Atlases data; b) partial overlap between the
marginalized community and a certain census sector included in the analysis set forth in the urban and/or
rural Atlases; and c) labeling a community as marginalized, without partially overlapping a census sector
deemed as marginalized community area in the Atlas49.


Attention!
A community is marginal if the reference territory, within the meaning of the applicant, fully overlaps a
territory identified in the Atlas as marginal. In respect of census sectors in the urban environment
containing more than 20.000inhabitants, marginalized urban areas are publicly available. In the rural
environment, at the time when the Guide for Applicants for objectives 4.1 and 4.2 was published, there
was no public list of marginalized community sectors.
Regarding areas deemed by the applicant as marginalized, but for which overlapping with the
marginality set forth in the Atlas is only partial, or there is no such overlap, it is necessary to conduct a
reference study which validates the marginality status of that territory. The need to conduct a poll or
census to estimate the values of the six indicators in table 1 (in respect of human capital, employment
and housing) is stringent in the cases where the marginality set forth in the Atlas largely differs, in
territorial terms, from the marginality proposed in the application. If a part of the area proposed by the
applicant as marginality area overlaps with the area holding the status of marginality in the Atlas, then
the reference study shall continue to be required, however, the need to conduct a poll or census for
validation could be reduced to the area which is not covered by the Atlas.
Also, it does not suffice to report a census or poll (or other administrative data) in order to validate the
marginalized community unless also providing convincing arguments referring to the quality of the data
collection method and the quality of the data itself.

Key aspects to consider by project applicants and evaluators carrying out analyses of marginalized
communities
Applicants   The Applicant should pay attention to the specifications from the Applicant’s Guideline
             when proposing a marginalized area for a project. For example, in the Guideline for
             Specific Objectives 4.1. and 4.2., the mere inclusion of the locality covered by the project in
             the list of localities/villages with marginalized census sectors, as per the Atlases, is not
             enough to validate a marginalized area. The comparison shall be conducted at the level of
             census sector; if the overall is not perfect, the proposed marginalized community should
             be validated by a new research. No matter of the Guideline specifications, new research is
             needed in the cases in which a marginalized community cannot be found in the Atlases.
             In the case of the Applicant’s Guidelines for Specific Objectives 4.1. and 4.2., only the
             marginalization indicators and thresholds from urban areas were used both for rural and
             urban areas. In this case, the minimal/extensive questionnaire for urban areas should be
             used for communities from both urban and rural areas to calculate the marginalization
             indicators.
             To validate that a community is marginalized or not, a fiche of the community is not
             sufficient to verify the marginalization criteria; a questionnaire need to be applied at the
             house level and include all the information on households and individuals regarding the
             marginalization indicators.
             The questionnaire should be applied either on all the population or on a representative
             sample of households from the marginalized areas. In the cases in which some of the
             information exist in administrative data, the applicant should document the how the
             information from that data source was collected and its quality.
             The collected data should be aggregated at community level, and the values for the
             indicators compared with the thresholds at national level.
Evaluators   A community is marginal if the reference territory fully overlaps a territory identified in the
             Atlas as marginal. In respect of census sectors in the urban environment containing more
             than 20.000inhabitants, marginalized urban areas are publicly available. In the rural
             environment, at the time when the Guide for Applicants for objectives 4.1 and 4.2 was
             published, there was no public list of marginalized community sectors.
             Regarding areas deemed by the applicant as marginalized, but for which overlapping with
             the marginality set forth in the Atlas is only partial, or there is no such overlap, it is
             necessary to conduct a reference study which validates the marginality status of that
             territory.
             The community is marginalized if the values of the indicators from Table 2 are larger than
             the thresholds.
             Also, it does not suffice to report a census or poll (or other administrative data) in order to
             validate the marginalized community unless also providing convincing arguments
             referring to the quality of the data collection method and the quality of the data itself.

4. Identifying the needs of marginalized communities and
potential solutions
The need of the community may be analyzed by using a combination of quantitative and qualitative data.
Each of these types of data, quantitative or qualitative, is collected by using specific instruments such as
the ones described in the annexes. In the intervention logic of the types covered by the Guide for
Applicants for the objectives 4.1 and 4.2, the instruments should fulfill a series of minimal conditions:
1.    The instruments shall reflect the needs according to each of the 7 dimensions of the project:
o    Education:
             -    Support to improve access and attendance to early education (early pre-school and pre-
                  school)
             -    Support to reduce early school leaving by: programs of the priority zone type for
                  education/afterschool
             -    Second chance programs
o    Employment:
             -    Support for access to and/or remaining on the labor market
             -    Attending on the job apprenticeship programs
             -    Attending internships for higher education graduates (including by providing financial
                  support to employers)
             -    Support measures to find jobs
o    Entrepreneurships and self-employment:
             -    Granting support to individuals in the target group
             -    Granting subsidies (micro-grants) for setting up new business
             -    Development supply of (social healthcare/healthcare-social) services
o    Housing conditions improved
o    Legal assistance provisions in order to settle documents
o    Fighting against discrimination and fostering multiculturalism.
2.   The instruments shall collect information in connection with the demand and supply of
     services/assistance for each of the 7 dimensions.
3.   Interest indicators (information collected through the questionnaire/charts/interviews) shall be
     collected at the level of the entire population in that community, respectively at the level of
     Roma population in that community. This shall be achieved by including, in the
     questionnaires/guideline, an interview containing questions on the (declared) ethnicity of the
     respondent, in particular collecting data from charts both at the level of the entire population, and at
     the level of the Roma population. In addition, as the case may be, the instruments shall include
     questions addressing issues specific to the Roma population (for instance, fear regarding the manner
     in which respondents are treated or regarded by the representatives of institutions, humiliation or
     other concerns as regards physical safety, dignity, reputation, etc., which could determine certain
     Roma to access and not benefit from the services and resources provided as part of the project).
4.   The instruments shall be conceived in such a way as to measure/identify both the needs and the
     issues obstacles currently existing or that could occur to prevent their satisfaction . In general,
     social phenomena have multiple causes, but our purpose is to identify the main causes. For instance,
     dropout from school may be caused by the long distance to the school and/or no transportation,
     costs (clothing, footwear, transportation, school supplies, etc.), discrimination, etc. Similarly, low
                                                                              This is a translation from Romanian

                                                                                                  Page 47 of 220
     access by a community to healthcare services could be the result of causes such as long distance to
     the health center, bad roads, lack of means of transportation, high cost (as compared to revenues)
     for transport, linguistic barriers, short/inappropriate business hours of the center, etc. Furthermore, in
     certain cases, the respondents would rather point solely to the reasons more socially acceptable and
     less to those who are relatively less acceptable, but which could be more important. For instance, it is
     easier for the respondents to mention, among the reasons for low school attendance, the shortage of
     clothing or footwear than the parents’ refusal to let girls attend school or the fact that they are
     already unofficially married.
5.   The data collected shall allow at least an approximate prioritization of the identified needs. The
     prioritization may be achieved directly by the respondents (including through a participative
     approach) and/or by the researcher, further to the analysis of integrated data at the level of the
     community.
6.   The data collected shall reflect the (in)existence of segregation in terms of education,
     employment, social and healthcare services, legal assistance, housing (natural, manmade or symbolic
     borders).



4.1. Specificity of quantitative and qualitative data
Beyond the common purpose of understanding social reality and the support for taking the best decision
with regard to the community interventions, quantitative and qualitative data have a series of specific
features that set them apart.
A brief summary of these differences is given below, starting from the following dimensions:
What     research     Quantitative data is collected in general within investigations or census using as the
instruments are       collection instrument of choice a questionnaire, meaning a series of questions in a
used in collecting    logical order and structured per topics. Most questions making up a questionnaire
the two types of      are closed-end, which means that in addition to the question, the respondent is
data?                 provided with potential answers to that question, and the respondent need only
                      choose one or several of the answers. The conditions in which the questionnaire is
                      applied shall be, insofar as practicably possible, the same for all respondents.
                      Quantitative data occur in relation to…:
                      o   A (statistical) population defined as space and time (or sub-populations)
                          -   sub-populations may be defined depending on various criteria (in the case
                              of individuals, we refer to gender, age, education level, employment status,
                              sources of revenues, etc.) and is described in numeric form (absolute and/or
                              relative frequency = % - for example the number of unemployed)
                      o   Characteristics of statistical individuals making up a statistical (sub-)population
                          -    are expressed in numeric form, in the form of individual values, statistical
                               distributions and/or synthetic measures (average, median, variance, etc.)
                          -    have a specific unit of measure (RON, ha, m2, etc.) is associated to theme
                               e.g.: surface area of the house (m2), average net salary earnings/month
                               (RON), average unemployment period (months), etc.
                      Qualitative data is usually generated as part of individual interviews. They take
                      discursive form. The instrument used in order to generate this type of data is
                                                                                 This is a translation from Romanian

                                                                                                     Page 48 of 220
                       referred to as interview guideline. An interview may have different structure degrees
                       (guiding the respondent’s discourse):
                       o    not structured: only the general instruction is given – question or topic
                            proposed for discussion –, and the interviewer only intercedes where necessary,
                            in order to obtain additional information, intercessions taking a form specific to
                            the interview situation,
                       o    semi-structured: the interviewer informs the interviewee on the general
                            instruction and several specific instructions and
                       o    structured: general and specific instructions, but also specific intercessions by

                            concerned (such a guideline is relatively similar to a questionnaire with open-
                            end questions – no potential answers).

4.2. Quantitative data in identifying needs
The relevance and need for each of the activities and sub-activities forming part of this project shall be
supported by (also) using quantitative data. The natural course is not starting from the activities one
would wish to achieve and then seeking to justify why such activities (measures) are required, but the
other way around, starting from the needs of the population to the activities that could help satisfy such
needs. In order to identify and prioritize the needs, quantitative and qualitative data is required.
This section, and also the corresponding annexes, presents several examples of instruments and indicators
which could be adjusted and used in specific projects. For each indicator, the definition, calculation
method and items necessary to obtain the information required for calculation are offered. Given that
certain indicators may be calculated at various levels (individual, or aggregate: area, village,
commune/town) the user of these instruments should pay attention to the selection of the suitable
instrument (diagnosis chart of the community marginalized, chart of the village or commune / town,
questionnaire at household level, validation questionnaire for inclusion in the target group in the project).

4.2.1. Types of useful instruments in the analysis of the marginalized
community

In the instances where the census sector is not overlapping on the marginalized area, validation of the
marginalized area may only be achieved by collecting new data (by census or poll). Identification of needs,
prioritization and validation may only be conducting by collecting new data (by census, poll, interviews,
group meetings, etc.). Collecting new data has its advantages and disadvantages. They are listed below:
Advantages:        If the concerned marginalized area is only a part of a village, this allows the collection
                   of data (indicators) at a territorial level (the marginalized community) for which such
                   data is inexistent.
                   It allows the collection of new data (indicators).
                   It allows the collection of updated data (indicators).
                   It allows the collection of data (indicators) at a decentralized level (not only per total
                   population, but also at the level of sub-populations, for instance Roma).
Disadvantages:     It requires higher cost.
                   It requires a longer time until the finalization of the analysis of the marginalized
                   community.
                   It requires access to more numerous and more experienced human resources in
                   collecting survey data.
                   It is necessary to involve individuals who know how to generate a questionnaire, to
                   train survey operators (individuals to collect data), to generate a data base, to feed
                   collected data in the data base and to analyze the data (at least in terms of frequency
                   and associations).


In order to collect new data, methods need to be selected, and respectively design data collection
instruments. The annexes introduce a series of several such potential instruments. However, they
only represent indicative instruments that can be adapted to the needs of each applicant/interested
                                                                               This is a translation from Romanian

                                                                                                   Page 50 of 220
person in carrying out an analysis of the marginalized community. Designing an instrument/set of
instruments to be used for a certain project shall commence from the identification of issues/topics of
interest and indicators necessary to measure such issues/topics. Depending on the specificity of
marginalized community/areas, the list of indicators to be collected may be extended or reduced. Some of
the indicators may be collected using multiple sources, however, for simplicity and efficiency, most
frequently the indicators were introduced in the annex only once, in one of the instruments. Furthermore,
some of the indicators may also be collected from sources other than census/new poll. Please find in the
annex, examples of indicators listed for each size, generated by means of the information collected by a
series of instruments, also described in the annex.
The instruments included among the annexes are:
o   Minimal questionnaires at urban and rural household level, which contain only the necessary
    items for (i) the validation of the marginalized community, (ii) the identification of the project target
    group according to the Guide for Applicants for Objectives 4.1 and 4.2 and (iii) filling in the
    information at individual/household level from the compulsory Minimal sheet according to the Guide
    for Applicants for Objectives 4.1 and 4.2 (see Annexes 6 and 7).
o   Extended questionnaire at household level. An extended questionnaire contains the items required
    to (i) validate the marginalized community, (ii) supplement information at the level of
    individual/household in the compulsory Minimal Sheet according to the Guide for Applicants for
    Objectives 4.1 and 4.2, (iii) identify the target group and (iv) identify the requisite activities in the
    project (Annex 8).
o   Diagnosis chart of the marginalized community. The sheet template alternative to the one in the
    Guide for Applicants for Objectives 4.1 and 4.2 contains a series of information which may be filled in
    at the level of marginalized community. Most of the items may be collected from the representatives
    of local institutions (town hall, school/kindergarten, police, attending physician, etc.). It is important
    that the collected items be correlated with the indicators concerning the justification of eligible
    activities and with the data collected in the minimum summary chart of the community (see Annex 9).
o   Diagnosis chart of the village in which the marginalized community is located. The chart template
    contains solely the information which may be filled in at village level (and which is not collected in the
    questionnaire referring to the community or the administrative-territorial unit). The questionnaire
    items shall be correlated with the indicators concerning the justification of eligible activities (see
    Annex 11).
o   Diagnosis chart of the commune/town in which the marginalized community is located. The chart
    contains solely the information which may be filled in at commune level (and which is not collected in
    the questionnaire referring to the community or the village). The questionnaire items shall be
    correlated with the indicators concerning the justification of eligible activities (see Annex 12).
o   Validation chart for inclusion in the target group of the project. In order to identify the
    individuals forming part of the target group (its categories) at the level of each household in the
    marginalized area, it is useful to use the validation questionnaire for inclusion in the target group of
    the project - poverty and social exclusion, please see the annexes. By means of this questionnaire, the
    necessary data is collected to prove that the individuals selected as beneficiaries of the project form
    part of the target group (satisfy the general condition, in particular “risk of poverty and social
    exclusion”). In addition, the validation questionnaire connects the socio -demographic features of each
    of the selected persons to the features of activities and sub-activities. Last, but not least, it records the
    consent expressed by the head of the households in respect to the individuals in that household
    taking part to the activities and sub-activities of the project (see Annex 14).

o   The indicators at the level of the community based on the household level questionnaire. The
    table contains all indicators that may be calculated at the level of the community, in reliance upon the
    extended questionnaire: (i) indicators for validating the marginalized community, (ii) indicators in the
    compulsory Minimal Sheet according to the Guide for Applicants for Objectives 4.1 and 4.2, (iii)
    indicators required to validate the inclusion of the household in the target group (persons facing the
    risk of poverty and social exclusion) and (iv) the other indicators justifying the need for interventions
    in various fields, as identified above (see Annex 10).
o   Useful indicators in assessing project impact. Even if monitoring and assessing the impact of the
    project is sometimes not a chapter which should be discussed and detailed in the project proposal,
    consideration given to this step in advance may be useful for several standpoints: helps to more
    clearly structure the goals and activities of the project, allows the more accurate identification of data
    to be collected (cross-section, but also longitudinal), casts a positive image in relation to the project
    as a whole, allows a swift project adjustment reaction to changes occurred in the community, as a
    result of its implementation, etc. The annex includes several examples of potential indicators in
    connection with Roma inclusion for each field (education, employment, etc.) (see Annex 15).

Identification and definition of the target group and corresponding needs
Identification of the target group, its categories and needs corresponding to such categories is the core of
a project of this type. The manner in which this is substantiated, data sources used, congruence between
the needs addressed, activities proposed in the project and features of beneficiaries shall be a major
criterion depending on which the project is assessed. Starting from the assessment criteria and sub-
criteria specified in the Guidebook, the tables below describe a general level, but also provide examples,
points (questions and answers) that should be taken into account in designing and substantiating this
project.

Filling in the Minimal Synthetic Fiche of the community
The Minimal Synthetic fiche contains a series of key-indicators at the level of the marginalized community.
The fiche is a simplified version of the diagnosis chart of the marginalized community and shall be filled in
depending on multiple sources (it is not mandatory to consider all of them):
o   gather information from the household (survey in households),
o   statistical data provided by the Census of the National Institute of Statistics (NIS) or own census,
o   data collected from the representatives of local institutions, formal and informal local leaders,
    representatives of the marginalized community, personal observation,
o   information in the community/village/locality fiche.
In the case of some of the collected indicators, the sources may reflect a relatively different image.
Depending on each case, it shall be verified whether there is an actual difference (errors may occur in the
collection, input of data, conflicting definitions, different reference years, etc.). If there is a difference, any
of the sources can be considered, depending on the needs of the project.
Information on the filling in of the Minimal Synthetic fiche corresponding to the Applicant’s Guidelines
may be found in Annex 1 “Pointers for filling in Appendix B: MINIMAL SYNTHETIC COMMUNITY FICHE”.

4.3. Qualitative data to identify the needs and validate the solutions
with the community support
Qualitative data is, in social sciences, one of the fundamental categories of data allowing, in addition to
quantitative data, inferences or conclusions on certain social situations or contexts. While the quantitative
data is essentially written (put down in writing in the questionnaires, data collection sheets, etc.),
qualitative data is verbal (may also consist only of verbal assertions, if applicable recorded, made by
certain people) or visual (observations on households or social premises, practices of the community etc.),
and may afterwards be kept in writing or as images51.
The specificity of qualitative methods as compared to quantitative ones may be described at least by
means of the following issues:
1.   While quantitative methods allow to obtain quantifiable data (in a standardized, numerical manner)
     on large groups of subjects, qualitative methods allow to record non-quantifiable personal
     information on people or small groups of people.
2.   The number of people consider for this this research may be as high as thousands in the case of
     quantitative methods, but may not be higher than tens for qualitative methods.
3.   The type of conclusions which may be reached relying on such data, their level of relevance: in the
     case of quantitative data, may be either statistical data collected as such (demographic data on the
     locality, the percentage of households facing a risk of poverty etc.), or statistically representative (in
     the case of questionnaires, for instance, to be performed at all times on a sample calculated
     depending on accurate criteria), while qualitative data shall be socially significant (to identify what is
     more important or different for various individuals or groups of individuals, the values and deep
     motivations thereof or current practices of which they may not be aware, etc.)
4.   The level of competence and the type of skills necessary to obtain and analyze it. Although they may
     seem easier to apply, certain qualitative methods require a longer experience for research operators.

4.3.1. Why are qualitative methods also required?

Let’s start from an example - a certain percentage of the population in a community aged 15-64 that is
unemployed (for instance 30%), identified based on a survey, forms part of the category of measurable
quantitative data. However, due to the fact that the researcher visits the locality, talks to the inhabitants
about the reasons for which they are unemployed, observes the daily activity of a household, how they
earn the bare necessities, and concludes (for instance) that the high unemployment rate may be explained
by causes such as the fact that the families work on the “black market”, without documents, that they do
not have employment opportunities in the vicinity of the community, that many families have early-pre-
school, pre-school or school aged children and that the parents have no one to leave them with – because
there is no nursery in the locality, they may not use baby sitter services for lack of resources, there are no
sufficient places in the local kindergarten for all pre-school children, there is no one to take care of the
children when they come back from school, etc.; the unemployed do not have the qualifications
demanded on the local labor market etc., all of these are qualitative data which supplements, on a

necessary basis, the quantitative perspective on issues, needs and solutions within a community.
Sometimes, the qualitative information can guide the measurement of these problems though a
subsequent quantitative research (the qualitative data can guide the construction of relevant items
through which the problems could be quantified within a quantitative research).
The quantitative research step also necessarily brings a certain simplification of the social reality, the
inclusion of social phenomena, complex in their manifestation and structure, into narrower categories,
defined by means of certain labels or specific terminology. The questionnaire, as the key instrument in the
collection of quantitative data uses pre-determined questions and phrases which may not be later
changed during the data collection process, shall be read as such to the interviewee, and the latter’s
answer shall be exactly written down/recorded. Thus, the respondent to a questionnaire is invited to take
a personal stand in relation to certain pre-determined and fixed words, phrases, labels or wordings.
However, the matter to be addressed here is that the same question, the same word or the same phrase
may mean different things or may have different relevance for different types of respondents (see the
below example). To put it briefly, qualitative methods are necessary because: a) they nuance and detail
quantitative data, reaching a more suitable interpretation thereof; b) allow to find subjective or intimate
information, even contradictory, which subjects do not wish or do not have the ability to express in the
questionnaires; they allow, in the case of observation, to identify social practices and areas not taken into
consideration or ignored by the community.

4.3.2. Types of methods

In order to obtain qualitative data, the established method (technique) mostly used in social sciences is
the interview. However, extremely relevant qualitative data may also be acquired by observing a certain
social context of interest. Moreover, the case study is also a data collection and analysis strategy that
could use qualitative data in the consistent relevant description of a certain social sector or context. Please
find below a description of each of them.

4.3.2.1. Interview in social survey
The interview used in social survey mainly consists of the organization of a discussion/interaction
(interview) with individuals who are very familiar with or live in the social context (for instance, a
marginalized community or area) where an assessment is intended to be performed, from which to collect
data. This endeavor shall involve, on the one hand, the researcher/expert conducting the study, familiar
with the stake of the research, the goals undertaken by the former, and who initiates and leads the
conversation. On the other hand, the interviewees – who live, are familiar with or closely know the social
context referred to in the research. The researcher aims to acquire relevant information in relation to the
envisaged social context from those who know it best. In this endeavor, the researcher uses a research
instrument – usually referred to as the interview grid – to contain a set of pre-determined questions
aimed at guiding the conversation with the interviewees - please see the interview grid template attached
in Annex 16. The interview shall take place according to certain essential rules that allow to obtain relevant
data necessary in achieving the study goals. These rules are:
o   Data obtained is relevant and valuable insofar as it reflects honest, genuine opinions of the
    respondents. That is precisely why it is mandatory that the interviewees be reassured on the
    confidentiality of their answers, are informed from the very beginning that their answers shall not be
    made public in an individual manner so that their identity is not disclosed (it goes without saying that
    many respondents would otherwise censure their opinions, will not provide honest replies, in line with
    their own beliefs, but rather with the expectations of a certain audience on which they focus, with
    what is considered politically correct, etc.).

o   Recording the interview allows to more easily and fully analyze the answers. That is why it is necessary
    to ask the respondents’ permission to record the meeting. In certain cases, answers may also be taken
    down during the meeting by an assistant researcher.
o   Influencing the respondents’ answers shall be avoided , no judgments of value shall be issued by the
    interviewer, likely to determine certain positions to be adopted by the respondent. The researcher has
    his own opinion or take on the topics discussed, there is no doubt about that, however, he shall
    refrain from stating his own opinion until after the end of the interview, and shall maintain a neutral
    attitude on the topics discussed. If, however, the researcher is expressly requested by the interviewee
    to express an opinion, his answer will avoid a clear-cut position, and will rather express an ambiguous
    opinion on the topic under review.
o   During the interview, the approached topics may also be outside those specified in the interview grid,
    the order of questions may be altered, the researcher is also free to touch on other topics deemed to
    be critical, which unexpectedly seem as important.
It should further be clarified that there are two categories of interviews, with particular specificities:
a) Individual interview, to be conducted with only one relevant individual or who is familiar with the
   social context and the topic under review. In social sciences, several characteristics of the interview
   have been indicated, however, largely used is the so-called “semi-structured interview” that is
   conceived in such a manner that the researcher is free to order the guiding questions as he deems
   appropriate and may develop, during the meeting with the interviewees, other topics than those
   included in the questions. The interview may take place by face to face meeting, however, telephone
   interviews are also documented in the relevant literature, where the conversation is held from a
   distance, by means of modern communication techniques.
b) Group interview (focus-group), in which the conversation is carried simultaneously with several
   individuals (6-10 individuals), and the researcher shall be the one mediating the conversation. In this
   case, each participant may intercede in the conversation, spontaneously, however, keeping in line with
   certain interaction rules set forth by the moderator.
Household interview may also be added to the above, conducted individually or in a group with all
members of a household, preferably at their residence. The advantage consists in the possibility to also
identify potential conflicting or dissenting opinions and expectations, in particular relating to gender or
age, which rarely come up in individual interviews.
An individual interview reflects the respondents’ position to certain relevant issues or features of the social
context under review, later analyzed by the researcher. In the case of focus-group, qualitative data is
obtained following, in addition to the individual interview, the dynamics of the group, the manifestation of
social psychology mechanisms specific to small groups, negotiation and interaction, arguments and
counter-arguments, etc. The focus-group may describe, unlike the individual interview, the emergence of
certain beliefs, position taking, topics or issues of interest for the social context under review. In addition,
in certain cases, the focus-group may stimulate a higher degree of honesty on the part of the
interviewees.

4.3.2.2. Case study and observation in social sciences
The case study is a research strategy performing a separate analysis of a certain social context, by taking
into account certain issued deemed important/relevant for the purpose of the research. In this case, the
researcher visits and spends a certain period of time in the social area under review, talks and interacts
with key relevant persons, observes and monitors visible issues of the social area (such as the quality of
                                                                             This is a translation from Romanian

                                                                                                 Page 60 of 220
residential houses, streets in the locality, of the building where the school, healthcare facility, town hall
etc. are located) and takes part in various events or actions specific for the social context subject to
research, such as weddings, christenings, meetings of the community where decisions are made, clubs or
social activities, sporting events, school activities, etc.
Observation in social sciences is a method readily available to the research which suggests that the latter
should directly follow the social area under review, take part in key activities conducted in the community
subject to research, observe the social context in reliance upon goals or hypotheses, collect data and thus
acquire a realistic and thorough understanding of the features of the community, implicitly the problems,
as well as its needs.
However, what is important, in an endeavor such as a case study or observation is that the researcher shall
follow certain well-determined analysis landmarks, certain working hypotheses, start from certain
assumptions referring to what could be found in a community, an area for intervention. In that respect,
close familiarity of the researcher with the specialized literature, with the outcome of similar researches is
a must. The instrument in charge of the methodological direction of the endeavor undertaken by a
researcher on site, in liaising with the people and social area under review could consist of an observation
chart. The template for such observation chart is given in Annex 16.

4.3.3. Target group envisaged in the research

In social sciences, the interview and observation are data collection techniques that allow, further to an
analysis, to identify problems, needs and the best intervention solutions in a specific social context.
However, in order for this action to be successful, the researcher shall also address the research
instruments used to the suitable people, to those who are more likely to provide the expected data. In
other words, to appropriately choose the target group envisaged in the research.
In principle, the conditions which an individual should fulfil in order to become the subject of a qualitative
analysis study for a social context are as follows:
o   To have knowledge or information on the social context under review. This may derive from the life
    experience spent in that social context (as in the case of people living in a community, in a potential
    intervention area, etc.) or from practicing an activity focusing on that intervention community or area
    (for instance, a social assistant having managed cases in the community, a legal counsel with the town
    hall, familiar with the issuance procedure for identification documents, a local facilitator, un healthcare
    mediator, teaching personnel, doctor or police officer – these categories of individuals may perform
    relevant activities in the community, without living there).
o   Form part of groups of individuals presumably impacted by anticipated social concerns (for instance,
    individuals from vulnerable groups, Roma, individuals facing poverty, receiving social assistance, etc.)
    or who could contribute to the settlement thereof (for instance, the mayor or local counselors, local
    entrepreneurs, local exports in charge of social, legal matters, facilitators, the management of the
    local school, teaching personnel, etc.).
Interviews shall be conducted with individuals from the target group, and the case study and sociological
observation shall concern social areas where the individuals in the target group live or perform their work
(home, school, local authority, local healthcare facility, etc.). Please find below, for your convenience, a
non-exhaustive list of individuals who could become the target group of a study.
List of individuals within the locality/community with whom it is recommended to discuss in order to
acquire qualitative data:
                                                                                  This is a translation from Romanian

1.   Mayor/Deputy Mayor;
2.   Local Roma Counselor (if any) or representative for Roma with the Town Hall/Local Council;
3.   Local mediator or facilitator (education, healthcare, social etc.);
4.   Roma leader in the locality (people vested or recognized by the Roma community in the locality as
     holding authority, whom the community trusts, who had various initiatives to improve the condition
     of Roma in the locality, etc.);
5.   Entrepreneurs operating in the community;
6.   Doctor and nurse working in the local healthcare facility (if applicable);
7.   Social assistant or person within the local authority in charge of welfare;
8.   Principal, teachers, school counselor or psychologist in the local school whose jurisdiction covers,
     even partially, the area where the marginalized community is located;
9.   Teachers within the local kindergarten/ kindergartens;
10. Representative of the public order and security unit (police) operating in the locality;
11. Roma in the envisaged intervention community or area;
12. Welfare beneficiaries in the locality (minimum guaranteed income etc.);
13. Parents in the locality who have or recently had pre-school or school children;
14. Children/teenagers school dropouts and their parents.
It should be mentioned that the interview grid used shall be adjusted for the interviewee or, in the case of
a focus-group, for the interviewees, by asking them relevant questions and topics for discussion, which
they know, on which they may have opinions.
The abilities of the person conducting the interview or moderating a focus-group are extremely
important. Where qualitative data is collected by interview or focus-group, the moderator (individual
asking the questions in the guideline) shall have specialized training (sociology or socio-humanistic
sciences), shall be familiar with the scientific rules for conducting an interview or focus-group and with the
dynamic mechanisms for small groups (in the case of focus–group), have high empathic skills and, most of
all, closely know the goals of the research and the specific context in which the qualitative data collection
takes place, always relying on them during data collection.

4.4. Participative methods in identifying solutions

4.4.1. What are participative methods and what are they used for?

Participative methods are used for the necessary consultation of the community, of the representatives of
local authorities, unofficial leaders in relation to the needs/issues identified, the solutions selected,
however, they are not qualitative data collection methods proper, in the sociologic meaning. In that
respect, participative methods supplement and meet the key requirements necessary in performing the
analysis substantiating the needs of a community, in particular:
o    Identification and validation requirements, whereby to prove that the target group falls under the
     category of marginalized communities, in accordance with the terms and criteria of the financing
                                                                                  This is a translation from Romanian

                                                                                                      Page 62 of 220
      program; please see the minimal sheet of the community (Annex B in the Guide for Applicants for
      Specific Objectives 4.1 and 4.2), acting as an eligibility filter;
o     Requirements for social knowledge, through various and optional methods for statistic and on site
      research, setting forth a detailed and through situation of the particulars of the envisaged community,
      the level, sectors and marginalization/discrimination factors existing at local level;
o     Requirements for community participation, whereby to ensure the information of the community
      on the outcome of the research, the forecasted solution and receive feedback from the members of
      the community (e.g. testing the realism of solutions). At the same time, community participation is
      also a method of empowerment (increasing the responsibility) and increasing the involvement of direct
      beneficiaries. On an ideal basis, it also contains information on who is deemed that should solve the
      issues/satisfy the needs of the target group.


    EXCERPT FROM THE GUIDE FOR APPLICANTS FOR SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES 4.1 AND 4.2
    ” 1.3.1. Preliminary activity – Conducting the analysis at the level of the Roma marginalized community
    in order to substantiate the financing request
    ”The purpose of this activity is to validate the qualification of the community as marginalized and to
    provide specific and relevant data to substantiate the analysis into the needs and issues facing the
    population in the marginalized community, whose resolution is intended in the project.” (….) ”Data
    used in the analysis shall be: statistical data resulting from scientific research or administrative data of
    relevant entities (for instance: the National Institute of Statistics / County Statistics Directorates,
    Directorates for Welfare and Child Protection, Directorates for Public Health, Public Welfare Offices,
    Local Police, etc.) and/ or data acquired from the reference study, by means of on-site research
    activities.” (....) ”In order to perform this analysis, it is mandatory to organize on-site research activities
    at the level of marginalized communities including Roma population. Furthermore, the proposed
    solutions for the inclusion of persons at risk of poverty and social exclusion shall be made by involving
    local actors (including informal leaders, Roma and non-Roma), and in particular by involving the target
    group envisaged by the interventions financed under the project (people facing the risk of poverty and
    social exclusion). The involvement of people in the Roma marginalized community in the analysis
    could be proven by: for instance, attendance lists, the minutes of meetings, photos, agenda of
    meetings, materials presented therein etc. such documents to be necessarily attached to the
    document – preliminary analysis at the level of community. It is MANDATORY to perform the analysis
    at the level of the community envisaged in the project and to perform it before submission of the
    financing request, subject to consultation with the members of envisaged communities and local
    authorities, which shall form the baseline for the identification of priorities and measures to be
    included in the project.” – p. 10-11

In the calendar for drawing up an application/project proposed to be financed by EU funds, the step when
qualitative/quantitative methods are used comes before the step when participative methods are
employed. The chart below illustrates the logic sequence in which the qualitative, and participative
methods, respectively, are used. It may easily be noticed that the use of quantitative/qualitative methods
for data collection is previous to the use of participative methods. By means of the latter, the community
is consulted and involved in the discussions concerning the needs and solutions identified, in supporting
the intervention proposed in the project.

     Activities performed with a view to preparing the project, before submitting it for
              assessment and determining whether financing should be granted



The participative approach is, in substance: “A process whereby people, in particular disadvantaged, may
exercise an influence on the formulation of policies, design of alternatives and variants, performance of
investments, management and monitoring of interventions conducting in view of community
development”. (The World Bank, Discussion Paper # 183: Participative Development and the World Bank,
1992, p. 2)
Participative methods allow:
o   To supplement and examine the needs perceived by the members of the community;
o   To develop the ownership by the community in respect of the solutions proposed, facilitate their
    acceptance by the project beneficiaries;
o   To validate or not the estimated solutions depending on their social perception (also depending on
    the reasons, values, customs of the community, etc.) through:
            o   The identification of potential difficulties for implementation, preventing risks associated
                to the enforcement of certain solutions;
            o   The assessment of perceptive associations by the community with certain solutions
                proposed, drawing the hierarchy of the needs identified;
                                                                                 This is a translation from Romanian

                                                                                                     Page 64 of 220
               o    Calibration of solutions, their adjustment to the specificity of the community, rules,
                    values, symbolic universe.

4.4.2. Types of participative methods which may be used

Pursuant to the “Handbook for improving the living conditions of Roma ”52, participative methods of
consultation may be of the following type:
1.     Feedback from the public, by requesting the stakeholders to provide written comments, in respect of
       the outcome of the analysis, the needs and solutions identified, by means of online media, telephone,
       letters, email, organization of face to face meetings;
2.     Interviews in order to collect opinions concerning the outcome of the analysis;
3.     Workshops, brainstorming, designing scenarios on the implementation of the project, etc.;
4.     Meetings in the community or at the Town Hall;
5.     E-discussions (on the internet, in various on-line networks, chat rooms, etc.);
6.     Open communication with and by means of social assistants in the community.
Throughout this endeavor, one key element shall be taken into account: “The main goal of the
consultation process is to identify and clarify the interests at stake, for the final purpose of developing a
well-documented strategy or a project with good chances to be supported and implemented by the
envisaged target group of beneficiaries.
Consultation of the community is effective in seeking information, advice and opinions from the
community along the project preparation stage or where certain specific information concerning the
project is necessary. Consultations should also be viewed as an opportunity to share available information
with the stakeholders”53.

Case Studies regarding the use of participatory approaches
Participation increases the ownership of projects by identifying the stakeholders’ prio rities and their ability
to operate. However, the voices of marginalized communities to speak with a strong unified voice is
unlikely. Additionally, participative methods might already be taking a backseat given the investments and
attention needed to the quantitative and qualitative analytical phases.

One example of good practice in community participation is the project initiated by the Cluj Metropolitan
Area Association for Intercommunity Development focusing on the Pata Rât area where approximately
300 Roma families living in extreme poverty and deprivation on the edge of Cluj-Napoca, next to the
dumping ground of the city. The project was implemented from 2014-2017 and was based on the
experiences of the interventions implemented by the local UNDP team in Pata Rât in 2012-2014, which
are recognized as good practice in this field by the Council of Europe and the European Commission. The
innovative methodology of the project uses community coaching to ensure community participation,
combining the “bottom-up” approach with the “top-down” one. The implementation of the project has
been based on continuous consultation with the beneficiary communities.

A second example of community participation occurred under a housing integration project in Pécs
implemented between 2011-2015 which aimed to reduce housing segregation in 3 colonies at the
northeastern edge of Pécs, on the one hand by improving the situation of those living in the relevant
communities and on the other hand, by relocation of 35 families to an integrated environment. The Pécs
example of housing integration offers useful experience to several cities where segregated communities
had developed and in this instance was done by incorporating the UNDP "coaching" practice. The
community was mobilized - apart from helping and gradually moving back, while passing on the relevant
initiative to the community. Coaches kept in contact not only with the beneficiaries of developments but
also those who are understandably concerned about changes brought about by the relevant
development, e. g. moving disadvantaged families into the neighborhood. By personal or small-group
contacts, the mistrust arising from the lack of information and the spread of misinformation and the
resulting conflict can and should be prevented.

the needs and solutions

“B. Analysis at the level of the community was performed by participative approach to identify the
needs of the target group envisaged in the project, to identify solutions to solve problems at the
level of the marginalized community”
    The analysis at the level of the intervention area envisaged in the project is mandatory and shall be performed
    before submitting the financing request, subject to consultation with the members of the envisaged

    intervention measures included in the project.
    The solutions proposed with a view to include people facing the risk of poverty and social exclusion shall be
    fulfilled by involving local actors (including informal leaders, Roma and non-Roma), and respectively by
    involving the target group envisaged in the interventions financed under the project.

Key aspects to consider by project applicants and evaluators carrying out analyses of marginalized
communities
Applicants   The need of the community may be analyzed by using a combination of quantitative and
             qualitative data, and then validated through a participatory approach. Each of these types
             of data, quantitative or qualitative, is collected by using specific instruments such as the
             ones described in the annexes.
             The research should reflect the needs according to the 7 dimensions of the project:
             education, employment, entrepreneurship and self-employment, housing conditions, legal
             assistance provisions to settle documents, fighting against discrimination and fostering
             multiculturalism.
             The research should indicate the problems in terms of both the demand and supply of
             services/assistance for each of the 7 dimensions.
             Interest indicators should be collected at the level of the entire population in that
             community, respectively at the level of Roma population.
             The data collected shall allow at least an approximate prioritization of the identified needs.
             The data collected shall reflect the (in)existence of segregation in terms of education,
             employment, social and healthcare services, legal assistance, housing (natural, manmade
             or symbolic borders).
Evaluators   In order to understand whether the applicant identified the target groups and their needs,
             they need to find answers to the following questions in the application: (i) at the level of
             community, which are the groups at risk of poverty or social exclusion, (ii) were the needs
             and/or services necessary for these groups identified and analyzed?, (iii) were the needs
             prioritized?, and (iv) do the proposed measures contribute to problem solving? (See
             section 4.2.2.)
             To check whether the target group and its categories is well defined, the evaluators should
             check if: (i) each category of the target group is considered for at least one sub-activity
             and each sub-activity is dedicated to at least one of the categories, (ii) The number of
             potential beneficiaries (in respect to a category of the target group) is larger than the
             number of beneficiaries specified in the project, and (iii) the resources allocated for
             activities are suitable. (See section 4.2.2.)
             To check if the methodology is appropriate, the evaluators need to check if: the data
             sources were indicated, (ii) the instruments used for data collection were described, (iii)
             the respondent selection method and the people with whom meetings were held to get
             information were documented, (iv) the research results were described. (See section 4.2.2.)
             The applicant should fill in the Minimal Synthetic Fiche of the Community. (See section
             4.2.2.)
             The participatory approach for identifying needs and solutions is mandatory. To assess its
             quality, the evaluator should understand if (i) the applicants used quantitative and/or
             qualitative approach to collect data, (ii) the needs and/or the solutions were identified
             through these methods, and (iii) the authorities and/or the target groups were involved in
             the needs and solutions identification. (See section 4.4.4.)

5. Segregation of marginalized communities
The concern of segregation appeared on the public agenda upon Romania’s pre-accession to the
European Union, a period when several legislative enactments have been adopted on the prevention and
fighting against discrimination in any form. In that respect, Ordinance No 137 of 31 August 2000
(republished) on the prevention and penalty of all forms of discrimination 54 defines the concept of
discrimination as “any difference, exclusion, restriction or preference, on reasons of race, nationality,
ethnicity, language, religion, social categories, beliefs, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, non-
contagious chronic disease, HIV, inclusion into a disadvantaged category, and also any other criterion aimed
at or resulting in the restriction, precluding the recognition, use or exercise, under equal conditions, of
human rights and fundamental freedoms or of rights acknowledged by law, in the politic, economic, social
and cultural sectors or in any other field of public life.”
General Policy Recommendation No 7 of ECRI55 (European Commission Against Racism and Intolerance)
defines direct and indirect racial discrimination as follows:
o    “direct racial discrimination” shall mean any differential treatment based on a ground such as race,
     color, language, religion, nationality or national or ethnic origin, which has no objective and
     reasonable justification. Differential treatment has no objective and reasonable justification if it does
     not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the
     means employed and the aim sought to be realized ”.
o    “indirect racial discrimination” shall mean cases where an apparently neutral factor such as a
     provision, criterion or practice cannot be as easily complied with by, or disadvantages, persons
     belonging to a group designated by a ground such as race, color, language, religion, nationality or
     national or ethnic origin, unless this factor has an objective and reasonable justification. This latter
     would be the case if it pursues a legitimate aim and if there is a reasonable relationship of
     proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realized “.
Pursuant to the Handbook for Improving the Living Conditions of Roma 56 desegregation “means to undo
segregation. It is an action or process that ends the existing separation of two groups (for example, Roma
and non-Roma). For example, if disadvantaged Roma are confined to live in an isolated neighborhood
with limited interaction or communication with non-Roma, desegregation could mean making the Roma
live among non-Roma neighbors or making Roma children study in the same school with non-Roma
children. The former involves spatial desegregation while the latter involves desegregation of service
provision. Spatial desegregation can take place at the neighborhood and household levels. The former
aims to desegregate the entire neighborhood, while the latter aims to help families move into integrated
neighborhoods on a household basis. The latter approach counters the growth of segregated
neighborhoods.”

Emphasis shall be placed on the fact that there is a difference between the concept of desegregation and
that of non-segregation. Thus, „Non-segregation means to avoid creation of new segregation or
reinforcement of existing segregation. It is an approach to implementing an intervention without leading
to increased concentration or further physical isolation of Roma. For example, basic services such as
garbage collection can be extended to a segregated neighborhood on a non-segregation basis (without
increasing the concentration of Roma or physically isolating them further )” 57.
There is no clear definition in specialized literature or in the national or international legal documents on
segregation in relation to Roma population. The main element which may be found in most document
dealing with the topic of discrimination is that segregation is a severe form of discrimination.
General Policy Recommendation No 7 of ECRI58 also contains a wording defining segregation as “the act
by which a (natural or legal) person separates other persons on the basis of one of the enumerated
grounds, without an objective and reasonable justification, in conformity with the proposed definition of
discrimination. As a result, the voluntary act of separating oneself from other persons on the basis of one
of the enumerated grounds does not constitute segregation ”. In that respect, for instance, setting up
schools where teaching is in Hungarian, at the initiative of the local community, or segregation of a set of
houses upon the initiative of their owners could never the construed as segregation, within the meaning
of anti-discriminatory policies.
Segregation “is closely connected with concentration, which means that there is statistical over-
representation of a group and under-representation of another one or more groups in a certain
area”59, which will lead to several “sectors” in which such concentration may occur – education, residential,
employment, healthcare system and other public services.
Recommended desegregation measures60 for education and potential non-segregation can be correlated
to the different territorial settings such as: integrated (non-segregated) urban and suburban
neighbourhoods with segregated school(s); large deprived and segregated urban and suburban
neighbourhoods; small deprived and segregated urban and suburban neighbourhoods; small rural
localities with segregated neighbourhoods; and segregated villages/settlements in deprived micro-
regions. Education and housing are the two areas under which infrastructure measures (funded under
ERDF) and ESF measures (with or without ERDF) can contribute to desegregation.

methodology for preventing and removing segregation of Roma children in school61 states as follows:

where all subjects are taught in Romani , segregation consists in the intentional or unintentional

physical separation of Roma children from the other children in schools, classes, buildings and other
facilities, so that the ratio between the number of Roma children to non-Roma children is
disproportionately large, as compared to the percentage held by school-aged Roma children in the entire
school population in that administrative-territorial unit.”
There may be several forms of school segregation:
o   Intra-school: refers to the organization of separate classes for Roma. This form may also include
    intra-class segregation, which refers to a differentiated level of curriculum standard in the same class
    for Roma students.
o   Inter-school: may have three different sources:
    o Geographical or residential segregation among ethnic groups, so that a certain school will have a
      majority of students of a certain ethnicity; a rather frequent case is where, although there is a
      school in the neighborhood attended by all the children in the area, gradually there is a relocation
      of mainstream children to other schools, and the neighborhood school will only be left with a
      majority of Roma children;
    o Inappropriate or culturally subjective selection process leading to non-disabled children being
      allocated to schools for mentally disabled children;
    o Existence of private or religious confession institutions, where admission may only be made based
      on examination or school tuition, from which Roma children are excluded de facto because of their
      social disadvantage;
o   Individual, in the form of residence schools, this is also a frequent form of segregation, largely
    resulted from the enrolling of students depending on their residence. The peripheral location of the
    Roma community will result in the predominant enrolling of students from that community in a
    residence school which thus has a majority or in most cases exclusive attendance by students
    belonging to a certain ethnicity.

mixed school
Segregation is not per se a fundamental concern, but the association of the segregation element with that
of unequal access of children to high-quality education. Separation into kindergartens and schools/classes
invariably leads to a lower quality of education than that provided in groups, classes or schools where
there is ethnical majority of school population.
Interest of teaching personnel for classes in segregated schools is low, and therefore school segregation is
often accompanied by the presence of less trained and less motivated teaching personnel, whose
connections with the local community is scarce.
School segregation on criteria of ethnicity entails negative effects at all levels of the education system,
both for Roma and non-Roma children, and for the teaching personnel, students’ parents, communities
from where they originate and for the education system as a whole.
The main desegregation measures which may be adopted by local authorities and by the school are as
follows:
1.   Preparation and implementation of school desegregation plans;
2.   Preparing teachers for inclusive education and providing a positive multi-ethnicity environment,
     fostering diversity;
3.   Monitoring school performance and providing additional support in mainstream classes for Roma and
     non-Roma children requiring assistance;
4.   The assurance that, as long as children remain in segregated schools in their own community, the
     level of expenses, personnel relationships and standards among teaching personnel are directly
     comparable with those existing in schools from non-Roma communities;
5.   Providing accessible and affordable transportation to pick up children from localities to mainstream
     schools without a significant Roma population;
6.   Informing Roma communities on the quality of education in mixed schools and involving Roma
     parents in decisions concerning the education of children.

Residential segregation
Residential segregation of Roma communities results in a concentration of poverty, the perpetuation of
marginalization reproduction mechanisms with school non-attendance, unemployment, no utilities
(running water, electricity, heating, etc.), no easy access to public services, risk of rainfall and many others.
Residential segregation also generates a consistent decrease of social relationships with other groups and
stigma, and also the lack of successful, positive role models.
Residential segregation of Roma communities may be:
                                                                              This is a translation from Romanian

                                                                                                  Page 72 of 220
o    Unintentional – when, by their own initiative, the members of Roma communities form compact
     housing areas, separated from the other inhabitants, as a result of living circumstances varying as
     form and intensity. For instance, the Pata Rât community in Cluj Napoca (near the town landfill)
     appeared over the past 25 years, as a result of Roma losing their jobs after 1990, losing their social or
     company houses, accruing personal debt, but also because of the source of revenues, in particular the
     collection of recycling materials from the landfill.
o    Intentional – is usual the consequence of intervention by local authorities, through relocation and
     eviction. Using the same example, a part of the Pata Rât community in Cluj Napoca was relocated by
     eviction from a quasi-central area of the town. There is also another form of intentional residential
     segregation, specific rather to traditional Roma communities, who wish to have limited social
     exchanges with the neighboring population, who observe certain traditions and for which modern life
     of current society is a potential jeopardy for the status-quo of the community – for instance,
     communities of coppersmiths or Gabor.
Residential segregation results in a degradation of housing quality, restriction of facilities, access ways, the
creation of physical or mental barriers. Public services, from public lighting, to asphalt-covered roads,
running water, gas, electricity, etc., are rarely present. The existence of identification and ownership
documents is another issue, because the buildings/houses do not comply with the construction criteria for
houses and may not be granted legal permits. And, even if there is an identification document in place,
the chances for anyone labeled as originating from a Roma community to find a job decrease, because of
the current prejudice and stereotypes concerning the Roma.
Residential desegregation is a complex and time-consuming process, the removal of separation between
the two communities requires a certain balanced access to resources, and thus involving the allocation of
financial sources for public investments (access roads, facilities, etc.) able to significantly improve the
quality of life, but also increased access to jobs, education, services, etc. Virtually, any desegregation
measure shall aim at removing the causes having led to segregation, followed by non-segregation,
namely consistent measures to avoid new cases of segregation.


The desegregation includes key elements 62:
(a) Increasing awareness and consultation – it is important for both Roma and non-Roma stakeholders
who will be involved in the desegregation process to be informed about it before it begins. Knowing the
objectives, processes, and expected impacts of desegregation will increase their understanding of and
support for the intervention. Ignorance often generates concerns, uncertainty, and suspicion, which can
fuel resistance to the process. Desegregation will not succeed if stakeholders do not understand its
benefits, are disinterested in it, and fail to support it. Awareness raising and consultation are thus essential
to keep stakeholders informed, provide feedback, contribute, and have ownership of the process. In
addition, Roma families have different preferences regarding where and how they want to be resettled.
While many Roma families prefer to live in mixed neighborhoods, there are also families that do not feel
comfortable or ready to live next to non-Roma neighbors in the immediate future, partially out of fear of
being mistreated by the latter. They usually prefer to integrate voluntarily at a pace at which they feel
comfortable (such was the case in Project Brief 23, Italy). More detailed information and good practices on
stakeholder consultation are discussed in Module 3 in Good Practice Note 1: Engaging Local

Communities.
(b) Preserving supportive social networks - a resettled Roma family risks losing the positive social ties to
other Roma families it enjoyed in its old neighborhood. Social networks often serve as a safety net in
difficult times through mutual help and support. Many Roma families work with and mutually support
extended families and friends; losing access to these relationships could increase their vulnerability to
shocks such as loss of income or health problems. Therefore, it is important for desegregation measures
to avoid disrupting such networks. Often times, enabling better access to mainstream social support
services can at least partially replace such networks’ roles, but interventions should still include actions to
create and restore positive social ties in the new community. Interventions should also consider the
possibility that tensions might exist between various Roma groups; simply creating a blended community
of different Roma and non-Roma residents might not work.
(c) Enhancing cultural competency and combatting discrimination - decades of segregation may have
hindered interaction and communication between Roma and non-Roma, making mutual understanding
between the groups difficult. Different customs, perceptions, and circumstances may lead each group to
behave differently, which could make it difficult for the other group to understand or accept. Such
differences could lead to misunderstandings, mistrust, and mutual disapproval, fueling tensions and
conflicts between different groups. These perceptions and attitudes could also result in discrimination. It is
important to increase both groups’ capacity to understand and respect their differences through
interaction, training, and awareness activities. In addition, when a Roma or a non-Roma is moved to a new
neighborhood, they need to be familiarized with the new community’s rules and accepted codes of
conduct. Activities that facilitate and promote interaction or cooperation between Roma and non-Roma
can also play an instrumental role in fostering mutual understanding and respect between the two
groups. Increasing the general appreciation for Roma cultures can also boost their self-esteem and
empower them to take a more affirmative and active role in social and economic life.
(d) Mediating conflicts and communication gaps - a mediation service should be provided to help resolve
or ease conflicts or tensions that arise from groups’ differences in customs, codes of conduct, perceptions,
and values (for example, between Roma and non-Roma, and between different Roma groups). Mediators
and social workers can also serve as a bridge between disadvantaged Roma and public officials or service
providers; they can improve their communication and enhance both the quality and uptake of social
services. Roma health mediators are a good example throughout the region.
(e) Restoring or improving income-generation activities - if desegregation requires resettling Roma from a
segregated neighborhood to a non-segregated one, Roma families would be required to find new sources
of income. Often, housing and other living costs are higher in non-segregated neighborhoods, and Roma
will need to earn more than they did in their old neighborhood, where they likely relied on readily
available resources in the neighborhood such as cultivable land, water (from a river or lake), the forest, or
in extreme cases, landfills—none of these may be available in the new neighborhood.
Moreover, the types of skills and knowledge they used to make a living in the segregated neighborhood
might not be suited to the types of livelihood and income-generation opportunities in the new
neighborhood. Assistance would be therefore required to help resettled Roma gain adequate skills to
adapt to new livelihood options and employment opportunities. It could include vocational training, non-
cognitive skills employment training, and job search assistance.
(f) Improving connectivity - while spatial desegregation is generally associated with resettling segregated
people into mixed neighborhoods, depending on the context of the community, segregation may be
addressed by enhancing the segregated neighborhood’s connectivity to a broader community (improving
public transportation and roads, removing physical barriers), increasing access to basic services via
                                                                              This is a translation from Romanian

neighborhood upgrading (for example, water, sewerage, and electricity) and thereby making the
neighborhood an integral part of the wider community. Depending on the context of the community,
tailored upgrading of services might be a more efficient and feasible solution to improving the
connectivity and living conditions of disadvantaged Roma than resettling them to a different
neighborhood.

Tackling education and spatial segregation
The Guidance for Member States on the use of European Structural and Investment Funds in tackling
educational and spatial segregation63 takes into consideration the EU legislation and policy framework to
assist the relevant public administration bodies of Member States, and in particular managing authorities,
in effectively designing and implementing the investments to address the education and housing needs
of marginalized communities, Roma and non-Roma, financed by the ESI Funds in the 2014-2020 period.


Based on the EU Guidance64, a checklist for proposals recommends in developing the calls to take into
consideration the following aspects:
1. Is the call for proposal in line with National Roma Integration Strategy and Country Specific
Recommendations?
2. Will the call for proposal contribute to the output indicators of the relevant programmes?
3. Does the managing authority have a definition of segregation of marginalized groups in education and
housing and pre-defined indicators to measure the segregation?
4. Does the call for proposal explicitly address the problem of segregation of marginalized groups?
5. Does the call for proposal explicitly exclude support for actions resulting in segregation of marginalized
groups?
6. Does the call for proposal require demonstration of alignment of the actions with local and regional
development strategy in place, which addresses social inclusion and desegregation of marginalized
groups?
7. Does the call for proposal require justification of proposed non-segregation actions, which:
a. demonstrates that desegregation of marginalized groups is not possible?
b. the action leads to desegregation of marginalized groups in longer term?
c. the action is complemented with desegregation activities related to marginalized groups?
8. Does the call for proposal include indicators to monitor desegregation effect of the actions specifically
on marginalized groups?
9. Was the call for proposal consulted with representatives of marginalized groups or stakeholders having
knowledge of the target groups’ needs (such as academia, NGOs, specialized think -tanks or possible
beneficiaries working with the target groups)?
10. Does the call for proposal require delivery of supporting activities to ensure effective desegregation of
marginalized groups?

Criteria to identify segregation
The Guide for Applicants for call 4.1 addresses the topic of segregation as follows: “Many of such
marginalized areas may be segregated (separated from the rest of the community). The boundaries
between the segregated community and the mainstream community may be natural boundaries (for
instance, a river, a hill, etc.), manmade boundaries (for instance, a wall, a fence, etc.) or symbolic (for
instance, the inhabitants of a certain street may consider themselves segregated, separated from the rest
of the community, there is no social interaction between them and the neighbors).”
Furthermore, Annex B Minimal Synthetic Sheet for the Community from the Guide for Applicants for
Specific Objectives 4.1 and 4.2 identifies elements that should be taken into consideration in terms of
school or residential segregation:
                         The definition and issues detailed in Annex B shall be taken into account.
                         Where there is spatial segregation, at least the following elements shall be
                         described: distance to the nearest locality or to the locality providing services
                         such as education, healthcare, jobs; the existence of physical or symbolic
  Spatial                barriers; social distance – quality (cooperation, conflicts, indifference, etc.) and
  segregation            quantity (most interactions of the members of the segregated group are also
                         with members of the segregated groups or with members of the community
                         between the segregated group and the mainstream community); concentration
                         degree (percentage) of Roma or segregated vulnerable group in the envisaged
                         territory and percentage of Roma in other areas/neighborhoods of the
                         administrative-territorial unit.
                         The definition and issues detailed in Annex B shall be taken into account.
                         Where there is school segregation, please describe at least the following
                         elements: percentage of Roma or percentage of members from another
  School                 segregated vulnerable group in the school/class, percentage of the same
  segregation            segregated group in the envisaged community and percentage of the same
                         group in other schools/classes servicing that community; distance to school,
                         distance expressed as the time spent by the child in travelling to school (return
                         route). It is also encouraged to describe other issues (quality of education,
                         school endowments, etc.), depending on the specificity of each community.


Thus, consideration shall be given to several indicators in connection with the segregation:
Type of segregation     Indicators
Segregated school       Percentage of Roma in the school as compared to the percentage of Roma in the
                        school district

                        Whether there are means of transportation to employment opportunities

Analysis of project proposals based on the non-segregation principle
During the assessment of project proposals, elements relating to various forms of segregation shall be
taken into account. Thus, as indicated by the Ministry of European Funds in Annex 4 – General
considerations on the compliance with the principles of non-segregation and desegregation65 in the
Annex to new call for projects Program “SCHOOL FOR EVERYONE” (OPHC, Specific goals 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.6),
shall comply with the European Commission principles on la non-segregation and desegregation:
1.   “Non-segregation – structural and investment funds may not be used in order to create new
     segregated facilities/services, or to develop/maintain the already segregated ones. Investments in
     housing or education may not result in isolation or concentration of vulnerable groups in certain
     areas.
2.   Desegregation –structural and investment funds may only be used in order to remove or significantly
     decrease segregation. Activities ought to concern the resettlement of inhabitants from segregated
     areas to non-segregated communities and relocation of children from segregated schools/classes.”

Key aspects to consider by project applicants and evaluators carrying out analyses of marginalized
communities
Applicants   The applicant should identify whether the community is segregated or not from the
             different areas (housing, education, employment etc.).
             The new activities of the project should not be used to create new segregated
             facilities/services or to develop/maintain the already segregated ones.
             In the case there is already segregation, a part of the structural and investment funds
             should be used in order to remove or significantly decrease segregation.

             Is there a plan for school desegregation or is such a plan intended to be prepared?

             Are the activities aimed at decreasing or removing the gap relating to the existence
             and quality of education services?

             Are the activities aimed at decreasing or removing the physical distance between
             the marginalized community and the rest of the community?

             Existing welfare services and services newly developed by means of the project are
             not addressed exclusively to people from the vulnerable group?

             Are there activities jointly performed by the members of the segregated vulnerable
             group and of the mainstream community, aimed at improving the relationship
             between the two communities?


Evaluators   The new activities of the project should not be used to create new segregated
             facilities/services or to develop/maintain the already segregated ones.

6. Identification of the ethnicity of the community members
and potential fields of specific intervention
Official data derived from Population and House Census 66 of 2011 reveals that the Roma population in
Romania is growing. As it may be noticed from the table below, 3.2% of Romania’s population declare
that they belong to the Roma ethnicity, on the rise from the 2002 Census, when the percentage was 2.5%.
Various sociological research conducted in the past years attribute such growth both to the higher
birthrate among the Roma, and to an increase in the number of people self-identifying as Roma in the
official context of population census.

Census data

The Population and Houses Census of 201167 collected data in connection with the ethnic-cultural
features and, more specifically, respondents were asked “To which ethnicity does the person considers
belonging to?”.
The working alternatives of the census operator, to identify a Roma (code 1200 – Roma) were the
following: 1201– Roma, 1202 – băieş, 1203 – boldean, 1204 – caştal, 1205 – tinker (căldărar), 1206 –
cărămidar, 1207 - cocalar, 1208 - gabor, 1209 – horse dealers (geambaş), 1210 – lăieş, 1211 – fiddler
(lăutar), 1212 - pletos, 1213 – rudar, 1214 – tinsmith (spoitor), 1215 – gypsy (ţigan), 1216 –gypsy silk trader
(ţigan de mătase), 1217 – bear trader (ursar), 1218 – vătraş, 1219 – zavragiu.
Here is a variety of names which were associated to the Roma ethnicity upon the performance of the
Census. And speaking of diversity, an analysis may be made of each of these groups or tribes of Roma,
leaving from their traditional characteristics, whether they speak Romani or not or a dialect, etc. In the
current context, the traditional tribe does not seem to be very lively in the consciousness of a large
number of the Roma population68 in Romania, that is why the researchers decided to focus in their study
on the diversity of Roma communities.
Thus, the diversity of these communities may be analyzed in light of elements such as:
o    Whether there are any characteristics of traditional life;
o    Self-identification as belonging to the Roma ethnicity in public and private contexts;
o    Hetero-identification from other populations with which they come into contact;

o      Level of speaking Romani;
o      In the analysis of Roma populations, five ethnical levels can be identified for Roma69: Roma with all of
       the traditional characteristics and self-identifying as such in all circumstances (official, administrative
       and informal);
o      Roma with all of the traditional ethnical characteristics and who are also identified as Roma by the
       others when seeing their lifestyle, but not self-identified in official-administrative circumstances;
o      “Emancipated” Roma who changed their lifestyle towards the modern, who no longer reveal visible
       indications of the traditional lifestyle, self-identified among themselves as Roma, both in official
       context, and informally and identified by the others as Roma as a result of their own identification
       (Roma activists, culture figures, Roma business men, etc.);
o      “Emancipated” Roma, tending not to self-identify as Roma, or who sometimes do and sometimes
       don’t and whom the other may identify or not as Roma;
o      “Former Roma”, who integrated in the mainstream population up to the disappearance of distinctive
       traits, and who do not even identify themselves as Roma.
Starting from this model, potential fields of social intervention may be identified according to the below
table.
It becomes obvious from this classification that emancipated Roma (category D – tending not to self-
identify as Roma) and Roma integrated in mainstream population (category E) cannot truly be deemed as
member of the Roma community, as they are no longer familiar with the specific problems of Roma
communities.
There is a quasi-general agreement of political leaders, researchers, international institutions that, in
reality, there is a larger number of Roma people than as officially registered. A sociological study
conducted by the World Bank estimates 70, in the minimum scenario, 730,174 Roma, and in the maximum
one 968,275 Roma. Other estimates refer to more than one million Roma and even reach as far as more
than two million Roma.
The issues facing Roma communities in Romania today are rooted in the historical discrimination and
social exclusion, in the traditional lifestyle and certain values of the community that no longer coordinate
with the trends and standards of the current society. Sociological studies and official statistical data reveal
that Roma is the population facing an extremely high risk of poverty and social exclusion.
The vicious circle of poverty keeps Roma in situations of social exclusion, from the legal/democratic
system, through employment and social security, up to family and community system 71. Consequences are
as varied as may be, from no participation in the election process, difficult access to healthcare services
and other welfare services, not being employed in the legal labor market, challenging housing conditions,
hampered access to education, decrease of solidarity within the community, etc.

Self-identification versus hetero-identification
In light of the negative connotations associated to the Roma ethnicity, self-identification as Roma is a
challenging matter, with many of the Roma avoiding potential labels and stigma associated to the word
Roma.
In the paper “Vino mai aproape. Incluziunea si excluziunea romilor in societatea românească de azi”72, the
authors, quoting a reference study in the field 73, state the following in respect of hetero-identification of
Roma interviewees:
o    “almost everyone identifying themselves as Roma is hetero-identified as Roma;
o    Individuals self-identified as Roma are fewer than the group hetero-identified as such: approximately
     10% of the respondents in Romania who self-identified as non-Roma were still designated as Roma by
     the interviewers;
o    The external features of the individual impact the likelihood of their being hetero-identified as Roma:
     living in a settlement (perceived as) majority Roma / gypsy, low education level (primary school or less),
     number of persons in the household and low income increase the likelihood of being defined as Roma;
o    Living in an area populated by Roma increases that likelihood twelve-fold, lack of education
     approximately three-fold, whole poverty and crowdedness – each approximately 1.5 times.”
Sociological research conducted in the past 20 years have revealed a certain evolution in the approach.
Whereas, in the beginning, we can talk about a prevalence of researches where hetero-identification was
the most used and considered acceptable method, later on researches became more sophisticated in their
sampling methodology.
This also occurred in the context of more and more Roma ethnic researchers or activists, who pointed to
the collection of ethnically segregated data. The positive outcome is that all researchers in the past years
mainly employed the identification model for Roma respondents by self-identification.
There are certain working alternatives in which at first, in the first stage of sampling, hetero-identification
is used, however, in the on-site data collection stage, only data from people who self-identify as Roma
shall be used. Various methods are used in the first stage, from census data to data collection from the
local public administration structures, local experts for Roma, health mediators, school mediators, county
offices for Roma, etc. Another often seen practice is creating samples (non-representative at a national
level for instance) of non-Roma population, who could provide interesting comparative data as to the
differences between Roma and non-Roma at the level of local communities where they co-exist.
In the sociological research endeavors, we may find various types of questions leading to data on the
Roma ethnicity:
      Questions                          Remarks
      Do you belong to the Roma          Affirmative answer or negative answer or no answer

Calculating the number/percentage of Roma as required by the Guide for Applicants for
specific objectives 4.1 and 4.2.
As indicated in the program documents of MFE74, in the performance of community studies, preliminary
analyses on the community, various data sources may be used. It is highly important to specify that the
data provided in such community studies is the one to be used in order to support the intervention, so
that, starting from the issues identified, to be able to find the best solutions to improve the condition of
the community or communities.
The percentage of Roma people may vary, depending on the source of the data, so that census data is no
longer sufficient. At a local level, there may be statistical data deriving from previous scientific researches
or data collected by structures of public administration or other structures and public institutions – the
National Institute of Statistics / County Statistical Directorates, Directorates for Welfare and Child Protection,
Directorates for Public Health, Welfare Services, Local Police, etc.

It may be noticed that three data sources are indicated, in particular:
1.   Census:
     o   Total Roma and non-Roma population, as per the 2011 Census, with additional data regarding
         the number of adults and children;
     o   In accordance with http://www.recensamantromania.ro/noutati/volumul-ii-populatia-stabila-
         rezidenta-structura-etnica-and-confesionala/, general Census data may rather easily be identified
         in various localities; the data that may be thus obtained tend to other details referring to the
         employment status, education level, use of mother tongue, religion, etc.;
2.   Town Hall: the data provided by the Town Hall may be completely different, as regards the
     percentage of Roma population, however, the assessments made by the above-mentioned structure
     may be extremely relevant, in particular in the context of the migration process; at this level, data is
     most of the times provided by the local expert on Roma matters, health mediator or school mediator,
     where any such exist, or by the Public Welfare Services or for the protection of children’s rights, Police,
     etc.;
3.   Roma leaders: Roma leaders are Romanian nationals of Roma ethnicity residing in the locality/area
     for intervention and exercising some form of authority over the population residing in the locality and
     who officially or non-officially represent them, in liaising with other social actors. In certain localities,
     we may also identify elected Roma local counselors, representative of the Roma Party or of other
     political or non-governmental organizations of Roma.
On the other hand, we may refer to the data deriving from the reference study, by on-site research
activities, and in that case the research activities are performed by the applicant, in reliance upon a
questionnaire or other data collection methods.
Depending on the size of target communities, the on-site research may take into consideration the
population as a whole or a sample thereof. Quantitative data may be additional to other data acquired
through qualitative methods.
Seeking to draw a hierarchy of data sources, there may be:

It is useful for the applicant to use estimates as to the percentage of Roma people in the community from
various sources - NIS census, estimates of leaders in the Roma community and estimates of the Town Hall.
The principle in selecting the percentage actually used for the classification of the community relates to
two criteria. It is advisable a) to remember the percentage relying on the most extensive methodological,
scientific, explicit support and which b) involves, to the largest extent, self-identification, not hetero-
identification in terms of ethnicity. Estimates of the belief or consideration type (“I know”, “we know or we
believe” that there are that number of Roma) rather rely of a subjective assessment basis.

7. Impact assessment and project sustainability
An impact evaluation assesses changes in the well-being of individuals, households, communities or firms
that can be attributed to a particular project, program or policy. The central impact evaluation question is
what would have happened to those receiving the intervention if they had not in fact received the
program. Impact evaluation is aimed at providing feedback to help improve the design of programs and
policies. In addition to providing for improved accountability, impact evaluations are a tool for dynamic
learning, allowing policymakers to improve ongoing programs and ultimately better allocate funds across
programs.
Many institutions and project managers are reluctant to carry out impact evaluations because they are
deemed to be expensive, time consuming, technically complex, and because the findings can be politically
sensitive, particularly if they are negative. Many evaluations have also been criticized because the results
come too late, do not answer the right questions, or were not carried out with sufficient analytical rigor. A
further constraint is often the limited availability and quality of data. Yet with proper and early planning,
the support of policy makers, and a relatively small investment compared to overall project cost, a
rigorous evaluation can be very powerful in assessing the appropriateness and effectiveness of programs.
Information generated by impact evaluations informs decisions on whether to expand, modify, or
eliminate a particular policy or program and can be used in prioritizing public actions. In addition, impact
evaluations contribute to improve the effectiveness of policies and programs.
Impact evaluations demand a substantial amount of information, time and resources. Therefore, it is
important to select carefully the interventions that will be evaluated and a set of four key questions can
guide the decision of when to conduct an impact evaluation: (i) Is the policy or program considered to be
of strategic relevance for poverty reduction?; (ii) Is the intervention testing an innovative approach to
poverty reduction?; (iii) Is there sufficient evidence that this type of intervention works well in a number of
different contexts?; (iv) When do we expect outcomes to show an effect?
As a component of the monitoring and evaluation process, impact evaluations are an essential instrument
to test the validity of specific approaches to development and poverty alleviation. Impact evaluations help
those involved on a project to establish whether or not there is a causal link between an intervention and
those outcomes that are of importance to the policymaker. The counterfactual analysis used by impact
evaluations is a critical tool for assessing the effectiveness of development interventions. By providing
critical feedback with respect to what works and what does not, impact evaluations can help to solidify a
results-based project structure.
In order to measure the impact of an intervention, a clear, well-designed evaluation strategy is necessary.
Incorporating an impact evaluation into a development program requires a well-structured monitoring
and evaluation plan. Every impact evaluation requires a specific methodological design, many of which are
described on this site. Through conversations among project managers, government officials, and
researchers, the appropriate methodology is chosen and incorporated into the monitoring and evaluation
process.
Impact evaluations fit into the chain of monitoring and evaluation process in several ways:
       they help to assess the casual link between an intervention and an outcome of interest;
       impact evaluations provide baseline evidence for the effectiveness of an intervention, which can
        be compared with other similar interventions; through this process, impact evaluations assist in
        establishing credible cost-effectiveness comparisons;

          impact evaluations can serve to build the knowledge base of what works in development. With
           and increasing demand for evidence of aid effectiveness, rigorous evaluations offer a method
           through which development successes can be highlighted.


7.1. Project sustainability, context and stake
Often times, while implementing a project, the management team places the priority and even exclusive
focus on the implementation process, the performance of activities in accordance with the project goals,
fulfillment of project markers and strict compliance with bureaucratic and legal regulations. The rationale
underlying this approach is quite comprehensible: the consequences of the failure to strictly observe
formal rules undertaken in the project, upon granting financing, may result in the invalidation of certain
expenses, engaged amounts, which amounts to a risk of financial deadlock and, implicitly, organizational
bankruptcy. In other words, there is a sustainability problem for the implementing organization and,
obviously, this substantially concerns the project management.
However, together with the sustainability of the organization, there is also the matter of sustainability of
the intervention enforced as part of the project. This takes, in substance, a stake higher than anything else,
because sustainability is the key item revealing, in the end, whether the implemented projects were
successful or not. The projects financed through structural instruments have a limitation of principle, with
fundamental implications: they have, from the very beginning, a fixed lifetime, an average of maximum 3-
5 years.
The key question to be asked is what happens to the activities organized as part of the project, after its
completion? What happens to the beneficiaries of these projects? What happens to other potential
beneficiaries of future generations, who will live in the project intervention area? What about other
potential beneficiaries (vulnerable people) living in other areas, where no project was implemented
providing support? Could the project contribute to the welfare of these beneficiaries, even after its
completion?
Providing answers to the questions above means, in fact, wondering on the sustainability of the effects
entailed by the implemented project. Sustainability should refer, in fact, to the following matters:
o      Ways to carry on the support intervention granted during the performance of the project and after its
       completion, with autonomous/independent resources from those engaged by means of the project;
o      The extent to which the effects or impact of the project intervention take, in themselves, other
       desirable effects, likely to contribute to a long-term outcome, after completion of the project, in
       support of the project’s beneficiaries or other potential beneficiaries;
o      Ways whereby the intervention enforced by means of the project may be multiplied, replicated on a
       larger scale, by identifying the necessary resources.
In this respect, each project is expected to take into consideration, to provide for mechanisms or an exit
strategy for the interventions enforced in the project even after the completion thereof, if necessary by
their multiplication or replication at a larger scale.
A material prepared under the World Bank and the European Commission emphasized the potential
elements of a diagnosis instrument in respect of the sustainability of a project75. The instrument contains
key-questions, which could guide the assessment on the sustainability of a project towards certain issues,
types of potential risks associated, risk mitigation methods, examples of best practices. We recommend

this bibliographic source as an excellent means to analyze the sustainability of effects entailed by a certain
project.
The Handbook for improving the living conditions of Roma identifies the main risk types for the
sustainability of a project the following:
o    Lack of awareness, among people of the target group and other categories outside of it (for instance,
     non-Roma population), project implementation and intervention features;
o    Reduced ability by the target population to pay for the services supplied in the project;
o    Inappropriate organizational capacity and lack of participation by the members of the community, of
     the target group;
o    High opportunity and trading costs (challenges in accessing the services proposed in the project, no
     time for or poor adjustment of the project activities to the daily/seasonal program of potential
     beneficiaries, degree of comfort experienced by the target population in accessing the services and
     facilities provided in the project, etc.)
o    Lack of civil documents (birth certificate, identification card, ownership documents) preventing access
     to project services and facilities;
o    Feelings of mistrust and grudge in intra-group relationships (between Roma and non-Roma, for
     instance), low acceptance of diversity.
o    Sustainability of a project’s effects substantially depends on the management of certain risks, such as
     the ones described above.
It is also important to pursue the multiplying effect of a project, the extent to which the intervention
practice proposed therein may be continued and replicated at a larger scale, in public policies, in the long
term. However, this requires a project impact assessment, to identify the best practices and appropriately
support them (through advocacy campaigns etc.).


7.2. Impact evaluation
Assessing the impact entailed by projects/programs/interventions is often seen as a marginal activity in
the economy of intervention implementation. This also happens because, in many financing guidelines,
this activity is not eligible for financing. Nevertheless, the importance of assessing the impact of a project
is overwhelming, as clearly proven by consistent bibliographical sources 76.
To put it simply, “the impact evaluation reveals the changes at the level of individuals’ welfare which may
be attributed to a certain project, program or policy”77. Where the changes brought about by the
project/program/policy are as expected, positive, this becomes an argument for the intervention to be

replicated at a larger scale, in relation to a much larger group of beneficiaries, even to become a public
policy, undertaken and developed by the government, dedicated to all those requiring such support.
Where the intervention did not have the expected results, a lesson is learned of how not to approach a
certain target group, to look for a type of alternative intervention, more efficient and more effective. The
importance of impact evaluation in relation to an intervention becomes, therefore, obvious. It may lead to
a multiplication of the number of beneficiaries in a certain target group, and implicitly to the resolution of
social concerns, at a larger scale.
At this point, a very significant distinction is to be made. Impact assessment is different from other types
of assessments, familiar to those who have analyzed or implemented projects, such as, for instance,
descriptive evaluation or normative evaluation78. Descriptive evaluation only describes what has happened
before, during and after the completion of a project, reflecting the implementation process; normative
evaluation compares the expected results against the actual results; on the other hand, impact evaluation
“examines the causal relationship between an intervention and the measured results. In other words, impact
evaluation intends to answer one question: what is the impact (or causal effect) of a project in an outcome of
interest?”79
Impact evaluation brings added knowledge, is a research endeavor, undertaken in accordance with
scientific practices, in order to have validity. Therefore, this process involves the use of solid arguments,
based on a well-structured methodology (and documented in the relevant literature). Furthermore, it is
obvious that such an endeavor requires extensive expertise and rather consistent resources – and thus,
there are many cases in which the interventions performed are not accompanied by impact evaluation,
losing the opportunity to identify the ”best practice” or, why not, the ”bad practice”.
Impact evaluation may not occur without the collection of data/information from the social reality, from
the context where the intervention is to take place. Additionally, the collection of such data shall be
performed in observance of a certain methodology.
These are the key elements defining the impact evaluation methodology:
1.     Who is the data collected from?
2.     What data is collected?
3.     When is the data collected, at what time?
4.     How is the data collected?

Who is the data collected from?
Data is collected, first and foremost, from the project beneficiaries, but this is not enough. For an
appropriate implementation of impact evaluation, data also needs to be collected from non-beneficiaries
of the intervention, people who receive no support through the project. In the specific wording of the
impact evaluation methodology, the group of beneficiaries shall consist of the experimental group
(meaning the group comprising the recipients of a certain intervention), and the group of non-
beneficiaries shall be the control group (used in order to compare/report on the dynamics of the
experimental group). People making up the control group shall, however, be selected further to a specific
random procedure. Impact evaluation answers the question: what would have happened to the
experimental group if the intervention/project had not taken place? This answer may be reached, in fact,
by comparing the evolution of the group in which the intervention takes place (experimental group)

against the evolution of a group of people who follow a natural evolution, not benefiting from the
intervention (control group). Nevertheless, in order for the results of this comparison to be valid, people in
the two groups (experimental and control) need to be similar in terms of socio-demographic profile.

What data is collected?
In order to be able to appropriately draw comparisons between the experimental and the control group, it
is necessary to collect, above all, specific socio-demographic data that is relevant, in accordance with
previous evidence, the results of intervention (for instance, in respect of an intervention in the education
field, it is necessary to collect data such as level of parents’ education, poverty risk for the family, financial
ability by the family to appropriately support the educational process, cultural capital of the family, etc.).
Another data category that bears high importance allows to characterize the results/effects at the level of
beneficiaries. For instance, in the case of an intervention at the level of students, academic performance
shall be measured by means of an identical test and under the same conditions both to the experimental
and to the control group. As regards a program in the healthcare field, the measured results may consist
of health condition, prevalence of certain healthy behaviors, existence of certain diseases/disorders (such
as obesity etc.). Other data may also be collected, such as opinions of beneficiaries, their family on certain
relevant key issues.
There are, in the specific literature, several categories of established, tested, validated indicators, which
may be trustworthy in describing the status of a certain group at a certain point in time. For instance, a
manual published under the aegis of the World Bank and European Commission proposes a set of
indicators which could be used in order to characterize the condition of Roma depending on key
parameters, such as education, employment, health, housing80. For instance, at the level of education,
such an indicator specified in the above-mentioned source is “% of Roma children who drop out of
preschool/primary/secondary/vocational school in project areas (as a result of project interventions)”. In the
Annexes there is an indicative list of indicators proposed for the evaluation of project activities (Annex 15:
Indicators useful in evaluating project activities).

When is the data collected, at what time?
In order for the results of the impact evaluation to be valid, data shall be collected from both groups
(experimental and control) both before the intervention, and after its completion. It is advisable to further
collect data at an interim time, in particular when the duration of the intervention is longer. The evolution
forming the object of comparison between the two specified groups (experimental and control) refers to
the changes occurred between time t0 – before the intervention – and time tf – after the intervention was
completed (and, where necessary, at an interim time ti).

How is the data collected?
Data is collected by using quantitative research instruments, settled in socio-humanistic sciences.
Questionnaires are such an instrument. The factual situation whose change is aimed by the results may be
measured through standardized tests (knowledge, medical etc.).
It is also worth mentioning that the analysis of data collected for the purpose of impact evaluation in
relation to the project requires extensive expertise and statistical skills, including the use of statistical
analysis software. Furthermore, in order for the best practices identified to be multiplied, the results of the

Key aspects to consider by project applicants and evaluators carrying out analyses of marginalized
communities
Applicants   The applicant should think carefully from the outset not only about the way the activities
             should be delivered during the project implementation, but also about their sustainability
             after the project closes. Examples of questions to be asked: what happens to the activities
             delivered and infrastructure developed during the project, what happens to the
             beneficiaries of the project, what happens to other potential beneficiaries of future
             generations?
             The project should focus not only on carrying out activities but also on having a real
             impact on the communities. Ideally, the applicant should also consider measuring the
             impact on the community during the project implementation.
Evaluators   The evaluators should assess whether the applicant made a realistic justification of the
             sustainability of the project after its closure.
             The evaluators should check whether the project aims to have any impact on the
             communities (it would not only have outputs but will also change the outcomes for the
             communities on the domains relevant to the project – employment, education, social
             services etc.).

Annex 1: Pointers for filling in “Appendix B: Minimal synthetic
community sheet”
General Aspects
1. The sheet needs to be filled in for each of the targeted communities / areas, with data regarding the
   community / field of intervention targeted under the project. This is clear from the very title of the
   sheet - what is aimed is the community, not the commune (village). If data pertaining to the area of
   intervention cannot be identified using the official statistical data, scientific research data or data
   acquired through own field research, then data / assessments obtained from the Territorial
   Administrative Unit are accepted, from which the area intervention has been extracted. The data
   provided by the Territorial Administrative Unit have some relevance in describing the area of
   intervention incorporated to it, but the Territorial Administrative Unit has no responsibility in
   collecting data, neither do they have the infrastructure or know-how specific to a scientific data
   collection process.
2. Source of data:
   a) official data. According to the Guide for Applicants for Specific Objectives 4.1 and 4.2, page 11, it
        is accepted to use the administrative data of the relevant entities ( for instance: The National
        Institute for Statistics / County Statistics Departments; Social and Child Protection Departments;
        Public Health Departments; Public Social Services; Local Police, etc.), with the list being merely
        exemplifying. The Administrative Territorial Unit/ Town Hall is not among the sources of official
        data explicitly listed as accepted, but we can admit that it is a possible, relevant source.
   b) data of scientific research. The guide does not define the expression "scientific research", but it
        does entail a specific method, a research approach that follows the habitual practice of a certain
        discipline. Examples include a published study; an article published in a scientific magazine; the
        report of a research project.
   c) data obtained from reference research through field research activities. This describes
        research activities carried out by the applicant, by their own initiative. Details on how to organise
        the reference research are included in presentations given by quantitative data experts.

”The data used in the analysis must be: statistical data resulting from scientific research, or
administrative data of the relevant entities (for example: The National Institute for Statistics / County
Statistics Departments; the Social and Child Protection Departments; the Public Health Departments; the
Public Social Services; the Local Police etc.) and/or data obtained from the reference research through
field research activities.” (p.11, Guide for Applicants, Specific Requirements)

Observation: the guide does not tackle on a prioritisation of the data depending on the source, therefore
the applicant may present data from whatever source they deem appropriate, even if he has several
sources available, presenting different values.
3. Filling in Appendix B is compulsory, according to the provisions on page 10 in the Guide. It is not
specified explicitly that all the fields of Appendix B have to be filled in. According to the Guide - see below
- Appendix B is deemed as filled in if it includes a summary of the minimum quantifiable elements based
on which the community evaluation will be developed.
Filling in Appendix B: The minimal synthetic community chart - which includes a summary of the
minimum quantifiable elements based on which the community evaluation will be developed.p.10

Filling in Appendix B:
Demographics.
a) Determining the area of intervention. This is where the area of intervention will be described, by
     mentioning the streets and marks (i.e. lake; bridge; railway; national road, etc.) that enclose it. The
     names used can be the official ones and/of the popular ones / used by the locals (ex. ... uphill, ... at
     the mill, etc.). Enclose the map of the settlement, on which the area of intervention can be identified.
b) Inventory of households with street names. Specify the streets - with their official name - inside the
     area of intervention and the number of households within the area of intervention. Presenting the
     source of the data (number of households) is not required in this context, but this is considered in the
     provisions of the Guide (p. 11).



                         Determine the area of
                         intervention (and enclose the
1.        DEMOGRAPHICS   map)                              (description)


                         Inventory of households with      (description of households)
                         street name

                                                                                                      Name of street                                          No. households




Population.
a) Total population acc. Census 2011, breakdown per ethnic groups. Keep in mind that many settlements
   will have a number of people about whom the information regarding their ethnic group was not
   possible to obtain.
b) Total population according to Town Hall estimations.
c) Total population according to Roma leaders. Roma leaders are Romanian citizens of the Roma ethnic
   group, residing in the settlement/area of intervention, who exert some form of authority over the
   population residing in the settlement, who represent them formally or informally in relation to other
   stakeholders.

Observation: The data presented are with respect to the area of intervention, not to the entire Territorial
Administrative Unit (when the two are different). If however, distinct data cannot be obtained for the area
of intervention, data for the overall Territorial Administrative Unit that the area of intervention belongs to
are useful too. The key thing: the data are not only presented because the Guide requires so, but in order
to be used in the process of validating and substantiating the intervention, to show that the needs and
the solutions selected relied on actual data. Census data can be different from the data provided by the
town hall or the local leaders.

Education. Three categories of information are envisaged here:
a) Data regarding the school population and infrastructure in the area of intervention / settlement (no.
   of pupils; dropout rates; no. of schools; no. of kindergartens). Ideally consider the school/s and the
   kindergarten/s that serve the greatest number of pupils / preschool children in the area of
   intervention / settlement. Comments can be added in this section, and relevant aspects can be
   described narratively. Mentioning the definition of school dropout as understood by the beneficiary
   when specifying the rate of this phenomenon would be a plus. If there are several schools /
   kindergartens serving the area of intervention, it is useful to insert comments on the distance to
   cover, the number of children attending each of these units, etc.
b) Children who do not attend any form of education, although they are of school age. Considering the
   dynamics of migration, the errors in recording and keeping track of people, etc., it is possible that
   these data are less accurate. Substantiated estimates can be used as well (for instance, starting from
   the size of the cohorts, considering certain migration rates, etc.)
c) Distance to the nearest high school in relation to the area of intervention Even in the urban
   environment, certain areas on the outskirts can be at considerable distance from the nearest high
   school. It is also the place to indicate the name of the high school, its educational profile, etc.

Employment.
a. Data regarding employment: rates of unemployed population; number of employed; unemployment
   rates. According to the NIS (the TEMPO database),” The rate of employment of labour resources is the
     ratio, expressed in percents, between the civilian employed population and the labour resources ”. Official
     data per settlement from public organisations can be presented (such as data from the County
     Employment Agency), or data resulting from own calculations of the team that develops the project.

b. Traditional crafts / independent professions / farming. This chapter will include descriptions of any:
       -   traditional trades practised in the area of intervention - usually these are associated to
           traditional groups / branches of Roma - blacksmiths, fiddlers; brick makers; spoon makers,
           etc.
       -   independent professions. According to some definitions currently in use, independent
                   professions are associated to ”medical professions; lawyers; notary; financial auditors; tax
                   consultants; chartered accountants; certified accountants; real estate investment consultant;
                 architect, or other regulated professions, carried out freelance, subject to the terms of the law .”81
                 These types of professions will not be frequent in the target communities, but some
                 professions might appear in the description, such as: trucking; collecting recyclable materials;
                 constructions, etc.
            -    farming - or those who work in the field of farming, for instance by practising subsistence
                 farming, seasonal or day labourers.
c.     Other forms of economic resources in the area - identify the main local investments, production
       facilities, commercial facilities, natural resources, tourism etc. that can become potential employers for
       the local population.

Health.
a) Prophylaxis. Mention especially the infrastructure that can contribute in prophylaxis. You could
   describe where the nearest medical dispensary is, or the nearest hospitals to the area of intervention;
   any public or private medical practices, dental practices, etc; the existence or absence of a community
   nurse.
b) Prevention. Especially mention specialised human resources than can contribute to prevention,
   including whether there is an integrated community centre available.

Papers.
a) Marital status papers Use official data obtained from the Territorial Administrative Unit or other
   sources, or estimations according to the reference research regarding the prevalence / number of
   people with no marital status papers. Where case may be, distinction should be considered between
   the birth not being recorded and the birth certificate being absent, since these two situations
   generate different subsequent legal approaches (late registration of birth).
b) People who have papers on the home they live in. Similarly, specify an estimated number of people
   who own papers on the home they live in.

NB. The estimated number of people (their relevant characteristic) who do not have documents / papers is
needed to justify proposed measures of intervention in this case under the project. Additional data
regarding the various contexts of ownership or rental documents are needed (ex. existing sales contract;
buildings on private or publicly owned land, etc.)

Housing.
a) Housing Context. Describe the existence or absence of electricity, water, sewers and city gas supplies
   and the degree to which households are connected to these grids, respectively data to characterise
   the housing conditions; housing density; electricity; access to running water; bathroom inside; heating
   system; amenities that facilitate educational activities (for instance a study room, a desk for the child,
   etc.) You can also describe the legal status of the home.
b) Branches of Roma. Describe the branches of Roma existing in the area of intervention / settlement
   (boiler makers; bear leaders; sedentary; wood workers, etc.); mention the existence of any
   communities of traditional Roma, what trades/habits do they have, etc. One exemplifying resource

Culture.
a) The prevalence of Roma population in the area of intervention, defined by their keeping of traditions
    and their degree of integration / assimilation. Integrated Roma will still keep some traditional
    elements, customs, Romani language, and they will use for survival an array of trades or skills resulting
    from traditional trades, while assimilated Roma have lost these traditional elements and no longer
    speak Romani language. Of course, in this case, these proportions can only be estimative.
b) Early marriage. Specify whether there are any (and how many) early "marriages" (couples that have
    not turned the legal age for marriage, but who live together as a couple, in a household), and if any
    children have resulted from such relationships. Another information that is useful too is information
    regarding marriages, legal or not, with legal implications for the extended family.
c) Specify the number of people in the area of intervention / settlement that are still speaking Romani,
    currently or occasionally.

Other local resources. Specify other local resources useful/needed for ensuring decent standards of
living, carrying out economic or cultural activities. For each category, mention whether, and how many
units of each category are in place in the settlement.
-    "Cultural house" - especially relevant for the rural areas, respectively for access to various cultural
     events, family events, etc.
-    Post office - Current postal services available in the community
-    Pharmacy - pharmacies available in the area ensure access to basic pharmaceutical products, but is
     also a sign of the area's economic relevance
-    Church - the type of church, the pertaining religious denomination Non-Protestant denominations
     managed to attract an increasing number of Roma people by strengthening the feeling of
     community.
-    Shops - number and diversity of shops/
-    Social venues - formal (park; playgrounds for children; areas equipped with urban furniture) and
     informal meeting places
-    Market place - food market or general goods market; flea market, etc.

Calculation of sample for confidence level 95%                                         340
Calculation of sample for confidence level 99%                                         394



How to work:
In the shadowed cells, replace the figures corresponding to the situation for the
survey you are planning. The current numbers serve as an example for an
excluded community of 500 people and 3% error margin. The sample needed in such
a case would be 340 people for 95% confidence level and 394 for 99% confidence
level.

Annex 3: Guide for the “random route” type of selection in building
samples
Steps for the “random route” type of selection 82:
1. The starting point can initially be indicated through an address from the locality (city hall, church,
    school, etc.) or through an area from the locality. It is preferable for the starting location not to be a
    central institution in the locality, because in this way the possibility to select more households from
    the central area is increased,regardless of the route algorithm followed afterwards. The rest of the
    instructions refer to the situation in which the starting point is represented by a particular polling area
    in the locality83, randomly selected.
2. Within the polling area from where the sub-sample should be selected, the start is from the lowest
    identifiable number of the street with the first name in alphabetical order.
3. The route on the street is done on the same side on which the lowest identifiable number is found,
    from 4 to 4 buildings in the direction of larger numbers, considering every block staircase as a
    building.
    3.1 The buildings that do not contain any dwellings will not be numbered. At the end of the street,
         the road will be continued on the first street to the left, within the same area.
    3.2 If the lowest identifiable number on the street is 1, the first address will be at number 1 and the
         second, after numbering four living buildings on the same side of the street and so forth, except
         for the buildings that do not contain any dwelling.
4. If the selection must be done within a block staircase, then the below table with random numbers
    shall be used.
    8.1 The operator will observe from the staircase which are the minimum and maximum numbers of
         apartments from the staircase.
    8.2 From the table, the column that has the letter or number indicated in the table will be selected, or
         the closest to what can be found in the table. On the respective column, while moving from up to
         down, the first apartment that has an identical number to the one in the reference column shall
         be selected. If the respective column doesn’t have such a number, then the apartment with the
         number closest to the one in the table shall be selected.
    8.3 If, for example, the staircase is A or one (I) and the staircase has apartments from 1 to 20,
         apartment 6 will be selected because this is the first number from the interval 1 to 20 that apears
         in the visual movement on column A: 117, 86, 54, 37, 77,135, 49, 6.
    8.4 If the staircase has apartments from 200 to 230, apartment 190 will be selected.
    8.5 If an apartment from staircase H has to be selected, and the staircase has apartments 150 to 170,
         apartment 161 will be selected, the first on column H, moving from up to down, in the interval
         150-170.
    8.6 If the polling area is very small and selecting two apartments from the block staircase is imposed,
         then the same rule will be applied: the column from the table that has the letter or number
         indicated in the table or the closest to what exists in the table. On the respective column, when
         going from up to down, the first two apartments that have an identical number to the one in the
         reference column are selected. If, for example, staircase G and apartments are between 80 and
         100, apartments 89 and 98 will be selected.

(such as a street from the locality).

Annex 4: Contextualisation of Excluded Rural Communities
The village and the commune, and the micro-region are the main layers of spatial contextualization of
marginal communities in the rural environment. As a result of the absence of public data, a negative
model has been perpetuated, of analyzing rural territorial micro-units only, or mainly in relation to the
communes. The model found in the Atlas of Excluded Rural Areas, which contains an entire section
dedicated to the human development of villages and the link between exclusion of census sectors and the
villages' poverty / development is worth pursuing.
The tables below support the idea that exclusion at the level of census sectors strongly depends on the
characteristics of the village.
The villages with no excluded communities are prevailingly commune-centre villages, with a low
prevalence of Roma (below 10%), with a local human development index (LHDI) average or above the
national average. Villages with only one excluded community are mainly poor or medium-poorly
developed in terms of LHDIvillage.
Villages with two excluded communities are mainly peripheral within the commune, with over 10% Roma
population and medium development level per LHDI village.

According to analysis results in table 2, excluded communities in rural environments have a significantly
higher probability of being located in villages that are:
o Big in terms of demographics
o Peripheral within the commune
o Far away from cities
o Far away from European roads
o With high prevalence of Roma in the population.
o In terms of development region, located especially in: NORTH-EAST, SOUTH-EAST, CENTRE
o Especially located at the periphery of the county, irrespective of the region.

The village development level (LHDI) has a decisive influence upon the probability of the village having
excluded communities (EC) on its territory: one third of the villages with EC are poor, and 40% of the
villages with EC are located in medium-poorly developed villages.

Annex 5: Indicators for Justifying Eligible Activities

Interventions in the field of education
“Activity 1. Support with a view to improving access and participation in education: early education (pre-preschool and preschool level); elementary and
primary education, including second chance to education - and to limit school dropout) by granting certain integrated packages (integrated packages
might include, for instance. costs with transport and meals for children in the target group; educational resources; access to medical and social services; measures to
prevent and reduce early drop-out through educational services tailored to the needs of the people in the target group; accompanying measures (for instance, clothing
and footwear; incentives linked to required attendance), tailored to the needs and specific characteristics of the community, etc.)

With a view to supporting and stimulating improved quality of the teaching act in schools serving to children in the communities targeted under the project,
integrated packages could be granted for teachers teaching in schools located in excluded areas, based on their performance in attracting the children from the
target group into the education system (for instance, to: increase daily attendance and school participation; improve performance at school; organise stimulating
extra-curricular activities for the children in the target group; education for parents, etc.). (Guide for Applicants for Objectives 4.1. and 4.2.)

1.1. Support to improve access and participation in early education - pre-preschool education
„Sub-activity 1.1. Support to improve access and participation in early education - pre-preschool education under which actions can be funded that aim
both at improving access and participation in pre-preschool education, including by ensuring/developing local services and using learning resources for children in
pre-preschool education, especially for children belonging to the Roma minority and disabled children; providing information and counselling services for parents;
programs on parenting, including accompanying measures and measures to provide financial support, etc.”(Guide for Applicants for Objectives 4.1. and 4.2.).

2.3. Measures to support job finding
"(for instance career information and advice; placement on the labour market; vocational training; subsidies to employers for employing people belonging to this
category; assessment of the skills acquired in non-formal and informal systems, etc.)
Vocational training must be delivered by vocational training providers authorised according to the provisions of Government Ordinance no. 129/2000 regarding
vocational training for adults, as subsequently amended and complemented, and shall result in qualification or graduation certificates recognised at national level.
Vocational training should be arranged through initiation, skilling, re-skilling, improvement, specialisation training programs. The employers can arrange vocational
training programs themselves only if they are authorised as vocational training providers under Government Ordinance no. 129/2000 regarding vocational training
for adults, as subsequently amended and complemented.
According to appendix 2 of Government Decision no. 918/2013 regarding the National Framework of Qualifications, as subsequently amended and complemented,
people who have graduated elementary education (4 grades) may attend initiation training programs, as defined in Government Ordinance no. 129/2000, as
subsequently amended and complemented regarding vocational training for adults, organised by authorised vocational training providers, which result in
graduation certificates recognised at national level.
Employers who enjoy such subsidies have the obligation to keep the newly-created job staffed for 6 more months after the end of the period that they received the
subsidies for (according to the legal provisions in force).

Interventions in the field of service development/delivery (social/medical/medical-social services)
„Activity 4. Support development/delivery of social services/services, including within the integrated community centres (medical-social). What is
envisaged here is delivery of integrated services for children, youth, adults/parents, etc. (for instance active employment measures; vocational training; education;
social-professional insertion measures; services - social/medical, /medical-social, psychological counselling, etc.) preferably through the integrated community centres
/ one-stop-shops /by involving specialists from the territorial network of the Public Employment Service or the public social services network, collaborating under
protocols with the territorial network of the Public Employment Service;

Innovative approaches in providing such services will be favoured, such as:
   social services to be delivered by promoting use of community-sourced labour (including through apprenticeship schemes);
   services to be delivered by mobile multi-functional teams;
   experimenting with new types of contract-based relationships between local authorities and/or private social service providers and community-based partners;
   bundled social services meant to prevent separation of children from families;
   bundled medical-social services/ bundled community medical services for people at risk of poverty and social exclusion, including Roma population, carried
    out by the community nurse, the health mediator and the social worker, with a view to lowering child mortality rates; preventing under-age pregnancy;
    increasing the number of people from communities with Roma population who are enrolled with a family doctor and/ or benefiting from various healthcare
    programs (TB, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, infectious disease, etc.); prevention and/or monitoring of autism incidence; mental health issues in children and
    adults; diminishing maternal mortality rates; increasing the number of beneficiaries of reproductive health / family planning services and programs.

NB The grant will be conditioned by the partnership taking responsibility for ensuring sustainability of the services developed (social/ medical/ medical-social) etc. after
completion of the ESF support"(Guide for Applicants for Objectives 4.1. and 4.2.).

Moderator introduction, general topics of discussion, description of technical details,
introduction of attendants - 10 min.
Hello. My name is... and I am................... Thank you for having accepted our invitation to attend this
meeting and discuss about important issues in your settlement/ community. Before we start, we will ask
you to express your point of view in a straightforward manner, with no preconceived ideas. Let me tell you
that there are no wrong or right opinions, good or bad answers; what we are interested in is your frank
opinion regarding the aspects we are going to tackle; your answers are very important for us, so that we
can get a true image of what people like you believe of these things.
The discussion will take about one hour, one hour and a half. I will also ask for your permission to record
our discussion, as it would be easier for us later on to remember all the details and generate the final
report. At the same time, I assure you that everything we will discuss here will remain strictly confidential
and will be used exclusively for our research, and that the respondents will be kept anonymous.
 (After getting permission to record) Now let's introduce ourselves. Introduction of respondents; name or
surname / age, occupation, educational background.




86 The questions in this interview guide are merely guidelines; every researcher/expert carrying out the research will
be free to add other questions or to adapt the ones provided in this template. Although this template proposes
questions both for individual and for group interviews / focus groups, we have to specify that the two types of
research approaches do have certain specific features that the researcher needs to take into account and which will
reflect as such in the research instrument used within the survey. Moreover, we will mention that the interview guide
will also reflect, on one hand, the hypotheses / theoretical grounds that will substantiate the research and, on the
other hand, the characteristics of the target group envisaged (questions will be adapted depending on the person
interviewed, for instance representatives of local authorities or people belonging to the vulnerable groups).

26. Are there any flows of water/rivers that cross in the area and where more bridges would be needed?
    What kind of bridges (for people, for machine tools/cars, etc.)? Any other problems?

27. Is it easy to get from one neighbourhood to another nearby one, or in nearby settlements or towns?
    How do you get there if you are to use public transportation? Is there a railway station in the
    settlement? Regular bus/micro-bus fares?

28. How are people's homes, do they provide a minimum standard of comfort and safety? Are there any
    people who have no adequate housing to ensure heating in the winter or shelter in rainy weather?
    How do people heat their homes? Are there any households where people who live there have no
    ownership documents for the house? Why does that happen?

29. Are there any homes/households with no electricity, no utilities (sewers, city gas, access to running
    water)? What is the extent, and where are they located in the commune? How could this problem be
    solved?

    missing for these things to be done?

31. What could be done in order to have better transport/travelling conditions? What is missing for this
    to come about?

Other problems
In addition to what we discussed, are there any other issues that you think should be solved in the
settlement/community/neighbourhood? How could these be solved, in your opinion, who are the persons
responsible for this?

Annex 17: Community mobilization guideline
Why and when is it necessary to use a community-based approach?
 Mobilization of the community is particularly necessary when the intervention involves a
  reconfiguration or adjustment of the values that characterizes a certain community, touches or
  questions a certain moral ethos developed at community level, etc.
 The support intervention at the level of a community implies, in most cases, certain changes in the
  values to which the community is committed to, in the norms and principles embraced by the
  members of a community.
 The success of an intervention depends on the degree of dissemination of the initiative within the
  targeted community (being familiar with the motivation and content of the intervention, the
  conditions of its implementation, the opportunities that such an intervention may offer, its
  consequences and expected results, etc.).
 It is important not only to know the proposed intervention, but also to obtain community acceptance
  or support thereof.


The stages of community mobilization can be as follows:
Getting familiar with the     The purpose of this approach is to properly understand the needs of the
community, collecting         community, the factors that underpin the existence of the identified
data on the context in        problems, the way to address/ resolve them in an efficient and effective
which the intervention is     manner.
going to take place.
                              The methods to be used in this approach can be as follows: desktop analysis
                              of available data on the community (i.e. official statistics, administrative data
                              of Territorial Administrative Units-TAUs), focus group, sociological
                              interviews, sociological observation, surveys, participatory discussions. It is
                              essential in this approach to notice, collect data and information and to
                              understand the mechanisms that generate the current (desirable or
                              undesirable) situation. The role of the researcher is vital in this approach, but
                              at this stage it is advisable to include also the community facilitator (i.e. the
                              community member who will coordinate the community mobilization
                              process).
Identifying those key         The purpose of this step is to seek/ identify those key actors on which the
actors (i.e. groups,          state of play depends, and who can contribute to a desirable change

                              depth discussions with community members, workshops or brainstorming
                              sessions will be initiated. Key actors can be both community members (i.e.
                              leaders, influential people, entrepreneurs, etc.) as well as organizations (local
                              authorities, local organizations providing community service and utilities, the
                              church, etc.). Vulnerable members of the target group on which the
                              intervention is focusing on are themselves key actors in this endeavour.
                              The research methods that can be used at this stage: SWOT analysis,
                              stakeholder analysis, PEST analysis (political, economic, social and
                              technological), social networking analysis (SNA). It is essential at this stage to

                             may be involved in the process of carrying out a supporting intervention.

                             relatively equal importance at this stage.

of the initiative
                    In the light of the results/outcomes of the impact assessment of the project,
                    strong arguments can be put forward to continue the intervention, to
                    allocate new resources, to replicate the intervention into new, more
                    widespread contexts that raise similar problems. The community
                    development model tested can be thus improved and streamlined. The role
                    of the researcher, public policies and communication specialists, the media
                    and other institutional representatives is essential at this stage.
