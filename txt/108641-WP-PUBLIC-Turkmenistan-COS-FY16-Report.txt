I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in Turkmenistan perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues Facing Turkmenistan
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Turkmenistan
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information




II. Methodology
From October 2015 to March 2016, 85 stakeholders of the WBG in Turkmenistan were invited to
provide their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion
survey. Participants were drawn from the office of the President, the office of the Prime
Minister; office of a minister; ministries/ministerial departments/implementation agencies;
bilateral/multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial
sector/private banks; NGOs/community based organizations; the media; independent government
institutions; academia/research institutes/think tanks; and other organizations. A total of 57
stakeholders participated in the survey (67% response rate).

Some respondents received and responded to the questionnaires via the online survey platform
Qualtrics; other respondents received and returned the questionnaires via official correspondence
or in person. Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Turkmenistan; their overall
attitudes toward the WBG; the WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work
and activities; working with the WBG; the WBG’s future role in Turkmenistan; and the WBG’s
communication and information sharing.

Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
      For further analyses, respondents from the financial sector/private banks were combined
       with those from private sector organizations; respondents from NGOs/community-based
       organizations and private foundations were combined in the “CSO” category; and few
       respondents from the office of a minister, independent government institutions, academia/
       research institutes/think tanks, and the media were included in the “Other” category.
       Note that there were no respondents from the Office of the President/Prime Minister.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Geographic Locations
     Note: Because of the small number of respondents from outside Ashgabat, analyses
      comparing geographic locations would not be statistically reliable and, therefore, were
      not conducted.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
     Collaboration: Respondents who professionally collaborate with the WBG had
      significantly higher levels of familiarity with the WBG (mean = 6.8) than respondents
      who do not work with the institution (mean = 5.5).
     Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
      with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Turkmenistan, and significantly,
      moderately correlated with their ratings of the extent to which the WBG’s work helps to
      achieve development results in the country.

IV. General Issues Facing Turkmenistan
Development Priority
     Stakeholder groups: Respondents from the private sector/financial sector/private banks
      were significantly more likely to indicate “private sector development” as the most
      important development priority in Turkmenistan.

Overall Ratings for Indicator Questions by Stakeholder Groups1
       Stakeholder groups: Respondents across stakeholder groups gave statistically similar
        overall ratings for the twenty six indicator questions.
       Collaboration: Respondents who professionally collaborate with the WBG gave
        significantly higher overall ratings (mean = 7.7) for the twenty six indicator questions
        than respondents who do not work with the institution (mean = 6.6).

  Note in the Appendix on the sectoral effectiveness (Appendix A, page 46) that primarily informed stakeholders
responded to this question. Respondents were given the option of “don’t know” if they did not have exposure to the
WBG’s work in certain development areas.

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Turkmenistan,
bivariate correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the sixteen specific
areas of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Turkmenistan. The areas
       determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at environmental sustainability;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at global/regional integration;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at natural resource management;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at energy; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at foreign direct investment.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Turkmenistan, suggesting that
       ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s
       ability to help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from
       these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at environmental sustainability;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at foreign direct investment; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at global/regional integration.
