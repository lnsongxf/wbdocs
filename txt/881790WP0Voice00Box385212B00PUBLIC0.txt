This report distills an array of data, studies and evidence to shine a spotlight on the
pervasive deprivations and constraints that face women and girls worldwide—from
epidemic gender-based violence to laws and norms that prevent women from own-
ing property, working, making decisions about their own lives and having influence
in society. It identifie some promising programs and interventions to address these
deprivations and constraints.

Policymakers and stakeholders need to tackle this agenda, drawing on evidence
about what works and systematically tracking progress on the ground. This must
start with reforming discriminatory laws and follow through with concerted policies
and public actions, including multi-sectoral approaches that engage with men and
boys and challenge adverse social norms. There is much to gain. Increasing wom-
en’s voice and agency is a valuable end in its own right. And it underpins achieve-
ment of the World Bank Group’s twin goals of eliminating extreme poverty and
boosting shared prosperity for girls and boys, women and men, around the world.

Box 1.1 What is agency?

“Agency” is the ability to make decisions about one’s own life and act on them to achieve a desired
outcome, free of violence, retribution, or fear. The ability to make those choices is often called
empowerment.

Agency is critical at the individual level, as demonstrated by women worldwide who have spoken of
having agency and of being empowered in many different ways:
     My opportunity is that I have free space, to decide for myself, no longer dependent on
     others. For me, this is a source of pride, my husband asking me [my advice] now there
     isn’t this machismo … there is mutual respect … together we decide.—Leticia from Ecuador
     What is an empowered woman? A woman who is able to work and able to fulfil the needs
     that she has identified for herself. As long as she has the strength to work, she can solve
     all her problems. Empowered women can manage their own lives, no matter what the
     circumstances. —Egypt Pathways fieldwork
     An empowered woman is one who can help herself and others, who has a job, knows
     about herself and her environment and her community. You cannot stay in the house
     and be empowered. If you join societies, organizations, communities, and other social
     things, even spiritually, you will be empowered. If you are enlightened, empowerment will
     follow.—Tsikata and Darkwah from Ghana
     I am free and I have some power; my partner has the same: sovereign decisions are
     freedom and power.—Urban man, neighborhood of Olzstyn, Poland

Agency is also about group and collective action, as we examine in chapter 6:
     Men used to shut us up and say we shouldn’t speak. Women learned to speak up in a
     sangathan [group]. Earlier, we couldn’t speak up even at home. Now, we can be more
     assertive and also go out. I am able to help other women gain confidence as well.—Woman

Box 1.2 Women’s mobility: Evidence on freedom of movement

                                          Mobility includes an individual’s physical capacity to move
                                          freely beyond the household, as well as the ability to move
                                          across social and economic spheres. It helps women and
                                          men build and maintain social and professional networks and
                                          enables participation in the economy and civic life.

                                      Physical mobility influences social and economic mobility,
                                      and significantly affects women’s and girls’ opportunities and
                                      choices. In Bangladesh, for example, women working outside
                                      the home, in both formal and informal employment, are more
                                      likely to vote and to do so according to their own decisions
compared with women who work from home or do not work for pay. Yet, widespread restrictions on
women’s mobility arise from social norms. Women who leave the house too often may be branded
“bad girls” or “bad wives.”

     Only a good-for-nothing, a ‘girl of the wind,’ can ride a taxi motorbike.—Women’s focus
     group, Garin Malam, Communauté Urbaine de Zinder, Niger

Our analysis from 52 developing countries found that one in three women agree that wife-beating
is justified for going out without permission; the same number of women report having no say over
visits to family or friends. Women’s mobility can change with age; for example, only 20 percent of
respondents ages 45 to 49 have no say over visits to family and friends, compared with 60 percent of
those ages 15 to 19. On average, women report greater freedom of movement if they are educated,
identify themselves as head of the household, or belong to a richer household. For example, 43
percent of women without an education have no say in decisions about visits to friends and family,
compared with 17 percent of those with a higher education.

Women’s mobility can be restricted by laws that dictate the need for her husband’s consent to work
outside the home or that restrict the types of jobs or industries in which she may work. A number of
countries in Europe and Central Asia, for example, have lengthy lists of jobs that are prohibited for
women; in Russia, the list includes 456 jobs, ranging from woodworker to truck driver in agriculture.
Such restrictions originated from a desire to protect women; but in practice, they limit women’s
earnings potential and opportunities outside the home.

Lack of appropriate transport is often a constraint, and unsafe public spaces where women risk
sexual harassment and other forms of gender-based violence make it difficult or impossible for
women to move about freely. In Yemen, for example, lack of mobility is cited as a major restriction on
girls’ ability to go to school, and one-third of women deliver babies without medical care because
appropriate transport is lacking. In central Afghanistan, mobility limits women’s ability to find work,
socialize, and build networks.

Lack of social mobility can limit women’s success as entrepreneurs, as in Sierra Leone, where limited
access to networks is a key factor in restricting women’s ability to scale-up microenterprises.

Box 1.3 Multiple disadvantages among adolescent Hmong girls

Vietnam has achieved tremendous progress in development, but the gains have been unevenly
enjoyed. In Ha Giang Province in northern Vietnam, Hmong children and adolescents, especially
girls, face multiple disadvantages. Among the Hmong ethnic minority, poverty rates exceed 80
percent, compared with 20 percent for Vietnam as a whole.

Traditional preference for sons and filial piety mean that girls spend long hours on domestic chores—
only 4 percent of Hmong girls are enrolled in secondary school and, as adults, their opportunities
for paid work are negligible.

Rates of child marriage and total fertility for Hmong are double the rate for the Kinh majority ethnic
group. Hmong girls also have inadequate access to sexual and reproductive health information
and services. In recent fieldwork in Ta Lung commune, girls often struggled to imagine future lives
that differed from those of their mothers. Most Hmong girls reported very little say in family or
community decisions, where they faced discrimination on the grounds of both their gender and
their age. That was reflected in one mother’s plans for her children: “My daughter will finish grade
nine only, and then she will get married. My son won’t go anywhere; he will live with me, so I let him
reach the high grade.”

Box 1.4 Norms about masculinity shape men’s behavior

                                                         Men’s actions and behaviors are subject to norms
                                                         of masculinity just as women’s are subject to norms
                                                         of femininity. Norms about masculinity are often
                                                         characterized as being aggressive, risk-taking,
                                                         virile, unemotional, and dominant over women.
                                                         Even though men often may have more decision-

                                                         they also may feel pressured to conform to societal
                                                         expectations. For example, men may not agree to
                                                         use contraception if it will reflect negatively on
                                                         their virility. In the words of one Tanzanian woman:

     You cannot tell men to use birth control; they want children. The more they have, the more
     manly they appear to be.—Young woman, Zabibu village, Tanzania

Men are also expected to be providers and protectors of their families. When they are unable to meet
those roles, they may compensate by finding alternative ways to prove their masculinity. They may
engage in risky behavior: becoming more sexually active, drinking excessively, or becoming more
aggressive to demonstrate their masculinity to peers. To maintain an appearance of invulnerability,
men may be less inclined to use health services that they need. Norms about masculinity can also
result in aggression and violence toward women.

Harmful norms can be transmitted across generations; a boy who has witnessed his father beat

patriarchal power structures within society that give men power and status over women, men have
little incentive to challenge those norms.

The good news, however, is that norms about masculinity can and do shift; a recent analysis of
the International Men and Gender Equality Survey has shown that younger generations of men
are more supportive of gender equality and more likely to engage in household tasks. Similarly,
evidence from urban Niger suggests that both women and men are becoming more open to sharing

And men have much to gain from gender equality. Data show that men in more gender-equal
relationships are more likely to be happy; men who participate actively as fathers are more likely
to have better physical and mental health; and men who take on greater care-giving roles report
benefits to their friendships and relationships with their children, as well as improved relationships
with their spouses. Studies from developed countries have found that men who are more actively
involved in care giving live longer and report lower rates of mental and physical health problems,
including high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease.

This chapter has set the stage for the more detailed investigations that follow. We
have seen that expanding women’s agency is critical for individual and collective
well-being, and for the promotion of shared prosperity and eliminating poverty.

Yet, many women—especially those who are poor and lacking education—experi-
ence agency deprivations across a range of domains, and they often face multiple
constraints simultaneously. These empirical patterns illuminate the need to consider
policy and programming design options as part of a comprehensive approach to
advancing agency and gender equality.

We have explored the importance of social norms and laws and legal institutions as
drivers of gender equality outcomes, and made the case for increased policy atten-
tion in those areas, which is the focus of the next chapter.

                                                         Tostan, which means “breakthrough” in the

                                                         organization working in eight African countries. It
                                                         was founded in 1991 in Senegal and now operates
                                                         in more than 450 communities in Djibouti, Guinea,
                                                         Guinea-Bissau, The Gambia, Mali, Mauritania,
                                                         Senegal, and Somalia. Tostan spreads awareness
                                                         of human rights issues using social networks.
                                                         Known primarily for its success in accelerating the
                                                         abandonment of female genital cutting, Tostan
                                                         has also achieved results in governance, health,
                                                         economic growth, education, and environment, as
                                                         well as child protection, empowerment of women
                                                         and girls, and early childhood development.

Tostan works through a Community Empowerment Program. It assigns trained facilitators to live in
participating villages for three years. The facilitator is fluent in the local language and is from the
same ethnic group as the community. In each village, two classes of 25 to 30 participants are held,
one for adults and one for adolescents. The classes draw on customary African oral traditions, such
as theater, storytelling, dance, artwork, song, and debate in their teaching. Participants are taught
basic management and literacy skills to help them implement small projects. In another program,
villagers learn about human rights, including the right to health and the right to be free from all
forms of violence, and discuss how new practices can help build a healthier community.

Participants follow up by speaking with friends and family and by traveling to other villages to
raise awareness—an outreach system first used by Demba Diawara, a Senegalese Imam. The Imam
recognized that just as tradition requires female genital cutting for a girl to marry, ending the practice
requires an agreement between the groups whose children marry one another. The Imam walked
from village to village to raise awareness, and consequently, 13 neighboring villages pledged to
abandon the practice of female genital cutting.

Tostan’s work has led to changes in social norms. One reason is that other communities that are
considering abandoning the custom can send delegates to the successful villages to see that an
alternative is possible, collective abandonment works, daughters’ reputations remain undamaged,
the effort does not bring shame to the community, and no supernatural punishments occur. Another
reason is that incorporating participatory human rights teaching into its approach ennobles the
process of norm revision—individuals are not rejecting the bad but embracing the good.

Tostan’s approach has encouraged 5,423 villages in Senegal to move away from female genital
cutting, as well as child and forced marriage. The movement has spread to communities in other
African countries, with hundreds of other villages joining the pledge. The government of Senegal
has now adopted Tostan’s development model and is working with the organization to end female
genital cutting by 2015.

vulnerable groups. Its bill of rights explicitly prohibits discrimination “directly or indirectly against
anyone on one or more grounds including … gender, sex, pregnancy, marital status….” South
Africa’s post-apartheid constitution is the first in the world to outlaw discrimination based on sexual
orientation.

The constitution affirms the role of customary law within the country’s legal framework and makes all
laws subject to the principles of non-discrimination.

The new constitution catalyzed new legislation and case law, which reshaped the definition of family,
relations between family members, and the meaning of marriage. The 1998 Domestic Violence Act,
for example, covers “persons who are or were married to each other according to any law, custom,
or religion and persons of the same or opposite sex who live or have lived together in a relationship
in the nature of a marriage.”

In Kenya, Article 60 of the 2010 constitution specifically calls for “the elimination of gender
discrimination in law, customs, and practices related to land and property.” It also established
constitutional oversight of customary law, and international treaties automatically become part of
the national legal framework upon ratification. The new constitution requires the government to
take legislative and other measures to redress any disadvantage suffered by individuals or groups
because of past discrimination.

These reforms have already influenced how disputes are decided in courts. In 2011, a judge declared
that a divorced daughter was allowed to inherit her parents’ estate because the constitution
eliminated all gender discrimination related to land. But in 2014, a new Matrimonial Property Act
stripped women of their rights to family property unless they can prove financial contribution.

Box 2.3 	 How the Adolescent Girls Initiative is helping to overcome agency
          constraints
In 2008, the World Bank launched the Adolescent Girls Initiative (AGI) to generate evidence on how
to promote young women’s transition to productive work. Interventions are being implemented
and rigorously evaluated in eight countries: Afghanistan, Haiti, Lao People’s Democratic Republic,
Liberia, Jordan, Nepal, Rwanda, and South Sudan.58 The box outlines some important lessons on
program design, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation to help improve programming
decisions.

Box 2.4. 	Promoting gender equality in school and improving the learning
          environment
Girls’ and sometimes boys’ ability to acquire an education is tragically disrupted by gender-based
violence. In schools where sexual violence against girls is the norm, the education system itself
may increase a girl’s chances of dropping out, interrupting her studies, experiencing an unintended
pregnancy, or becoming infected with HIV. Addressing harassment and violence in schools is
important to promote gender equality in education.

South Africa’s Girls’ Education Movement is a civil society organization seeking to promote gender
equality and to address the very high levels of violence experienced in schools through student-
led clubs and community workshops. It has created a network for improving girls’ education,
knowledge, and self-esteem, with boys and adults as allies. The clubs equip children to address
issues of education, clean and safe school environments, and good communication among peers,
as well as other things. It gives children the opportunity to work together to find solutions to the
problems affecting their school lives.

The program has seen some progress in reducing aggressive behavior and conflict and in changing
attitudes of the students and program leaders who received training. But the results varied
significantly by context, and impacts on the broader school environment were not significant.
Findings suggest that changes in underlying norms around the acceptability of violence and the
unequal treatment of girls is needed to realize the full impact of the program.

Box 2.5 Curriculum reform to promote gender equality through education

Although global progress has been made in increasing girls’ school enrollment, gender equality in
education encompasses much more than access. Social norms influence textbooks, curricular choices,
the sex distribution of teachers and administrators, teacher attitudes and behavior, classroom and
discipline practices, and the presence of violence—all of which shape opportunities for boys and
girls. National curricula can reinforce existing social and gender inequalities by implicitly upholding
traditional gender stereotypes or by disregarding the diversity of learning needs and learning styles
among girls and boys. At the same time, schools have enormous potential to effect social change
and to transform gender relations by expanding the range of possibilities for both boys and girls.

One avenue for transformation is the gender sensitization of school curriculum, including revising
textbooks. Research suggests that the treatment of girls and women in school textbooks is broadly
similar across countries. There are fewer images of women and girls compared to men and boys;
men and women are generally portrayed in stereotypical roles and professions; men and women
are described as having specific gendered attributes; and contributions of important women are
ignored or given less consideration than those of important men. An increasing number of countries
are taking action to address these biases. For example, in Thailand, policies have been instituted
directing textbooks to be revised and all gender stereotypes to be removed. In Vietnam in 2009, the
Vietnamese Ministry of Education, supported by 12 UN agencies, conducted a national textbook
review and developed teacher-training modules to promote gender equality, while in Indonesia,
teachers are being trained in gender-sensitive methodologies to engage boys and girls. Similarly,
the Australian National Curriculum directs teachers to address certain issues within their classes—for
example, the Year Seven English curriculum recommends that teachers teach how languages and
images create character by identifying and challenging gender stereotypes in girls’ and women’s
magazines and popular television programming.

Mainstreaming gender into curricula goes beyond revising textbooks and requires incorporating
gender equality across the range of studies. Evidence suggests that intensive and long-term
attention to gender as part of school coursework has an impact on improving children’s attitudes and
behaviors related to gender equality. In Mumbai, India, for example, the Gender Equity Movement
in Schools, which includes sessions taught over two years focused on understanding gender roles,
power dynamics, violence, and physical and emotional changes related to adolescence, led to
participating children reporting more equitable attitudes toward gender. In Tanzania, the national
syllabi for secondary schools contain topics related to gender as part of civics education and national
examinations.

Constraints to agency stem from many sources. Often, deeply rooted social norms
are an unrecognized driving factor behind the actions taken by men and women,
boys and girls, sometimes entrenched by laws on paper and in practice.

The good news outlined in this chapter is that there is a range of polices that can
work to promote change across a broad spectrum. We also saw how such programs
are working to couple development results in terms of incomes and service access
together with increases in women’s agency. Indeed, we saw that improvements in
women’s agency are sometimes necessary for other desired development results to
be achieved.

This is an important stage to set for the examination of major agency deprivations—
freedom from violence, control over sexual and reproductive health, land and hous-
ing ownership, and participation in politics and collective action—and the more
targeted policy and program responses in the chapters that follow.

Freedom from
violence
      Key messages
Box 3.1




          >	Violence is a major theme of this report because it is among the most 		
             egregious and commonly experienced abuses of women’s rights.

          >	The media often present violence as a tragic event or a side effect of war
             or armed conflict. But around the world, no place is less safe for a woman
             than her own home—almost one-third (30 percent) of women have
             experienced physical or sexual violence or both by an intimate partner.

          >	Gender-based violence stems from social norms and expectations that
             reinforce inequality and place women’s and girls’ choices outside of their
             realm of control. Major individual risk factors are family history, early
             marriage, and husband’s alcohol use, while education emerges as the
             most significant protective factor.

          >	The effects of intimate partner violence (IPV) are felt at the individual,
             family, and economy levels.

          >	The development costs are substantial. Estimated costs of IPV are close
             to the average that developing country governments spend on primary
             education.

          >	Preventing violence relies in part on changing norms and attitudes that
             perpetuate gender inequalities and sanction gender-based violence.

          >	Treatment and support for victims is critical—but across the globe, the
             majority of women (6 in 10) who experience violence never seek help or
             report the violence to anyone.

          >	Economic empowerment interventions can expand women’s agency
             by adding strategic design features to address IPV—“economic
             empowerment plus” interventions.

          >	Promising interventions have multiple components and intervene at
             different levels; address norms; involve the wider community; engage
             both men and women; and span long periods.

Box 3.2 	 What is GBV? Stories from survivors in Tonga

The Women and Children Crisis Centre in Tonga provides care and support to survivors of violence.
The Centre collected stories from survivors describing the range of violence they have suffered at
the hands of the men in their lives—husbands, fathers, and fathers-in-law.

Women described being pushed and punched. They had their hair pulled and cut. Men cut their
bodies with knives and hit them with heavy objects, such as tire jacks and hammers. Men stood
and stepped on their faces and beat their backs, burned their bodies with scalding objects, and
spat and urinated on them. Women reported being kicked, including being kicked while pregnant.
Women and children were forced to have sex. Very young girls were forced to perform fellatio on
their fathers. They were raped by their fathers and by their fathers-in-law, some every night. Yet
the abuse is not limited to young women by any means. Grandsons attacked their grandmothers,
verbally terrorized them, and hit them in the face. Crisis centers around the world record countless
similar testimonies every day. And myriad similar stories are never told at all.

Box 3.3 	 The Domestic Violence Module of the Demographic and Health
          Surveys
The Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) support nationally representative data collection in the
areas of population, health, and nutrition. A standardized domestic violence module was developed
in 1998 and has been included in 91 surveys. It collects data on the prevalence of physical, sexual
and emotional violence against women since the age of 15, by current or previous partners as well
as by non-partners within the household context, and allows the experience of violence to be linked
to a range of risk and protective factors.25

In both stand-alone surveys developed specifically to measure violence and broader surveys like
the DHS that integrate a violence module, underestimation of the actual prevalence of violence
is a concern. The DHS has incorporated enhancements to protect respondents and optimize the
accuracy of violence estimates, including offering multiple opportunities for disclosure by asking
many different times about any experience of many types of violence, and by generally placing
the module toward the end of the questionnaire, which provides the greatest opportunity for
developing a rapport between interviewers and respondents. Further, the DHS adheres to strict
ethical and safety guidelines aligned with the internationally recognized recommendations of WHO.
Key precautions include anonymity of respondents, that is, names are never disclosed and are
excluded from all data sets. The guidelines include providing specialized training for interviewers,
observing strict informed-consent procedures, assuring privacy during the interview, administering
the module to only one eligible woman per household, not asking men in the household questions
about violence, and providing referrals to services.

Stand-alone surveys like the WHO Multi-Country Study generally report higher prevalence than the
DHS, likely due to greater efforts to enhance disclosure in questionnaire design and interviewer
training. However, in terms of risk and protective factors and gaps in help-seeking, results from
analysis of DHS data are comparable to those from the WHO study. The DHS is largest source for
population-based data about violence, and so constitutes a large share of the available data on
IPV prevalence. Further detail about the data sources used in this report can be found in chapter 7.

Box 3. 4 Serving survivors and empowering women in the Great Lakes

Poor and vulnerable women in the Great Lakes states (Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo
and Rwanda) face multiple and mutually reinforcing constraints, including high levels of violence, lack
of say over their health, and limited economic opportunities. In the Democratic Republic of Congo
alone, nearly three-quarters of women have experienced intimate partner violence. Although women
and girls are particularly vulnerable during and after armed conflicts, there is growing recognition
that sexual violence has become a wider social phenomenon, including through increasing levels of
sexual partner violence.

To help respond, the World Bank is preparing a US$75 million operation to address the needs
of survivors of violence and of other vulnerable women in targeted communities, with activities
spanning several sectors. The project is expected to offer the following support:

››   Improved maternal, reproductive, and obstetric care;

››   Mental health services to reduce post-traumatic stress and to improve daily functioning;

››   Case management, referrals for survivors, and assistance in accessing the judicial system through
     civil society organizations;

››   Assistance through village savings and loans associations and cooperatives for survivors and other
     vulnerable groups; and

››   Scale-up of one-stop centers for survivors of violence and provision of emergency contraception
     kits, antiretroviral drugs, and surgery equipment to boost the technical capacity of facilities to
     deliver specialized services.

Finally, the program aims to build relevant capacities of a full range of professionals—including
social workers, the police, and the military—and engage community leaders as agents of change.

 Box 3.5	 Mobilizing communities against violence: Lessons from SASA!

SASA!, which means “Now!” in Kiswahili, is a program developed by Raising Voices and
implemented in Uganda by the Center for Domestic Violence Prevention. It is the first community-
based violence prevention program in Sub-Saharan Africa to be rigorously evaluated. The program
employs multiple strategies to build a critical mass of engaged community members, leaders, and
institutions, including local activism, media and advocacy, communication materials, and training.
The Activist Kit that is central to SASA! community engagement and mobilization involves four
phases: Start, Awareness, Support, and Action. The content evolves with each phase, with power as
a central theme. Initial results from a randomized controlled trial show positive effects after almost
three years of programming. Compared with control communities, people in SASA! communities
have more gender-equitable attitudes and a reduced prevalence of past-year physical violence by
an intimate partner. Compared with control communities, SASA! communities report the following
striking results:

››   Levels of violence were 52 percent lower.

››   Twenty-eight percent more women and men believe it is acceptable for women to refuse sex.

››   Fifty percent more men and women believe physical violence against a partner is unacceptable.

Box 3.6	 Increasing women’s access to justice in Papua New Guinea

In Papua New Guinea, a Family Protection Bill was introduced to Parliament in 2013 after extensive
and inclusive stakeholder consultation. This effort was accompanied by the establishment of
specialized Family and Sexual Violence Units and survivor-centered training to duty bearers and
service providers, and prosecution efforts were strengthened through the creation of a Family and
Sexual Offense Unit to support legal staff and to improve case management. The early results are
promising. The number of female magistrates rose from 10 in 2004 to more than 900 in 2013. Since
2012, a record number of IPV cases have been heard in Papua New Guinea’s courts, with two out
of three resulting in a conviction or guilty plea. Of particular note are two landmark sexual violence
cases involving police officers, who received combined sentences of 30 years imprisonment.

In the Solomon Islands, 64 percent of women have experienced physical and/or sexual partner
violence. A World Bank grant supported the government’s efforts to improve access to services for
survivors by bringing together specialized organizations in a forum that allowed them to identify
gaps and priority actions in supporting victims of violence.

As a next step, the grant will deliver a pilot project to strengthen frontline response and help
coordinate referral services. Service providers will also be trained in sensitive and timely responses
to the needs of survivors of violence. Finally, the project will help the government undertake a
diagnostic study on capacity constraints in the institutions and services, and it will support training
and data collection.

Box 3.8	 Integrating violence: Innovations in a transport project in Brazil

As part of a broader effort to develop a regional master plan for the metropolitan transport
system, the government of Rio de Janeiro is looking to use trains and cable cars that connect many
hillside shantytowns to increase access to job opportunities. With a loan from the World Bank,
the government has integrated gender-responsive legal, social, and economic services within this
system. The program will support the establishment of Women Reference and Service Centers—one-
stop shops that will provide services, referrals, and information for survivors of violence. Electronic
public information is used to promote the national law against domestic violence. Sustainable
transport links to the Brazilian Women’s House—a federal program that assembles several public
services for women—will also be established as part of the effort. In addition, a women’s police
station, a women’s clinic, and a child care center will be established. The project will also finance
dissemination of information on improved security for women riders. Finally, the program will pilot
vocational education and training for women that are at risk of violence.

Violence is one of the most pronounced manifestations of gender inequality across
the globe. Addressing violence is critical for promoting women’s agency and for a
range of other gender outcomes and development goals. But violence is perpetuated
by social norms and institutions that implicitly or explicitly condone this behavior. This
means that eliminating violence requires appropriate prevention strategies, as well as
response mechanisms that prioritize the needs of survivors. Effective approaches are
likely to target multiple entry points within the framework depicted in figure 1.1—
improved laws and policies, more gender equitable attitudes, and safer social envi-
ronments. This also requires better data for decision making. One recent advance is
the international agreement on standard indicators for measuring violence against
women, which will provide much-needed data on prevalence as well as monitoring of
efforts to reduce violence, as discussed in chapter 7. Preventing violence is critical—
and has positive effects in other domains of women’s agency, as will be highlighted
in the chapters that follow.

Chapter 4
Control over Sexual and
Reproductive Health and
Rights
      Key messages
Box 4.1




          >	Sexual and reproductive health and rights are important ends in
             themselves and can have valuable benefits for women’s own health,
             nutrition, education, and livelihoods and for the well-being of their
             children.

          >	Having agency over sexual and reproductive decisions includes being able
             to choose whether, when and with whom to have sex, to ask a partner to
             use a condom, and to make decisions about childbearing and ones own
             health.

          >	Child marriage, high rates of adolescent pregnancy, and women’s limited
             control over their own sexual and reproductive health decisions often
             reflect underlying gender inequalities, and carry serious repercussions.

          >	Beyond access to contraceptive methods, promising interventions
             integrate multi-sectoral actions, such as sexual and reproductive health
             education, mentoring and peer group training, incentive programs, and
             activity clubs and sports.

          >	Broader structural and normative changes are critical, which can be
             achieved by engaging community opinion leaders and gatekeepers to
             support changing norms.

Box 4.2	 Engaging traditional “gatekeepers” in adolescent sexual and repro-
         ductive health in Malawi
Chapsinja, the rural area outside of Lilongwe, is known for customary practices such as initiation
ceremonies, during which information is delivered to young people by traditional counselors or
akunjira. A study by the Family Planning Association of Malawi (FPAM) documented that traditional
counselors were strongly against condom use and that some of the messages they conveyed
during the ceremonies likely contributed to the high prevalence of HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted
infections, adolescent pregnancies, and coerced sexual initiation rates for girls.

FPAM launched a community mobilization campaign to introduce sexual and reproductive health
services and information. They worked with akunjira to transform existing rituals into opportunities
for health-promoting messages. Girls and boys were encouraged to go to school and become
sexually active only when they are socially, mentally, and physically mature. At the same time, young
people were trained as peer educators and volunteer condom distributors in their communities.
HIV testing has become more frequent, and according to preliminary results, HIV prevalence is
declining. The Chapsinja senior chief now plans to serve as a bridge to chiefs in surrounding areas.

Box 4.3	 Social accountability and service delivery

Social accountability mechanisms that help improve the quality of service delivery can improve
women’s ability to exercise agency over their own health and their health outcomes, as in the
following examples:

››   In Uganda a year after the introduction of a local accountability mechanism which gave clients
     greater control on the delivery of primary health services, including through provision of information
     about staff performance, child survival rates improved leading to a 33 percent reduction in under-
     five mortality.

››   In Peru, a citizen surveillance program increased the number of births in health facilities by almost
     one-third in just one year and increased access to culturally appropriate delivery options.

››   Recent work from Orissa, India, identified three effective processes that had positive impacts
     on reproductive and maternal health: generating demand for rights and better services through
     information campaigns, leveraging intermediaries to legitimize the demands of poor and
     marginalized women, and sensitizing leaders and health providers to the needs of women.

Box 4.4	 Promising approach to delaying marriage in Ethiopia

Ethiopia has high rates of child marriage. In Awi zone, in rural Amhara Region, one in five girls is
married before her 15th birthday, and nearly half (44 percent) are married by age 17. Nearly all (92
percent) of these marriages are arranged by their families.

In 2004, the regional government partnered with the Population Council on a two-year project to
delay marriage and keep girls in school. This program, Berhane Hewan (“Light for Eve”) provided
families with cash conditioned on their daughters remaining unmarried and in school for the
duration of the program. Other elements included social mobilization of girls led by female mentors,
provision of school supplies, livelihood skills for out-of-school girls, and “community conversations”
on early marriage and reproductive health.

Berhane Hewan was among the first projects targeting child marriage to be rigorously evaluated,
and the results are promising. Girls (ages 10–14) enrolled in the program were only one-tenth as
likely to be married compared to girls in the control site. Participants were also three times more
likely to be in school. Married girls in the project site were three times more likely to be using
contraception compared to married girls in the control site.

Box 4.5	 Egypt: Closing the gap between laws and practice

A recent review of laws and the code of medical ethics showed that Egypt recognizes most of the
key human rights related to family planning and reproductive health. Reproductive rights are also
recognized in the Standards of Practice for Service Providers in Family Planning. Yet the standards
and guidelines are not legally binding, and therefore cannot be relied upon to enforce or pursue
breaches of rights, such as denial of service, coercion over a woman’s choice of contraceptive
method, or lack of informed consent.

Women’s lack of agency continues to be a challenge, with data from four regions showing that
awareness of the right to autonomy is notably lower than other rights. In some instances, women are
asked for spousal consent to receive sexual and reproductive services, although this is not required
by law. In 2007, to help close this gap, Mansoura University launched joint medico-legal and ethics
training courses for health and law students.

Sexual and reproductive autonomy are intertwined with women’s agency and
opportunities in life more broadly. Ultimately, fertility decisions should be made
on the basis of informed choices and life plans that women and girls themselves
value. This opportunity is especially relevant for vulnerable adolescents, who may
perceive motherhood as the only option for social mobility and recognition.

It is important to engage men, boys, and community and family opinion leaders
as informed consumers, responsible decision makers, and advocates for women’s
sexual and reproductive health and rights. Programs that target and engage only
women will bring only partial results.

Control over land
and housing
      Key messages
Box 5.1




          >	Access to and control over land can expand women’s agency, increasing
             self-esteem, economic opportunities, mobility outside of the home, and
             decision-making power.

          >	Fewer women than men report owning land or housing. More women
             who are married, divorced, or widowed report owning land than do single
             women. Women are more likely to report they own land jointly than
             individually.


          >	Social norms, customary practices, inaccessible and weak institutions,
             and, in many cases, women’s lack of awareness of their rights are
             important barriers to the full realization of women’s land rights.


          >	Three key areas of legislation—family law, inheritance law, and land
             law—affect the right to own and control property. Complex and
             sometimes contradictory sets of statutory laws, customs, and norms
             affect women’s land ownership.


          >	Law reform and improved implementation, better gender-sensitive
             administration, and richer sex-disaggregated data are all needed to
             ensure women’s land rights are fully realized.

  Box 5.2 	 Can control over land reduce gender-based violence?

  Chapter 3 reviewed the extent and gravity of gender-based violence, focused primarily on
  violence in the home. Women’s asset ownership may provide exit options from unhappy or
  abusive relationships and can reduce vulnerability to domestic violence. In Kerala, India, a panel
  survey of ever-married women (that is, married women, widows, or divorcees) found that more
  than 70 percent of the women who owned land or housing and who had experienced long-term
  physical violence had left their husband and the matrimonial home, and few had returned. In
  contrast, almost all of the 20 percent of women who did not own such property went to live
  with their parents, and, ultimately, half returned to their husbands. Land and housing ownership
  also demonstrated a more secure exit option than employment: only one-third of women were
  employed, and the majority were in low-paying and irregular employment.

  In West Bengal, India, women who did not own land or housing were more likely to report
  domestic violence than those who did—57 percent of those without property compared to
  35 percent of women property owners. In contrast, in Sri Lanka, women who owned property
  did not report lower rates of intimate partner violence than women who did not own property.
  The mixed nature of these findings may be due in part to women acquiring property after
  marriage, when a pattern of violence may already be entrenched in the relationship, but further
  exploration is needed.

  The introduction of joint titling in Ethiopia’s Amhara region in 2000, supported by strong
  implementation, has meant that men are more reluctant to ask for a divorce because they risk
  the division of their property. However, whether this trend is beneficial for women or ties them
  to abusive relationships is unclear. It is important to bear in mind that most of the studies do not
  show causal relationships but instead demonstrate associations.

Box 5.3 	 What do we mean by ownership and control?

Clarifying ownership and control in relation to land and housing is important.

Reported ownership is where a respondent reports that they own land or housing (usually posed at
the household level). However, even when women self-report as joint owners of land parcels with
their husband, often only his name is on the documentation.

Documented ownership indicates that an individual’s name is on the relevant document, either alone
or jointly with someone else. This document may be a formal land title or a customary certificate,
certificate of sale, or inheritance documentation. Inclusion on a document provides a verifiable form
of ownership, and important for women in the wake of a divorce or a husband’s death and also in
the case of sale or transfer of land.

Effective ownership is about decision-making power over how to use and dispose of property.
Individuals may have partial ownership rights, such as user rights to cultivate, rent, and even
bequeath land, but lack authority to sell the land.

In general, women’s documented ownership of land is lower than self-reported ownership. For
example, 8 percent of women and 15 percent of men are self-reported landowners in Ghana, which
falls to 1 percent and 2 percent, respectively, among those with a formal ownership document.

Individuals can have control over land under customary law in a number of countries, including
Malawi and Rwanda. Under customary law individuals may have rights of use, with differing degrees
of freedom to lease out, mortgage, bequeath, or sell. Land rights also may have a temporal or
locational dimension: they may accrue only for a person’s lifetime or some lesser period, and may be
conditional on the person residing on the land or locally. The extent to which an individual perceives
herself to be an owner may affect her choices about the land and decision-making more broadly.

     Box 5.4 	 Main types of marital property regimes

     Community of property regimes treat all assets, including land and housing, acquired during the
     marriage as the joint property of the couple, with the exception of inheritance or gifts specifically
     earmarked for one spouse. These regimes implicitly recognize nonmonetary contributions to the
     household, including domestic labor and child care. About 87 countries have community of property
     regimes. Community of property regimes can be divided into three categories:

     ››   Full: all property acquired before marriage is regarded as joint property.

     ››   Partial: all property acquired before marriage remains personal property of each spouse.

     ››   Deferred: all property acquired during marriage is treated as individually owned during the
          marriage but is divided equally on divorce or death.

     Separation of property regimes provide that all property is individually owned unless specified as
     jointly owned. In the event of marital dissolution, each spouse leaves with the property they brought
     into or acquired during the marriage. Specific legislation can be enacted to recognize nonmonetary
     contributions, but these provisions are rare. Of the 46 countries that have separation of property
     regimes, only nine recognize nonmonetary contribution.

Box 5.5 	 Expanding women’s access to land rights in Honduras

In 2003, the Honduras Land Administration Program (PATH) was launched to address gaps in
formalization of property rights, promote a more dynamic land market, increase investments in land,
and reduce social instability resulting from conflict over land. Increasing formal property ownership
for women was also seen as critical for improving rural productivity. At that time, about 30 percent
of the country’s land was registered, of which women owned less than 13 percent.

A World Bank gender audit revealed that despite provisions allowing for joint titling, few women
were named on a land title. The audit identified three primary constraints, namely limited awareness
of legal rights among women and land administration personnel, land registries and other municipal
offices who lacked capacity and procedural guidance on ways to implement the laws, and social
norms which dictated that men were the head of household, resulting in titling being in their names
alone.

To address these gaps, PATH held almost a dozen stakeholder workshops in different municipalities.
The participants included local authorities, community leaders, and indigenous peoples’
organizations, and the aim was to facilitate better understanding of the program among beneficiaries
and the importance of gender-responsive design. The resulting gender strategy employed the
following methods to improve implementation:

››   The guiding documents and instruments were revised so that implementation included specific
     objectives for strengthening women’s access to land.

››   A media campaign, including a radio program on “Gender situation of women in indigenous
     communications,” was initiated, with materials targeted at men and women of all ages to convey
     clear messages on the importance of land titling and ways to use titles to advance economic
     opportunities.

››   Project indicators were strengthened to include joint titling. The revised results and monitoring
     framework includes such targets as 30 percent of new titles to include women, and 25 percent
     of those receiving training in alternative dispute resolution, and in territorial planning and natural
     resource management are women.

Box 5.6 	 Tools to guide gender land assessments

The World Bank’s “Toolkit for Integrating Gender-Related Issues in Land Policy and Administration
Projects” provides guidelines for a gender analysis of the socioeconomic and cultural conditions
in the project area, including with regard to statutory and customary property rights, land policies
and legislation, land administration institutions, and land market transactions. In the West Bank
and Gaza, for example, such an analysis identified that inheritance is determined according to
Shari’a law and proof of ownership is issued by the Shari’a court. However, customary practice has
encouraged women to cede their shares to their brothers. A gender analysis of the local conditions
led the project design to counteract this type of pressure by issuing titles that include the names of
all rightful heirs and specify their shares.

Landesa’s “Women’s Land Tenure Framework for Analysis: Inheritance” provides a framework for
assessing women’s ability to inherit land in a specific country, state, or community. Collaboration
between the state and progressive traditional authorities can identify options for upholding
women’s land rights in customary tenure areas. In Foshan City, Guangdong Province, China, for
example, the local government took action to address land rights of women who married someone
from another village. Using clear guidance and principles based on relevant Chinese laws, the
district government set up a working group of government officials to review village rules and
work together with villagers to change the local provisions that discriminate against women’s equal
rights to land. Judicial procedures were applied to enforce compliance. After one year of the
administrative and judicial intervention, 95 percent of married women in the district (about 18,000
women) were granted equal land rights.

Box 5.7	 Lessons from Vietnam’s land reform process

Vietnam’s 1993 Land Law did not appear to discriminate in granting land rights because it used
neutral language such as “individuals” and “users” when referring to the targeted beneficiaries of
the reforms. The 2000 Family and Marriage Law also provided for equal spousal rights to assets and
property, including land. In practice however, gender disparities resulted. Initially, the Land Use
Certificates that were used had space for only one name, which was to be filled in by the household
head (generally the husband). The unintended consequence was that fewer women had their names
on certificates. Gender disparities also resulted from the allocation of acreage based on the ages of
household members, whereby working-age individuals received the largest shares. Because female
households tended to have fewer adults of working age, they received on average less land than
male-headed households. The legal retirement age for women was also five years earlier than for
men. In practice, this led to women ages 55–59 being allocated half the amount of land allocated
to men of the same age.

Vietnam has made progress in remedying these disparities. For example, a 2001 government decree
stipulated that the names of both husband and wife should be included on the certificate if the land
was jointly owned, and the 2003 Land Law mandates joint titling.

Control over land and housing affects women’s agency across a range of domains,
including household decision making and access to economic opportunities. Improv-
ing women’s property rights can have transformative effects on social norms and
women’s status within the household and the community. More and better sex–
disaggregated data are needed to highlight gaps in ownership and access. This will
help inform policy interventions to ensure the inclusion of women in land titling
programs. Data availability and gaps are reviewed in chapter 7. A broad approach
needs to ensure that beneficial customary and communal rights are recognized and
respected, coupled with reforms to promote gender equality and provide effective
implementation.

Bad people came, and they took all normal life from us … they had so many rules as to what we
could do. We could not go to market.

We fought for our rights. I wrote the blog for the BBC and wrote my diary. Not only was I speaking,
many of my friends were talking to the media and to news channels. Media was like a messenger,
telling what we are saying to the world. We spoke, we wrote and raised our voices. We spoke, and
we achieved our goal. Now Swat is now a peaceful place. Girls are going back to school and are
allowed to go to the market.”

Box 6.3 	 Women’s movements drive reforms

In India, the women’s movement helped secure wide-ranging reforms in the aftermath of the
heinous attack of a young student on a bus in Delhi in December 2012. India’s women’s groups and
their male allies used the attack and the inadequate response from India’s authorities to highlight
the customary violence against women that has been ignored by a culture of impunity and silence.
Galvanized by these mass protests, a committee was set up and headed by a former Chief Justice to
review antirape provisions and make recommendations for state action. Previously in India, women’s
networks had used CEDAW to press for sexual harassment legislation. In 1997, the Indian Supreme
Court relied on the Constitution and India’s obligations under CEDAW to recognize the right to
gender equality and a working environment free from sexual harassment and abuse. The court
produced the first guidelines on sexual harassment and employment, which ultimately led in 2007
to legislation prohibiting sexual harassment in the workplace.

Women’s movements also use litigation as a powerful tool to challenge unconstitutional discriminatory
laws and to address gaps in legal frameworks, such as the successful challenge to discriminatory
customary inheritance laws in Botswana in 2013. In Egypt, tireless mobilization by women’s groups
in the wake of the revolution led to a new decree that established the right of Egyptian women
whose husbands are from West Bank and Gaza to pass on her citizenship to their children. In El
Salvador, Asociación de Madres Demandantes helps women enforce court-ordered child support
payments, and its work has attracted national attention and led to several measures guaranteeing
greater support for children.

Box 6.4 “If anyone listens, I have a lot of plans”: Women’s participation in
         Afghanistan
Afghanistan’s National Solidarity Programme (NSP) mandates participation of women in community
development councils. Evidence of the mandate’s effect suggests that increasing women’s
participation in community development processes can improve women’s mobility and enable
access to a range of information, including legal rights. In most places, the NSP increased women’s
mobility by giving them socially acceptable places to visit on a regular basis and by showing men
that women’s mobility has a positive effect on women’s personal growth.

A woman from Parwan province reported: “NSP allowed women to come out of their houses and
gather in groups. This has helped a great deal. The more women come out the less people will talk.”

At the same time, men’s perceptions have changed: “After we allowed the women’s shura (council)
to become active, people do not make negative comments anymore, and if they do, nobody pays
attention.”

Mandating female participation improved both men’s and women’s attitudes toward female
participation in community affairs (by 20 percent and 8 percent, respectively) and increased the
likelihood that women would be involved in income-generating activities by some 13 percent.

Box 6.5 	 Women are underrepresented at senior levels in the justice sector

                                       Globally, women account for 27 percent of judges. In some
                                       countries, women judges are restricted in their judicial duties.
                                       In the Islamic Republic of Iran, for example, women judges are
                                       unable to issue and sign final verdicts.

                                  In nearly two-thirds of the 123 countries for which there are data,
                                  women comprise less than 25 percent of justices in constitutional
                                  courts (figure 6.2). But there is significant country and regional
                                  variation. In Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and Zambia more than half of
                                  justices are women. At 60 percent, Sierra Leone has the highest
                                  share of female constitutional judges in the world, and the chief
                                  justice is a woman. With six female chief justices—in Gabon,
Ghana, Niger, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Zambia—Sub-Saharan Africa has more female chief justices
than any other region.
Note: Of the 600 judges in Jordan’s court system, about 40 are women.

Box 6.7 	 Mapping and creating safe spaces for girls in South Africa

The daily activities of adolescents in South Africa are overshadowed by social, economic, and physical
risks that constrain their access to the public sphere and limit their economic opportunities. In
particular, the threat of gender-based violence looms large for girls. As a result, they are encouraged
to stay close to their home and limit their movements and activities to safe spaces.

In 2004–05, the Population Council conducted a participatory mapping exercise in an urban township
and rural community. Groups of students from both primary and secondary schools, roughly 11 to
15 years of age, were asked to draw the area that represented their community and rate its level
of safety. Their drawings were compared with Google satellite images for each locality (figure 6.5).

In urban areas, the space mapped by younger girls (6.33 square miles) was 2.5 times larger than
the area mapped by older girls (2.62 square miles). In contrast, older boys mapped an area twice
as large as younger boys, 7.81 square miles compared to 3.79 miles. The results show that at age
11, girls’ physical space was larger than that of boys of the same age but then fell dramatically after
puberty. The same was true in rural areas.

Boys reported a number of spaces as “very” or “extremely” safe, including primary and secondary
schools, but girls did not use these categories to describe any space. In fact, urban secondary
schools were ranked as very unsafe by adolescent girls. Libraries were rated as somewhat safe by
younger and older urban girls, whereas older boys described them as extremely safe. Older girls in
particular reported most spaces in their restricted navigable areas as unsafe.

The findings suggest that participatory mapping tools can provide a useful instrument for assessing
perceptions of violence and creating targeted programs for adolescents. For example, local libraries
and youth centers can be transformed into safe spaces for girls by designating girls- or boys-only
spaces at different times and by providing social support networks for boys and girls to negotiate
insecurity and dangers in their immediate environments.

Box 6.8 	 Working with civil society to prevent gender-based violence in Haiti

In the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, as people crowded into camps, women and
children became increasingly vulnerable to violence and assault. To help address this risk, the
World Bank Group joined forces with the Commission of Women Victims for Victims (KOFAVIV),
a grassroots Haitian organization comprised of female survivors of sexual gender-based violence,
and their international partner organization, MADRE, to address and prevent violence in five of
Haiti’s internally displaced persons camps. The project worked with KOFAVIV’s community outreach
workers and peer counselors—often rape survivors themselves living in the camps—and provided
health and safety kits to vulnerable women and girls. This support was coupled with media outreach
campaigns to promote awareness and prevention of violence as well as technical assistance to
KOFAVIV from MADRE to improve project coordination, financial management, communications,
long-term planning, and monitoring and evaluation. The initiative enhanced women’s civic
participation by building coalitions and networks with government, international institutions, media,
and other women’s rights nongovernmental organizations in Haiti.

KOFAVIV also became a lead convener in working with civil society groups, police, hospitals, and
the government to address gender-based violence in Haiti. The capacity at KOFAVIV increased as
more empowered community agents became involved in the initiative.

Women’s voices can be transformative, helping to highlight and combat discrimina-
tion, focusing attention on policies that can reduce gender inequality, and directing
resources to programs that can enhance opportunities for women, girls, and their
families. Making real advances in women’s political participation requires interven-
tions and support on several fronts to foster positive changes in norms and practice.
Collective action is an important vehicle for women’s voice, and autonomous wom-
en’s movements play a critical role in driving positive changes that can shift social
norms over the longer term. In many parts of the world, attitudes are changing,
leading to increased recognition of women’s leadership ability at national and local
levels.

          >	Lack of data on women’s agency is a challenge to be overcome, but it
             should not be an excuse for inaction in the meantime.

          >	To measure progress and compare women’s agency across countries,
             more and better data and new measures are needed.

          >	The internationally agreed minimum set of 52 gender indicators and
             the statistical indicators and guidelines for measuring violence against
             women provide a strong basis for improving the availability of data and
             evidence on women’s agency

          >	Promising efforts to produce more national-level data on women’s agency
             includes Data2X, the Evidence on Data and Gender Equality initiative,
             and the Living Standards Measurement Study–Integrated Surveys on
             Agriculture.

          >	Quantitative data need to be complemented by qualitative information.
          >	Several promising new initiatives are combining data in composite
             indices to measure multiple agency deprivations across different
             domains.

          >	At the operational level, project and program indicators need to establish
             baselines and more systematically track agency in key domains.

          >	More rigorous evaluations of what works are needed, particularly around
             collective voice, normative change and the design of multi-sectoral
             programs.

Box 7.6 	 Measuring and expanding agency in Latin America and the Caribbean

In Latin America and the Caribbean ”(LAC), as in other regions, lack of rigorous measures for agency
and low awareness of the importance of agency create serious impediments to its advancement
through programs and policy initiatives. To fill this gap, the World Bank Group’s Umbrella Facility for
Gender Equality (UFGE) supports initiatives aimed at 1) expanding data, indicators, and evidence on
agency and its effects on other dimensions of gender equality and 2) road testing evidence on how
to expand agency. In all projects supported by LAC UFGE, agency is either one of the outcomes or
plays an instrumental role in achieving other project objectives. Some examples are as follow:

››   In Ecuador, the Text Me Maybe pilot intervention aims to increase the evidence-base on the role
     of agency in policy interventions that address teen pregnancy prevalence and risk factors and
     road test the effectiveness of text message reminders in changing behaviors.

››   In St. Lucia, UFGE funds support efforts to reduce women’s vulnerability in natural disasters by
     enhancing their agency, especially for female heads of households, through climate adaptation
     activities.

››   In Northeast Brazil, a pilot intervention to enhance women’s agency in agricultural production
     integrates tools to measure their empowerment relative to productivity, income-generation,
     access to markets, and gender roles and decision-making power within the household, producer
     groups, and the broader community.

LAC UFGE also supports capacity building for project teams in conceptualizing and measuring
agency, including through a recent workshop to review existing measures of various dimensions of
agency and resources for addressing empirical challenges. The first results from this work will be
available in September 2014.

Box 7.7 	 Using new measures of women’s autonomy in Chad: The Relative

                                                with United Nations Children’s Fund–Chad and the
Indic Society for Education and Development, used the RAI within a nationally representative survey,
which addressed topics such as consumption, work, living standards, education, and subjective well-
being, with a focus on health behaviors and outcomes.

To measure autonomy, people were asked whether their actions were coerced to some extent, or
done to please others, and whether their actions embodied the respondents’ own values. Their
degree of autonomy was analyzed for their actions in eight domains—including domestic work,
market work, making major household purchases, participating in groups, and feeding young
children.

The most striking finding is that women are less autonomously motivated than men across every
single domain. Women ages 15-26 had the lowest autonomy, in sharp contrast to men of the same
age. Uneducated men had greater autonomy than uneducated women in all domains (except group
membership), but men and women who participated in a group had higher autonomy in all other
domains without exception. However, results show that autonomy is not necessarily associated
with more life satisfaction or happiness. Levels of education and household income—commonly
used indicators of agency—are not strongly associated with autonomy levels either. Given these
additional insights, the results suggest that the RAI could be used to enhance or replace other
indirect measures of agency.

These early findings suggest the RAI yields new information that can contribute to understanding
the linkages between women’s autonomy, agency, and development outcomes. Further analysis
will explore the relationship between the individual’s autonomy and specific behavior such as hand
washing, exclusive breastfeeding, and child marriage. In Chad, early marriage is widely accepted—
and 1 in 10 girls has had a child before age 15.b Measuring autonomy in these ways, therefore,
could help to identify high-impact pathways that empower multiple generations within the same
household.

Box 7.9 	 Examples of World Bank Group project indicators related to women’s
          agency

Gender-based violence
››   The 2008 Protection from gender-based violence in Côte d’Ivoire Project measured the percentage
     of the surveyed population that listened to the project’s radio shows about GBV at least two times
     and the number of women experiencing physical intimate partner violence.
››   The 2012 Breaking the Cycle of Violence Project in Honduras included measures of the number of
     youth whose awareness about GBV increased over the course of the project.

Sexual and reproductive health and rights
››   The 2010 Nepal Second Health Nutrition and Population and HIV/AIDS Project included the
     following agency-related indicators: the current use of modern contraceptives among women
     ages 15–49 and the percentage of married women ages 15–49 with unmet need for family
     planning.
››   The 2014 Tajikistan Health Services Improvement Project included contraceptive prevalence
     rates as a results indicator, measured as the share of women in project districts ages 15–49 using
     modern methods of family planning.

Control over land and housing
››   The 2010 Kosovo Real Estate Cadastre and Registration Project incorporated an indicator on the
     percentage of women with use of or ownership rights registered (both joint and individual).
››   The 2007 Vietnam Poverty Reduction and Support Operation Credit (PRSC-6) measured asset
     ownership among women.


Voice and influence
››   The 2010 Afghanistan Third Emergency National Solidarity Project included targets for the
     proportion of female representatives in the Community Development Councils taking active part
     in making decisions for community development.
››   The 2010 Bangladesh Empowerment and Livelihood Improvement “Nuton Jibon” Project
     monitored the percentage of village-level Executive Committees (Gram Samitis) where the
     chronically poor hold decision-making positions and the percentage of these who are women.

Capturing and monitoring efforts to promote women’s voice and agency requires
high quality data, but data gaps remain significant. Overcoming these gaps will
require greater investment and concerted effort from governments, international
agencies, and local and national implementing partners. As highlighted in this chap-
ter, several initiatives are already underway to develop and standardize indicators
that better measure agency and allow for more direct comparison across countries.
These include Data2X, EDGE, LSMS–ISA, in addition to recent international agree-
ment on minimum gender indicators and guidelines for collecting data on violence
against women. Some research efforts are underway to design and test new mea-
sures of agency and deepen the evidence base for policy through rigorous test-
ing of interventions that explicitly aim to enhance women’s agency, but more are
needed. Together these efforts will contribute to closing important data and knowl-
edge gaps on agency and will serve the priorities of the post-2015 agenda, which
will increase demand for data to measure advancements in women’s empowerment
and our progress towards gender equality.
