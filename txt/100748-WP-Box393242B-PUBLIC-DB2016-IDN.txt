THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business
2016: starting a business, dealing with construction
permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in this year’s economy
profile.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2015 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is nev er used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

        (KRK):

        1. A copy of land ownership certificate (which has been
        notarized);
        2. A copy of the latest payment receipt for land and building tax;
        3. A copy of the identity card (KTP/Driving License) of the

        below).]

        The KRK is a statement that contains planning information about
        the plot of land that BuildCo intends to build the warehouse on.
        The KRK also includes a city planning map scale (1:1000) signed

      h. Blocking - the arrangement of city spaces on certain lanes
      governing the length and width of the piece of land for which
      the city planning permit is being applied for

      BuildCo must also request a building site plan (RTLB) from the
      City Planning Office. The RTLB is a plan that outlines the exact
      position of the building on the city planning map and contains
      the following information (some of which is already contained on
      the city planning map previously):
      a. Building setback (GSB) - the borders within which BuildCo is
      allowed to construct the building
      b. Road border lines (GSJ) - the borders of the front yard or
      block borders or road control borders
      c. Building trace form and location
      d. Building usage
      e. Height of building, including KDB (building coverage) and KLB
      (floor area)
      f. Building cuts
      g. Parking lot
      h. Kelzar circulation/entry of vehicles

      Once the documents are submitted, BuildCo receives an invoice
      with the amount of fees that must be paid (SKRD). BuildCo must
      pay the fees at a local branch of Bank DKI and submit the receipt
      to the City Planning Office. The total cost to obtain these
      documents is IDR 1,482,000.00 according to Article 123 of the
      Regional Regulation No. 1 Year 2006.

      The following is the detailed calculation:
      • Land measurement (based on the land certificate, namely 500 -
      - 1,000 sq. m.) a retribution of IDR 750,000.00
      • Print out of the map (scale of 1:1000), a retribution of IDR
      1,000.00 per copy x 12 copies or a total of IDR 12,000.00
      • KRK for plans to use the land for warehouse construction
      (Karya pergudangan/Kpg) for a land area of up to 1,000 sq. m. is
      subject to a fee of IDR 40,000.00
      • RTLB for plans to build warehouse construction is subject to a
      fee of IDR 40,000.00/100 sq. m. of floor surface, so the total fee
      for the RTLB: IDR 40,000.00 x 13 (based on a 1,300.6 sq. m. floor
      surface) = IDR 520,000.00
      • Land marking for city planning implementation purposes
      (pematokan penerapan rencana kota) is subject to a fee of IDR
      80,000.00 x 2 (because the building exceeds 1,000 sq. m.), or a
      total of IDR 160,000.00

      The Building Supervision and Control Office has 4 different
      teams that review the architectural, structural, mechanical and
      electrical drawings. The application is first reviewed by TPAK (the
      team that reviews the architectural drawings). This can take 3-4
      weeks. The application is then forwarded to TPKB (team that
      reviews the structural drawings) and in parallel to TPIB (team that
      reviews the mechanical, electrical and plumbing drawings). This
      also takes about 3-4 weeks on average.

      According to Bylaw No. 3 on Building Tariff Rates of October
      2012, the permit fee is calculated as follows:

      RPP = L x It x HSbg = 1,300.6 x 2.1 x 25,000

      •          L = area of the building (1,300.6 sq. m)
      •          It = index that is calculated as follows:
      Ikg x If x Ik x Iw x Ipt where Ikg = 1 (for a new building); If = 3
      (for commercial buildings); Ik = 0.7; Iw = 1 (for permanent
      buildings); Ipt = 1 (if the building does not have a basement).
      Therefore, It = 1 x 3 x 0.7 x 1 x 1 = 2.1
      •          HSbg = IDR 25,000 / sq. m.

      (SLF) and the usage permit. The party issuing the official report
      on the completion of the construction and compliance with the
      building permit is the Supervising Director, who can be an
      individual, a group of experts, or an entity appointed by the
11    project owner to supervise the construction work. For the Doing        1 day        no charge
      Business case study, the supervising director would most likely

      Request city planning permit (SKRK) from Surabaya One-Stop
      Shop (Unit Pelayanan Terpadu Satu Atap - UPTSA)

      In order to obtain the city planning permit (SKRK), BuildCo must submit
      the following documents:

      a. Application form (available at Surabaya one-stop shop);
      b. Copy of identity card of the applicants;
      c. Copy of property tax invoice and receipt;
      d. Legalized copy of land ownership certificate.
      e. BuildCo’s deed of establishment
      f. License of supervising engineer

      BuildCo can see the map of Surabaya online and click on the location
      where they intend to build the project. Majority of applicants apply for
      the city planning permit in person, although it is possible to submit the
      documents online.

      Once it submits the documents, BuildCo is interviewed about the
      project details. After that, the Surabaya one-stop shop checks
      adherence of the location with master plan and calculates the
      retribution charges. BuildCo pays the fees at the Surabaya one-stop
      shop and the file is transferred to the City Planning Agency (Dinas Cipta    1 day      IDR 2,822,000

      Karya dan Tata Ruang). City Planning Agency representatives inspect
      the future building site, measure the location, prepare drawings, and
      position the future building's plot in technical master plan. They also
      prepare location drawings (with border, base coefficient, size
      coefficient, and technical requirements). When all is complete, the City
      Planning Agency evaluates, registers, and approves the application.
      Once the application has been approved, the City Planning Agency
      transfers the file back to the Surabaya one-stop shop which then
      notifies BuildCo that the statement is ready for pick up.

      Regulations establish a statutory time of 7 days for the city planning
      statement to be issued, but it usually takes longer.

      This procedure is governed by the following regulations:
      a. Local Regulation No. 7 of 2010 on Buildings
      b. Local Regulation No. 5 of 2012 On City Maps
      c. Major Regulation No. 39 of 2012 on Guidelines and Technical

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March (for 11 economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city). As noted, the
warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff schedules may apply if a time-of-
use tariff is available.

       few hours to 1 day. However, sometimes the land book is unavailable,
       misplaced or being used by another division of the Land Office, so then
       the examination process will be pending and it usually takes a few days
       to obtain the information from the Land Office. The land title search

      Land certificate examination at the local Land Office (BPN)



      A land certificate examination is carried out by a Land Deed Official. If
      the land book concerned is available at the Land Office, it usually takes 1
      day. However, sometimes the land book is unavailable, misplaced or
      being used by another division of the Land Office, so then the
      examination process will be pending and it usually takes a few days to
      obtain the information from the Land Office. The Regulation of the
      National Land Agency Number 1 of 2010 stipulates that the
      requirements to examine the land certificate include the following:
      a. Land Ownership Certificate;
      b. Copy of the applicant’s identification or its proxy;                             3 days

      The land title search would also involve a check at the local City Planning
      Office, located at the local government office, to determine the intended
      use of the said plot of land, whether for residences, industry or green
      belt. No written statement is given, but a note made on the certificate
      saying 'Has been examined and according to the Land Registry/ Land
      Book at the Land Office, dated_______, time ________' and initialed by the
      officer at the Land Office.

PAYING TAXES
Economies around the world have made paying taxes                 and exemptions. Many have lowered tax rates. Changes
faster, easier and less costly for businesses—such as by          have brought concrete results. Some economies
consolidating payments and filings of taxes, offering             simplifying tax payment and reducing rates have seen
electronic systems for filing and payment, establishing           tax revenue rise. What tax reforms has Doing Business

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

                                             conducted by the SAO (State Auction Office).


                                            After the suspension of payment period, BizBank would gain

                                             The total foreclosure procedure, which will be suspended temporarily
                                             by the initiation of the bankruptcy proceedings, would take
                                             approximate 2 years in total. BizBank would initiate foreclosure after
                                             Mirage's default on payment. According to Part Six of Law No.37 of
                                             2004 regarding Bankruptcy and Suspension of Obligation for Debt
                                             Payment, Mirage would petition to the Commercial Court for a
                                             suspension of payments. The foreclosure procedure then gets
                                             converted to reorganization. Bankruptcy cases are heard before the

                                             administrator or receiver to assist the debtor in managing its estate.
                                             Provisional moratorium is 90 days, but permanent moratorium, which
                                             can be granted as an extension of time is 270 days. During this time,
                                             Mirage must propose a composition plan and creditors will decide
                                             whether to accept the plan, reject it or proceed to a permanent
                                             moratorium. BizBank is likely to vote against the composition plan,
                                             which will lead to Mirage being declared bankrupt. At that time,
                                             moratorium ends, and BizBank can proceed with foreclosure

                                             The costs associated with the case would amount to approximately
                                             22% of the value of the debtor's estate. Cost incurred during the entire

economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in
figure 14.2 in the Doing Business 2016 report). And for
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 in the Doing Business 2016 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
