EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Now that enrollment has been completed for the HIV cohorts, this report describes the
complete enrollment into the HIV cohorts for protocol 1 for the Evaluation of the National
Adherence Guidelines for Chronic Diseases in South Africa Using Routinely Collected Data.
The study is evaluating short-term and long-term effects of five interventions being
implemented by the National Department of Health (NDoH) in South Africa to improve
adherence to HIV care and chronic disease care in general: Fast track initiation counselling
(FTIC), decentralized medicine delivery (DMD), adherence clubs (AC), early patient tracing
(TRIC) and enhanced adherence counselling (EAC). The study uses a randomized evaluation
design to compare health facilities where the intervention was rolled out with facilities
where it was not. After completing data enhancement activities at each of the 24 sites (12
intervention and 12 control sites in 4 provinces in South Africa), the teams began
enrollment into 7 study cohorts (5 HIV intervention evaluation cohorts and 2 TB,
hypertension and Diabetes (TBHD) observational cohorts).

Enrollment began on 20 June 2016 and was stopped as of 16 December 2016 for the HIV
cohorts. Enrollment for the TBHD cohorts is ongoing (with expected completion by March
2017). While the team faced several challenges to completing enrollment the team
developed approaches to overcoming the enrollment obstacles for nearly all cohorts by
working with the World Bank and NDoH co-principal investigators. In addition to the
barriers reported in the first enrollment report, the team encountered some additional
barriers: 1) additional delays in rollout of the interventions; 2) an insufficient number of
patients provided with the interventions at some sites; and 3) delays in implementation of
the interventions which meant we could not continue to prospectively enroll subjects and
still meet our endpoints within the appropriate time frame. To overcome these barriers and
achieve the targeted sample size for all but one cohort (EAC), the team employed three
main strategies: 1) increasing the duration of enrollment through nearly the end of
December 2016; 2) overenrolling patients at some sites; and 3) shifting to including some
retrospective enrollment, whereby sites with additional numbers of eligible patients for
enrollment prior to December 2016 overenrolled patients. While these strategies mean we
do not have even enrollment across sites, this allowed us to achieve or nearly achieve our
total sample size in nearly all cohorts. The exception to this is the EAC cohort, where either
not enough subjects were offered the intervention or the intervention was offered and not
documented sufficiently to allow completion of enrollment within this cohort.

EVALUATION OF THE NATIONAL DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH'S NATIONAL ADHERENCE GUIDELINES FOR CHRONIC
DISEASES IN SOUTH AFRICA


Passive follow up has now begun for patients in the HIV cohorts through monitoring data
collection systems (TIER.net and NHLS) and patient files for study outcomes. Much of the
work by the local team has now shifted to focus on protocol 2 where qualitative data is
being collected to supplement the quantitative analyses that will result from protocol 1.

       BACKGROUND
For antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV and treatments for other chronic diseases to be effective,
patients must remain in care for longer periods of time, initiate treatment as early as allowed under
prevailing guidelines, consistently achieve high levels of adherence to their treatment regimen and,
as a result, exhibit low and stable monitoring test results and/or treatment completion. In the case
of HIV, treatment is lifelong and requires consistent, nearly complete adherence to sustain an
undetectable viral load. Numerous studies and reviews have indicated that retention in care and
adherence to ART in South Africa are sub-optimal and pose a serious threat to the long-term
success of the national HIV response. Although there is less evidence on hand, these same problems
almost certainly also pertain to tuberculosis (TB), for which treatment completion and cure rates
do not approach global targets and to non-communicable diseases (NCDs), for which almost no
treatment adherence data are available.

To address this challenge, in 2014 the NDOH developed the “National Adherence Guidelines for
Chronic Diseases (HIV, TB and NCDs)” with rollout in 2015/2016. The guidelines address the
provision of a minimum package of interventions to increase linkage to care, retention in care, and
adherence to treatment. The minimum package of interventions includes five interventions that are
being evaluated under this study: 1) fast track initiation counseling (FTIC); 2) enhanced adherence
counseling for unstable patients (EAC); 3) adherence clubs (AC); 4) decentralized medicine delivery
(DMD); and 5) early tracing of all missed appointments to improve retention in care (TRIC). The
study was designed as a matched cluster randomized study in 24 clinics, 12 of which would receive
early implementation of the minimum package and 12 would delay implementation and serve as
control sites. Clinics were matched on clinic characteristics: total remaining on ART, clinic size,
setting, location and viral suppression. This design was achieved for all of the interventions except
for DMD, where a national decanting strategy meant that many of the control sites implemented
DMD.




       STUDY AIM AND OBJECTIVES
The overall aims of this study are to assess the impact of a subset of the National Adherence
Guidelines’ (AGL) minimum package of interventions on HIV patients’ treatment outcomes at public
sector clinics; estimate the costs of the interventions; and describe the cascade of care for TB,
hypertension, and diabetes at these same clinics.

The study has 8 specific aims which are detailed in the two study protocols entitled “Evaluation of
the National Department of Health's National Adherence Guidelines for Chronic Diseases in South

Africa Using Routinely Collected Data” and “Process Evaluation of the National Department of
Health's National Adherence Guidelines for Chronic Diseases in South Africa”. The objectives are:

    ► Among HIV-infected patients newly eligible for antiretroviral therapy, evaluate the impact of
       Fast Track Treatment Initiation Counselling on initiation and viral suppression.

    ► Among HIV-infected patients who are stable on antiretroviral therapy, evaluate the impact of
       Adherence Clubs on ART adherence and viral suppression.

    ► Among HIV-infected patients who are stable on antiretroviral therapy, evaluate the impact of
       decentralized medicine delivery on ART adherence and viral suppression.

    ► Among HIV-infected patients who have poor adherence to antiretroviral therapy, evaluate
       the impact of EAC on treatment adherence and viral suppression.

    ► Among HIV-infected patients in antiretroviral therapy programs who miss a scheduled
       appointment by 5 days or more, evaluate the impact of Early Patient Tracing on retention in
       care.

    ► For each clinic included in the study, evaluate the overall impact of the Adherence Guidelines
       on patient outcomes.

    ► Estimate the incremental and total cost of each of the interventions listed above compared to
       standard of care.

    ► Describe the current status of the cascade of care and adherence to treatment for
       tuberculosis, hypertension, and diabetes, for the purpose of tailoring the minimum package
       of interventions to these conditions in the national rollout.




        PURPOSE OF THE REPORT
We previously wrote an enrollment report which covered enrollment up through October of 2016.
Since that time enrollment has closed for all of the HIV cohorts. The purpose of this report is to
describe the complete enrollment for protocol 1 which was completed for the HIV cohorts at the
end of December 2016 (December 16th). Enrollment is still ongoing for the TB, Hypertension and
Diabetes cohorts and this report provides updated enrollment data for those cohorts as well. In
addition, we describe the additional challenges we faced since the last report to completing
enrollment and document the strategies that we used to complete our enrollment for the HIV
cohorts. As with the previous report, we describe the data sources used to collect baseline
information on the cohorts, review the eligibility criteria for each cohort and describe the
methodology used to identify eligible subjects for each cohort. Finally, we review the final
enrollment data within each HIV cohort and describe the cohorts in terms of their basic clinical and
demographic characteristics.

       ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA
For all cohorts, we created general eligibility criteria that focused the study on non-pregnant adults.
All cohorts used these general eligibility criteria, including the TBHD cohorts. Below we describe
the general inclusion and exclusion criteria which applied to all cohorts within the study.

4.1 General inclusion/Exclusion criteria
Inclusion criteria

   ► ≥ 18 years old

   ► Meet the inclusion criteria for one or more of the cohorts


Exclusion criteria

   ► Not resident in the facility’s catchment area

   ► Recorded intention to transfer care to a different facility within 12 months

   ► Pregnant and eligible for prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT)

4.2 Cohort specific inclusion/exclusion criteria
Within each cohort, specific inclusion/exclusion criteria were developed to ensure enrollment of
appropriate subjects. The enrollment criteria followed the December 2014 national guidelines for
HIV care and ART and November 2015 National Adherence Guidelines for Chronic Disease (HIV, TB
and NCDs) with some updates based on the August 2016 version of the Guidelines. Below we
describe inclusion/exclusion criteria applied to each cohort.

Cohort 1: Fast track treatment initiation inclusion criteria (Patients newly eligible for ART)

   ► Determined to be eligible to start ART under prevailing national guidelines (before
       September 2016, CD4 count < 500, WHO Stage 3 or 4 condition, no TB or cryptococcal
       meningitis; September 2016 and after, anyone HIV positive and considered eligible by the
       sites)


Cohorts 2 and 3: Adherence clubs or decentralized medicine delivery (Patients stable on
ART)

   ► On same ART treatment regimen for at least 12 months

   ► Most recent viral load taken in past 3 months

   ► Two consecutive viral loads undetectable (<400 copies/ml3)



                                                                                                      3
EVALUATION OF THE NATIONAL DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH'S NATIONAL ADHERENCE GUIDELINES FOR CHRONIC DISEASES IN
SOUTH AFRICA

Cohort 4: Enhanced adherence counseling (Patients on ART with poor adherence)

    ► On first-line ART for at least 3 months

    ► Poor adherence as indicated by an elevated viral load (>400 copies/ml3)


Cohort 5: Early patient tracing (Patients lost from ART programs)

    ► Initiated ART

    ► Failed to return for a scheduled appointment within 5 to 90 days from their scheduled
       appointment date


Cohort 6: TBHD cohort (Tuberculosis, hypertension, and diabetes patients)

    ► Screened for TB, hypertension or diabetes at last visit during enrollment period June-
       December 2016 or diagnosed with TB or hypertension between June-December 2016, or
       diabetes between January-December 2016.

    ► Does not have existing TB, hypertension (diagnosed before June 2016) or diabetes
       (diagnosed before January 2016)




        OVERVIEW OF STUDY SITES
The study is being conducted at 24 primary health care clinics (PHCs) in South Africa. In
consultation with the NDoH, the study team chose six clinics from one district each in Gauteng,
KwaZulu Natal, Limpopo, and North West Provinces giving a total of 24 sites. These provinces were
chosen because in most cases they are high HIV burden provinces with high burden districts and
high volume clinics.

Each site was required to meet the following criteria: 1) a high volume site as defined by having its
Total Remaining on ART (TROA) being above 1000 patients; 2) not already be a National Health
Insurance pilot site; 3) generating computerized TIER.net Phase 2 (all HIV patient data captured
electronically including back capture of historical data) essential for the evaluation outcomes; and
4) not participating in any other adherence-related studies or pilots. Sites were chosen so that they
could be matched with another site within a district roughly on TROA, proportion of patients virally
suppressed, setting (rural/urban/formal/informal) and location (sites near each other).

After choosing the 12 pairs of sites (24 total), NDoH, World Bank, Boston University and HE2RO
randomly allocated one site within each pair to be an intervention site and the other to be a control
site. Table 1 below describes the study populations at each facility using data from TIER.net and
DHIS on patients who were active in care (i.e. had visited the clinic within the last four months) and

As can be seen, by design the sites were very different in terms of geographic location, size and
number of eligible subjects within each of the intervention cohorts. For most cohorts, this did not
pose any major challenges. Over the time period described, for most cohorts and sites a sufficient
number of subjects became eligible to allow us to reach our site specific targets and certainly our
overall targets. At the same time, this table illustrates some of the challenges the team faced in
enrolling subjects into some of the cohorts: there were few new eligible subjects in the EAC cohort

                                                                                                                             5

over the entire enrollment period, particularly in uThungulu and parts of Mopani and Ekurhuleni.
This meant that we did not have sufficient numbers of subjects to enroll at several sites as will be
shown below and led to the decision not to reach the increased sample size agreed to (discussed
below in the section on sample size).




        ENROLLMENT
6.1 Methods for identifying eligible individuals
To enrol subjects into the study, the team identified patients who met the enrollment criteria for
each cohort (described below). The procedures were different depending on whether or not the site
was an intervention or control site. In control sites, because the intervention had not been
implemented, the team had to find subjects who met the counterfactual definition of a control (i.e.
they would have been eligible for the interventions had they gone to an intervention site). These
subjects could typically be identified by using TIER.net. At intervention sites, we only included
subjects who actually got the interventions. Identifying which patients got the interventions turned
out not to always be straightforward. In part, this was because sites didn’t always keep good
records on who got the interventions for some cohorts (the most striking example being those in
the EAC cohort). In other cases, it was because the interventions were not given to those who
should have been eligible. This was common with the tracing (TRIC) cohort as in many cases sites
chose to apply TRIC to all patients missing appointments, not just those who recently missed them
as called for the guidelines. In other cases, it was difficult to identify eligible subjects because sites
shifted priorities and moved patients from one intervention to another (e.g. from ACs to DMD) as a
result of implementation of the decanting/decongestion strategy. In cases where registers were not
sufficient to allow us to identify which patients got the interventions within a site we developed
alternative methods to identify the cohorts such as: reviewing DMD script sheets for DMD; checking
patient files for evidence of FTIC or EAC counselling and completed Patient Adherence Plans, or AC
visits; and collaborating with implementing partners to access their tracing registers where those
partners had taken over the responsibility for tracing.

An exception to how we enrolled subjects into the cohorts at control sites was for the DMD and the
AC cohorts. To create the counterfactual control group we needed to find patients who were eligible
for these interventions. Because the eligibility criteria for these two cohorts were identical, we
sought to prevent enrollment of the same subject into two cohorts at a control site. We note,
however, that there would not have been bias introduced if we had, we simply did this for logistical
reasons to increase the probability that we would get roughly balanced patient characteristics
predictive of the outcomes within each cohort. Therefore to enrol into these two cohorts, we
identified patients eligible for these two interventions at each control site and allocated them

randomly to one of the two cohorts. This was further complicated by the fact that the DMD analysis
was observational as described below.

For certain cohorts at specific sites we were unable to prospectively enrol the required number of
patients before closing enrollment on the 16 December 2016 (e.g. EAC and TRIC in Mopani, AC and
DMD in Ekurhuleni). For these cohorts we are continuing to review cohort registers and patient
files during follow up visits to double check that eligible patients were not missed during the
enrollment period. If these patients are identified they will be enrolled retrospectively and followed
as part of the cohort.

6.2 Specific Procedures for Intervention Sites
As noted, at intervention sites we sought to identify individuals who were both eligible for and
received specific interventions. We note that in some cases, sites did not give all patients eligible for
an intervention the intervention and in other cases they gave the interventions to subjects who
were not eligible. Accordingly, we required both eligibility for and receipt of the intervention as
enrollment criteria. To achieve this, we used one of three approaches described below. Our goal
was to spread out enrollment into each cohort over a period of months (June to December). We did
this to prevent overenrolling subjects into the cohorts during the early stages of the rollout when
sites were still learning how to deliver the interventions. This was not always successful as in some
cases site enrollment could be spaced over the enrollment period because rollout of the
interventions occurred early and quickly, while in others the interventions were not rolled out
early enough for us to enrol over many months.

We identified potentially eligible subjects by first downloading the most recent TIER.Net dispatches
from each facility and running STATA code to check for patients who should have received the
interventions as described in the AGL for each specific HIV cohort. Prior to each facility visit that the
team made, the Data Manager sent lists of eligible patients for each cohort to the Provincial Study
Coordinators. A password protected ‘Cohort Creation List’ was sent along with targets for visit
enrollment for each cohort. Then one of three approaches was used at each intervention site:

    1. List to Register Approach. In cases where intervention specific registers (e.g. FTIC
       register, AC register, etc.) were kept, our Cohort Creation Lists were compared against each
       one to identify which of the eligible patients had actually received the intervention.
       Provincial teams checked each patient on the cohort creation list until the target number of
       cohort patients to be enrolled was identified.
    2. List to File Approach. In cases where intervention registers were absent, did not contain
       enough information to verify a patient got the interventions, or were deemed to be of poor
       quality and therefore might miss patients who actually got the interventions, files of
       patients on the Cohort Creation Lists were identified and used to determine whether or not
       the patient had in fact received the intervention for which they were eligible. Evidence of
       receiving the intervention varied by cohort (e.g. record of specific AGL counselling sessions,
       presence of a patient adherence plan, etc.). This approach was used in later rounds of

                                                                                                        7

SOUTH AFRICA

         recruitment mainly to complete enrollment of FTIC and EAC cohorts and predominantly in
         Ekurhuleni.
     3. Direct from Register Approach. If patients on the Cohort Creation List could not be found
        using the List to Register Approach then rather than using the cohort creation lists to
        identify eligible patients, patients were identified directly from the intervention specific
        registers and their files found to confirm they were eligible according to the AGL criteria.
Regardless of the method used to identify patients, patient files were reviewed and information
extracted using an electronic case report form (CRF) to confirm patients did meet all eligibility
criteria for that cohort (including receipt of the intervention).

6.3 Control sites
For controls sites, the Data Manager created Cohort Creation Lists of eligible individuals as
described above using TIER.net data and sent each list to the Provincial Study Coordinators. Each
list was reviewed and the team pulled files for each patient until the cohort enrollment target was
achieved (i.e. all patients enrolled in control cohorts were found using the List to File Approach).
Files were then reviewed and information extracted using the electronic CRF to confirm eligibility.
We note that many control sites did implement some form of the interventions (e.g. adherence
counselling is routinely done at sites even if not enhanced, tracing is often done even if not targeted
at those recently missing visits). At control sites, patients were enrolled based on eligibility for the
interventions, while receipt of interventions at these control sites was disregarded for enrollment
purposes.

6.4 Cohort Specific Enrollment
Below we describe the approach to identifying eligible patients for each of the cohorts. For all
cohorts at both intervention and control sites we first produced Cohort Creation Lists from the
most recent TIER dispatch for each facility identifying patients who on the date of the site visit by
the data team:

    ► Were active in care (visit within last 124 days and no record that the patient was listed as
       “died”, “lost to follow up” or “transferred/moved out”)

    ► Were greater than 18 years of age

    ► Had their pregnancy status at last visit was not listed as “pregnant”

Cohort lists were refined using TIER.net to select patients who met the general inclusion criteria.
We then proceeded differently for intervention and control subjects and followed specific
procedures for each cohort as described below.

        Cohort 1: Fast Track Initiation Counselling (Patients newly eligible for ART)
   ► Control Subjects: Control subjects were identified and enrolled using the ‘List to File’
       approach. Patient files for eligible patients were found and screened using the electronic CRF
       to ensure FTIC eligibility criteria were met.

   ► Intervention Subjects: For intervention subjects, we first used a ‘List to Register’ approach
       then a ‘Direct from Register’ then the ‘List to File’ approach. In some facilities
       (predominantly in Ekurhuleni) FTIC registers were absent or inadequately completed, hence
       a ‘List to File’ approach was used. Eligible files were reviewed for evidence of FTIC
       counselling sessions recorded on clinical stationery and/or presence of a completed or
       partially completed AGL Patient Adherence Plan on the patient file.


All selected files were then screened using the electronic CRF to confirm all eligibility criteria that
could not be verified through TIER.net (i.e. resident in the facility catchment area, no intention to
transfer to another facility, no cryptococcal meningitis diagnosis at ART initiation). Once eligibility
had been confirmed an FTIC barcode was assigned and the patient enrolled.

        Cohort 2: Adherence Clubs (Patients stable on ART)
AC enrollment was complicated by the fact that DMD was rolled out at some of the control facilities
and because at some sites AC patients were shifted to DMD to meet DMD targets, necessitating
additional checks.

   ► Control Subjects: Control subjects were identified and enrolled using the ‘List to File’
       approach and patient files screened to ensure all AC eligibility criteria were met. Further
       checks were made to ensure selected patients were not currently receiving their medication
       through DMD if it was in use at a control site.

   ► Intervention Subjects: For intervention subjects, first a ‘List to Register’ approach was used to
       identify patients recorded on the facility AC register(s). If the sample size could not be
       achieved using this approach, the ‘Direct from Register’ approach was used to identify and
       find AC patient files. A ‘List to File’ approach was not used for this cohort.
Eligible patient files were screened using the electronic CRF to confirm patients’ eligibility
(including confirmation of enrollment in an AC for intervention sites), and ensuring that patients
had no record of picking up their medications separately from a DMD pick-up-point. All patients
who eligible for the AC cohort were assigned an AC barcode.

        Cohort 3: Decentralized Medicine delivery (Patients stable on ART)
As noted, DMD was not rolled out at all intervention sites and was rolled out at some control sites
(Table 2). Therefore, we had to tailor our approach to enrollment for this cohort. For DMD, cohort
lists were developed as described above for the AC cohort, although in the case of DMD we did not
have a way to confirm enrollment into DMD using TIER.net as no field captures this information.



                                                                                                          9
EVALUATION OF THE NATIONAL DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH'S NATIONAL ADHERENCE GUIDELINES FOR CHRONIC DISEASES IN
SOUTH AFRICA

     ► Control Subjects: Unlike the other HIV cohorts, because DMD was rolled out in some
         randomized control sites and not in all randomized intervention sites, control DMD subjects
         were enrolled from any site that was not implementing DMD during the enrollment period
         (June-December) regardless of whether or not the site was randomized to intervention or
         control. Control subjects were identified and enrolled using the ‘List to File’ approach. Given
         that we did enroll DMD control subjects at some intervention sites, we instituted further
         checks to ensure that selected cohort patients were not also enrolled in an AC. At control
         sites where DMD was implemented during the enrollment period, we checked the IDs of all
         patients enrolled in the AC cohort and replaced any patient in that cohort who received
         DMD.

     ► Intervention Subjects: For intervention subjects (as noted, enrolled at any site currently
         implementing DMD irrespective of randomization assignment), the ‘List to register’
         approach was used to identify patients recorded on DMD register(s) as having been
         decanted to a DMD (CCMDD/CDU) medicine pick up point. The relevant patient file numbers
         were recorded and those patient files found. If the targeted sample size of DMD patients
         could not be enrolled at a site, then the ‘Direct from register’ approach was used and patient
         files found. As with ACs, a ‘List to file’ approach was not used for this cohort at DMD
         intervention sites. At intervention sites that implemented DMD while we were enrolling, any
         patient in the AC cohort who was transferred to DMD was replaced in the AC cohort.
Patient files were found and then screened using the electronic CRF to confirm patients’ eligibility
including confirmation that the patient was not also enrolled in an AC. Assuming all criteria were
met the patient was enrolled and a DMD barcode assigned.

        Cohort 4: Enhanced Adherence Counseling (Patients on ART with poor
        adherence)
For EAC, cohort lists were first developed using TIER.net.

   ► Control Subjects: Control subjects were identified and enrolled using only the ‘List to file’
      approach.

   ► Intervention Subjects: For intervention subjects, first the facility EAC register(s) were used in
      a ‘List to register’ approach. If the targeted sample size for a site for the EAC cohort could not
      be enrolled, the ‘Direct from Register’ approach was used. In some intervention facilities
      where EAC registers were absent or inadequately completed (predominantly Ekurhuleni)
      the ‘List to File’ approach was used. Patient files were reviewed for evidence of EAC sessions
      and/or presence of a completed or updated AGL Patient Adherence Plan.
Once eligibility had been confirmed the patient was enrolled and an EAC barcode assigned.

        Cohort 5: Early patient tracing (TRIC)
For TRIC, cohort lists were again refined using TIER.

   ► Control Subjects: Control subjects were identified using just the ‘List to File’ approach.
      Eligible files were screened using the electronic CRF to ensure that patients had in fact
      missed an appointment by 5-90 days as indicated on TIER (occasionally a TIER backlog
      could result in patients being identified as having missed a visit when in fact they had not).

   ► Intervention Subjects: For intervention subjects, a ‘List to Register’ approach was used to
      identify patients from the TRIC registers who needed tracing or who had been traced. The
      relevant patient files were then found. If the targeted TRIC sample size for a site could not be
      enrolled, then the ‘Direct from Register’ approach was used to identify TRIC eligible patients
      and their patient files.
       In some facilities (e.g. some Mopani and uThungulu clinics), TRIC registers were not held by
       the facility but by implementing partners or Ward Based Outreach Teams (WBOT) teams
       and information was not sent back to the facility. This led to delays in enrolling this cohort at
       some intervention sites. When possible, visits were made to partner offices and meetings
       with WBOTs were organized in order to gain access to the registers and tracing information.
       This is similar to the ‘Direct from Register’ approach. The names and file numbers (if
       recorded) of patients recorded on these lists were noted and taken back to the facility by the
       team and these patient files found. The ‘List to File’ approach was not used at intervention
       sites for this cohort. Patient files were screened to confirm eligibility (including confirmation
       that they had missed a scheduled appointment by 5-90 days).

Once eligibility was confirmed a TRIC barcode was assigned.

         Cohort 6: Tuberculosis, Hypertension, and Diabetes Cohort (TBHD patients)
TBHD Screening Cohort (Cohort 6A)

At each facility visit the study team reviewed patient files from the previous or current day to
exclude patients < 18 years and pregnant women. All remaining patients are then eligible for the
TBHD Screening cohort (Group A). Baseline data for these patients is extracted from their files
using the electronic CRF. As we require 100 eligible subjects per site for Group A, we continued this
process until the targeted sample size was reached.

After the patient information was captured in the CRF, it is reviewed by the research team to
determine the status of each patient:

     ► Not screened or eligible for screening (i.e. not screened for tuberculosis, hypertension or
        diabetes; no evidence of TB, hypertension or diabetes/no known disease/screened negative;
        prevalent case of tuberculosis or hypertension (diagnosed more than 1 month ago),
        prevalent case of diabetes (diagnosed more than 6 months ago), MDR or XDR TB)

     ► Screened positive for tuberculosis (at last visit)

     ► Screened positive for hypertension (at last visit)

     ► Screened positive for diabetes (at last visit)

     ► Newly diagnosed with tuberculosis (in last month)

     ► Newly diagnosed with hypertension (in last month)

     ► Newly diagnosed with diabetes (in last 6 months)

At this point the Data Manager returned a list of file numbers of all patients who had screened
positive for tuberculosis, hypertension or diabetes to the Provincial Teams and these files were
found and marked with a barcode label to signify enrollment in the TBHD Screening cohort to be
followed up.

TBHD Diagnosed Cohort (Cohort 6B)

There were three ways in which patients are identified as eligible for and enrolled in the TBHD
Diagnosed cohort:

      1. Incident cases from the TBHD screening cohort. Patients from the TBHD screening cohort
         who are diagnosed with tuberculosis, hypertension or diabetes during the TBHD cohort
         enrollment period (June-December 2016) are eligible for inclusion in the TBHD diagnosed

        2016), or diabetes cases diagnosed after Jan 2016 that were identified during the creation
        of the TBHD Screening cohort (Cohort 6A) were also eligible. These were identified by the
        Data Manager from the baseline CRF data previously collected. A list of file numbers is then
        returned to the provincial teams so that patient files could be marked with a Cohort 6B
        (TBHD Diagnosed) barcode.
    3. Register identified cases. Tuberculosis patients (diagnosed after May 2016) were identified
       from the tuberculosis suspect register or the tuberculosis register, and hypertension
       (diagnosed after May 2016) and diabetes patients (diagnosed after Jan 2016) were
       identified from the PHC tick register. File numbers were noted and patient files pulled to
       verify the diagnosis is within the required time period. If eligibility was confirmed files
       were marked with the Cohort 6B (TBHD Diagnosed) barcode label.

6.5 Enrollment process/Identification of cohorts
While enrollment generally went smoothly after initiation of enrollment procedures began on June
20th, 2016 the team did identify some barriers to completing the process, and in some cases,
starting the enrollment process. This was often cohort specific, with sites having difficulty enrolling
into one or two of the cohorts, while the others were able to enrol without problem. Barriers for
each cohort, therefore required different solutions.

The initial barriers to enrollment fell into four general categories: 1) delays in implementation of
the interventions at the sites and delays in implementation per the NDOH’s Standard Operating
Procedures of the AGL; 2) changes in rollout of the intervention due to the pressure to “decant”
patients; 3) incomplete or not used registers for the interventions; and 4) delay in enrollment at
control sites due to delays in implementation of the interventions at intervention sites. These have
each been discussed in the previous enrollment report.

While these challenges were largely solved or the impacts mitigated, some new challenges arose to
completing full enrollment. In addition to the barriers reported in the first enrollment report, the
team encountered: 1) additional delays in rollout of the interventions; 2) an insufficient number of
patients provided with the interventions at some intervention sites; and 3) delays in
implementation of the interventions meant we could not continue to enroll subjects and still meet
our endpoints within the appropriate time frame. Below we discuss each barrier.

        Delays in Implementation or not implemented as per AGL
As with the previous report, we note that the main barrier to enrollment resulted from delays in the
implementation of the rollout of some of the interventions in the AGL or failure to implement
interventions as specified in the AGL. DMD and ACs were the most likely to be affected and this was
largely due to the implementation during the study period of a National Decanting Strategy which
sought to decongest clinics. The Decanting Strategy meant that many sites, whether control or
intervention, needed to quickly implement DMD, preventing us from achieving a “pure”
counterfactual. Because of this, we made the shift to analyse this cohort using methods for


                                                                                                     13

SOUTH AFRICA

observational research rather than randomized trials. Still, the shift also had the impact of slowing
recruitment because we could not be certain that subjects recruited into the AC cohorts were not
being decanted to DMD. The issue was most commonly seen in Gauteng and uThungulu.

Reluctance to implement interventions as specified in the AGL SOPs further hampered enrollment
as on occasion this meant that those enrolled in the interventions were not eligible or if they were
eligible had not been enrolled in sufficient numbers. This issue was most commonly seen in
uThungulu, particularly where ACs had previously existed prior to the AGL and had used slightly
different enrollment criteria (e.g. only one viral load required). Other examples included EAC in
Buchanana, uThungulu where staff in charge had seemingly been enrolling patients who were
virally supressed rather than unsuppressed; EAC in Grace Mugodeni in Mopani where clinicians
were reluctant to refer patients for EAC; and also TRIC at Grace Mugodeni where a decision had
been made to focus tracing on patients who had just missed a visit (i.e. by 1 day) rather than early
and late missed appointments. These issues were all escalated to managers and support partners
but unfortunately were not rectified quickly enough or are still ongoing.

        Incomplete, poorly completed or not used registers for the interventions
While in most cases, our data enhancement plans allowed us to work with sites to ensure improved
record keeping and data recording, not all sites had the capacity to use the registers for
documenting who got the interventions. This issue occurred most often in Mopani and Ekurhuleni
for the Early Adherence Counselling and TRIC interventions and was often the result of
implementing partners choosing to keep separate registers for interventions, which were not kept
at the sites, or a shortage of staff capacity and some resistance by staff to complete these registers.
Poor completion and use of registers and no record of intervention delivery in patient files was why
recruitment into the Early Adherence Counselling cohort fell well below target at Khumalo,
Tzaneen and Thokozani and the reason we were unable to achieve TRIC target numbers in Tzaneen.

        Insufficient numbers of patients enrolled onto the interventions
While the decanting strategy resulted in delays in enrollment, in other sites, some interventions
simply did not enrol a sufficient number of patients into the interventions or they enrolled patients
without using the AGL inclusion criteria, which meant some subjects who got the interventions
were not eligible for enrollment into the evaluation. The most common examples of this were for
DMD and EAC.

For example, while DMD numbers at Motsamai in Ekurhuleni were initially encouraging, the
number of patients enrolled and picking up their medications at the DMD pick-up-point began to
diminish quite quickly after implementation with clients preferring to pick their medications up at
the facility. The reluctance by clinicians to refer patients for Early Adherence Counselling at Grace
Mugodeni in Mopani resulted in too few patients being enrolled for this intervention.

Delays in Implementation Prevented Enrollment Due to the agreed Endpoint Timeframes

Not all sites that delayed rollout of the interventions (or slow rollout once they began the
interventions). However, as the evaluation’s timeline has already been shifted several times due to
delays in AGL implementation, and the long-term outcomes would take 12 months of cohort follow-
up, there was a limit to the timeframe of possible cohort enrollment. The intention was to close HIV
cohort enrollment in December 2016 to obtain the data on AGL effectiveness by December 2017.
Therefore, it was challenging in some sites to achieve the full sample size for each HIV cohort by
December 2016. The most common examples of this were for ACs in Ekurhuleni (Motsamai and
Khumalo) in Gauteng.

6.6 Strategies to Overcome Barriers
The team enacted three main strategies to achieve the targeted sample size in the face of the issues
described above. Each is described below.

        Increasing the duration of enrollment through 16 December 2016
We had initially hoped to complete enrollment by the end of November of 2016. In consultation
with the World Bank, we made the decision to extend the enrollment period and only close
enrollment on December 16th, 2016. This increased duration allowed us to meet or nearly meet the
increased sample size targets in 4 of the 5 cohorts with only Early Adherence Counselling not
approximately reaching the targeted sample size. Because not a sufficient number of subjects
received EAC and met the eligibility criteria (EAC was often provided to those who did not meet the
criteria according to the guidelines), we were not able to achieve our targeted sample size in the
required time and the strategies below were also not entirely sufficient to achieve the target.

        Overenrolling patients at some sites
While we had initially hoped for a perfectly balanced design in which all sites enrolled the same
number of subjects for each intervention, this was not possible at all sites. As we had to under
enroll at some sites, we increased enrollment at others where there were sufficient numbers of
patients to do so. This was easier to do in control sites than in intervention sites because control
site subjects were not required to have actually gotten the intervention, only to have been eligible
to do so. This meant more patients could be found who met the inclusion criteria. The most
common examples of this were in FTIC, ACs and Early Adherence Counselling although some over
enrollment occurred at specific sites for DMD and TRIC as well. The sites where over enrollment
occurred can be seen in Table 5 below.

        Shifting to including some retrospective enrollment
While we did need to close enrollment as of December 16th 2016 in order to reach the long-term
endpoints by end 2017, this did not prevent us from enrolling subjects from sites that we had
previously not enrolled all eligible subjects. This retrospective approach to enrollment meant that
the site teams were not looking for newly eligible subjects on their visits but rather were looking
for subjects who had been eligible but had not already been enrolled. This strategy was used


                                                                                                       15
EVALUATION OF THE NATIONAL DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH'S NATIONAL ADHERENCE GUIDELINES FOR CHRONIC DISEASES IN
SOUTH AFRICA

sparingly as it was not possible at many sites as either all eligible subjects were enrolled or because
we didn’t want to have a strongly unbalanced design in which we had a large sample size at one site
and few at another. The most common examples of this were in EAC, DMD and TRIC.




           SAMPLE SIZE
In our initial protocol, our total sample size for the study was estimated to be 2,880 subjects in the
five intervention cohorts and 4,800 in the TBHD cohort, for a total sample size of 6,680. However,
as we noted there was crossover between subjects in the AC and DMD cohorts, in consultation with
the co-Principal Investigators we decided to increase the sample size by 20% in each of the HIV
cohorts. While this sample size was likely not necessary for most of the cohort, it would give us
sufficient power to detect differences even if some subjects needed to be excluded from the final
analysis there was no reason not to. The table below shows the sample size that was estimated to
be required for each cohort initially and after we increased the target numbers. We determined
each sample size to be sufficient to measure the short term outcome for that cohort. For all the
cohorts except the TBHD cohort, calculations assumed a site-clustered design with the clinic as the
cluster and 24 clusters evenly randomized between intervention and comparison groups. They also
assumed a coefficient of variation of 0.1, 80% power; and an alpha of 0.05. In Table 3 below we
describe the remaining assumptions behind the sample size for each cohort.

8.2 Enrollment by cohort
The team has tracked enrollment into each cohort over time to ensure progress towards the sample
size targets and to ensure we did not exceed the total sample size allowed. Table 5 below shows the
results of that tracking, demonstrating accrual into each cohort at each site through December 16th,
2016. The table is also stratified by evaluation facility and district.

In the control arm alone, all five HIV cohorts reached the target sample size. In the intervention arm
alone, four HIV cohorts did not reach the full sample size: the DMD cohort attained 96% (231
enrolled/240 target), AC cohort 95% (275/288), EAC cohort 71% (360/504) and TRIC 94%
(272/288). Three of these four cohort met their initial sample size before it was increased by 20%
(DMD, AC, TRIC) with only EAC falling below the initial sample size.

Two factors were mainly responsible for the underachievement of the sample size for DMD: DMD
was implemented at only 10 clinics while the remaining 14 sites were control sites. In addition,
Motsamai (DMD intervention site) only had 8 patients for enrollment. Other DMD implementation
issues also posed enrollment challenges including: a) Accessibility of the DMD registers and the
ability to identify patients when they were picking up medicines through DMD; b) cases where
DMD was being implemented for hypertension/diabetes but not for patients with HIV; c) Incorrect
labelling of medicines and spelling of patient names; and d) Lack of documentation from CCMDD
providers to update TIER. The last was perhaps the biggest barrier as we saw very little
documentation of DMD in TIER.

The chief reason for not meeting the enrollment target in the EAC cohort was the low number of
patients who were eligible for enrollment in the following clinics: Khumalo (GP), Grace Mugodeni
(LP), Tzaneen (LP), Thokozani (KZN), and Buchanana (KZN). This occurred because of the following
EAC implementation challenges: a) Poor recording on registers and in patient files (difficulty
identifying those receiving the EAC intervention); b) Registers not being updated due to absence of
Lay Counsellor, or lost registers; and c) Confusion over which patients are eligible for EAC (virally
suppressed patients have been receiving EAC but were not meant to be enrolled in the evaluation
cohort). The evaluation team has also observed that EAC (as well as FTIC) registers are primarily
driven to completion through the request of the Evaluation Team and not for patient management
reasons.

Two clinics contributed to under-achievement of the targeted sample size in the TRIC cohort as
they had insufficient numbers of eligible patients: Grace Mugodeni and Tzaneen Clinic. The main
implementation challenges for TRIC at the intervention clinics were: a) lack of airtime or access to
phones within clinics; b) Difficulty linking information between facility, support partner, WBOTs,
and CHWs; c) Wrong targeting of TRIC (defaulters, unsuppressed, appointments missed 1 day ago
only); d) Absence of Lay Counsellor (delays tracing and completion of registers); and e) incomplete
registers.

The AC cohort achieved 95% of its targeted sample size in the intervention cohort. This was mainly
due to insufficient numbers of eligible patients for cohort enrollment at Khumalo Clinic. Other sites

                                                                                                            19

under-enrolled by one or two subjects, and this was only because on data cleaning some patients
enrolled were found to not have met the inclusion criteria and had to be excluded. Thus, overall this
cohort did not experience many issues, though as with the other cohorts, completion of registers
was an issue.

8.3 Enrollment over time
While we initially wanted each site to recruit the same number of subjects per cohort, due to
logistical constraints at some sites and, more commonly, due to delays in implementation of the
interventions at the sites, enrollment was not evenly distributed across time with some cohorts
enrolling faster than others. Figure 1a-g below demonstrate this for the six cohorts.

These figures show that the FTIC, ACs and DMD cohorts were the fastest to enrol, reaching targets
at some sites in about 16 weeks and at all sites within 24 weeks. While enrollment was largely
steady week on week in these cohorts, enrollment accelerated between week 8 and 9 for the
Adherence Clubs and DMD cohorts. This acceleration was largely due to enrollment at control sites
in pairs where enrollment of the cohort at the intervention site was delayed and resolution of some
register issues that had previously delayed enrollment. Each of these cohorts required screening
more subjects than we ultimately enrolled. Subjects who were not eligible are described below.

The EAC and TRIC cohorts took longer to enrol (up to 26 weeks) and by the end of enrollment on 16
December 2016 it had not been possible to enrol the full EAC cohort. The most prominent reasons
enrollment was slower or incomplete for these cohorts was related to: 1) interventions not being
implemented to AGL specifications (e.g. focussing EAC on defaulters rather than unsuppressed
patients, or only tracing pre-ART or patients who had defaulted rather than those who had early or
late missed appointments); and 2) incomplete or unavailable registers at intervention sites. We also
noted that for the TRIC cohort, a larger number of patients who were screened were found to be
ineligible compared to other cohorts. This was due in large part to the intervention not being
delivered as per the AGL specifications.

As anticipated, the Tuberculosis, Hypertension and Diabetes cohorts are taking the longest to
complete. We have currently identified all 2400 eligible patients for the TBHD Screening cohort and
are in the process of identifying those who screen positive who will be followed as part of this
cohort. By January 13, 2017, we had also identified 577 (24%) subjects as eligible for enrollment
into the TBHD Diagnosed cohort. However as described on page 13, we have not yet initiated cohort
enrollment via the third method for the TBHD diagnosed cohort but will be able to do this
retrospectively once it is initiated. We anticipate that enrollment of these two cohorts will be
completed by March 2017.

8.4 Enrollment by facility/district
In addition to variation in enrollment over time by cohort, we also encountered variation in
enrollment by site and province. While overall all five intervention cohorts have nearly completed
(with the possibility of some retrospective enrollment if feasible), Figure 2 shows that enrollment
was uneven with facilities in North West province enrolling fastest and Limpopo and KwaZulu Natal
taking somewhat longer. This was largely due to delays in being able to enrol for one or more
cohorts because of implementation or register issues.

Figure 3 below shows enrollment into each cohort within each district. Note that the large
difference between 6A and 6B cohort numbers in Mopani is due to only having screening
information for TB patients (for hypertension and diabetes cases, no records are created until
patients are diagnosed). Because the third route of detecting the diagnosed patients has not been
implemented yet, the number of diagnosed patients in Figure 3 only contains those Mopani patients
diagnosed TB positive who were identified from those screened. This will change as we implement
the third method of identifying diagnosed patients.

8.5 Ineligible Patients
As part of the enrollment process we have screened subjects for eligibility and identified subjects
who were ineligible upon file review. Below in Table 6 we describe the number of ineligible
subjects per cohort. We note that for all cohorts except DMD (where the intervention was delivered
in control sites) more subjects were screened in the intervention cohorts than the control cohorts.
This was expected as interventions subjects had additional eligibility criteria, namely getting the
intervention.

The most common reason for not being eligible in the intervention cohorts was a patient not
actually receiving the intervention for which they were eligible. This was most common with FTIC
where 89 patients (46% of all those excluded) were eligible for FTIC but did not receive it.

For all cohorts, between 4% (Early Adherence Counselling controls) and 15% (FTIC intervention)
of files were missing resulting in the need to exclude patients. Not being able to locate a patient file
was more common in intervention sites than control sites, but this is largely due to the fact that
more files needed to be screened in interventions sites due to the additional screening criteria. Very
few patients were found ineligible due to the other general eligibility criteria (e.g. <18 years old, not
resident, pregnant) suggesting that TIER.Net data was reasonable for screening patients for
eligibility.

Of note, in the TRIC cohort, the numbers screened were similar in the intervention and control
arms. This was because many patients were found ineligible in this cohort because TIER.net data
was not up to date given the time between the TIER.Net dispatch date and file screening, causing us
to think a patient had missed a visit on our initial screen when clinic files confirmed they had not.

While this was more common in control clinics, this was balanced out in the intervention cohort by
patients who did not receive the intervention.

Note: *Totals for individual variables may differ because some observations have been dropped due to missing or out-of-range
values. These are undergoing review to determine the correct value.

The FTIC cohort participants are mostly under age 40 (65%). As is typical of a public-sector HIV
treatment population, the cohort is more likely to be female (59%) though slightly less than the
66% we typically see (see Egger et al. Int Journal Epidemiol 2011; 41: 1256-1264 Table 2 for
example). The average CD4 count at ART initiation in this cohort is also barely above the initiation
threshold when the ART program started (<200) with an average of 224 cells/ml3 at ART initiation,
suggesting that our population is more immunocompromised than the general population of
patients eligible for ART. This is expected as FTIC is likely to be prioritized for sicker patients even
if not as per the SOP. Despite being a population that by definition was expected to be sicker than
the general population, by design we did not enrol any patients with tuberculosis in this cohort.

For FTIC, the intervention and control cohorts were largely balanced on baseline characteristics
with only minor differences between groups, much like what would be expected in a moderate
sized individually randomized trial. We did observe some small difference in the CD4 count
medians, with higher CD4 counts among those in the control group although only by 24 cells. This is
also not surprising as it is not possible to know who in the control group would have gotten the
intervention had the intervention been delivered there and likely sites prioritized the sickest. Still,
it is reassuring the differences are so small. In addition, we note that there were only 23 subjects
(3%) for whom we could not find a baseline CD4 count, far less than we typically see in
observational cohorts in South Africa (20% in the IeDEA cohort, Egger et al. 2011).

Note: * We note that the adherence club cohort is not limited to those who were treatment naïve, so some patients could have
been transfer-in patients without a baseline CD4 count. Others may have had a lost file and no record of the baseline CD4 count.
The NHLS data we have access to for this study only contains lab results from April 2016 onward, so we are not able to find
baseline CD4 counts for those in adherence clubs as we require them to be on ART for more than one year.

For the adherence clubs, a little over half of patients were under age 40 (58%) and just above 70%
were female. These patients were somewhat healthier at ART initiation than those in the FTIC
cohort at an average of 268 cells, but with a fairly wide range (157-379). We had nearly complete
viral load data in this cohort as this was necessary to confirm eligibility for the interventions.
Baseline CD4 count was missing from 66 subjects (12%) closer to but still below what we observe
in the literature for observational HIV cohorts (again see Egger et al. Int Journal Epidemiol 2011; 41:
1256-1264 Table 2 for example). As noted, these cannot be updated using the NHLS data because
we only have data from April 2016 onwards and these patients are not new on ART.

The intervention and control cohorts were similar with respect to the demographic variables (age
and sex) and with respect to log viral load at time of eligibility, which is by design (patients must be
supressed to be eligible for the intervention). We did however observe a difference between the
cohorts in terms of CD4 count at treatment initiation with the control cohort being somewhat
healthier at ART initiation (282 vs. 255). As with FTIC, the differences were small and unlikely to
impact the results. We also saw differences between groups in the duration on treatment at
enrollment with the control population on treatment for a shorter period of time than the
intervention population. This suggests that the intervention sites were either targeting the ACs
towards patients who were on treatment for a longer time than eligibility criteria required or that
patients who were on treatment for longer were more interested in this intervention.

The DMD cohort also had roughly half of the patients below age 40 (54%) and had many more
females (71%) than males. As we would expect given the interventions had the same eligibility
criteria, the cohort was similar to the Adherence Clubs cohort with respect to ART initiation CD4
count (269 cells), though we note that this is not the CD4 count at the time of enrollment into the
cohort. As with Adherence Clubs, we were missing a baseline CD4 count on 64 (11%) of subjects,
typical of but lower than, most HIV programs in South Africa. The median viral load at baseline was
also very low as would be expected given the eligibility criteria for the intervention (i.e. stable
patients).

The intervention and control cohorts were well balanced with respect to sex and age but there were
some small imbalances in CD4 count at ART initiation (279 vs. 259) and log viral load at eligibility
(1.62 vs 2.09). These don’t appear too large, but it is something we will pay attention to when we
conduct the analysis. Interestingly, here the time on treatment was very similar between groups,
suggesting that unlike Adherence Clubs, DMD was not being targeted towards those on treatment
longer or shorter than the eligibility criteria would require. The median time on ART for both
groups was also much more similar to the intervention group in the Adherence Club cohorts,
suggesting overall that patients who got one of the two interventions were on treatment a fair bit
longer than required (a minimum of one year), likely as clinics processed a backlog of eligible
patients as part of the Decanting Strategy. In addition, due to the Decanting Strategy some of our
DMD control sites were evaluation intervention sites, and as such we would exclude any patient
from our DMD group who had been enrolled in an Adherence Club. This likely would have excluded
those who had been on ART for shorter periods of time.

Note: * Time between last viral load and enrollment. It is likely patients are only enrolled in EAC at their next visit after
becoming eligible through an elevated viral load unless there is a specific intervention at the site to follow up patients with high
viral loads (if the patient is only returning every other month to pick up medication then these times seem reasonable, as the EAC
SOP says “an EAC identified file should trigger referral for EAC as soon as the patient comes back to the facility”). It is p ossible
that an EAC patient may be contacted in between telling them they need EAC but this is not recorded; ** We note that 3 viral
loads were not found. As this is an inclusion criteria, we will need to verify if these can be found and if not, they will not be
included in the final dataset; *** We note that the enhanced adherence counselling cohort is not limited to those who were
treatment naïve, so some patients could have been transfer-in patients without a baseline CD4 count. Others may have had a lost
file and no record of the baseline CD4 count. The NHLS data we have access to for this study only contains lab results from April
2016 onward, so we are not able to find baseline CD4 counts for those in adherence clubs as we require them to be on ART for
more than one year.

The EAC cohort was very evenly divided between those below and above 40 (50%) but slightly
fewer females (60%) than we typically see in ART cohorts, possibly suggesting that males may be
more likely to have elevated viral loads in these cohorts than in the general population. The cohort
was quite sick at ART initiation with an average CD4 count below 200 cells/ml3 (157 cells/ml3). The
cohort was eligible for the intervention for a median of 55 days at enrollment, suggesting a little
over a one month delay between eligibility and enrollment. We believe most patients who get EAC
only get it after returning to the clinic from a previous visit where a blood draw for viral load
monitoring found them to have met the eligibility criteria. As with the previous two interventions
we had near complete data on viral load at enrollment as this was necessary to determine
eligibility. We were missing CD4 counts at ART initiation for 107 (12.4%) still below the 20% we
typically observe in our observational cohorts.

The intervention and control cohorts were well balanced with respect to age and sex and
tuberculosis enrollment. There were small differences in CD4 count (163 vs 146 cells/ml3). Log
viral load was also somewhat different and lower in the control cohort (log10 3.55 vs. 4.06). This
suggests that despite the eligibility criteria, EAC was being targeted towards those with the highest
viral loads while those with lower, but still eligible viral loads are not being given the same priority.

Note: * Most patients are only enrolled at their next visit between last missed visit and enrollment (visit can be missed by up to
90 days). The patients need to be eligible for tracing from May through October. Therefore if someone missed a scheduled visit in
February, they would be eligible for tracing through May, and only enrolled in October, resulting in 243 days between missed
visit and enrollment.

The TRIC cohort was also roughly divided between those below (58%) and above 40 (42%) and
very close to what we expect for percent females at 65% suggesting those that receive TRIC are
similar to the general clinic populations. As with previous cohorts the patients were quite sick at
ART initiation with an average CD4 count of 211 cells/ml3, though higher than the EAC cohort. In
this cohort 60 (10.4%) patients had a missing CD4 count at ART initiation, lower than what we
typically observe in our HIV cohorts. We note here that there was a substantial amount of missing
viral load data, but this is explained by the fact that this cohort is not required to have a viral load to
be eligible, and many patients in this cohort have left care and are therefore expected to not have
had a viral load. In addition, patients may also have not reached the point of needing a viral load
(e.g. if they missed an appointment between initiation and 6 months). Overall the last viral load was
low in this cohort, suggesting that many of the patients lost and being traced (or eligible to be
traced) had not been experiencing an elevated viral load just prior to missing a visit. The cohort was
eligible for the intervention for an average of 45 days at enrollment (days between last missed visit
and enrollment to the cohort, not time between missed visit and tracing attempt).

The intervention and control cohorts were very well balanced with respect to CD4 at ART initiation
and log of last viral load. However they did show some differences, with younger patients in the
intervention cohort and the intervention cohort being eligible for the intervention substantially
longer than the control cohort (32 vs. 85 days). This likely reflects the fact that we did retrospective
enrollment into the cohorts rather than reflecting any meaningful differences.

Overall, the TBHD cohort was older than the previous cohorts (only 41% under age 39) but their
sex distribution looked exactly like an ART cohort, suggesting that ART cohorts are much like the
general population of patients seeking care at a PHC. TB screening was common in this cohort (with
45% receiving TB screening at last visit) with only 10% getting hypertension screening and only
2% receiving diabetes screening. This differed strongly by HIV status, however, as would be
expected. Those with HIV were much more likely to get TB screening at last visit than those who did
not have HIV (78% vs 21%). Overall, those with HIV were much less likely not to receive any
screening (18% with HIV vs 69% without did not receive any screening, though again this was

largely driven by TB screening). Still even among hypertension there was some suggestion that
screening was better among those with HIV (13%) compared to those without (8%), though the
numbers were small overall. The opposite was true for diabetes however, with the HIV cohort
receiving almost no screening (4% vs 1%).

Among all patients, 79% had no diagnosed condition at last visit, though this included the 48% of
patients who received no screening. Diagnosis of all conditions was rare, with 1% diagnosed with
TB, 2% diagnosed with diabetes and 7% diagnosed with hypertension. The HIV negative cohort was
less likely to have no condition diagnosed than the HIV positive cohort (83% vs 95%). This might
seem counterintuitive, but likely reflects the fact that more patients in the HIV cohort would
already have been diagnosed with a condition. The most common condition diagnosed among the
HIV negatives was hypertension (9%).

The diagnosed cohort is still in recruitment, so it is difficult to interpret the data. However, of the
577 subjects enrolled, very few were young with only 21% being under 40 years of age. This would
be consistent with the age distribution of these comorbid conditions. In addition, more males have
been diagnosed than females, again consistent with what we know about tuberculosis rates.

          FOLLOW UP PROCESSES
With the HIV cohorts now nearing completion of enrollment (with only possible retrospective
enrollment remaining), we will continue to follow up patients through passive record review while
continuing to work with the sites to maintain quality data and to monitor data systems for study
outcomes. The short term and long-term outcomes are described in Table 8 below.

We will continue to monitor TIER.net and work with the sites to collect follow up data for patients
enrolled in the study. The Gantt chart below in Figure 4 show the timeline for follow up and
completion of data collection for protocol 1.

10.1 Data collection for short-term endpoint for Fast Track
     Initiation Counselling
The short-term outcome for FTIC requires a 30-day follow up for each patient to assess the
percentage who initiate ART. FTIC follow up occurs through TIER.net through identification of the
initiation visit with verification through patient registers if needed. FTIC follow up has been
completed for 81% of patients who have currently been enrolled. All subjects are expected to reach
a short-term outcome by February 2017. At that point we will need to verify data against patient
files for any subjects with missing data in TIER (e.g. should a backlog occur) with an expected date
of having all short-term outcomes by March 2017. Below are outcomes for the patients who have
reached a primary short term outcome for FTIC. Currently 84% of patients in intervention sites and
81% of patients in control sites initiated ART within 30 days of eligibility.

       CONCLUSIONS
Enrollment into the HIV cohorts has now completed with enrollment into the TBHD cohort
expecting completion in March 2017. While there have been challenges to getting the
cohort enrolled, including delays in implementation of the interventions and changes to the
way the interventions have been implemented, the team has been able to enrol subjects
into the cohorts. These challenges have been overcome through a combination of support
from the World Bank and NDoH PIs to working with the sites to ensure accurate record
keeping and access to registers. The cohorts are now entering the follow up phase for the
HIV cohorts and work will shift to a mix of maintaining control over the quality of the
cohort data, completing enrollment into the TBHD cohorts and to continue with protocol 2
where we will collect largely qualitative data from patients and providers to better
understand how the rollout is occurring and the impacts that it is having.
