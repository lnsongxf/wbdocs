Sampling
Sampling Procedure
The Kenya sample design is a stratified 3 stage sample design. The sample was stratified by 4 geographic areas: 1-Nairobi,
2-Other Large Cities (over 100,000 households), 3- Medium cities (60,000 to 100,000 HHs), and 4-Other Urban Areas. For
detailed description of the sample design and sampling methodologies, refer to Part 3 of the National Survey Design
Planning Report (NSDPR) as well as the STEP Survey Weighting Procedures Summary. Both documents are provided as
external resources.



Deviations from Sample Design
War marred and unstable regions of Kenya were excluded from the survey. Itinerants (as classified in the Population Census
2009 in Kenya) were also excluded.



Response Rate
An overall response rate of 91.8% was achieved in the Kenya STEP Survey. Table 21 of the STEP Survey Weighting
Procedures Summary provides the detailed percentage distribution by final status code.



Weighting
The weighting was carried out by the STEP Survey Methodologist. The weighting process is outlined in section 3.7 of the
STEP NSDPR for Kenya as well as the STEP Survey Weighting Procedures Summary. Both documents are provided as
external resources.

Questionnaires
Overview
The STEP survey instruments include:
(i) A Background Questionnaire developed by the WB STEP team.
(ii) A Reading Literacy Assessment developed by Educational Testing Services (ETS).

All countries adapted and translated both instruments following the STEP Technical Standards: 2 independent translators
adapted and translated the Background Questionnaire and Reading Literacy Assessment, while reconciliation was carried out
by a third translator.
- The survey instruments were both piloted as part of the survey pretest.

DATA COLLECTION NOTES

In Kenya, each component of the STEP Survey was carried out by a personal visit using a Paper And Pencil Interview (PAPI)
method.

The STEP program requires all surveys to be implemented in a standardized way:
(i) Each participating country (survey firm) wrote up a National Survey Design Planning Report (NSDPR) detailing how it
intended to implement the STEP survey while complying with the STEP Technical Standards. The NSDPRs were submitted to
the WB STEP team for approval.

(ii) The WB STEP team and Educational Testing Services (ETS) provided 2 workshops to all survey firms. The first was a 2-day
workshop provided via video conference and aimed at presenting the STEP Technical Standards. The second workshop was
organized over 2 full weeks at the WB's Headquarters and consisted in a training course to project managers from each
survey firm on the survey instruments - Background Questionnaire and Reading Literacy Assessment - as well as on
implementation and data management procedures.

(iii) Based on the STEP Technical Standards, the survey firms adapted and translated the STEP survey instruments, the
Interviewer Manual, and all training materials.

(iv) Once the instruments had been adapted and translated, survey firms carried out a pre-test, usually including 20-30
interviews. Findings from the pre-test were discussed with the WB STEP team and ETS to finalize the adaptation and
translation of the STEP survey instruments.

(v) Each survey firm provided a 2-week training course to its enumerators, using training materials developed by the WB
STEP team (after translation and adaptation). The WB STEP team's Survey Consultant helped organize the training and was
present in the country for the first few days at least of the training. In addition, the WB STEP team in Washington DC
provided just-in-time technical assistance, answering questions sent by the survey firm during the training. The training
included in-field mock interviews in addition to in-class courses. At the end of the training, survey firms only retained
enumerators having demonstrated a good understanding of the instruments.

(vi) As per STEP Technical Standards, data collection started within a few days of the end of the enumerators' training
course.The composition of each country's fieldwork teams is described in the NSDPR, as well as reporting procedures and
quality control processes.Weekly reports were sent to the WB STEP team, which provided just-in-time technical assistance
during fieldwork to answer questions or concerns. Regular calls or VCs were also held between survey firms and the WB
STEP team to discuss progress. Matters discussed usually involved questions on how to deal with specific situations,
strategies to reduce non-response, the activation of reserve households, and general pace of progress. Non-response rates
were high in Bolivia and Colombia, in part due to difficult access to appartment buildings and gated communities, although
survey firms worked hard to gain local community leaders' support. In a few instances - all documented in the weighting
documentation - a couple of EAs were replaced due to security concerns or because an EA had been completely altered (e.g.
construction site, dwellings converted into a large shopping center).

(vii) Interviews lasted between 120 and 150 minutes, depending on respondents' reading proficiency.

Detailed information on the survey processes is provided in the National Survey Design Planning Report (NSDPR) provided as
an external resource. The document describes the project management structure, fieldwork teams and reporting processes.

Data Processing
Data Editing
EEC Canada Inc. was responsible for data entry and processing.

The STEP Data management process is as follows:

1. Raw data is sent by the survey firm
2. The WB STEP team runs data checks on the Background Questionnaire data.
- ETS runs data checks on the Reading Literacy Assessment data.
- Comments and questions are sent back to the survey firm.
3. The survey firm reviews comments and questions. When a data entry error is identified, the survey firm corrects the data.
4. The WB STEP team and ETS check the data files are clean. This might require additional iterations with the survey firm.
5. Once the data has been checked and cleaned, the WB STEP team computes the weights. Weights are computed by the
STEP team to ensure consistency across sampling methodologies.
6. ETS scales the Reading Literacy Assessment data.
7. The WB STEP team merges the Background Questionnaire data with the Reading Literacy Assessment data and computes
derived variables.

STEP Guidelines for Data Processing

Title                    STEP Guidelines for Data Processing
Author(s)                The World Bank
Date                     2012-12-11
Language                 English
Publisher(s)             The World Bank
                         The present document provides guidelines for processing data collected through the STEP Household
                         Questionnaire.
                         It is specifically intended for Project Managers and all Data Entry Staff, regardless of the Data Entry
                         Program (DEP) they are using, and details:
                         (i) the data entry process and timing;
                         (ii) the structure data files must comply with before being submitted to the World Bank STEP Core Team;
                         (iii) data checks all Survey Firms are expected to carry out during fieldwork and data cleaning.
Description
                         The guidelines are organized in three points:
                         (i) Standards, which describe particular norms the Survey Firm is expected to comply with;
                         (ii) Information to provide During Fieldwork;
                         (iii) Information to provide in the Final Implementation Report.

                         Survey Firms are asked to provide either the full list or the frequency of particular inconsistencies:
                         - A full list of inconsistencies is required in cases that are unlikely to occur;
                         - Whereas only frequencies are required in cases that are more likely to present errors.
