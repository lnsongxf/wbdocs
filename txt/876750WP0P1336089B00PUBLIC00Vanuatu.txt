INTRODUCTION


The objective of the Socio-Economic Atlas (SEA) for Vanuatu is to present key indicators of the socio-
economic status of Vanuatu population, at the areas council level. The Atlas should be of interest to
various policy makers and development practitioners concerned about various spheres of socio-
economic development in Vanuatu. It allows for comparisons of various development indicators
across various geographical areas. It is a useful baseline for comparisons over time, when the
indicators presented in the Atlas get updated.

The Atlas has been developed by the Vanuatu National Statistical Office (VNSO) with support from
the World Bank, and with funding provided by the Australian Aid Program. The Atlas has been
developed through a consultative process with various Government agencies and development
organizations.

The Atlas provides representative socio-economic indicators at the level of area council (district),
which is the smallest administrative division unit in Vanuatu. Most of the indicators presented in the
Atlas have been derived from the Vanuatu 2009 Census data, which is rich in terms of the
development indicators captured. On the other hand, the content of the Census questionnaire
defines the boundaries of what indicators can be presented. We have also used small area
estimation techniques to derive estimates of consumption-based poverty and inequality, by
combining the use of the 2009 Census data with the 2010 Household Income and Expenditure
Survey (HIES) data. A separate technical paper has been prepared that describes the methodology
used in doing this and is available from the VNSO and the World Bank.

The Atlas includes five key groups of socio-economic indicators for population. Section A covers the
indicators of household wellbeing in terms of consumption-based poverty rates and inequality
indices. Section B looks at the sources of livelihoods for households in terms of livestock numbers
and share of households engaged in various economic activities. Section C focuses on the
households’ living conditions by looking at the quality of dwelling, access to water and access to
electricity. Section D explores education outcomes and shows percent of adult population with
various levels of schooling. Section E looks at some indicators related to health status, such as
percent of adults who smoke and consume alcohol. In addition, Section F looks at the distribution of
education and health facilities, and roads and tracks in the national road network.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Socio-Economic Atlas (SEA) for Vanuatu includes five key groups of socio-economic indicators
for population. Section A covers the indicators of household wellbeing in terms of consumption-
based poverty rates and inequality indices. Section B looks at the sources of livelihoods for
households in terms of livestock numbers and share of households engaged in various economic
activities. Section C focuses on the households’ living conditions by looking at the quality of dwelling,
access to water and access to electricity. Section D explores education outcomes and shows percent
of adult population with various levels of schooling. Section E looks at some indicators related to
health status, such as percent of adults who smoke and consume alcohol. Section F looks at the
distribution of education and health facilities and availability of the road and track network.

It is important to note that all indicators presented in the Vanuatu SEA are at the level of Area
Council (AC), the lowest level of administrative division in Vanuatu. The maps show the name of
the AC, and not the island. Where an AC covers more than one island the name is repeated; for
example in the Torres AC in Torba, “Torres” appears three times on the map for the islands of Hui,
Tegua and Toga. Most of these indicators have been derived directly from the Vanuatu 2009 Census
data. The consumption-based poverty and inequality indicators have been obtained using the small-
area estimation techniques developed by the World Bank. These estimates are based on the use of
the 2009 Census and 2010 HIES data.

Some of the key findings that emerge from these maps are highlighted below:

Section A: Household Wellbeing

       The levels of the consumption-based poverty (% of population below the total poverty line)
        in Vanuatu could be considered as rather low, with a national average rate of 12.3%.
        However, there seem to be certain areas where the poverty rates are substantially higher
        than national average. These are mostly areas around North Malekula, Maewo, Pentecost
        and Tanna. Poverty rates are lowest in prime agricultural areas of Santo and parts of Ambae
        and Ambrym.
       It is worth noting that in some ACs where there is a high poverty incidence, the number of
        poor is low. In Mota for example, the household poverty incidence is 33.4% but only 0.8% of
        Vanuatu’s total poor live there. Similarly, areas such as Port Vila have high poverty incidence
        and a high proportion of the nation’s poor. This has important implications for policy makers
        in targeting pro-poor policies.
       The level of consumption inequality in Vanuatu also seems to be rather low. The ratio of the
        average consumption of the top 10% of population in terms of the per capita (per adult
        equivalent) distribution relative to that of the bottom 10% is 4.7, while this ratio can reach
        the level of 10 in many other countries, including in the East Asia Pacific region (e.g., Papua
        New Guinea). The lower this ratio is the lower inequality is. Similarly, the Gini coefficient is
        found to be 0.351 (where 0 would represent perfect equality and 1 perfect inequality).
        However, the Gini coefficients are highest (>0.38) in Efate, indicating higher levels of
        inequality there.
        There are significant differences across Vanuatu in the possession of durable goods by the
        households. As would be expected, lower levels of possession are generally observed in
        more remote areas, and areas with less access to electricity. It is important to keep in mind
        though that possession of a few durable goods is not necessarily a sign of food insecurity or
        poverty. In fact, the analysis suggests that many of those areas with a low asset index at the

                                                                                                      11
        same time have quite a high livestock index. Most areas of Santo are examples of this type
        of situation.

Section B: Sources of livelihoods

       Traditionally in Vanuatu, livestock (especially pigs and, to a lesser extent, cattle and poultry)
        are not only kept for food, but as a store of wealth or for ceremonial purposes and special
        events. For this reason high rates of ownership may be a less reliable indicator of the
        absence of poverty. For instance, in Tanna pigs and poultry are common household assets,
        but poverty rates are relatively high. On the other hand, cattle ownership seems to be
        related to higher levels of wellbeing. In East Santo, where the poverty rate is 2.4%, the
        average household owns around 12.3 cows, compared to the national average of 2.2. Most
        households in Port Vila do not have any livestock at all, while some households in rural areas
        have more than 10 cattle per household. On some small islands, around 90% of households
        keep livestock and with the exception of Efate, growing cash crops is almost a universal
        pursuit for ni Vanuatu. About 40% of households raise pigs, and 64% have poultry, though
        these figures are weighed down by the lower rates in Port Vila.
       There is also a substantial reliance on growing cash crops (45.3% of households) and fishing
        (31% of households do fishing for subsistence). In certain areas, up to 80% of households
        report being involved in fishing for subsistence living only. Moreover, across the nation, 45%
        of households report being involved in food production for own consumption. This number
        goes as high as 90% in many ACs, including the majority those within Penama province,
        northwest and west Santo in Sanma, and Ureparapara and Mota in Torba.
       The small extent of the formal economy is apparent from the low rates of wage and salary
        dependent households in many parts of the country. In 35 of the 66 ACs, less than 10% of
        households report wages or salaries as their main source of income. Even close to the
        capital in, say, North Efate, less than 30% of households rely on wages and salaries while
        more than 52% rely on the sale of fish, crops or handicrafts for cash income. Where formal
        employment is highest, it tends to be around provincial capitals.
       The results highlighted above exemplify the traditional way of life and reliance on
        subsistence living in Vanuatu.

Section C: Household Living (Dwelling) Conditions

       Living conditions vary considerably across Vanuatu, based in part on access to infrastructure
        and utilities. Those living outside urban areas and towns tend to go without electricity and
        often lack piped water and sewage systems. On most islands, almost all households mainly
        rely on wood or coconut shell for cooking – even in Port Vila almost half of households still
        cook using these sources. In the more urbanized parts of the country, houses have concrete
        or wood floors. Many households in Vanuatu live in basic conditions. For instance, even
        though traditional materials appear to be widely used for housing across the country, only
        17% of households report living in dwellings with walls made of makeshift or improvised
        materials.
       A generally low access to electricity in Vanuatu is an area of concern. At the national level,
        only 38% of households report having electricity (from main grid, solar, or own generator) as
        a main source of lighting. Outside of the key urban areas (Port Vila and Luganville), less than
        20% of households have access to the main grid, and even that number may be driven by
        those households that live close to provincial centers. In fact, in most ACs, less than 2% of
        the population has access to the main grid. Solar power has become an important source of
                                                                                                      12
       electricity, especially in more remote locations. In some ACs, up to 50% of households report
       reliance on solar power as the main source of lighting. The national average for this source is
       6.3% (as of 2009). Only about 2% of the population relies on small petrol generators, which
       could be a reflection of high costs of fuel. However, in parts of Efate the share of households
       using generator power reaches 20% (Malorua).
      A significant share of population in more remote areas is using water from the unprotected
       source (such as river/lake/spring) as the main source of drinking water. While the national
       average of this statistic is 12% (coincidentally, very close to the poverty rate), in some area
       councils, such as on Erromango or Tanna, where natural springs are common, this indicator
       is as high as 70%.
      There is high reliance on using traditional fuels – coconut shell and firewood – as the main
       means of cooking across the country (85.2%). Coconut usage is notably high even in Efate,
       with over 95 percent in Eton relying on coconut fuelled fire. The lowest, yet still large, rate of
       coconut usage in Efate and Vanuatu as a whole is found to be 47.5% in Port Vila.
      Outside the urban centers and provincial hubs people rely on pit toilets or have no toilet at
       all. Whereas in Port Vila and across northern Efate flush toilets are more prevalent Pit
       latrines, shared and private, are used widely (48% of the population) as a primary type of
       toilet. Their use is particularly prevalent in Penama where between 83% and 100% of those
       living in Pentecost, Maewo, and Ambae use pit latrines. The lowest rates of pit latrine use
       (4.7%-19.1%) are found in Efate (Port Vila, Malorua, and North Efate) and a few other areas
       councils (Motalava, Tongariki, North Tongoa).

Section D: Education

      Indicators of educational attainment also vary considerably across the country. The islands
       of Torba province, along with Tanna and the western side of Santo report high proportions
       of adults without any schooling – sometimes more than 50%. Interestingly, the gender
       disaggregated maps for this indicator do not show large differences between men and
       women - the inequity here appears to be geographic, rather than gender based. There may
       also be an inherent bias in these results as the more educated people move to the urban
       centres. As would be expected, parts of Efate show higher rates of education than the
       national average. But so too do a number of remote areas (such as North Erromango,
       Vermali or East Santo) where, interestingly, their neighboring councils have relatively low
       rates. Distances from village to school may be a factor in these differences.
      Given the generally low rates of education, self-reported literacy rates seem high. 82% of the
       population (age 15+) reports ability to read/write in Bislama, 67% in English, and 37.1% in
       French. In contrast, literacy rates in parts of Tanna, Pentecost, Santo and Malekula are
       sometimes below 40%. These results contrast with recent research conducted in Shefa
       Province which showed that, despite 85% of respondents self-declaring they were literate,
       only 27.6% we actually classified as literate (VEPAC, 2011). In terms of a gender dimension,
       the differences in literacy rates between men and women are very small. For instance, the
       English literacy rates are 69% and 65% for men and women, respectively.
      A key issue in Vanuatu seems to be the very low percent of people that continue on to
       secondary and tertiary education. Indeed, only 7% of adults (age 15+) nationwide report to
       have completed secondary education (with 7.7% and 6.6% for men and women,
       respectively). Distance plays a significant part, as does the limited number of secondary
       school places. Attending secondary school often means going to a boarding school (as many
       areas do not have secondary schools nearby). The maps show that remoteness may play
                                                                                                      13
        part secondary attainment. Some parts of the country (for example North West Santo) that
        show relatively good level of primary education reporting close to zero rates of secondary
        education. On the other hand, some small communities, report some of the highest rates of
        secondary and tertiary education, such as Futuna with 6.2% and 10.3% respectively. In urban
        areas attainment is much higher – though still only 17% in Port Vila.
       The cost of upper secondary education is also likely to be a barrier to school completion. The
        secondary school fees are reported to be in the range of VT 20,000-40,000 per child per
        term (equivalent of USD 200-400), which, considering three terms per school year, and the
        number of children in a typical household, could represent a substantial cost barrier. If the
        student is boarding, there are additional costs on top of this. Transport and other costs
        associated with relocation can also be substantial.
       In terms of tertiary education, it is also a rare commodity in Vanuatu. Only 6.6% of adults
        report having a tertiary education (with 7.8% and 5.5% for men and women, respectively).
        This is mostly explained by the fact that, except for the local rural training centers, there are
        few tertiary education providers in Vanuatu. It is also worth noting that as people progress
        through school, they often move to more urban areas for secondary and tertiary education.
        Consequently, the attainment rates for the remote locations will likely fall, and in more
        populated areas they will likely rise.

Section E: Health

       The census contains a limited number of health-related indicators. The share of people
        reporting some functional limitation is 12% nationwide, though this rises to around 30% in
        some parts of the country, such as Ambrym, Erromango, Epi or Efate. Given the nature of
        the census question for this indicator it is difficult to ascertain precisely the difficulties
        people face, but further investigation following the completion of the DHS in 2014 would be
        warranted.
       25% of adults (age 15+) report smoking, with very significant difference between men (45%)
        and women (4%). Across the country smoking among men seems most prevalent in Torba
        province and on Santo and Pentecost, and it is common for people in rural areas to grow
        their own tobacco. The consumption of alcohol is reported by about 10% of adults – 17% for
        men and 3% for women. It appears that the share of people consuming alcohol is higher in
        urban areas. Drinking kava, a tradition deeply ingrained in the Melanesian society, is
        reported by 30% of the adult population – 53% for men and 8% for women. In fact, it
        appears that in most parts of Vanuatu, kava is a substitute for alcohol or vice versa. Though
        for both, consumption is generally a male dominated activity.
       The data on epidemics/diseases is not available at the AC level. Some efforts are currently
        under way by the Department of Health and WHO to collect data from individual health
        facilities, and to aggregate it, but this is still work in progress. The malaria rates in Vanuatu
        are generally low as a result of intensive efforts for malaria control and progressive
        strategies for elimination. Data on malaria cases is collected at the health zone level (about
        46 of those), but the health zone boundaries do not necessarily overlap with AC boundaries,
        so the compilation of these statistics at the AC level is not possible.

Section F: Location of education and health facilities, and roads

       The education and health facilities, mapped in Section F are disaggregated to the level that
        existing data can provide. For example, health facilities include hospitals, health centers,
        dispensaries and for some provinces - provincial and national offices. Education facilities
                                                                                                      14
include both government and non-government run schools, disaggregated by the level of
education. All types of roads, from walking tracks to major roads, are illustrated as the same.

    ANNEX 3: METHODOLOGY FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE ASSET AND LIVESTOCK
                                  INDEXES

The asset and livestock indexes were constructed using the statistical procedure of principal
components (PCA). PCA is a multivariate statistical method used to reduce the number of
variables into smaller dimensions. This statistical technique extracts common information
from a set of variables and represents them as a weighted combination of the variables. The
method generates uncorrelated indices or components, where the first component is a
linear combination of all the variables that captures the largest variation in the original data
(Filmer and Pritchett, 2001).

Table 1 reports the factor scores or weights of the first component for each variable, along
with the mean and standard deviation. Weights were computed separately for urban and
rural areas. The asset index comprises of 15 variables and the livestock index includes 5
variables. In urban areas, we can observe that ownership of fridge/freezer, TV screen;
computer, DVD Deck and motor vehicle were the variables with the highest weights, while
the factor score for canoe, motor bike and generator received the lowest scores. In the rural
areas, TV screen, gas stove, DVD Deck and mobile phone were the variables with the highest
score.

The variance of the principal component indicates the percentage of variation in the total
data explained by this component. The first component accounted for 24% of the variance
in both areas for the asset index and 22% in the case of the livestock index. Each household
was then assigned a total score based on the sum of her standard score.
