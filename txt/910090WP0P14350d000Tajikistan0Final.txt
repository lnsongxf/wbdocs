Overview

In light of the relative political stability and strong economic growth in Tajikistan since 1997, the
government has set ambitious development targets for 2020: to double GDP, to significantly reduce
poverty, and to expand the middle class. 1 In recent years, sustained high economic growth rates have
sharply reduced poverty rates, from 47 percent in 2009 to about 36 percent in 2012. However, to
achieve Tajikistan’s 2020 development goals more needs to be done. Generating more productive
employment is arguably the most critical challenge.

This report addresses a fundamental question facing policy makers in Tajikistan: is the current level
of worker skills hindering employment outcomes? To answer this question, the study relies on a
unique household survey—the first in the country—that goes beyond the traditional data and
analysis on educational attainment. More specifically, the survey includes large-scale assessments of
cognitive and non-cognitive skills of workers in both the formal and informal sectors, of job seekers,
and of those who are inactive by testing and interviewing respondents. This is a relatively rare
occurrence in middle- and low-income countries, though OECD countries tend to conduct these
assessments more frequently.

The survey was developed specifically for this study and was conducted jointly by the German
Society for International Cooperation (GIZ) and the World Bank in 2013 (see Box 1). The study was
conducted with generous support from the Bank Netherlands Partnership Program (BNPP) for the
“Skills for Competitiveness and Growth: The Challenge of Labor Exporting Countries” Initiative.
The report complements and builds on past studies focusing on the determinants of economic
growth and the determinants of employment outcomes. 2 It also builds on a qualitative study on
economic mobility, jobs, and gender. 3

The main finding of the report is that skills gaps hinder labor market outcomes in Tajikistan. There is
a significant demand for skills in the Tajik economy, as evidenced by substantial positive labor
market returns to both cognitive and non-cognitive skills. Yet, considerable skills gaps persist.
Inactive individuals in Tajikistan have significantly lower cognitive and non-cognitive skills than
employed individuals. Additionally, a large share of employers reports shortages of adequately skilled
individuals in the workforce.

While skills are developed during different stages in the life cycle and a host of actors are involved—
families, the education system, and employers play a central role. Tajikistan’s education system has a
mixed record in skill formation. On the one hand, workers with higher educational attainment
generally have higher cognitive and non-cognitive skills. On the other hand, there is considerable
variation in cognitive and non-cognitive skills across workers within educational attainment
categories, which means that there are too many low performers in each educational attainment level.

To meet the expected growing demand for higher-order skills in the workplace, policy makers should
therefore address skill formation across the life cycle: from conception to preschool (or early

childhood development [ECD] more generally), in general education, in higher education, and while
part of the workforce. At all levels of education and training, a broader focus on cognitive and non-
cognitive skill formation is crucial to ensure that skills are valued in the current and future labor
market. A comprehensive skills development strategy is required that improves the quality and
relevance of education and training systems to ensure that they build market-valued skills.

The Skills Toward Employability and Productivity (STEP) Framework can provide the government
with a set of policy goals to enhance skills for employability in Tajikistan and outside Tajikistan,
where so many Tajik workers find productive employment each year. The STEP framework brings
together research-based evidence and practical experience from diverse areas—from research on the
determinants of early childhood development and learning outcomes to policy experience in the
reforming of vocational and technical education systems and labor markets. 4 In Tajikistan, policy
makers can boost employment outcomes through a more skilled workforce by focusing on the
following five policy goals:

        Getting children off to the right start by expanding access to quality ECD programs—
         including nutrition, preschool—which are critical to ensuring that all children acquire the
         cognitive and non-cognitive skills that are conducive to high productivity and flexibility in
         the labor market.
        Ensuring that all students learn by modernizing the curricula and improving teaching quality,
         in order to strengthen the link between educational attainment and cognitive and non-
         cognitive skills.
        Building job-relevant skills that employers demand by implementing selective active labor
         market programs, focused particularly on expanding employment opportunities for labor
         market discouraged and the female population, and incentivizing firms to provide on-the-job
         training.
        Encouraging entrepreneurship and innovation by managing the expansion of higher
         education, focusing on quality assurance, selection, and information provision, to ensure that
         higher education graduates possess market-valued skills and to ensure that investments in
         higher education pay off.
        Matching the supply of skills with employer demand by improving labor market information
         systems, in order to make labor markets more efficient by alleviating current constraints in
         the job search and skill signaling process.

To reach the above findings and policy goals, the report presents analysis of: (a) key labor market
outcomes; (b) the returns to skills in the labor market and their use in the workplace; and (c) the
formation of skills, with a particular emphasis on whether the education system imparts the cognitive
and non-cognitive skills needed to successfully participate in the labor market. The key findings of
the three areas analyzed in the report are summarized below.

Labor Market Outcomes

Tajikistan faces important challenges in meeting its rapidly changing labor market needs. First,
despite the fact that overall job creation has kept pace with population growth, formal sector job
creation has been insufficient. Second, productivity has risen significantly, but wage growth has
outstripped productivity increases raising concerns about competiveness. Third, jobs are distributed
unevenly. In particular, female employment rates of only 25 percent are far lower than those
observed in OECD countries. A large share (over 15 percent) of the young population in Tajikistan
is labor market discouraged—meaning that they are not looking for a job because they do not believe
they can find one and almost one-in-three young men migrate abroad for employment purposes.

At the same time, Tajikistan’s economy is undergoing significant structural changes—specifically, it is
shifting away from agriculture and industry toward services. Nonetheless, job quality remains an
important challenge. A sizable portion of the working population is engaged in the informal sector
(60 percent), and the vast majority of workers perform repetitive tasks and they do not learn new
things on the job. Finally, weak labor market systems hinder the effectiveness of job searches and
skills signaling, limiting the extent to which the supply of skills are effectively matched with employer
demand in Tajikistan.


Skills and Employability

As in many other parts of the world, there is an increasing demand for “new economy” skills in
Tajikistan. New economy skills are higher-order analytical and organizational skills, including non-
routine cognitive analytical and interpersonal skills. Although there are competing explanations for
this observed trend—including technology advances and globalization—it is clear that Tajikistan is in
the beginning stages of modernizing its economy and is experiencing a growing demand for new
economy skills.

Workers’ skills consist of cognitive, non-cognitive (social and behavioral), and technical skills. This
study focuses on foundational cognitive and non-cognitive skills more thoroughly. Cognitive skills
capture the ability to use logical, intuitive, and critical thinking as well as skills such as problem
solving, verbal ability, and numeracy. These skills are the basis for the formation of technical and job-
specific skill acquisition later in life. The cognitive skills measured in this report include memory,
literacy, and numeracy skills (for more details, see Appendix B: Constructing Cognitive Skills Scores
Methods for Scale Development and Scoring). Non-cognitive skills represent personality traits and
socio-emotional skills that are relevant in the labor market, including extraversion, conscientiousness,
openness to experience, agreeability, and emotional stability. This survey measures the following non-
cognitive skills: openness/sociability, workplace attitude, decision making, achievement striving, and
growth mindset (for more details, see Appendix C: Constructing Non-Cognitive Skills Scores
Methods for Scale Development and Scoring).

Beyond educational attainment alone, both cognitive and non-cognitive skills are important factors
for employability in Tajikistan. Individuals with better skills are not only more likely to be employed,
but they also typically have more desirable jobs—those in the formal sector with labor law

                                                   3
protections and access to some benefits in case of termination. Skills valued in the Tajik labor market
include not only cognitive skills such as literacy and numeracy alongside technical skills, but also non-
cognitive skills such as an individual’s attitude in the workplace and decision making skills. In
addition, higher skilled individuals use their skills more frequently on the job. For example, workers
with higher numeracy skills are more likely to use math on the job. And, workers with a better
workplace attitude are more likely to supervise others’ work.


Skill Formation over the Life Cycle

The importance of skills for employment outcomes is clear, yet the skill-formation track record of
Tajikistan’s education and training system is mixed. While skills are developed during different stages
in the life cycle and a host of actors are involved—for example, families play a central role—the
education and training system plays a key role in skill formation of both the current and future
workforce. Although the education system in Tajikistan provides universal access to general
education, skills gaps are likely to emerge at early ages given the low coverage of early childhood
development (ECD). Because the foundations of cognitive and behavioral skills are formed earlier on
in life, the early childhood period is critical in the development of these skills. Furthermore, at the
tertiary level, higher education completion rates have been consistently strong while the completion
of vocational degrees has diminished in recent years. Upon entering the workforce, few workers
continue to develop their skills through on-the-job training.

Aside from access issues, quality concerns across all levels of education and training further
contribute to the observed gaps in the level and relevance of skills. On the one hand, workers with
higher educational attainment generally have higher cognitive and non-cognitive skills. On the other
hand, there is great variation in skill levels across workers, to the extent that the level of cognitive and
non-cognitive skills often varies widely despite identical educational attainment levels. In particular,
there are individuals in the sample who have completed higher education but have a lower cognitive
ability than individuals with less than secondary education. These results raise questions about the
quality and selection at various levels in the education system, most notably in higher education
institutions. In addition, the variation in non-cognitive skills may result from disparities in the extent
to which non-cognitive skills are taught in schools and the quality of such teaching—although,
admittedly, families and communities play a central role in the early development of non-cognitive
skills in children.

Box 1: World Bank/GIZ Tajikistan Jobs, Skills, and Migration Survey (2013)


The World Bank/German Society for International Cooperation (GIZ) Tajikistan Jobs, Skills, and
Migration Survey is one of three household surveys conducted in Central Asia in 2013—the other
countries covered are the Kyrgyz Republic and Uzbekistan.+ Conducted from July to September
2013, the survey collects comprehensive information not typically captured by traditional household
surveys and is representative at the national, regional (Oblast), and urban/rural levels.


Two distinct instruments are employed in the survey: a core questionnaire and a skills questionnaire.
The sample size of the core questionnaire is 3,300 households with a total of 20,142 individuals.
Depending on the household, one or two individuals per household were randomly selected to
partake in the skills questionnaire. The second skills questionnaire sample consists of 4,892
individuals. Qualitative testing and pilots helped fine-tune the questionnaires and organize the
modules in order to administer the survey efficiently and consistently.

1. Core questionnaire*
The core questionnaire contains modules focusing on: education, employment, migration, health
expenditure, remittances, government transfers, financial services, subjective poverty, housing
conditions, and household expenditures. The core questionnaire concludes with the random selection
of a household member aged 15 to 64 who is not a current migrant (the selection is based on a
random number table or Kish grid) to be the subject for the skills questionnaire.

2. Skills questionnaire*
The skills questionnaire contains detailed modules on labor and work expectations, migration and
preparation for migration, language skills, and technical skill training. A unique aspect of the survey is
the battery of cognitive and non-cognitive questions which helps to test a respondent’s ability. The
cognitive skills module is based on a recent instrument developed for a similar survey in Bulgaria.
The non-cognitive test modules of the skills questionnaire are based on World Bank Skills Toward
Employment and Productivity (STEP) surveys. The skills modules were developed with the support
of a multi-disciplinary panel of experts in psychology, skills assessment, education, and labor markets.

1          Labor Market Outcomes

This section presents an overview of Tajikistan’s labor market outcomes and attempts to
answer three fundamental questions that shed light on the country’s ability to meet the
evolving labor market demand. The questions addressed are:

      (1) Has job creation in Tajikistan kept pace with population growth?
      (2) What do we know about job quality in Tajikistan?
      (3) Are workers in Tajikistan able to find jobs that match their skills with employers’ needs?

As further explained below, Tajikistan faces important challenges in meeting its rapidly
changing labor market needs—five key areas are currently shaping labor market outcomes.
First, despite the fact that job creation has kept pace with population growth, formal sector job
creation has lagged behind. Moreover, there is a weak link between economic growth and
employment opportunities. Second, jobs are distributed unevenly—in particular, female employment
rates are far lower than those observed in OECD countries. Third, Tajikistan’s economy is
undergoing significant structural changes—specifically, it is shifting away from agriculture and
industry toward services. Fourth, job quality is an important challenge; a sizable portion of the
working population is engaged in the informal sector (60 percent), performs repetitive tasks (82
percent), and does not frequently learn new things on the job (57 percent). And fifth, weak labor
market systems hinder the effectiveness of job searches and skills signaling. Overall, these challenges
have resulted in high labor market discouragement levels and exceptionally high international
migration rates. To improve labor market outcomes in Tajikistan, the government will need to
revamp the education and training systems to meet the challenges of a modernizing economy. In
addition to the results presented in the main body of the report, Appendix E: Summary Tables
contains more detailed results on labor market outcomes.

1.1        Although total job creation has kept pace with population growth, formal sector job
           growth has lagged behind

Economic growth rates in Tajikistan have been among the highest in the world in recent
years—growing at an average annual rate of nearly 8 percent in the last decade. As such,
Tajikistan’s economy has outpaced its peers in Europe and Central Asia (ECA) as well as the OECD
countries (
Figure 1). This dynamic was driven in part by “catch-up” growth following the slump experienced
during the early stages of transition in the 1990s. Remittances have also played an increasingly
important role, with remittance inflows rising from a relatively low base in 2000 to 46 percent of
GDP by 2008. In addition, government stabilization policies, growing exports of aluminum and
cotton, and gradual government reforms further propelled the economic boom experienced since the
early 2000s. 5

Total job creation has kept pace with population growth, though too many of these jobs were
created in the informal sector. Labor demand from both the formal and informal sectors has
grown at an average rate of 2.84 percent per year since 1996, while the working-age population has
grown at an equivalent rate of 2.8 percent per year. Hence, nearly 1 million additional jobs have been
created in the last decade. Since 2006, the Tajikistan’s population has increased by 17 percent, while
formal employment rose by only 10 percent. 6 In other words, formal sector employment did not
keep pace with population growth, and hence, informal sector job growth made up for the shortfall.
However, the rate of job creation vis-à-vis population growth is only one of many factors affecting
employment outcomes—as explained in the next section, also important are job quality and labor
market discouragement, which can be push factors for migration.

Although productivity has grown considerably, Tajikistan continues to lag behind other
countries. Productivity in Tajikistan has grown by more than 50 percent between 2000 and 2011
(approximately 4 percent per year), outperforming many comparator countries including Brazil,
Chile, Poland, and Turkey(Figure 2). However, in a separate analysis conducted, there are concerns
about the rise of real wages in Tajikistan by almost 300 percent since 2005, while labor productivity
only increased by 32 percent during the same period. 7 This is potentially important because while
poverty reduction may follow from wage growth, increases much larger than productivity growth
may hamper sustainable job creation and reduce Tajikistan’s competitiveness, unless sizable total
factor productivity gains materialize.

Tajikistan’s favorable demographics present an opportunity for continued economic growth,
especially if the future labor force is well trained. The demographics favor Tajikistan in that the
youth bulge is significant; approximately 55 percent of the population is under 25 years of age. As
young adults reach working age, Tajikistan’s dependency ratio is projected to decrease. The share of
the working-age population will rise from 54 percent in 2000 to roughly 65 percent in 2050. Unlike
many other countries in ECA, this window of opportunity is projected to remain open for several
decades. The share of elderly (over 65 year of age) in the population is currently very low (3.3
percent), and while the population of Tajikistan is expected to age, the share of elderly in the
population will reach close to 15 percent in 2100—lower than in most other countries in ECA.
Importantly, however, Tajikistan will only be able to take full advantage of its youth bulge if those
young adults are absorbed into the labor market and are productive in the labor force.

1.2                                     Jobs are distributed unevenly and labor market discouragement is high

Male employment rates in Tajikistan are similar to those seen in OECD countries, but
employment rates among women are far lower. Figure 4 shows that male employment rates in
Tajikistan are relatively high and just below those in OECD countries. Female employment rates, on
the other hand, are considerably lower than male employment rates and are also lower than female
employment rates in OECD countries. A recent qualitative study finds that caring for children is the
main obstacle for women to participate in the labor market, 8 particularly among 20- to 34-year-old
adults, whose employment rates are 35 percentage points below the OECD average. While the gap is
smaller among women between the ages of 35 and 44, it is still significant at 25 percentage points
below the average OECD rate. If Tajikistan’s female employment rates were on par with those of
OECD countries, there would be 700,000 more women contributing to the Tajik economy today.9

Another important factor affecting employment outcomes in Tajikistan is labor market
discouragement—a considerable share of the population feels discouraged from seeking
work, especially youth. Discouraged workers are defined as persons who are not in the labor force
and are available to work but are no longer looking for a job because they do not believe they will
find one. 10 The share of discouraged workers is particularly high among young men and women—
approximately one in six men and one in ten women aged 20–24 are too discouraged to look for
employment. By comparison, the average share of discouraged workers among the young labor force
(aged 15–24) was just 0.5 percent in OECD countries in 2012 (Figure 5). Hence, Tajikistan is not
been able to absorb youth who reach working age into the labor market, limiting the extent to which
the country has been able to turn the youth bulge into a demographic dividend.

High youth labor market discouragement could have important implications for Tajikistan’s
future quantity and quality of labor supply; recent studies find that inadequate skills are at
the root of the problem. A qualitative study finds that young males in particular face barriers to
finding jobs because they do not meet skills and experience requirements by employers.11 A recent
labor market study also supports this finding, and points to a lack of work experience and vocational
skills as a cause of youth labor market discouragement. 12 Given that a sizeable part of the young
working-age population is out of the labor market as a result of high discouragement, addressing the
issue is among the most pressing priorities.

International migration rates are exceptionally high in Tajikistan—one-third of all prime-
aged men are migrants. International migration is often a coping mechanism for workers who are
unable to find a (good) job domestically. It is particularly striking that more than one in three men
aged 20–39 in Tajik households are currently abroad; however, this share is considerably lower
among women (Figure 6). Due in part to regional cooperation agreements permitting visa-free entry,
the Russian Federation is the primary destination for Tajik labor migrants. More than 90 percent of
Tajik labor migrants are in the Russian Federation, working mostly in construction, trade, housing
and cleaning services, agriculture, and maintenance. 13 In contrast to international migration, domestic
migration rates are very low, which suggests that labor allocation within the country may be less than
optimal. Domestic migration, or internal migration, plays a key role in fostering local agglomeration
economies.

1.3                                    The labor market has undergone significant transformations

Tajikistan’s economy has undergone fundamental structural changes over the last 15 years,
with a shift in value added away from agriculture and industry toward services. Despite
substantial fluctuations in value added by sector, this trend is especially evident in the last decade
(Figure 7). The share of value added of the services sector has more than doubled since 1995, from
22 percent in 1995 to 48 percent in 2012. The share of agriculture and industry in value added has in
turn decreased from approximately 40 percent each in 1995 to 26 percent each in 2012. However,
compared to OECD members, agriculture continues to be a relatively important sector in Tajikistan
(representing just 1.5 percent of value added in OECD countries), while services are significantly
more important in OECD countries (representing approximately 75 percent of value added).

Figure 7:                                   The share of services in GDP has increased while the share of agriculture and
                                            industry in GDP has decreased, 1995–2012

Services and agricultural sectors account for the majority of employment in Tajikistan (Figure
8). Four out of five employed individuals are engaged in the services or agricultural sectors, but some
of these workers are family workers or entrepreneurs. The share of employment in services is
proportional to its share in GDP, but the value added in industry appears to be higher than the share
of employment.

The majority of the employed population is self-employed or works in state-owned firms. In
both urban and rural areas, self-employment is by far the most common type of employment; overall,
41 percent of the employed report to be self-employed (Figure 9). In addition, more than one in four
people work in state-owned enterprises or for the government (28 percent). This is considerably
higher than the number of people working for private firms (17 percent).

Entrepreneurship in Tajikistan is dominated by micro enterprises that operate in the services
sector. Over half of all self-employed individuals do not employ any additional workers (56 percent)
and another 30 percent employ fewer than five additional workers. Compared to salaried workers,
the self-employed are more likely to engage in the services sector as opposed to industry and
agriculture sectors. Note that the majority of individuals working in agriculture in Tajikistan are
unpaid family workers (53 percent).

Private sector workers in Tajikistan typically perform seasonal labor in the agricultural
sector. Nearly two-thirds (61 percent) of all workers engaged in the private sector work in agriculture
(Figure 11), considerably above the country average of 35 percent (Figure 8). The vast majority of
workers in agriculture have a seasonal job (80 percent), and overall four out of five workers in the
private sector lack a permanent job. On the other hand, nearly all (81 percent) of the employees in
the public sector consider their job to be permanent.

1.4                           Job quality remains a concern in Tajikistan

Job quality is a multidimensional concept that includes earnings, but also other concepts such as
workplace safety, job security, learning and advancement opportunities, and health and social
protection benefits, mental and physical health, etc. 14 At the other extreme, not having a job
undermines life satisfaction and especially in countries where wage employment is the norm and
where the lack of opportunities translates into open unemployment rather than underemployment. In
this section, the concept of informality, which is work without a labor contract; the type of work
performed at typical workplaces; and the use of technology at work is explored in more detail.

Box 2: What are ‘good jobs’ in Tajikistan?

Qualitative study results suggest that the most important characteristics of a preferred job
are a good income (30 percent), a permanent/long-term contract (11 percent), and access to
benefits (11 percent). For women in particular, status/prestige (8 percent) and socially accepted
jobs (6 percent) are other important considerations for a job. For younger men, a better work
environment (6 percent) is among the preferred characteristics.

The majority of women prefer to be employed in the public sector, while men favor the
private sector or self-employment. For women, the public sector ensures stability, a formal salary,
and access to a pension upon retirement. While women (83.3 percent) tend to favor employment in
large companies for its stability, men are less eager to work in large organizations (65 percent).

Informal employment, which is prevalent in all three employment sectors—state-owned
firms, private sector, and self-employed—plays a key role in the Tajik economy. About 60
percent of all Tajik salaried workers are engaged in the informal sector. Although the definition of
informality varies across countries, 15 for the purposes of this analysis, the following definition is
applied: informal sector salaried workers are those who lack an employment contract or are unpaid
family workers. Informality is particularly common in the agricultural sector, a pattern observed in
most countries around the world, and informality is also more common among less educated workers
(Figure 12).16

Informal employment offers remuneration and working conditions inferior to those in
comparable formal sector jobs, and can impose costs to the economy at large. Consistent with
evidence in other regions, 17 jobs in the informal sector in Tajikistan are associated with significantly
lower earnings than comparable jobs 18 in the formal sector. Working conditions, as well, are inferior
to those in formal sector jobs. Whereas approximately one in four workers in the formal sector are
entitled to sick leave, less than one in ten workers have this entitlement in the informal sector.
Moreover, people working informally typically face explicit and implicit barriers to public and
privately provided insurance instruments to manage shocks. Indeed, the vast majority of respondents
in the qualitative study report to prefer a job in the formal sector because of stability and access to


15 See, for example, Perry et al. (2007).
16 In some studies, the self-employed in businesses with fewer than six employees are also considered part of
the informal sector. In Tajikistan, however, there is indication that a considerable share of these small
businesses pay taxes, so while they are non-corporate, they should not be considered informal.
17 Koettl et al. (2012).
18 A comparable job is defined as a job in the same sector of employment (i.e. private/public/self-employed

and agriculture/industry/services) held by an individual with the same level of completed education.

pensions and benefits. 19 More broadly, a large informal economy imposes heavy costs to the
economy at large that tend to deteriorate the provision of services and public goods. 20

Physical work and repetitive tasks are key components of most jobs in Tajikistan and less
than half of all workers seem to learn new things on the job. Doing physical work is defined as
regularly lifting or pulling anything weighing at least 50 pounds (25 kilograms). Such tasks are
common in jobs in the agriculture and industry sectors, and less so in the services sector (Figure 13).
The majority of tasks performed at work are repetitive in nature, and this holds for all three sectors
of employment. Manual, repetitive tasks limit the scope for on the job learning, which is confirmed
by respondents in all three sectors. Only one in four respondents working in agriculture (27 percent)
and half of all workers in industry (48 percent) state that they learn new things at least once a week.
This share is slightly higher in services (60 percent).

Few workers use computers on the job, and workers who do use computers are typically
young employees in state-owned enterprises in the service sector. Overall, only one-in-ten
workers in Tajikistan use computers at work. This is relatively low compared to other developing
countries. In the Yunnan province in China 55 percent or workers use computers, and this share is
35 percent in Bolivia and Vietnam, and 30 percent in Sri Lanka (World Bank, 2013e). In Tajikistan,
younger workers are more than twice as likely to use computers at work as older workers. The share
of workers using computers is the highest in state-owned enterprises or the government (26 percent)
and in the services sector (20 percent). Moreover, workers in richer households are considerably
more likely to use computers at work than workers in poorer households, suggesting that higher
paying jobs are more likely to require computer use.

1.5                                        Labor market systems are weak, hindering the job search and skills signaling process

Weak labor market information systems are hindering the job matching process. Difficulties
in learning about job vacancies or demonstrating their skills make it harder for employees to find
suitable jobs. Finding a job is usually a difficult and time-consuming process. Workers should know
where an opening exists, how to search for work, and how to present their qualifications in a way
that convinces the employer. There is evidence that information gaps and signaling problems form
barriers to efficient and equitable job allocations in the Tajik labor market.

The majority of respondents in Tajikistan feel constrained by a lack of adequate
qualifications and face difficulties demonstrating their qualifications when finding a job.
Approximately 80 percent of the respondents in Tajikistan state that they are unable to certify or
demonstrate their qualifications to an employer, or lack adequate qualifications to begin with.
Qualitative study results show that, among other factors, having access to further training can help
individuals get a job. 21

In addition, two-thirds of individuals face significant barriers to learning about job
vacancies. Information is a key element in the quest to successfully match labor supply and labor
demand. Workers should have the ability to learn about vacancies and assess the nature of the jobs
that are offered. In Tajikistan, however, two out of three respondents (68 percent) indicate that they
do not have the means to find out about job vacancies, in the event that they would be looking for a

information in Tajikistan, for instance through public employment services.

2        Skills and Employability

This section presents findings about the returns to skills in the Tajik labor market and the
use of skills on the job, mostly drawing from the 2013 household survey data. In doing so, it
addresses a fundamental question, namely what skills are valued and used in the Tajik labor market?
Four key findings are explained in this section. First, the types of skills needed in both the domestic
and international labor markets are changing. Second, educational attainment is valued in the labor
market, but employers are not always able to find adequately educated individuals in the Tajik
workforce. Third, skills are an important factor in employability. And fourth, workers with better
skills tend to use them more frequently in the workplace. The section begins by defining skills. Box 3
defines skills for the purposes of this report. Because of data constraints, this study focuses on
cognitive and non-cognitive skills. In addition to the results presented in the main body of the report
below, Appendix F: Cognitive and Non-Cognitive Skill Mean Scores contains more detailed
information on cognitive and non-cognitive skill outcomes.

Box 3: Defining skills

Workers’ skills consist of cognitive, non-cognitive, and technical skills (Figure B3). Because of
data constraints, this study focuses on cognitive and non-cognitive skills. Cognitive skills capture the
ability to use logical, intuitive, and critical thinking as well as skills such as problem solving, verbal
ability, and numeracy. Social and behavioral skills represent personality traits that are relevant in the
labor market, including extraversion, conscientiousness, openness to experience, agreeability, and
emotional stability.

           social/behavioral, and technical

cited in World Bank (2013b).

The three cognitive skills measured in this study are memory, literacy, and numeracy. The
working memory score is based on twelve items that asked respondents to repeat a sequence of
numbers of increasing length. The literacy score represents reading comprehension skills and builds
on five text comprehension questions about a story card. The informational numeracy score is built
using a total of 10 questions measuring comprehension of a medicine instructions card, a bus

schedule card, publicity, and a graph. It should be noted that the numeracy score represents various
aspects of numeracy skills, which often also require a broader set of cognitive skills such as being
literate. In particular, individuals with a high score on numeracy have the ability to recognize and
manipulate numbers contained in and represented by various formats.

The five non-cognitive skills measured in this study are openness, workplace attitude,
decision making, achievement striving, and the growth mindset scale. The skills are built using
the following items:
    (1) Openness to New Ideas and People (5 items; e.g., “Are you outgoing and sociable?”; “Are
         you interested in learning new things?”);
    (2) Workplace Attitude and Behavior (5 items; e.g., “Do you enjoy working on things that take a
         very long time to complete?”; “Are people mean/not nice to you?”);
    (3) Decision Making (5 items; e.g., “Do you think about how the things you do will affect
         others?”; “Do you think carefully before making an important decision?”);
    (4) Achievement Striving (3 items; e.g. “Do you do more than is expected of you?”; “Do you try
         to outdo others, to be best?”); and
    (5) Growth Mindset Scale (4 items; e.g. “The type of person you are is fundamental, and you
         cannot change much”; “You can behave in various ways, but your character cannot really be
         changed.”).

2.1         The skill needs in the domestic and international market are evolving

In an increasingly interconnected and globalizing world economy, newly created jobs
require a high degree of analytical and interpersonal skills. The rapid developments in
technology, business organization, and trade have led to changes in the key competencies needed in a
dynamic labor market. The occupational structures in most economies worldwide and in ECA have
undergone a significant change: a shift in value added and employment toward knowledge-intensive
activities and services has reduced the demand for manual tasks that can be easily automated, and
occupations requiring high analytical and interpersonal skills are becoming more prevalent. 22

In Tajikistan, too, there is an increasing demand for “new economy” skills. Figure 16 shows
the evolution of the skill intensity of jobs in Tajikistan between 2007 and 2013. It depicts the change
in an index of the task-skills intensity of jobs relative to the skills intensity of jobs in 2007, measured
in “centiles” (or less precisely, the percentile change in skills requirements in jobs in the Tajik
economy). The demand for new economy and routine cognitive skills increased (often in
manufacturing and services jobs) while the demand for routine manual skills declined (often in low
productivity agriculture and retail services). This shift has occurred primarily in the four years

                                                    21
between 2009 and 2013, while the change was less apparent from 2007 to 2009. This shift in skills
demand is consistent with those observed in other Eastern European and Central Asian countries as
well as in many OECD countries.

2.2                          Education matters to employers

A considerable share of firms in Tajikistan complains about an inadequately educated
workforce. The World Bank Enterprise Survey reveals that approximately one third of all firms in
Tajikistan (34.2 percent) identifies an inadequately educated workforce as a major constraint (Figure
17). This share is higher than the average in Eastern Europe and Central Asia (22.8 percent) and also
higher than in most comparator countries (with the exception of Brazil). Note that the question does
not specify whether inadequately educated means that workers’ skills are on average too low, or that
workers on average have the wrong set of skills and/or specialization for their job. The former
implies a problem related to skill formation, as discussed in section 4. The latter, on the other hand,
is inherently also a problem in the labor market. Even if workers possessed the right level of skills,
there may be inefficiencies in matching workers to jobs. In this case, the problem is in the allocation
of jobs in the labor market.

Employment prospects are stronger for higher educated and secondary special/technical
educated individuals. While individuals who have completed a secondary special/technical or
higher education enjoy high employment rates, individuals who have only completed secondary
general or who have not completed secondary school are less likely to have a job. Overall, the
employment rate among adults with a university degree (81 percent) is roughly twice as high as the
employment rate among adults who have not completed a secondary general education (41 percent).
This ratio is in fact three-to-one for women, with employment rates of 69 percent for women with a
higher education compared to 22 percent for women with less than a secondary education.

Preschool attendance as a child is significantly correlated with employment outcomes, but
mainly as a result of higher educational attainment. Adults who attended preschool as a child on
average are more likely to be employed (66 percent) compared to adults who did not attend
preschool (56 percent), and, among those employed, a larger share of adults who went to preschool
as a child have formal sector jobs or public sector jobs (Figure 19). Doing agricultural work is also
less common among adults who went to preschool as a child. However, when taking into account
demographic characteristics such as age, gender, marital status, geographic location, and educational
attainment, preschool is no longer a significant correlate of employment outcomes; rather,
educational attainment is a more significant correlate of labor market outcomes. Preschool
attendance may not be correlated with employment outcomes directly, but rather through higher
educational attainment.

Informality rates fall sharply with educational attainment. As shown, approximately 60 percent
of all salaried workers in Tajikistan are engaged in the informal sector. This share is even higher
among lower educated individuals. In fact, workers with less than a secondary education are roughly
twice as likely to be engaged in the informal sector as workers with higher education (Figure 20). As
discussed earlier, informal sector jobs are usually associated with lower pay, job insecurity, and no

In addition, there is a considerable wage premium to higher education in the labor market in
Tajikistan. Figure 21 shows the average percentage earnings premium for workers with higher
education relative to workers with secondary education (both general and technical) with similar
observed characteristics. In Tajikistan, workers with higher education on average have a 40 percent
higher wage than similar workers with secondary education. Such a considerable return to higher
education is a signal of strong demand for higher educated individuals in the labor market. As such,
there is a positive correlation between the degree of modernization (reforms to transition to a market
economy) and the returns to higher education. 23 Average college premiums are highest in most EU-
10 countries and are comparable to other middle- and high-income countries. Hence, the value and
importance of higher education is likely to increase as Tajikistan’s economy continues to modernize.

2.3                                                Skills and employability are closely linked

In Tajikistan, workers have significantly better cognitive and non-cognitive skills than
individuals who are out of work (Figure 22). Employed adults scored significantly higher than the
inactive population average on all measured cognitive skills, including memory, literacy, and
numeracy. The gap is especially large for numeracy, where employed adults on average receive nearly
half a standard deviation higher scores than adults without a job. Non-cognitive skills are also
considerably better among the employed. In particular—as found in other studies (see Box 4)—
workplace attitude, decision making, and achievement striving are significantly correlated with being
employed in Tajikistan.

23        See, for instance, Staneva et al. (2010); Flabbi et al. (2007); and Rutkowski (1996 and 2001).

                                                                                         26
Moreover, individuals who are discouraged in the labor market have significantly lower
cognitive skills than the employed. Discouraged individuals have similar cognitive skills as
individuals who are out of the labor force. Non-cognitive skill outcomes are more mixed but decision
making, in particular, seems to be falling short. These results may, in part, explain why discouraged
individuals face difficulties finding a job in the labor market. Of course, others factors both on the
demand side—including high reservation wages or a lack of mobility—and on the supply side—
most notably constraints in the business environment—should not be discounted. Nonetheless, low
skill levels among the discouraged are noteworthy in particular because youth are overrepresented in
the discouraged population, and given the youth bulge in Tajikistan, the mismatch in skills raises the
stakes for policy makers.

Individuals with better skillsets typically work in the public sector. Figure 23 depicts the
cognitive and non-cognitive skills for employed adults in the public and private sector, as well as for
self-employed individuals. Higher-skilled individuals are clearly concentrated in the public sector.
Cognitive skills are up to half a standard deviation higher among employees in the public sector
compared to employees in the private sector (in the case of literacy). Similar gaps are found for non-
cognitive skills such as openness/sociability, workplace attitude, decision making, and achievement
striving. The lack of high-skilled individuals in the private sector suggests that this sector is currently
a relatively unattractive sector to work in.

There is a stark difference between skills of formal and informal sector workers—with formal
sector workers having better cognitive and non-cognitive skills (Figure 24). All measured
cognitive skills among formal sector salaried workers are significantly higher than those among
workers in the informal sector. Similarly, there are large differences in non-cognitive skills between
workers in the formal and informal sector. Statistically significant differences are can be observed for
openness or sociability and for achievement striving.

Regression analysis confirms that both cognitive and non-cognitive skills matter for
employment outcomes in Tajikistan. 24 Controlling for the usual socio-demographic variables, 25
several cognitive and non-cognitive skills remain significantly associated with being employed, as
opposed to being out of work. Although no causality is implied, numeracy (cognitive) skills and
decision making (non-cognitive) skills are found to be positively and significantly associated with the
probability of being employed. An increase in the numeracy score by one standard deviation is
associated with a 24 percent higher likelihood of being employed; similarly an increase in the
decision-making score by one standard deviation is associated with a 9 percent higher likelihood of
having a job. The other cognitive and non-cognitive scores are not correlated significantly with being
employed.

In the more modern sectors (i.e. industry and services) in particular, the probability of
employment is significantly higher for individuals with better cognitive and non-cognitive
skillsets. As the economies develop and prosper, they also undergo a process of structural shift,
whereby jobs are shifted from the traditional sectors (agriculture and mining) to the modern ones
(industry and services). This shift also implies a rise in importance of the cognitive and non-cognitive
skills in this so-called “modern” sector. 26 In order to gauge this relationship, the analysis above is
restricted only to the industry and services sectors, as opposed to working in agriculture or being out
of work. The results reveal that, in addition to numeracy and decision making, workplace attitude is
also found to be positive and statistically significantly correlated with employment in the industry or
services sector, although only within the female sub-sample.

Workers with better cognitive and non-cognitive skills are typically more likely to have a
formal sector job. A higher skillset implies not only higher employability, but also a higher chance
of obtaining a formal sector job, typically a job in the state administration or a state owned enterprise
(SOE), as well as in a medium or big privately owned company. There are numerous benefits
associated with employment in these sectors, thus including job security and various social protection
benefits. In order to explore the relationship between a respondent’s skillset and the probability of
having a formal sector job, we repeat the analysis from above, restricting it to employment in the
state administration, SOEs, as well as private enterprises employing more than 6 workers. The results
confirm the findings that the numeracy score and workplace attitude (only when the analysis is
restricted to the female sub-sample) are associated with a higher probability of being employed in a
formal sector job.

probability of being employed, conditional on a respondent’s set of cognitive and non-cognitive skills.

Box 4: Existing literature shows a strong relationship between both cognitive and non-
       cognitive skills and employment outcomes

Past work has shown a strong and robust relationship between cognitive skills and labor
market outcomes. Studies using longitudinal household surveys in the US find that cognitive test
scores during schooling years are good predictors of the level of wages (Heckman, 2000; Heckman
and Carneiro, 2003; Cunha et al., 2006). Moreover, the empirical evidence shows that a shortage of
skills is considered to be one of the biggest barriers to employment (Sanchez Puerta, 2009). The
empirical literature on cognitive skills/labor market outcomes distils two types of causal pathways: (i)
direct—e.g. Murnane et al. (1995) assess the role of math skills of graduating high school seniors on
their wages at age 24 and found a positive and increasing impact of cognitive skills on wages; and (ii)
indirect—e.g. Cunha et al. (2005) argue that cognitive skills increase the likelihood of acquiring a
higher level of education, which in turn leads to higher economic returns.

Similarly, there is growing evidence that non-cognitive skills are also important for labor
market outcomes. Even though a more recent phenomenon, the empirical literature on the
skills/labor market outcomes nexus finds a strong and robust relationship between certain non-
cognitive skills, such as dependability, persistence, and docility and labor market outcomes (Heckman
et al., 2006; Blom and Saeki, 2011; and Cunha and Heckman, 2010). A separate strand of the
literature has argued that non-cognitive skills are particularly valued in certain sectors (e.g. services).
Finally, recent evidence in the context of high-income countries has suggested that employers value
non-cognitive abilities more than cognitive ability or independent thought (e.g. Bowles et al., 2001).



Young adults possess better cognitive skills than older adults, but the pattern is not as clear
for non-cognitive skills. Figure 25 shows two interesting patterns. First, young adults generally
have better cognitive skills than older adults. Second, employed people have higher cognitive skills
than inactive people. This holds both for the young and old age cohort. Similarly, employed people
score higher than inactive people for most measures of non-cognitive skills as well, for both young
and older cohorts. Among the employed, young people show more openness and better workplace
attitude, a finding that is observed in other countries as well. However, older workers appear to be
much better decision makers in Tajikistan relative to younger workers.

Box 5: Skills and migration in Tajikistan

Existing studies find that migrants and non-migrants differ with respect to education and
skills. Among the reasons are the selective migration of groups who can gain disproportionally from
mobility (Borjas, 1987), investments in higher education for those who aspire to migrate (Mountford,
1997), or specific pre-migration investments in human capital (Danzer and Dietz, 2014). There is a
broad range of literature on the self-selection of migrants with respect to formal educational
attainments (e.g., Chiquiar and Hanson, 2005; Lanzona, 1998; Orrenius and Zavodny, 2005).
However, evidence on the cognitive and non-cognitive skill endowment of migrants is scarce.


Individuals who intend to migrate from Tajikistan generally score above those who do not
intend to migrate on cognitive and non-cognitive skills. 27 Given that migration is a common
labor market outcome for Tajik youth, with one-third of all 20-39 year old males migrating for
employment, it is important to analyze the skill profile of migrants. In Tajikistan, adults with
migration intentions typically belong to the middle of the educational attainment distribution.
However, individuals with intentions to migrate score significantly above average on all cognitive and
non-cognitive skills compared to individuals who plan to stay in Tajikistan. The skills gap is sizeable
for memory, literacy and numeracy skills (all greater than 10% of a standard deviation). For all
measured non-cognitive skills, individuals with migration plans perform better than individuals
without migration intentions. The gap is especially large with respect to achievements and ambitions,


27 The analysis of skill profiles among those who intend to migrate and those who return from working abroad
is drawn from a background paper written by Alexander Danzer.

reflecting the fact that migrating abroad implies a strongly positive contribution to family income in
Tajikistan. In support of selection theories, the results show that individuals planning to migrate have
on average better cognitive and non-cognitive skills than others in the working-age population. The
results also suggest that studies focusing exclusively on education may draw different conclusions.

Migrants who return have significantly higher cognitive and non-cognitive skill outcomes
than non-migrants (Figure 27). These return migrants typically have a secondary education diploma
and have significantly higher cognitive and non-cognitive skill outcomes than non-migrants. The
positive cognitive skills gaps migrants who have returned are of similar size to the positive cognitive
skills gaps for individuals with migration intentions. Therefore, if many of those with intentions to
migrate follow through and migrate (and if migrants had migration intentions before the move), this
result suggests that migrants do not necessarily acquire cognitive skills during their stay abroad.
Returned migrants also have better non-cognitive skills than non-migrants. For non-cognitive skills,
the most interesting difference between returned migrants and individuals with migration intentions
can be found for achievement striving skills. While individuals who plan to migrate are substantially
more ambitious than non-migrants, actual migrants are only slightly more ambitious than non-
migrants. This could result if the most ambitious adults tend to emigrate permanently and hence are
not captured in the survey.

2.4                                          Workers with better skills use those skills more often in the workplace

Comparing a worker’s skillset and use of skills on the job can help to establish whether an
individual’s skillset is put to use in the labor market. If the labor market were to effectively
make use of workers’ skills, then there would be a positive correlation between ability and the use of
skills on the job. For example, a person with better numeracy ability would use mathematics skills
more frequently and intensely on the job. This section examines whether the labor market in
Tajikistan indeed uses workers’ skills in an effective way. It is important to note that the results
presented are correlations—they do not imply causation. It may be that individuals who make more
use of mathematics on the job score higher on a mathematics ability test precisely because they use
such skills on a daily basis. Such bi-directional links between skill use and skill ability is an important
caveat when interpreting the results.

In Tajikistan, workers with better cognitive skills typically make more frequent and intense
use of mathematics and reading skills. Figure 28 shows that individuals with high numeracy
ability are on average more than twice as likely to use mathematics on the job—calculating fractions,
decimals, or percentages. These positive correlations hold in both urban and rural areas, as well as for
both men and women. Similar results show that literacy ability is also positively correlated with the
frequency and intensity of reading. Note that the use of math is generally considerably lower among
women, compared to men.

Workers with higher cognitive ability are less likely to do physical work. The share of
respondents who do physical work drops from 60 percent among those with low cognitive ability, to
just over 40 percent among those with high cognitive ability (Figure 29). While this drop is
significant, the share of physical work remains high even among individuals with a high cognitive
ability. This underscores the earlier finding, in section 1.3, that the labor market in Tajikistan consists
largely of jobs that require manual work.

Workers with strong non-cognitive skills tend to supervise other people. For example,
individuals with a higher workplace attitude 28 are more likely to supervise other people’s work
(Figure 30). Similarly, being more open and sociable increases the likelihood of having contact with
people other than colleagues, such as clients, customers, or students. Women at all levels of ability
are considerably less likely to supervise others’ work than men.

3       Skill Formation over the Life Cycle

This section assesses skill formation coupled with educational attainment levels in
Tajikistan. Specifically, it addresses the following question: does the education and training system
impart the cognitive and non-cognitive skills needed to successfully participate in Tajikistan’s labor
market? The details ensue, but the four main findings on the role of the education system show a
mixed record. To summarize, first, it is important to underscore that skills are formed throughout an
individual’s life cycle. Different skills are developed during different stages in the life cycle and a host
of actors are involved—from families to formal schooling, to adult training, to employers. Second,
although general educational completion rates are relatively high, preschool and vocational coverage
rates fall short. Third, workers with higher educational attainment generally have higher cognitive and
non-cognitive skills. Yet, there is considerable variation across workers in cognitive and non-
cognitive skills despite identical educational attainment levels. Such significant variation in cognitive
and non-cognitive skills within educational attainment levels raises questions about the quality of
education in Tajikistan.


3.1     Skills are formed throughout the life cycle

Skills are developed throughout all stages of life—from conception to preschool, primary,
secondary, higher education, and on the job—and there are sensitive and critical
development periods for each type of skill. Recent evidence suggests that the most sensitive and
critical moments for skill-building differ by skill type; these “malleable” periods are depicted in green
in Figure 31. Because cognitive and behavioral skills are formed earlier on in life, the early childhood
period is critical in the development of these skills. This stage marks the first step of skill-building,
and it can be particularly critical in closing the gap between children from poorer and better-off
households. In fact, there are strong indications that the most critical moment for cognitive skill-
building is before a child turns 5. By ages 8 to 10, the foundations of an individual’s cognitive abilities
are well set. Technical skills are developed later—they are continuously developed throughout
adolescence and into adulthood. 29

The development of solid cognitive and non-cognitive skills early in life is central to building
skills needed for productive employment. Strong cognitive and behavioral skills feed into the
successful acquisition of technical skills, as solid cognitive and non-cognitive foundations will help
workers to strengthen their technical skills throughout their working lives. 30 They also determine a
person‘s readiness to learn over the life cycle by shaping the capacity and motivation to absorb new
knowledge, adapt, and solve new problems. This is crucial in a dynamic economic environment
where specific skills can be rendered obsolete. This is not to say that generic skills, particularly non-
cognitive skills, are an alternative to academic qualifications. Instead, careful attention to them is a
powerful way to improve educational attainment, life-long learning, and thus employability. 31

Over the last two decades, the literature has shifted from focusing on enrollment levels and
educational attainment to focusing on the skills obtained by students. An influential recent
study shows that educational quality—that is, ensuring that students develop valuable skills—is what
matters to achieve economic growth. 32 This section assesses cognitive and non-cognitive skill
development and outcomes in the Tajik working-age population. We begin, however, by presenting
the traditional educational attainment measures (section 3.2). The next sections discuss correlations
between educational attainment and cognitive (section 3.3) and non-cognitive (section 3.4) skills.


3.2      General educational completion rates are high, but preschool and vocational
         coverage rates fall short

Skill formation challenges start at the youngest ages; it is alarming that a significant
percentage of Tajik children suffer from malnutrition and that preschool enrollment levels
are exceptionally low. Proper nutrition, cognitive stimulation, and nurturing care during children’s
early years have lasting positive effects for their subsequent educational attainment, amongst other
indicators. 33 Aside from early childhood skill formation, there are many other reasons to invest in
early childhood development, as illustrated in Box 6.Starting at an early age, proper nutrition is key to
building cognitive and non-cognitive fundamentals. However, in Tajikistan, 15 percent of all children
under the age of five suffer from malnutrition. 34 In addition, moderate and severe stunting is
prevalent, affecting 39 percent of all children under the age of five. 35 In terms of schooling,
preschool enrollment is exceptionally low in Tajikistan (Figure 32). Less than one percent of all
children under 3 years old are participating in preschool, compared to approximately 30 percent in
the average OECD country. More striking is that even in the 3- to 5-year-old cohort, only 6 percent

of children are in preschool, which falls far below the average in comparator countries. In the
Republic of Korea, for example, almost 80 percent of 3- to 5-year-olds are enrolled in preschool
programs and in Poland almost half of all 3- to 5-year-olds are enrolled in preschool programs.
Qualitative study results suggest that there are not enough preschool facilities in Tajikistan. 36 In
particular, women suggested that most of the preschool facilities are located in urban areas and
capacity is limited.

Box 6: Early childhood development (ECD) investments can promote social equity and
       have positive externalities

Aside from promoting skills development at the early childhood stage, investments in ECD can
contribute to social equity by reducing the intergenerational transmission of poverty. The family
environment is crucial to any child’s development of skills and abilities, but poor children frequently do not
have access to the resources enjoyed by their wealthier peers. This disparity leads to the emergence of
performance gaps between children from different socioeconomic backgrounds and the widening of these gaps
as the children grow older (Paxson and Schedy, 2007). By using public resources to create a supportive
environment for the most disadvantaged children, ECD programs can make up for some early family
differences. Research has convincingly shown that early childhood interventions can equalize opportunities for
children and reduce the intergenerational transmission of poverty and inequality (Heckman, 2006).

Provision of ECD services has positive externalities, including increased female labor supply. ECD
interventions that also provide childcare can free household members to participate in other productive
activities such as education or employment. For example, the expansion of Argentina’s pre-school programs
increased maternal employment by about 7 to 14 percent. 37 In this way, ECD can create win-win situations
whereby there is an immediate payoff in the form of an increase in female labor force participation and a
longer-term return in the form of a healthier, more educated workforce.

While education completion rates are relatively high at the secondary level, an increasing
share of people, women in particular, are not completing secondary general schooling. The
education system in Europe and Central Asia was well-regarded prior to the transition, due to the
Soviet system’s emphasis on equalizing the population’s access to education (an overview of the
education system in Tajikistan can be found in Appendix D: The Education System in Tajikistan). 38
Tajikistan’s achievement in terms of access to general education remains strong: educational
enrollment is high at the secondary general level. The proportion of adults (25 years and older) who
have attained at least a secondary level education is approximately 80 percent (Figure 33). Note that
this is due to national compulsory education requirements. Worryingly, however, the share of
individuals who have dropped out of school before completing secondary general has increased
among younger cohorts. The share of men and women with less than a secondary level of
educational attainment is more than twice as high among 25- to 34-year-olds compared to 40- to 54-
year-olds. In addition to the results presented, Appendix E: Summary Tables contains more detailed
results on educational attainment in Tajikistan among the working age population.

Vocational degree completion is low and decreasing in Tajikistan. Vocational education in
Tajikistan includes a secondary technical and secondary special degree. Prior to the transition, the
share of individuals who obtained such a degree was approximately 30 percent among men and 12
percent among women. This share has dropped considerably in recent decades, and only
approximately 6 percent of young men and women aged 25–34 have completed a secondary technical
or secondary special degree (Figure 33). In many countries, vocation graduates have employment
gains at youth, but those gains may be offset at older ages due to less adaptability and difficulties
transitioning between jobs. 39 As a result, there are many instances in which vocational education can
remain a small part of an educational system, while the emphasis can be on more adaptable skill
development.

Higher education attainment levels are on par with those in countries with similar levels of
development, although the average enrollment rates among women are relatively low. As the
economy in Tajikistan shifts away from agriculture and manufacturing and toward the services sector
(see 1.3), labor demand is moving away from lower skilled jobs and toward higher skilled jobs (see
section 2.1). Tajikistan’s gross higher education attainment rate is comparable to other countries with
similar levels of GDP per capita, at approximately 13 percent. The largest discrepancy is found
among Tajik women—only 8 percent of Tajik women complete higher education. Moreover, while
higher education completion has increased among men in the last decades, it has remained constant
and low among women (Figure 33). Higher education completion rates are greater in urban areas (36
percent among men and 18 percent among women), compared to rural areas (15 percent among men
and 3 percent among women).

Education completion is correlated with wealth. The higher education completion rate is nearly
three times greater among men belonging to households in the richest per capita consumption
quintile (33 percent), compared to men belonging to the poorest quintile (12 percent). Among
women, this ratio is five to one. In households in the poorest quintile, approximately one-third of all
men and women have not completed secondary education, compared to just 8 percent of men and
20 percent of women in households in the richest quintile (Figure 34). Education completion is
higher among all levels of education for those individuals belonging to wealthier households. This
finding implies that either education pays off or, alternatively, that those who are richer have better
access to higher education than those who are poorer.

Students from better-off families are more likely to enroll in higher education than poorer
students. In fact, two out of three students currently enrolled in higher education belong to
households in the top two consumption quintiles (Figure 35). Conversely, only one in twenty
students from the poorest consumption quintile are enrolled in higher education. This suggests that
there may be individuals who, despite having high cognitive ability, are unable to pursue higher

education because they belong to low-income households. There is evidence that financial barriers
and weak governance play a key role in accessing education. A study on informal payments in general
education reveals that among parents, 37 percent believe that informal payments are “necessary for
higher educational attainment.” Students reportedly can pay thousands of dollars to access more
prestigious universities while less prestigious universities require hundreds of dollars. 40

Learning does not end upon graduation from formal education, however, and a significant
portion of skill formation takes place on the job and in adult (post-formal) training. This
includes skills acquired during learning by doing and on-the-job training. In the United States, it is
estimated that on-the-job training contributes approximately from a quarter to half of all human
capital. 41 Not surprisingly, there is an extensive body of literature documenting (albeit largely in
OECD countries) that adult education and training increases worker productivity. 42

Yet, few firms in Tajikistan offer formal training programs to full-time employees. In
Tajikistan, less than a quarter of all firms offer their full-time employees formal training programs.
This is well below the proportion of firms offering training in comparator countries in Eastern
Europe and other countries in Eurasia as well. For example, almost 70 percent of firms in the Czech
Republic and 60 percent of Polish firms offer formal training to their full-time employees (Figure 36).

required to bring productivity in line with market wages of older and low-educated workers.

3.3          While cognitive skills outcomes generally increase with educational attainment, there
             is significant variation within the different levels of education, raising questions
             about Tajikistan’s quality of education

Past studies have shown that educational attainment and cognitive ability are generally
positively correlated. This correlation exists for two reasons. First, to the extent that ability is an
innate characteristic of an individual, it can influence school choice, since more abled people face
lower costs to acquire education. 43 For this reason, people with higher cognitive ability are able to
progress through the education levels and hence, achieve higher levels of attainment. In addition,
cognitive skills can be built in particular in early stages of the life cycle (see section 3.1) through
education and training. 44

Educational attainment is also correlated with better cognitive skills. Cognitive skill outcomes
include scores on memory, literacy, and numeracy test modules (Appendix B: Constructing Cognitive
Skills Scores Methods for Scale Development and Scoring). Figure 37 shows that cognitive ability is
positively correlated with educational attainment among both working-age men and women.
Individuals with less than secondary education attainment typically score below average on all
cognitive tests, including memory, literacy, and numeracy. Meanwhile, individuals who completed
higher education typically scored above average on all cognitive skill assessments. Note that
educational attainment remains a significant determinant of these cognitive scores even after
controlling for background characteristics such as area, age, marital status, household consumption
quintile, and employment status.

There is, however, a significant variation in cognitive ability among individuals with
identical education levels, raising concerns about the education system’s quality. While, on
average, cognitive ability is positively correlated with educational attainment, it is important to note
that there is considerable heterogeneity in cognitive ability even within education levels (Figure 38).
An important caveat to mention is that part of this result is likely due to measurement error in the

                                                                                                        43
cognitive skill outcomes. In particular, the cognitive skill questions are not able to precisely
distinguish high ability individuals from very high ability individuals. Given these limitations,
however—as Figure 38 illustrates—there are individuals in the sample who have completed higher
education but have a lower cognitive ability than individuals with less than secondary education, and
vice versa. While some heterogeneity is to be expected, the degree of overlap found in these
cognitive skill distributions may suggest issues with quality and selection of the education system.

There is little data available about the quality of education in Tajikistan, but the most recent
OECD Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) results in the neighboring
country of Kazakhstan indicate that there is cause for concern. PISA participation has led a
number of countries to realize that their education systems are in great need of reform and has, in
fact, prompted policy responses. While there are several examples, Germany and Poland are good
case studies where educational reform came about following weak PISA results, thereby improving
their subsequent PISA performance. The OECD PISA captures the cognitive abilities—reading,
math, and science—of 15-year-olds and thus reflects the new generation of labor market entrants.
Both Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic participated in 2009, and both scored well below other
participating countries, such as Mexico and Turkey, both of which have comparable GNI per capita
levels.

Preschool attendance is correlated with cognitive skills later in life, even after controlling for
educational attainment. Adults that have completed at least one year in preschool as a child on
average do significantly better on cognitive skills tests—which measure memory, literacy, and
numeracy skills—than adults who did not attend preschool (Figure 39). When demographic

                                                        44
characteristics such as age, gender, marital status, geographic location, and (most importantly)
educational attainment are taken into account, having attended preschool as a child remains a
significant correlate of cognitive ability, particularly numeracy skills and, to a lesser extent, literacy
skills.

3.4                                         There is significant variation in non-cognitive skills within educational attainment
                                            levels

There is increasing evidence of a positive correlation between schooling and non-cognitive
skills; if done well, schooling can enhance non-cognitive skills of students. Several studies in
the psychology literature have shown the important role of non-cognitive skills on schooling
performance, 45 comparable to that of cognitive skills. At the same time, schooling itself is also a
determinant of non-cognitive skills in individuals. 46

Non-cognitive skills are positively correlated with schooling in Tajikistan. Non-cognitive skill
outcomes include openness/sociability, workplace attitude, decision-making, and achievement
striving (see Appendix C: Constructing Non-Cognitive Skills Scores Methods for Scale Development
and Scoring for more details). Figure 40 demonstrates that non-cognitive skill outcomes for
openness/sociability, workplace attitude, and achievement striving are, on average, significantly
higher among higher educated individuals.

However, there is also a large degree of variation in non-cognitive skills among individuals
with the same level of educational attainment. Non-cognitive skills are not always better among
higher educated individuals across the entire distribution. In fact, there are respondents with less than
a secondary education who scored higher on the non-cognitive skills measured than respondents
with a higher education. Hence, while non-cognitive skills and educational attainment are correlated

                                                                                                      46
on average, the development of non-cognitive skills in school seems to vary substantially (Figure 41).
These findings suggest that there may be variation in the extent to which non-cognitive skills are
taught in schools and the quality of such teaching, although, admittedly, families and communities
have a central role in the early development of non-cognitive skills in children, and such factors
should not be discounted.

Note: Respondents aged 25–64.

Most adult non-cognitive skills are largely unaffected by whether or not the person attended
preschool as a child. As Figure 42 shows, non-cognitive skills outcomes do not differ significantly
between adults who did and did not attend preschool as a child. The notable exception is decision
making, which is weakly negatively correlated with preschool attendance. Hence, adults who attended
preschool as a child rated themselves lower on questions such as “do you finish whatever you
begin?” and “do you think carefully before you make an important decision?” than adults who did
not attend preschool as a child. The lack of a significant positive correlation between non-cognitive
skills and preschool attendance is somewhat surprising given past findings in other countries. Hence,
one area that warrants policy reform in Tajikistan is placing more emphasis on non-cognitive skills
development in preschools.

4       The Skills Roadmap in Tajikistan

As employers in Tajikistan demand more workers with strong cognitive and non-cognitive
skills, policy makers will have to make a concerted effort to improve skills as part of their
development strategy. This report argues that skills gaps hinder labor market performance in
Tajikistan. There is a strong demand for skills in the Tajik economy, as evidenced by significant
positive labor market returns to both cognitive and non-cognitive skills. Yet considerable skills gaps
persist. A large share of employers report shortages of adequately skilled individuals in the workforce,
and workers themselves also complain about the inadequacy of their training for productive
employment. Other studies have shown that an educated workforce alone does not in itself guarantee
economic growth or job growth, but that the availability of skilled workers is key to the growth of
high skill jobs. As a result, policies and programs to up-skill current workers and better prepare
children and youth to become more productive workers in the future are an important development
strategy for Tajikistan.

A number of actors play a role in building skills throughout the life cycle of an individual,
targeting the current and future workforce to different degrees. Policies can target the future
workforce, usually by focusing on families and communities and the formal education system,
and/or the current workforce, by focusing on adult training institutions and firms. Families and
communities play an important role in skill development of the future workforce, especially during
the early years by ensuring good nutrition and stimulation, but they continue to play a role
throughout the life cycle. Formal educational institutions, beginning with pre-schools and extending
through to tertiary education, are also important for skill formation of future workers. Adult training
institutions, which include non-traditional training institutions and second-chance educational
institutions, can help to strengthen the skillsets of the current workforce. Similarly, adults derive skills
at work, either during on-the-job training programs or by learning by doing.

To meet the expected growing demand for higher-order skills in the workplace, policy
makers should therefore address skill formation across the life cycle: from conception to
preschools (or ECD more generally), in general education, in higher education, and while part of the
workforce. At all levels of education and training, a broader focus on cognitive and non-cognitive
skill formation is crucial to ensure that skills are valued today’s, as well as tomorrow’s, labor market.
A comprehensive skills development strategy is required that improves the quality and relevance of
education and training systems to ensure that they build market-valued skills.

The Skills Toward Employability and Productivity (STEP) Framework can inform the
government’s strategic vision to enhance skills in Tajikistan. The STEP framework brings
together research-based evidence and practical experience from diverse areas—from research on the
determinants of early childhood development and learning outcomes to policy experience in the
reforming of vocational and technical education systems and labor markets 47.

In Tajikistan, policy makers can boost employment outcomes through a more skilled
workforce by focusing on the following five policy goals:
   1. Getting children off to the right start by expanding access to quality early childhood
       development (ECD) programs—including nutrition, preschool—which are critical to
       ensuring that all children acquire the cognitive and non-cognitive skills that are conducive to
       high productivity and flexibility in the labor market.
   2. Ensuring that all students learn by modernizing the curricula and improving teaching quality,
       in order to strengthen the link between educational attainment and cognitive and non-
       cognitive skills.
   3. Building job-relevant skills that employers demand by implementing selective active labor
       market programs, focused particularly on expanding employment opportunities for labor
       market discouraged and the female population, and incentivizing firms to provide training.
   4. Encouraging entrepreneurship and innovation by managing the expansion of higher
       education, focusing on quality assurance, selection, and information provision, to ensure that
       higher education graduates possess market-valued skills and that investments in higher
       education pay off.
   5. Matching the supply of skills with employer demand by improving labor market information
       systems, in order to make labor markets more efficient by alleviating current constraints in
       the job search and skill signaling process.

4.1     Get children off to the right start by expanding access to quality early childhood
        development programs

Getting children off to the right start requires adequate early childhood development
programs (ECD) with an emphasis on nutrition, stimulation, and basic cognitive skills. The
formation of cognitive and non-cognitive foundations critically occurs during early childhood. This
stage marks the first step in skills building, and high-quality ECD programs have been shown to be
critical in developing the technical, cognitive, and behavioral skills conducive to high productivity and
flexibility in the work environment. Handicaps developed early in life are difficult if not impossible to
remedy later. Furthermore, the benefits of ECD generally by far outweigh the program costs. Nobel
laureate James Heckman estimates that every dollar invested in high-quality ECD programs yields a
7–10 percent return per annum, and, in fact, policies that provide ECD to disadvantaged children
have even higher returns. 48 These high rates of return are fairly consistent in the literature because
ECD, it is argued, raises the returns to investment later in life as children learn how to learn.

In Tajikistan, malnutrition rates are high and enrollment in early childhood development
(ECD) programs is exceptionally low. As demonstrated, approximately 15 percent of all children
under the age of five suffer from malnutrition and moderate and severe stunting is prevalent,
affecting 39 percent of all children under the age of five. 49 Less than one percent of all children
under the age of 3 and approximately 6 percent of all children aged 3–5 years in Tajikistan are
currently enrolled in preschool primarily due to a lack of preschool facilities in Tajikistan, especially
in rural areas. 50 This is far below the enrollment levels in comparator countries in Central Asia and
globally.

Hence, to ensure that future cohorts of labor market entrants have strong cognitive and non-
cognitive skills foundations, policy makers should continue prioritizing the expansion of the
coverage and improve the quality of ECD programs in Tajikistan. More resources could be
directed toward investments and interventions in skill formation during critical development periods
in a person’s life, when cognitive and non-cognitive skills are most malleable. Since skills
development is a cumulative process, and given low current levels of ECD enrollment in Tajikistan,
increased access to quality ECD programs could have a considerable impact on cognitive and non-
cognitive, as well as technical, skill development of the future workforce. Increasing access to ECD
within Tajikistan could also assist in ensuring that young children’s nutrition needs are met and that
developmental skills are nurtured. The government has already started investing in an expansion of
preschool education with support from Global Partnership for Education (GPE) and other donor-
funded projects, and should continue investing in this cost-effective activity.

4.2         Ensure that all students learn by modernizing the curricula and improving teaching
            quality

To ensure that all students learn, policy makers can focus on building stronger general
education systems with clear learning standards, good teachers, adequate resources, and a proper
regulatory environment. The continued development of foundational cognitive skills—reading,
numeracy, and writing—and non-cognitive skills throughout childhood is key for a person’s capacity
to learn, discover, and innovate throughout life. Schooling plays an important role in ensuring that
students acquire the skills and abilities that are valued by employers and that are useful for self-
employment.

While enrollment in general education and higher education is strong, the education system
in Tajikistan is not developing market-valued skills to full potential. Access to primary and
basic education is universal in Tajikistan, and higher education coverage also compares favorably
with countries at similar levels of development. However, significant improvements can be made in
the education system in both cognitive and non-cognitive skills development. Although, on average,
cognitive and non-cognitive skills are better in higher educated individuals, there is a large degree of
variation in skills outcomes even among individuals with the same level of education. These findings
likely reflect issues of quality and selection in the education system.

Tajikistan can strengthen the link between educational attainment and cognitive and non-
cognitive skills by developing the school curricula and improving teaching quality. There is a
large body of research and emerging consensus that interventions can be implemented to support
skills development during distinct life stages. In a number of countries, non-cognitive skill
interventions have been integrated into the academic curriculum. The empirical evidence for
Tajikistan clearly shows that stronger cognitive and non-cognitive skills enable workers to obtain
better jobs. Therefore, to improve labor market outcomes for future generations in Tajikistan,
workers need to acquire better cognitive and non-cognitive skills, including problem-solving, critical
thinking, communication, and team player skills.

Mainstreaming non-cognitive learning in the education system can strengthen the formation
of such skills in the future workforce. An increasing number of countries worldwide have
integrated non-cognitive learning into the regular school curriculum by training teachers, adopting a
structured curriculum, evaluating students, and investing in efforts to improve the school climate.
Schools provide an ideal environment for early cognitive and non-cognitive skills development, given
that children are typically in a single classroom with a single teacher and the same group of peers for
an entire school year. This “single point of entry” reduces the costs of interventions and increases the
likelihood of a positive impact on skills development. There is a wide range of international
experience from which to draw lessons related to mainstreaming non-cognitive learning in the
education system. For example, some countries have implemented national legislation to promote
non-cognitive skill building in schools, including Australia, Colombia, Romania, Spain, and the
United Kingdom. 51

                                                  53
4.3     Build job-relevant skills that employers demand by implementing labor market
        programs

To build job-relevant skills that employers demand in the current workforce, policy makers
can develop the right incentive framework for labor market programs (LMPs) and on-the-job
training (OTJ) programs. Although strong cognitive and non-cognitive skill foundations are critical
for workers to develop and use skills on the job, specific job-relevant skills are typically acquired
while in the workforce. Shortages of such skills can pose considerable constraints to workers’
employability. Similarly, a shortage of crucial skills can prevent firms from performing to their full
potential.

There are considerable skills gaps between the employed and inactive populations in
Tajikistan. While job creation has kept pace with the country’s rapid population growth in the last
decade, a large share of the working-age population remains out of the workforce. This is especially
the case for women and youth. Adults who are out of work scored significantly lower on both
cognitive and non-cognitive skills assessments than the employed population.

Labor market programs (LMPs) that address labor market information asymmetry, job
searching skills, and technical or job-specific skills gaps can boost the employment rates in
Tajikistan. LMPs can include job placement assistance services, counseling with employment
advisors, job application and interview preparation, CV composition, informational interviews, and
in-depth assessment of skills and abilities. One element in common is that all LMPs are designed to
encourage the unemployed, discouraged, and inactive populations to more actively seek jobs, thereby
improving their prospects for employment. Countries offer a menu of LMPs including training
programs, public works projects, employment subsidies, and matching workers and jobs through
intermediation services. As with any program, its efficacy should be evaluated.

Cognitive and non-cognitive skills are particularly low among workers in the private sector,
Tajikistan can also benefit from addressing market failures that prevent firms from providing
on-the-job training (OJT) and incentivizing them to do so. OJT is an important channel
through which workers upgrade skills during their time at work. It is also a vehicle that can help firms
adopt new technologies and improved business practices. In Tajikistan, less than a quarter of all firms
offer their full-time employees formal training programs. This is a lower proportion than most
countries in Europe and Central Asia. In Europe, OJT is far more common. For example, almost 70
percent of firms in the Czech Republic offer formal training to their full-time employees; 60 percent
of Polish firms do so; and 54 percent of Lithuanian firms do the same. Identifying the reasons for the
varying levels of OJT in each country context is a prerequisite for designing effective policy
responses. Tajikistan must design policies that strive to support firms that, despite positive expected
returns, do not train their workers. To encourage the implementation of LMPs, policy makers have
several instruments at their disposal, such as credit and subsidy programs or tax grants that can be
used to deal with liquidity constraints and incentivize training. These types of programs have been
used successfully in a number of countries in Western Europe and Eastern Asia.

Similarly, improving migrant skills increases their earning capacity, and therefore their
ability to support their families in Tajikistan. To do so, policy makers can introduce pre-

                                                  54
departure training programs for migrants to ensure that they have the basic language skills and
knowledge of social services provision and migrant protection programs. The Philippines, for
example, carries out pre-departure reviews and approvals of contract terms, in addition to providing
a mandatory pre-departure orientation. Furthermore, in order to help migrants secure better jobs
abroad, it is important that existing skills are appropriately recognized and valued. Enhancements to
the existing migrant job placement system, including better registration and pre-selection assessment,
could help avoid the “brain waste” that often impacts mid-skilled workers, devaluing not only their
skills while abroad, but also the benefits of the international migration experience for both the
individual workers and Tajikistan.

Education and labor market reforms—such as public-private partnerships on business-
friendly curriculum development, support for on-the-job training and apprenticeship
programs, and improved labor market diagnostics—can also benefit international migrants.
Such programs could increase Tajik migrants’ ability to apply their skills abroad by making skills
more visible to employers. This would in turn enable them to expand their skills abroad, which could
then be absorbed into the domestic market upon their return, resulting in productivity and wage
improvements at home. This is particularly important given the large number of migrant workers in
sectors such as construction and those with secondary or technical education, and the fact that mid-
skilled workers are often at the highest risk of brain waste. 52

To improve the link between migrants’ skills and labor market needs abroad, the quality of
workers’ skills, and the visibility of those skills, the government of Tajikistan could pursue a
three-pronged strategy. First, develop partnerships with Ministries of Labor and business leaders in
key destination countries and sectors to identify skills needs and raise the profile of Tajik laborers.
Second, conduct labor market diagnostics to identify sectors with demand for laborers, both
domestically and abroad. And third, invest in improved vocational and technical training programs.


4.4        Encourage entrepreneurship and innovation by increasing the quality of higher
           education

To encourage entrepreneurship and innovation, policy makers could increase the quality of
higher education. As the Tajik economy further develops, high-skilled graduates from universities
are likely to become a more important group of labor market entrants. Within the context of
Tajikistan’s modernization strategy, the demand for non-routine skills is likely to increase, as
observed in other middle- and high-income countries. While enrollment rates in higher education are
currently favorable, quality concerns persist. More specifically, skill outcomes reveal that there is a
large share of individuals in Tajikistan who gained a higher education degree but had lower cognitive
and non-cognitive scores relative to individuals who have not finished their secondary general
education.

To ensure quality at the college and university level, measuring the skills produced is
important. The development of an independent quality assurance agency is critical for a modern
higher education system. In addition, individual institutions of higher education should perform

“internal” quality assurance through so-called Quality Enhancement Cells based partly on self-
assessments and peer reviews by other higher education institutions.

There is also a need to better equip college and university graduates with market-relevant
skills. Several steps are required to achieve this goal. First, regular and independent market surveys
should monitor the skills requirements in the labor market. Second, partnerships with both domestic
and foreign academic institutions (research partnerships, faculty exchanges, and training) as well as
with domestic and foreign industry (modernizing curricula, laboratories, innovation platforms,
research, and joint business development) can help strengthen the links between higher education
institutions and the labor market. Third, more generally, ensuring high-quality equipment in relevant
and priority technical fields, together with modern curricula, trained faculty and staff, and related
university-industry linkages is crucial.

Merit-based admission to higher education programs is another key priority for the
government of Tajikistan. As shown, approximately 40 percent of students currently enrolled in
higher education belong to households in the top consumption quintile. This may occur for various
reasons, including the importance of parental background for educational achievement and/or
financial barriers. For the first year in 2014, high school students took a unified university entrance
exam, which is a reform by the government aimed at improving fairness and transparency in access
to universities. In addition, the reform is expected to help ensure that state funding is allocated in a
more transparent and fair manner to students using a merit-based system. 53 If implemented
successfully, the reform will be an important accomplishment in Tajikistan.


4.5      Match the supply of skills with employer demand by improving labor market
         information systems

To match the supply of skills with employer demand, labor market information systems are
needed that will ease the transition from school to work. In Tajikistan, more than two-thirds of
all survey respondents (68 percent) indicated that they face significant constraints in learning about
job vacancies. The problems caused by asymmetric information between job seekers and employers
are far-reaching because they affect students’ educational choices, firms’ selection of workers, and the
time it takes to fill vacancies. 54 In other words, poor labor market information flows hinder the
efficient allocation of resources in a country. Improving the flow of labor market information in
Tajikistan will be particularly helpful for youth and first-time job-seekers.

A number of modernizing countries have successfully implemented labor market
information systems designed to dismantle planned manpower education structures. In
Poland, for example, employment observatories were introduced to provide information on job
availability, wages, career prospects, and hiring expectations. 55 Employment observatories have also
been established in Chile and Colombia. The rationale behind employment observatories is that
information about major industries, recent growth areas, occupations experiencing shortages,

qualifications needed for jobs, and so on, can help people make better-informed choices about their
education and careers. Access to this type of information is routine in the United States, the EU
countries, and Australia. A number of emerging countries are also beginning to expand their labor
market information systems.

Employment observatories use a rich array of data to monitor and disseminate information
about the labor market. The data managed by employment observatories include: (1) administrative
data from public employment offices on unemployment, vacancies, and active labor market
programs; (2) data from the national statistics office including labor force survey and household
survey information, usually disaggregated by region; and (3) data from special-topic surveys (usually
“sociological”). Employment observatories use multi-media to disseminate information, ranging
from traditional paper-based information to YouTube videos and text/SMS messaging. The
information is disseminated at irregular intervals, dictated by the speed with which the information is
processed.

Background and Measures

Data for this study come from a 34-item survey module designed for use by the World Bank to
assess five different “cognitive” skills. These cognitive skills can be conceptualized as falling into two
domains:
    (1) Executive functioning skills, defined as the cognitive control capacities that enable individuals to
         “organize their thinking and behavior with flexibility, decrease their reactive responding to
         contextual cues and contingencies, and engage in self-regulated … behavior” (Welsh et al.,
         2010). Researchers in developmental psychology and elsewhere propose that such skills are
         important for school readiness and labor force attainment since they enable individuals to
         regulate cognitive and emotional responses that in turn allow individuals to engage more
         effectively in learning activities (Fuchs et al., 2005). We assessed one component of executive
         functioning—working memory—using a 12-item memory scale adopted from the Skills and
         Labor Market Survey (ENHAB) 56. These items tested the short-term recall of increasingly
         longer number sequences (starting with two numbers and ending with 9 numbers).
         Enumerators gave respondents three practice examples with two-number sequences to train
         the respondents on how to answer the questions, and were instructed to read out numbers at
         a regular pace to avoid grouping.
    (2) Domain-specific skills, consisting of “knowledge of ideas, facts and definitions, as well as …
         formulas and rules” (Boekarts, 1997, p. 164) about specific domains such as literacy and
         numeracy. In turn, each broader domain can be conceptualized as including other branches;
         mathematics, for example, includes concepts such as number recognition, arithmetic, and
         graph comprehension (Fuchs et al., 2005; Pinker, 1990). In this study, we assessed various
         concepts within the domains of literacy and numeracy using multiple-choice questions with
         four answer choices. Within literacy, these concepts include: (1) semantics, assessed using
         seven items, with five items assessing respondents’ familiarity with vocabulary, one item
         testing understanding of a national idiom, and one item measuring comprehension of the
         meaning of a complex sentence; 57 (2) reading comprehension, assessed by asking respondents to
         read a 257-word non-technical narrative text and then answering five questions about the
         text; and (3) information comprehension, assessed using four items based on instructions for
         taking a medicine and reading a timetable describing inter-city bus schedules. Within
         numeracy, concepts include: (1) arithmetic, assessed using three questions about prices in an
         advertisement; and (2) graph comprehension, assessed using three questions based on a graph of


56 The ENHAB is a recent survey in Peru which gathers data on cognitive and socio-emotional test scores,
individual’s characteristics, educational trajectory, and wages.
57 An issue with translation of the items comprising the semantics scale rendered the data from this set of items

unusable. The semantics scale was thus not considered for analysis, leaving the total number of assessed skills
at five.

         Bulgaria’s population growth from 1900 to 2011. The items assessing reading
         comprehension and semantics were taken from existing instruments fielded by the World
         Bank with Bulgarian students, while the items assessing mathematics and information
         comprehension were adapted from the Adult Literacy and Lifeskills Survey (Murray,
         Clermont, & Binkley, 2005).

These domains are not meant to be exhaustive, but to serve as useful heuristics. Moreover, executive
functioning skills and domain-specific skills are related: A number of recent studies provide evidence
that executive functioning skills such as working memory actually contribute to the development of
literacy and numeracy skills (Blair & Razza, 2010; Swanson, Jerman, & Zheng. 2008). From a policy
perspective, this suggests that educators should focus on the promotion of both executive functioning
and domain-specific skills, particularly in the pre-school and elementary school years when such
functions are most malleable to intervention (Welsh et al., 2010).

Analysis Strategy

All missing values were recoded as incorrect answers, resulting in a set of 33 dichotomous or binary
items. 58 In choosing how to score the items, we were motivated by a primary concern of reducing
the measurement error in each score. That is, when we administer a survey measure or test, we want
to ensure that the variability in scores is due to what we are trying to measure—in this study,
executive functioning or domain-specific skills—as opposed to error or bias. Traditional or unrefined
methods of scoring—such as summing the survey items—do not account for this measurement
error, leading to bias in future regression analyses (for more information, see Box C1, “What is
Factor Analysis and Why do We Use It?” in Appendix C). Refined scoring methods that account for
measurement error include the production of factor scores using factor analysis or item response
theory (IRT) methods.

Box B1: What is Item Response Theory and When Can We Use It?

Item Response Theory (IRT) is an approach, or family of statistical models, used to analyze
assessment item data, such as cognitive skills assessment data. Several IRT models have been
developed to estimate ability or person parameters that are scored either dichotomously (i.e. only two
response categories) or polytomously (i.e. more than two response categories; Hambleton,
Swaminathan, & Rogers, 1991). Traditionally, IRT has been used for educational applications for
Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT), test score equating, item analysis, and test banking. However,
due to the advantages of IRT, other disciplines have recently developed an interest in using IRT for
scoring, validation, and other psychometric analyses (Reise & Henson, 2003).




58Ideally, we would be able to identify four, not two, sets of responses: answered correctly; answered
incorrectly; not answered and didn’t know; and not answered due to time constraints or motivation but known.
While such codes were initially included in the survey instrument, issues with data processing rendered such
codes unusable. We were thus forced to collapse the codes into a dichotomous response: correct or incorrect.
The implications of this choice are discussed further in the Implications and Future Directions section.

                                                     66
There are two over-arching families of item response models which differ greatly in theoretical and
mathematical background and analysis. The first of the two families, the logistic models, relate
examinee ability (θ) and item parameters using logistic functions. The logistic family of IRT models
allow for the estimation of up to three item parameters, or characteristics. The one-parameter (1PL)
model is the most basic and involves, as the name states, only one item parameter: the b-parameter is
included in every IRT model and is considered the difficulty parameter (Yen & Fitzpatrick, 2006).
The b-parameter is at the point on the θ scale where the probability of a correct response is equal to
0.50 and typically varies from -2.00 to 2.00 (Hambleton et al., 1991; Yen & Fitzpatick, 2006),
increasing as items become more difficult. The two-parameter model (2PL) includes a second item
parameter, the discrimination parameter, a. a is the slope of the item characteristic curve (ICC) at the
point of inflection and the higher the value of a, the more sharp the discrimination (Yen &
Fitzpatrick, 2006). Finally, the three-parameter model (3PL) includes the c-parameter, called the
guessing or pseudo-chance parameter. This parameter was introduced to account for the possibility
that even students with low ability have some chance of answering even difficult questions correctly.
This parameter is not always necessary, and if set to zero, equates the 3PL with the 2PL (Yen &
Fitzpatrick, 2006).

One of the big advantages of using IRT is that the ability or person parameters (θ) are not item or
test dependent, and item and test characteristics are not dependent on the ability or person
parameters. This is called the property of invariance (Hambleton et al., 1991; Lord, 1980). It means that
the test and item parameters remain the same regardless of the sample of respondents, and the ability
or person parameters do not vary depending on the test items administered or the time of test,
provided the items are relevant to and representative of the same domain of interest.

Although there are clear benefits to the invariance property, there are two integral assumptions of
IRT. First, there is an assumption regarding the dimensionality of the underlying ability or trait. While
there are multi-dimensional IRT models (MIRT), the traditional IRT model requires that a single trait
or ability accounts for an individual’s θ score. When this assumption of the data holds, the examinees
can be placed along a single, meaningful scale (Hambleton et al., 1991). Second, there is the
assumption of local item independence. When the items on an assessment are locally independent, a
response to any item is independent of a response to any other item on the same assessment for a
given individual. This assumption allows us to determine the probability of an individual response
pattern occurring given the individual’s ability or trait level (Hambleton et al., 1991; Lord, 1980). If
either of these assumptions is not met, item and person parameters will not be properly estimated
and thus, indefensible.

In addition to these assumptions, an assessment of model-data fit is also important in IRT. A poorly
specified model creates problems with estimating both item parameters and θ scores. Consider the
following: An analyst mistakenly specifies a model which only specifies two parameters when in fact
the data fit a model consisting of three item parameters. Because the pseudo-guessing parameter has
not been specified, the θ values may be over-estimated as the individual’s ability to correctly guess the
answer has not been taken into consideration. Guessing is not considered to be included in ability
and, as such, it should not be allowed to unduly influence scores. While IRT provides distinct
advantages to classical methods of analyzing assessment data, these advantages come with several
very restrictive assumptions which, if violated, calls into question the validity of the results.

                                                   67
In order to assess whether it was appropriate to employ an IRT model with this data, we decided to
first empirically determine the dimensionality of the items by conducting an exploratory factor
analysis (EFA) with an oblimax rotation on a randomly selected half of participants stratified by
country (N = 3,965). 59 Should a one-factor model provide a good fit to the data, we would be able
to proceed with IRT analyses. Should a multi-factor model provide a good fit to the data, the
dimensionality assumption required by IRT methodologies would be violated. In that case, we
proceed by examining the results of the EFA and confirming the factor structure using the second
half of the sample (N = 3,964). All analyses were conducted in MPlus (Muthén & Muthén, 1998-
2012; Version 6.12) and adjusted for any clustering of the data due to sampling design. 60 Responses
were treated as ordered categorical data to account for the skewed nature of the data.

Once we determined a factor structure that provided a good fit to the data, we created individual
scores on each of these factors using refined factor scoring techniques. As detailed above, factor
scoring is preferable in this case to traditional sum scoring methods given that factor scores account
for: (1) the weight of individual item loadings; and (2) shared variance between the items and the
factors and measurement error (DiStephano, Zhu, & Midrila, 2009). Factor scores were created using
maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation in MPLUS, which accounts for the non-normal distribution
of item response (Muthén & Muthén, 1998-2012).

Results

The initial EFA indicated that a one-factor model did not provide a good fit to the data (χ2 (324) =
8981.68, CFI: .888, RMSEA: .082, .081 < 95% CI < .084). 61 Thus we decided that it was not feasible
to proceed with an IRT analysis due to the plausibility of violating the dimensionality assumption. In
examining the factor loadings, we noted that the 12 items making up the original construct of
working memory loaded cleanly onto one factor. This factor was left intact and removed from the
exploratory analyses. We then chose a 2-factor solution to model associations between the remaining
15 items. This model provided a good fit to the data (χ2 (76) = 1261.15, CFI=.951,
RMSEA=.063, .060 < 95% CI < .066) while modeling the observed indicators parsimoniously.

A confirmatory factor analysis then confirmed the fit of a 3-factor model for all 27 items in which
factors were allowed to correlate (χ2 (321) = 3128.37, CFI=.981, RMSEA=.033, .032 < 95% CI
< .034). 62 The three identified factors described in Table 1, below, were: (1) Working Memory (12
items); (2) Reading Comprehension (5 items); and (3) Informational Numeracy (10 items). In
addition, preliminary measurement equivalence analyses indicate that this same factor structure

59 An oblimax rotation was chosen to account for the hypothesized correlation between factors.
60 In Tajikistan—but not in Uzbekistan or Kyrgyzstan—up to two individuals per household were administered
the non-cognitive skills module. To account for any non-independence of the data that may occur due to
individuals being nested in households, we used the Type=Complex and Cluster=psuid commands in MPlus.
61 In assessing model goodness of fit, the following criteria are used: A RMSEA < .08 provides an acceptable fit

to the data, while an RMSEA < .05 provides a good fit to the data; a CFI > .9 provides an acceptable fit to the
data while a CFI > .95 provides a good fit to the data (Kline, 2011).
62 Factor correlations in the CFA were: Working Memory-Literacy (r=.428, p<.001), Working Memory-

Informational Numeracy (r=.480, p<.001), and Literacy-Informational Numeracy (r=.69, p<.001).

CFI=.953, RMSEA=.061, .060 < 95% CI < .062). 63 Finally, given the high correlation between the
literacy and informational numeracy items, initial analyses were also conducted to determine whether
a higher-order “cognitive” factor may account for the covariation between factors (Cattell, 1978). 64
This model was uninterpretable due to factor loadings above 1.

63 Tests of measurement invariance seek to establish whether we are measuring the same construct in the same
way across different groups. As of this writing, our preliminary analyses have established configural invariance: that
the same factor structure (e.g., the same number of factors and the same pattern of loadings) exists in the
samples from all three countries. Future analyses will examine other levels of invariance, establishment of
which increases our certainty that observed differences between countries is attributable only to true
differences in the variability of the scores.
64 For over a century, researchers have been interested in defining and measuring an overall measure of

cognitive ability, or “g” factor (Jensen, 1998; Heckman, Stixrud, & Urzua, 2006). It is beyond the scope of this
paper to comment extensively on such research; however, as developmental psychologists with an interest in
applying research to policy, we take the position that it is useful to identify and understand the components of
cognitive ability to better design programs to support the development of such skills.

Interpretation and Future Directions

Our analyses indicated that the data from the cognitive skills module is best represented by three
related factors that correspond to some—but not all—of the five cognitive skills described above.
For example, our analyses indicated items 1-12 all indexed the hypothesized underlying executive
functioning skill of Working Memory, while items 13-17 corresponded to the hypothesized
underlying domain-specific skill of Reading Comprehension. Substantively, this indicates that
individuals that have higher Working Memory factor scores are better able to temporarily store and
manipulate information that is necessary for domain-specific cognitive tasks such as reading
comprehension (Baddeley, 1992). Individuals with higher Reading Comprehension scores have a
better ability to read and process text and understand its meaning than individuals with lower
Reading Comprehension scores (National Reading Panel, 2000).

The other factor represented in the data is a combination of items meant to index facets of both
Literacy (items 18–21) and Numeracy (items 22–27). This pattern of relationships can be understood
in that the Information Comprehension items all involved number recognition (a component of
numeracy), while the Numeracy items all tapped the ability to locate and use information contained
in various formats such as advertisements and graphs (a component of information comprehension).
Individuals who score highly on Informational Numeracy have the ability to recognize and
manipulate numbers contained in and represented by various formats.

There are three things to consider when interpreting the above analysis. First, the factor scores
created through the factor analysis procedures described above are not invariant across different tests
assessing cognitive ability. While such scores could have resulted from using IRT methodologies, we
have evidence that using IRT with this cognitive assessment is not defensible given the likely
violation of the assumption of dimensionality and as a result, item dependence. As such, we
proceeded with creating refined factor scores that—although they do not inherently have the
property of invariance—reduce the amount of measurement error contained in the scores. It should
be noted, however, that invariance is a property that can be assessed through the use of factor
analytic methods. Second, many of the items included in the cognitive skills assessment are not
“clean” items. That is, they assess more than one skill at the same time: Items meant to tap the
construct of Arithmetic, for example, also involve elements of reading comprehension and
information comprehension. The factors—particularly Reading Comprehension and Information
Numeracy—are thus highly correlated, which may be problematic for establishing predictive validity.
To address this, we recommend that future analyses with this data consider a bi-factor analysis in
which orthogonal or non-correlated grouping factors are created by allowing a “general” trait to


                                                  70
correlate with the items (Reise, Moore, & Haviland, 2010). Finally, as noted in footnote 2, we were
limited in our ability to discriminate between correct, incorrect, and missing answers due to issues in
data processing. Given that missing answers were all recoded to be incorrect, it is likely that the
scores underestimate the cognitive ability level present in the sample population. To address this, we
recommend that future data collection activities carefully assess the type and extent of missing data
to allow for better sensitivity tests of results to such specifications.

Appendix C: Constructing Non-Cognitive Skills Scores Methods for Scale
Development and Scoring

Prepared by Carly Tubbs, Ph.D. Candidate, New York University

Background and Measures

Data for this study come from a 33-item survey module designed for use by the World Bank to
assess 11 different “non-cognitive” skills (see Table B1, below; Duckworth and Guerra, 2012). These
non-cognitive skills can be conceptualized as falling into two domains:

Personality traits, defined as enduring patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving which are relatively
stable across time and situations (Borghans, Duckworth, Heckman, and ter Weel, 2008; Paunonen,
2003). The “Big Five” factors of personality—openness, conscientiousness, extraversion,
agreeableness, and neuroticism (or emotional stability)—are the most widely accepted taxonomy of
broad personality traits (Goldberg, 1990), having been validated for use across developmental stages
(John and Srivastava, 1999) and cultures (Soto, John, Gosling, and Potter, 2008). The survey assessed
each of these five factors with three items in the short Big Five Inventory (BFI-S) originally
developed by John and Srivastava (1999) and later validated in large-scale panel surveys (Lang et al.,
2011). Given its association with important labor market outcomes, assessed grit—a component of
conscientiousness—was also assessed, with three items from the Grit Scale (Duckworth et al., 2007).

Socio-emotional skills, defined as the learned knowledge, attitudes, and skills necessary to understand
and manage emotions, set and achieve positive goals, establish and maintain positive relationships,
and make responsible decisions (CASEL, 2014). Although different cultures may differentially name,
conceptualize, and prioritize such skills, socio-emotional skills and learning are of critical importance
across all regions of the world (Torrente, Alimchandani, and Aber, in press). There does not
currently exist an organization of socio-emotional skills similar to that developed for personality
traits; as such, this survey measures socio-emotional skills that are both valued by employers in
countries in Europe and Central Asia (World Bank, 2009, 2013) and amenable to intervention efforts
(Yeager and Dweck, 2012). These skills include: hostile bias (2 items; Dodge, 2003), decision making
(4 items; Mann, Burnett, Radford, and Ford, 1997), achievement striving, and self-control (3 items
and 2 items, respectively; Goldberg et al., 2006). In addition, the fixed vs. growth mindset, or the
belief that intelligence is fixed versus malleable, was measured (4 items; Yeager and Dweck, 2012).

These domains are not meant to be exhaustive, but to serve as useful heuristics. Moreover,
personality traits and socio-emotional skills are related: individuals with certain personality traits may
tend to employ certain socio-emotional skills (McAdams, 1995). For program and policy purposes,
however, there is a key distinction between personality traits and socio-emotional skills: while
personality traits are predictive of labor market outcomes, they are less amenable to direct change via
intervention. Socio-emotional skills, however, have been shown to be malleable to various
intervention efforts across cultures (e.g., Jones, Brown, and Aber, 2011; Torrente et al., 2014). In
turn, building socio-emotional skills can result in changes to enduring patterns of thinking and
behaving (Dweck, 2008).

Analysis Strategy

Our initial analyses revealed three main issues with the data. First, correlations between items in the
same groupings (e.g., openness, grit) were low—generally ranging from .2 to .4—suggesting that each
item is measuring a different facet of the grouping. Second, sum-scoring items according to the 11
hypothesized constructs and computing reliability coefficients indicated the scores were composed of
a significant degree of measurement error. Third, the distribution of item responses across the Likert
scales deviated substantially from normality, invalidating the assumptions inherent in traditional
statistical measurement techniques. To address these issues, factor analyses were conducted in a
multi-step process.


Box C1: What is Factor Analysis and Why Do We Use it?

Factor analysis is a statistical technique that can be used to examine the relationship between
observed items or indicators (see Table B1, above) and unobserved latent constructs or factors that are
hypothesized to underlie the associations between indicators (in this study, openness,
conscientiousness, etc.). There are three primary goals of or reasons to use factor analysis: (1) data
reduction; (2) scale structure; and (3) to reduce measurement error. First, survey instruments provide
a lot of data—some surveys to assess adult personality factors include over 500 items. Not only is it
not practical to analyze that much data, but testing effects on multiple discrete indicators increases
the likelihood of having a “false positive,” or Type I error. Factor analysis assists with data reduction
by establishing a lesser number of factors that account for the variation between indicators. Second,
surveys are frequently designed to capture multiple constructs (in our study, various personality traits
and socio-emotional skills) using items that may relate more strongly to some constructs than others.
For example, in our study, the item “Do you think about how the things you do will affect your

                                                        75
future?” may be a better indicator of Decision Making than, “Do you ask for help when you don’t
understand something?” Factor analysis allows us to understand the internal scale structure by
quantifying the number of factors in the data and the extent to which items are related to each factor.
Finally, when we administer a survey measure or test, we want to ensure that the variability in scores
is due to what we are trying to measure—in this study, personality traits or socio-emotional skills—as
opposed to error or bias. Traditional or unrefined methods of scoring—such as summing the survey
items—do not account for this measurement error, leading to biases in regression analyses. Factor
analysis allows us to adjust for measurement error by fitting an underlying model accounting for both
variation among observed items and random error variance.

There are two primary types of factor analysis: exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory
factor analysis (CFA). While both EFA and CFA attempt to model the relationship between
observed items using a smaller set of latent constructs, they differ in the a priori restrictions that are
placed on the model. EFA is a data-driven technique that is primarily used when the factor structure
(e.g., the appropriate number of underlying factors and the relationships of the items to the factors)
is unknown, whether because the survey has never been administered before or is being administered
in new contexts. In CFA, a researcher uses a strong theoretical foundation to specify at the outset the
number of hypothesized factors and the patterns of how the items relate to the factors. This solution
is then evaluated with respect to how well it fits the observed data. EFA is used most frequently early
in the process of scale development, while CFA is used once the researcher has established the factor
structure based on prior empirical and theoretical grounds.


Given that the non-cognitive skills module has never before been administered in the countries of
interest in this study, we decided to proceed by first conducting exploratory factor analyses (EFAs)
with an oblimax rotation on a randomly selected half of participants stratified by country (N =
3,885). 66 In doing so, we are not making a priori assumptions about the factor structure of the module
in these new contexts. Then, to support the EFA results, the factor structure was confirmed (in a
confirmatory factor analysis, or CFA) using the second half of the sample (N = 3,887). All analyses
were conducted in MPlus (Muthén and Muthén, 1998–2012; Version 6.12) and adjusted for any
clustering of the data due to sampling design. 67 Responses were treated as ordered categorical data to
account for the skewed nature of the data, and full information maximum likelihood (FIML)
estimation was employed to handle missing data. 68

Once we determined a factor structure that provided a good fit to the data, we created individual
scores on each of these factors using refined factor scoring techniques. As detailed above, factor


66 An oblimax rotation was chosen to account for the hypothesized correlation between factors.
67 In Tajikistan—but not in Uzbekistan or Kyrgyzstan—up to two individuals per household were administered
the non-cognitive skills module. To account for any non-independence of the data that may occur due to
individuals being nested in households, we used the Type=Complex and Cluster=psuid commands in MPlus.
68 FIML utilizes all available data points, even for cases with missing item responses, by assessing during

parameter estimation missing data patterns as well as by using information from all available data points. While
FIML does not impute missing data, its use of information from all observed data is conceptually similar to
missing data imputation, where a missing value is computed conditioned on several other included variables
(Muthén, Kaplan and Hollis, 1987). In this sample, 120 cases did not have data on any of the items and were
removed from the analysis.

                                                      76
scoring is preferable in this case to traditional sum scoring methods given that factor scores account
for: (1) the weight of individual item loadings; and (2) shared variance between the items and the
factors and measurement error (DiStephano, Zhu, and Midrila, 2009). Factor scores were created
based on the exploratory factor analysis solution using maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation in
MPLUS, which accounts for the non-normal distribution of item response (Muthén and Muthén,
1998-2012).

Results

The initial EFA revealed two groupings of items: those that loaded well onto one factor, and those
that did not. The 4 items making up the original construct of “Fixed Versus Growth Mindset” loaded
cleanly onto one factor. This factor was left intact and removed from the exploratory analyses; it was
subsequently confirmed to provide a good fit to the data (χ2 (2) = 27.52, CFI: .996,
RMSEA: .057, .039 < 95% CI < .077). 69 Also removed from analyses at this juncture were items that
loaded below .2 on any construct and items that were reverse coded due to factor-item correlations
in unexpected directions. We then chose a 4-factor solution to model associations between the
remaining 18 items; in this solution, items were allowed to cross-load on multiple factors and factors
were allowed to correlate. 70 This model provided an excellent fit to the data (χ2 (87) = 530.89,
CFI=.985, RMSEA=.036, .033 < 95% CI < .039) while modeling the observed indicators
parsimoniously.

The four identified factors described in Table C2, below, were: (1) Openness to New Ideas and
People (5 items; e.g., “Are you outgoing and sociable?”; “Are you interested in learning new
things?”); (2) Workplace Attitude and Behavior (5 items; e.g., “Do you enjoy working on things that
take a very long time to complete?”; “Are people mean/not nice to you?”); (3) Decision Making (5
items; e.g., “Do you think about how the things you do will affect others?”; “Do you think carefully
before making an important decision?”); and (4) Achievement Striving (3 items; “Do you do more
than is expected of you?”). As detailed above, confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the fit of this
model (χ2 (129) = 2336.52, CFI=.922, RMSEA=.066, .064 < 95% CI < .069). In addition,
preliminary measurement equivalence analyses indicate that this same factor structure provides a
good fit to the data in Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan (χ2 (459) = 69484.24, CFI=.932,
RMSEA=.068, .066 < 95% CI < .070). 71




69 In assessing model goodness of fit, the following criteria are used: A RMSEA < .08 provides an acceptable fit
to the data, while an RMSEA < .05 provides a good fit to the data; a CFI > .9 provides an acceptable fit to the
data while a CFI > .95 provides a good fit to the data (Kline, 2011).
70 Factor correlations in the final EFA ranged from .1 to .65. The highest correlations were: Openness-Decision

Making (.535), Openness-Achievement Striving (.556), and Decision Making-Achievement Striving (.65).
71 Tests of measurement invariance seek to establish whether we are measuring the same construct in the same

way across different groups. As of this writing, our preliminary analyses have established configural invariance: that
the same factor structure (e.g., the same number of factors and the same pattern of loadings) exists in the
samples from all three countries. Future analyses will examine other levels of invariance, establishment of
which increases our certainty that observed differences between countries is attributable only to true
differences in the variability of the scores.

Interpretation and Future Directions

Our analyses indicated that the data from the non-cognitive skills module is best represented by five
factors that correspond to some—but not all—of the 11 personality traits and socio-emotional skills
described in Table C1. For example, our analyses indicated that items 19–22 and 16–18 index the
hypothesized underlying socio-emotional skills Fixed Versus Growth Mindset and Achievement
Striving, respectively. Substantively, this indicates that individuals that have higher Achievement

                                                 78
Striving factor scores tend to strive to go “above and beyond” and to do more than is expected of
them, while individuals who have higher Fixed Versus Growth Scores tend to believe new skills can
be learned.

The other three factors represented in the data are combinations of items meant to index both
personality traits and socio-emotional skills; this pattern of relationships can be understood in that
certain personality traits tend to be related to certain learned attitudes and skills. For example, our
factor of Decision Making consists of items originally thought to index both decision-making skills
and the trait of grit. In this case, individuals who think carefully and thoroughly about the
repercussions of their decisions and behaviors (see items 12–15) tend to follow through with their
actions (see item 11)—perhaps anticipating the repercussions of not following through. Our factor of
Workplace Attitudes and Behaviors consists of items meant to index both Grit and Hostile Bias.
Individuals who work very hard when others take a break (see items 6–8) may tend to feel that others
take advantage of them or are mean (see items 9–10). Thus individuals who score higher on this
construct may be workers who work hard and are innovative but perceive interactions with others as
hostile; individuals who score lower on this construct tend to work less hard and on discrete projects,
without perceiving workplace interactions as negative. Finally, our construct of Openness to New
Ideas and People reflects items thought to index the personality traits of extraversion, agreeableness,
and openness. Individuals who score high on this construct are social and open to new ideas, people,
and things (see items 1–5).

There are two plausible reasons why the data did not reflect the expected 11 traits and skills. First,
only 2–4 items were used to originally index each trait/skill; this may not have been enough to validly
and reliably fully “capture” the constructs of interest. Instead, these items appear to reflect weak to
moderately related aspects of a trait/skill that co-vary with aspects of other traits/skills. This is
unsurprising given demonstrated correlations between: (a) Big Five personality traits (Digman, 1997);
and (b) personality traits and socio-emotional skills (McAdams, 1995). To address this issue, future
surveys should consider including a broader range of items to represent each trait/skill. A second
explanation that we cautiously proffer is that the items do not relate to each other in the same way in
Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan as in the samples from which the items were developed. For
example, in the Grit scale in this sample, “finishing what was begun” is not related to “enjoying
working on things that take a long time to complete.” In ECA contexts, grit might not be well-
indexed by such behaviors. To investigate this, future research should: (1) conduct qualitative
research to better understand how these traits and skills are understood in ECA contexts; and (2) test
for measurement invariance between the non-cognitive items administered in this study and in other
studies.
