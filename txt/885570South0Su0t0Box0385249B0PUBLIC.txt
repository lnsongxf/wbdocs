I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
       Assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in South
        Sudan perceive the Bank;
       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in South Sudan regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in South Sudan;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank in South Sudan;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank’s effectiveness and results, knowledge
               and research, and communication and information sharing in South Sudan; and
            Perceptions of the World Bank’s future role in South Sudan.
       Use data to help inform the South Sudan country team’s strategy.


II. Methodology
In February 2013, 300 stakeholders of the World Bank in South Sudan were invited to provide
their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country survey.
Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of the President; the office of the
Prime Minister; the office of a Minister; the office of a Parliamentarian; employees of a ministry,
ministerial department, or implementation agency; consultants/contractors working on World
Bank-supported projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing
implementation of a project; local government officials or staff; bilateral and multilateral
agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks;
NGOs; community-based organizations (CBOs); the media; independent government
institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; the
judiciary branch; and self-employed individuals. A total of 191 stakeholders participated in the
country survey (66% response rate).
Respondents received questionnaires via courier or face to face and returned them accordingly.
Respondents were asked about: general issues facing South Sudan; their overall attitudes toward
the Bank; the World Bank’s effectiveness and results; the Bank’s knowledge; working with the
World Bank; the Bank’s future role in South Sudan; and the Bank’s communication and
information sharing in South Sudan.
Every country that engages in the Country Survey must include specific indicator questions that
will be aggregated for the World Bank’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions are
identified throughout the survey report.

A. General Issues Facing South Sudan: Respondents were asked to indicate whether South
   Sudan is headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important
   development priorities, and which areas of development would contribute most to reducing
   poverty and generating economic growth in South Sudan.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with the World Bank, the Bank’s effectiveness in South Sudan, Bank staff preparedness to
   help South Sudan solve its development challenges, their agreement with various statements
   regarding the Bank’s work, and the extent to which the Bank is an effective development
   partner. Respondents were also asked to indicate the sectoral areas on which it would be most
   productive for the Bank to focus its resources, the Bank’s greatest values and greatest
   weaknesses in its work, the most effective instruments in helping to reduce poverty in South
   Sudan, with which stakeholder groups the Bank should collaborate more, and to what reasons
   respondents attributed failed or slow reform efforts.
C. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which
   the Bank’s work helps achieve development results in South Sudan, the extent to which the
   Bank meets South Sudan’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments, and the
   Bank’s level of effectiveness across thirty six development areas, such as poverty reduction,
   agricultural development, water and sanitation, education and others.
D. The World Bank’s Knowledge: Respondents were asked to indicate how frequently they
   consult Bank knowledge work and activities, the areas on which the Bank should focus its
   research efforts, and to rate the effectiveness and quality of the Bank’s knowledge work and
   activities, including how significant of a contribution they make to development results in
   South Sudan and its technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
   a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as the World Bank’s
   “Safeguard Policy” requirements being reasonable, the Bank imposing reasonable conditions
   on its lending, disbursing funds promptly, increasing South Sudan’ institutional capacity, and
   providing effective implementation support.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank in South Sudan: Respondents were asked to rate how
   significant a role the Bank should play in South Sudan’ development in the near future and to
   indicate what the Bank should do to make itself of greater value in South Sudan.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the Bank, and their usage and evaluation of the Bank’s websites.
   Respondents were asked about their awareness of the Bank’s Access to Information policy,
   past information requests from the Bank, and their level of agreement that they use more data
   from the World Bank as a result of the Bank’s Open Data policy. Respondents were also
   asked about their level of agreement that they know how to find information from the Bank
   and that the Bank is responsive to their information requests.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their exposure
   to the Bank in South Sudan, and their geographic location.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank
   PMUs/consultants/contractors on Bank-supported projects, and respondents from the
    bilateral/multilateral agencies had the highest levels of familiarity with the World Bank,
    whereas respondents from the private sector/financial sector/private banks, and employees of
    the office of the President/Prime Minister/Minister had significantly lower levels of
    familiarity.
   It should be noted that respondents’ ratings of familiarity with the Bank were significantly,
    strongly correlated with their perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in South Sudan,
    the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results, and the Bank’s relevance to South
    Sudan’s development.

Specific Areas of Effectiveness

       There were significant stakeholder group differences in their ratings of the Bank’s
        effectiveness in just two of these thirty-six development areas.

             Respondents from the office of the President/Prime Minister/Minister, bilateral/
              multilateral agencies, and CSOs had the highest ratings for the Bank’s
              effectiveness at “Energy,” whereas respondents from the media, and employees of
              a ministry/ministerial department/implementation agency had significantly lower
              ratings.

             Respondents from PMUs and consultants/contractors on the Work Bank’s
              projects had the highest ratings for the Bank’s effectiveness at “Public sector
              governance/reform,” whereas respondents from CSOs, private sector/financial
              sector/private banks, and other organizations had significantly lower ratings.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in South Sudan, bivariate correlational
analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty six specific areas of
effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results increase.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in South Sudan. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
                Communicable/non-communicable diseases;
                Domestic private sector development;
                Regional conflict and tensions;
                Trade and exports; and
                Natural resource management.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        Bank’s ability to help achieve development results in South Sudan, suggesting that
        ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s
        ability to help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from
        these analyses were:
                Information and communications technology;
                Local governance and institutions;
                Basic infrastructure;
                Security/stabilization/reconstruction; and
                Economic growth.

The World Bank is interested in gauging the views of clients and partners who are either involved in
development in South Sudan or who observe activities related to social and economic development. The
following survey is meant to give the World Bank’s team that works in South Sudan, greater insight into
how the Bank’s work is perceived. This is one tool the World Bank uses to assess the views of its critical
stakeholders. With this understanding, the World Bank hopes to develop more effective strategies,
outreach and programs that support development in South Sudan. The World Bank commissioned an
independent firm to oversee the logistics of this effort in South Sudan. This ensures anonymity and
confidentiality. We hope you’ll be candid. To complete the survey, please circle/check the response that
most accurately reflects your opinion. If you prefer not to answer a question, please leave it blank.
