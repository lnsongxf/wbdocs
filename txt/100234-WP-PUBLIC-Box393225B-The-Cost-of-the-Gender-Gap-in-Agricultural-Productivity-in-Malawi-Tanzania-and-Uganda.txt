                  Methodology: Measuring the economic costs of the gender gap
                  in agricultural productivity


                  1   Traditionally, agricultural productivity is measured based
                      on household-level analysis. In contrast, we here look at
                  the plot level and identify the plot manager, measuring the
                                                                                     in two scenarios. In the first scenario, we assume that there is
                                                                                     no difference between male and female agricultural output—
                                                                                     that is, there is no gender gap and agricultural productivity
                  difference in productivity between plots cultivated by women       of women’s plots is equal to plots cultivated by men. In the
                  and men. We convert the agricultural output produced by            second scenario, we use the actual productivity estimates
                  women and men farmers on their plots into monetary values          obtained in the first step to calculate the value of output
                  by multiplying the output obtained per unit of land with           obtained from female plots in the presence of the gender gap.

                  enumeration area (or at a higher level of aggregation if           gender gap scenario gives the additional output value from

                  kilograms; in Malawi, a wide range of measurement units was
                  employed. We then aggregate the total value of all crops per
                  unit of land associated with each gender. The difference in
                  this value between women’s and men’s plots constitutes the
                                                                                     3   The final step includes computing the size of the gap
                                                                                         relative to agricultural GDP. To do this, we first need to
                                                                                     know what fraction of agricultural GDP comes from crop

                  2   As a next step, we calculate the fraction of land cultivated
                      by women and men, after accounting for the fact that
                  women cultivate smaller plots than men. For example, in
                                                                                     GDP. To take this into account, we use an estimate of the
                                                                                     multiplier between agricultural sector growth and the rest
                                                                                     of the economy obtained from other studies in Malawi,

                  plots but because their plots are on average smaller by            and Benin 2012; Pauw and Thurlow 2011).
                  0.47 hectares, women manage only about 13 percent
                  of the land. Combining this fraction with the estimated            A more technical description of the methodology is given

UN WOMEN, grounded in the vision of equality as enshrined in the Charter of the
United Nations, works for the elimination of discrimination against women and girls;
the empowerment of women; and the achievement of equality between women and men
as partners and beneficiaries of development, human rights, humanitarian action, and
peace and security. Placing women’s rights at the center of all its efforts, UN Women
leads and coordinates United Nations system efforts to ensure that commitments on
gender equality and gender mainstreaming translate into action throughout the world.
It provides strong and coherent leadership in support of Member States’ priorities and
efforts, building effective partnership with civil society and other relevant actors.

The WORLD BANK GROUP (WBG) is a vital source of financial and technical assistance
to developing countries around the world. The formation of a unified WBG has created a
unique partnership working to end extreme poverty within a generation and boost shared
prosperity. The World Bank Africa Region Gender Innovation Lab’s (GIL’s) analytical
work underpins World Bank financing and helps inform the development communities’
investments. Through conducting impact evaluations, the GIL supports the design
of innovative, scalable interventions to address gender inequality across Africa, with
the goal of enabling project teams and policy makers to advocate for better gender
integration using evidence.

The POVERTY-ENVIRONMENT INITIATIVE (PEI) of the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) supports
country-led efforts to mainstream poverty-environment linkages into national
development planning and budgeting. PEI provides financial and technical assistance
to government partners to set up institutional and capacity-strengthening programs
and carry out activities to address the particular poverty-environment context. PEI is
funded by the governments of Norway, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the
European Union and with core funding of UNDP and UNEP.
