I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
    Assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in Romania
       perceive the Bank;
    Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Romania regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Romania;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank in Romania;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank’s effectiveness and results, knowledge
              work and activities, and communication and information sharing in Romania;
            Perceptions of the World Bank’s future role in Romania.
    Use data to help inform Romania country team’s strategy.
II. Methodology
In August-September 2013, 191 stakeholders of the World Bank in Romania were invited to
provide their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country
survey. Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of the President/Prime
Minister/Minister, the office of a Parliamentarian; a ministry, ministerial department, or
implementation agency; consultants/ contractors working on World Bank-supported
projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of a project;
local government officials or staff; bilateral and multilateral agencies; private sector
organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks; NGOs; community-based
organizations; the media; independent government institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups;
academia/research institutes/think tanks; the judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of
81 stakeholders participated in the survey (42% response rate).
Respondents received questionnaires via email and returned them accordingly. Respondents
were asked about: general issues facing Romania; their overall attitudes toward the Bank; the
World Bank’s effectiveness and results; the Bank’s knowledge work and activities; working with
the World Bank; the Bank’s future role in Romania; and the Bank’s communication and
information sharing in Romania.
Every country that engages in the Country Survey must include specific indicator questions that
will be aggregated for the World Bank’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions are
identified throughout the survey report.
A. General Issues Facing Romania: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Romania is
   headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three development priorities in
   Romania, which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty and generating economic
   growth, and what best illustrates how “shared prosperity” would be achieved in Romania.
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with the World Bank, the Bank’s effectiveness in Romania, Bank staff preparedness to help
   Romania solve its development challenges, their agreement with various statements
   regarding the Bank’s work, and t he extent to which the Bank is an effective development
   partner. Respondents were asked to indicate the Bank’s greatest values, greatest weaknesses,
   the most effective instruments in helping reduce poverty in Romania, with which stakeholder
   groups the Bank should collaborate more, in which sectoral areas the Bank should focus most
   resources, to what extent the Bank should seek to influence the global development agenda,
   and to what reasons respondents attributed failed or slow reform efforts.

II. Methodology (continued)
C. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which
   the Bank’s work helps achieve development results, the extent to which the Bank meets
   Romania’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments, and the Bank’s level of
   effectiveness across thirty eight development areas, such as public sector governance/reform,
   regulatory framework, education, gender, and social inclusion of marginalized and
   vulnerable groups.
D. The World Bank’s Knowledge: Respondents were asked to indicate how frequently they
   consult Bank knowledge work and activities, the areas on which the Bank should focus its
   research efforts and to rate the effectiveness and quality of the Bank’s knowledge work and
   activities, including how significant of a contribution it makes to development results, its
   technical quality, and the value of the World Bank’s fee -based services/products.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
   a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as the World Bank’s
   “Safeguard Policy” requirements being reasonable, the Bank imposing reasonable conditions
   on its lending, disbursing funds promptly, increasing Romania’s institutional capacity, and
   providing effective implementation support.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank in Romania: Respondents were asked to rate how
   significant a role the Bank should play in Romania in the near future and to indicate what the
   Bank should do to make itself of greater value.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the Bank, and their usage and evaluation of the Bank ’s websites.
   Respondents were asked about their awareness of the Bank’s Access to Information policy,
   past information requests from the Bank, and their level of agreement that they use more data
   from the World Bank as a result of the Bank’s Open Data policy. Respondents were also
   asked about their level of agreement that they know how to find information from the Bank,
   that the Bank’s websites are easy to navigate and useful, and that the Bank is responsive to
   information requests. Respondents were also asked to indicate whether they primarily use the
   Bank’s country website or the Bank’s main website and whether they primarily use high
   speed or dial-up Internet connection when visiting a World Bank website. .
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their exposure
   to the Bank in Romania, and their geographic location.

When possible, responses from respondents completing this year’s country survey were
compared to responses from the 322 respondents (54% response rate) who completed the survey
in FY 2005. Year comparisons can be found in Appendix C (see page 88).

         For further analyses, respondents from the office of President/Prime Minister were
          combined with respondents from the office of Minister; respondents from PMUs were
          combined with consultants/contractors working on Bank projects; respondents from
          private sector organizations were combined with respondents from financial
          sector/private banks; respondents from independent government institutions, the judiciary
          branch, and other organizations were combined into the “other” category. There were no

       There were significant stakeholder group differences in their ratings of the Bank’s
        effectiveness across many of these thirty-eight development areas. For the most part,
        respondents from PMUs and consultants/contractors working Bank projects gave the
        highest ratings, whereas respondents from academia/research institutes/think tanks tended
        to give significantly lower ratings. Those areas with significant stakeholder differences
        were:
             Anti corruption;

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Romania, bivariate correlational
analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty eight specific areas of
effectiveness.
Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results increase.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Romania. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
                The Bank’s effectiveness at regional development;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at poverty reduction;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at equality of opportunity;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at health;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at gender; and
                The Bank’s effectiveness at social cohesion.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        Bank’s ability to help achieve development results in Romania, suggesting that ratings of
        effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
                The Bank’s effectiveness at health;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at disaster management;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at rural development;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at poverty reduction
                The Bank’s effectiveness at regional development; and

        with all two statements: “the World Bank’s work is aligned with what I consider the
        development priorities for Romania,” and “the World Bank supports programs and
        strategies that are realistic for Romania.” Respondents from the PMUs and
        consultants/contractors working on Bank projects tended to have the highest levels of
        agreement, whereas respondents from academia/research institutes/think tanks had
        significantly lower levels of agreement.
       Respondents across stakeholder groups had statistically similar levels of agreement with
        the indicator statement “overall the World Bank currently plays a relevant role in
        development in Romania.”
