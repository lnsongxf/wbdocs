          This Discussion Paper was prepared by the author for the World Bank Group’s Networked Carbon Markets
                 (NCM) initiative. It describes the rationale, objectives and key elements of the NCM initiative.

             It is expected that the proposed concepts and components outlined in this Paper will evolve based on
          discussions with stakeholders, further technical work, and negotiations under the United Nations Framework
           Convention on Climate Change. As such, this Paper is ‘live’ and will continue to be updated to capture the
                                                  evolution of the NCM initiative.

[117] The possibility of introducing the Index and the roles
it might perform invites a great deal of further
investigation. For example, questions such as what will the
Index be based on – a budget approach or a composite
approach and, if the latter, a composite of? What
weighting factors might be taken into account in devising a
composite index for NCM? Whether in composing it, the
weighted average might only be composed of similar
entities e.g. MVs of trading jurisdictions, or could risk
assessed project credits be included – must the
comparison be like-with-like? If the Index were to be
based on an emissions budget approach, who would
determine jurisdictions’ budgets and by what
methodology? On the other hand, if the Index were to be a
basket of just a limited number of NCM jurisdictions,
based on pre-determined criteria (like SDRs), what would
those pre-determined criteria be aimed at achieving?
Whether investors holding ITUs would act as a drain on
supply so as to cause problems with liquidity, rather than
fostering greater liquidity? Whether the inclusion of risk-
assessed project-based credits could address liquidity
concerns? And whether and how basing the transaction
mechanism on an index would increase market liquidity?
Engagement with NCM partners, such as the EEX,
London Stock Exchange and other exchanges, should
help to address these and related questions.
