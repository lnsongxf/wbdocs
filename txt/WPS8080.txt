1.     Introduction


     A signicant number of households throughout sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) engage
in rural non-farm farm economy (RNFE), either through employment in the sector or
self-employment by establishing microenterprises. Such diversication in investment
and labor allocation is prevalent throughout rural settings in SSA (Reardon et al.,
1992; Reardon, 1997; Barrett et al., 2001; and World Bank, 2007). A range of plausible
explanations for this extensive prevalence of diversication in livelihoods have been put
forward:   ex-ante risk mitigation (Barrett et al., 2001; Reardon, 1997) and ex-post risk
management (Webb and Reardon, 1992 and Reardon et al., 1992); missing or incomplete
market for land, labor, insurance and credit (Barrett et al., 2001); seasonality in
agriculture (Reardon, 1997; Barrett et al., 2001); and complimentary of activities and
economies of scope (Barrett et al., 2001). It has been documented that non-farm income
constitutes a huge portion of rural income in the continent (Reardon et al. 1998: cited
in Lanjouw et al., 2001). On the other hand, until recently, poverty reduction strategies
in SSA have not given due emphasis to RNFE and the focus has predominantly been on
improving productivity in the agricultural sector. This conscious focus on agriculture
is, arguably, misplaced (Rigg, 2006), and that the role played by o-farm activities in
improving welfare and socioeconomic mobility is crucial (Haggblade et al., 2010; Davis
et al., 2010; Rigg, 2006; Bezu et al., 2012).


     There is also ample evidence supporting the hypothesis that RNFE oers a decent
alternative income source, and improves well-being (Lanjouw et al., 2001; Bezu et al.,
2012; Block and Webb, 2001). RNFE appears to oer an important route out of poverty
(Lan, 2007; Lanjouw et al., 2001), and participation in the sector facilitates growth,
and hence upward mobility (Bezu et al., 2012). According to Block and Webb (2001),
initial diversication leads to subsequent boosts in households' income in rural Ethiopia.
Therefore, it is imperative to understand whether women are taking advantage of these
rewarding economic activities.

                                            1
   However, the extent of women's engagement in and their returns from RNFE is not
clearly documented, and previous studies seem to oer contrasting accounts. Some of
the evidence suggests that women have a lower level of diversication outside agriculture
and their returns from engagement in RNFE tends to be lower than men's (Lanjouw
et al., 2001; Block and Webb, 2001; and Canagarajah et al., 2001). Lanjouw et al.
(2001) found that women in Tanzania appear to be poorly placed in RNFE, and business
returns are 60 times higher for men than for women. Similarly, Block and Webb (2001)
found that, in Ethiopia, twice as many female-headed households as male-headed ones
identied o-farm employment as important, and yet they tend to have lower levels of
income diversication away from cropping. Women earned less (than men) in RNFE of
Ghana and Uganda as well, and yet being a female household-head contributed better
to non-farm earnings (Canagarajah et al., 2001). On the other hand, Bezu et al. (2012)
and Djurfeldt et al. (2013) found that women have better access to and receive higher
returns from o-farm activities. In RNFE, female labor enjoys higher returns than
male labor, and RNFE oers opportunity for (female) labor, which is underutilized in
agriculture (Bezu et al., 2012). In Zambia and Malawi, male-headed households also
have relatively limited access to RNFE, and the high RNFE income for females seems
to bridge the gender-gap in farm income (Djurfeldt et al., 2013).


   These previous studies have identied gender gaps in non-farm incomes. However,
they fall short of tracing the sources of the return gaps as they do not identify the
gap resulting from dierences in resource endowments or marginal returns to these
endowments. The current study applies Heckman correction for selection bias and then
conducts return decompositionidentifying gaps due to endowment dierences from
gaps due to marginal return to endowments. In addition, this study contributes to
a rarely explored aspect of RNFE by analyzing the industrial classication of non-
farm activities. For a number of socio-cultural reasons women's participation in some
industries of the non-farm sector might be limited. This could potentially aect returns

                                           2
from RNFE. The main objective of this study, therefore, is to investigate the gender
dimension of RNFE and provide policy relevant insight on factors associated with
gender gaps in Uganda and Ethiopia. Out of the four Eastern and Southern Africa
countries (Uganda, Tanzania, Malawi and Ethiopia) covered by the Living Standards
Measurement StudyIntegrated Surveys on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA), the data used in
this paper, these two countries are interesting to compare. Both are landlocked and
heavily dependent on agriculture, a sector in which men and women tend to have
distinct roles and certain agricultural activities such as ploughing are reserved for men
in Ethiopia. However, despite their geographic proximity and other similarities, RNFE
is much more important in Uganda than in Ethiopia. Therefore, these two countries
provide a good comparison for studying gender gaps in similar countries where the
development of the non-farm sector is at dierent stages.


   The current study addresses the following inter-related questions: Do women have
equal access to high return economic activities in RNFE of Uganda and Ethiopia? Does
the gender dierence in access to RNFE vary by industry? Is there a gender gap in
returns from RNFE? If so, do dierences in resource endowments explain the earnings
gap? While addressing these questions, this study attempts to deal with the two major
limitations common to most of the previous studies: (1) failure to account for selection
bias; and (2) reliance on sample of households that are not nationally representative,
with the exception of a few studies. The current study deals with these shortcomings
by conducting Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition (Blinder, 1973; Oaxaca, 1973) of returns
with Heckman correction for selection problem (Heckman, 1976; Heckman, 1979).
We study the non-farm sector in these two countries using the LSMS-ISA, which
is a national representative and internationally comparable household survey. After
providing a general mapping of participation in and income from RNFE, we investigate
gender-based dierences in access to RNFE and the types of industries that female-
headed households typically engage in. Then, we analyze gender inequality in returns
from o-farm activities by implementing bias-corrected Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition.

                                           3
   The descriptive results show that returns from RNFE account for a fairly large
share of household income in Uganda and Ethiopia. The signicance of RNFE is more
pronounced in Uganda, where almost half of gross household income originates from
o-farm activities. In Ethiopia, only 26 percent of gross household income is from o-
farm activities. There are also signicant gender gaps in access to salaried employment
and self-employment in RNFE.


   Results from decomposition of returns reveal that female-headed households benet
less from engagement in RNFE. For instance, female-headed households in Ethiopia
earned 29 percent less gross return than male-headed households. The gross return
gaps are even higher in Uganda (61 percent). The return gaps are also much higher
when we focus exclusively on households in rural areas compared to when we include
households in both rural areas and small towns (henceforth `rural+ areas') . The return
gaps are further decomposed into ones that are explained by dierences in endowments
and those that are unexplained and hence could be the result of gender bias. The
results show that, in Ethiopia, the major portion of the gender gap in return is not
explained by dierences in endowments in both rural and rural+ areas. In Uganda, we
nd dierent results in rural areas and rural+ areas. In rural areas, a large proportion
of the gender gap is the result of dierences in endowments. Whereas, in rural+ areas,
we nd that the return gap is only partially explained by endowment dierences.


   The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briey describes the data and
measurement. Section 3 describes the empirical strategy employed. Section 4 presents
the results. Finally, Section 5 presents the conclusion and policy recommendation.

2.      Data and Measurement



2.1. Data
     This study uses nationally representative and internationally comparable panel data
from the LSMS-ISA in Ethiopia and Uganda. In Ethiopia, the survey includes 3,969
households, which are representative of rural areas and small towns. These households
were surveyed in 2011/12 and 2013/14. For Uganda, we use two rounds of a nationally
representative survey which interviewed 2,716 households in 2010/11 and 2011/12.
As this study focuses on rural areas and small towns, we exclude Kampala from our
analysis.


2.2. Measurement
     The approach adopted in this study to characterize diversication is straightforward.
We classify labor allocation and income into on-farm and o-farm. On-farm refers
to engagement in crop-production and animal husbandry on own farm.                         O-farm
encompasses engagement in paid economic activities outside the domain of one's own
farm, by working for wage and salary, as a casual laborer and/or by establishing and
operating non-farm enterprise(s).


     We adopt various measures of o-farm engagement by exploring the size and share
of gross and net o-farm income; and labor-days in o-farm activities and their share in
households' labor supply:1 (1)      Gross on-farm income includes total income from crop,
livestock and their byproducts sold and used for own consumption.2 , 3 (2)            Net on-farm
     1 The denition of each measure slightly varies by country, due to dierences in information
availability.
     2 There is no data on the amount of crop harvested in the rst round of Ethiopia's LSMS-ISA, and
hence we have relied on crop disposal mechanisms (sell, giving out for free, storage for consumption
and/or seed) to impute on-farm income. As a result, we could not account for the amount consumed
between harvest time and the time when the households were surveyed.
     3 For Uganda, we include income from livestock services such as transportation under on-farm
income.



                                                  5
income refers to gross income minus production cost such as wagebill for hired labor
used in planting and harvesting crop; expenditure on transportation, seed, fertilizer,
and land rental; expenses incurred to feed, vaccinate and look after livestock as well
as transportation of livestock and byproducts. (3)              On-farm labor is the total days
of (own, hired and shared) labor deployed for agricultural activities on own farm.4
(4)   Gross o-farm income is income from employment for wages/salaries and as a
casual laborer; and gross return from non-farm enterprise.5 , (5)             Net o-farm income
encompasses the incomes from wage/salaried employment and casual labor; and net
income from enterprises. (6)        O-farm labor refers to the total number of days spent
on wage/salaried and casual employment as well as own and hired labor-days spent on
running non-farm enterprise.6 , 7


      To convert agricultural production into revenue and labor days into farm wagebill,
we used median prices of outputs and wage rate at the lowest admin division (`kebele' ),
whenever data is available.          Otherwise, median prices and wages in higher admin
divisions like     `woreda' /district, zone and even region have been adopted. This price
and wage conversion applies only to agricultural incomes and expenses that are used to
construct total household incomeagainst which share of o-farm income is imputed.
This construction of revenue and wage bill is not applied to o-farm income. Therefore,
it does not aect the o-farm return analysis. Value of land is imputed based on farmers'
response to a hypothetical question regarding rental value of their own farmed parcel(s),
and rental cost of land rented from others.




      4 Labor accounting is also based on aggregating labor days by men, women and children at equal
weight. Labor data on livestock is not detailed enough to properly account for labor spent to looking
after livestock.
      5 In Ethiopia, o-farm income includes income from working under the public safety-net program
(PSNP).
      6 For Ethiopia, labor allocated for PSNP is included under o-farm labor.
      7 In Uganda, we do not have information on days allocated to operating non-farm enterprises.



                                                   6
2.3. Income from RNFE
   Here, we briey describe the gender based dierences in return from RNFE and
dierences in relevant characteristics such as human and physical capital, exposure to
shocks and access to public services. Table A.1 presents the gap in these variables. In
both Ethiopia and Uganda, female household heads tend to be older with less education,
compared to male heads. Female-headed households have fewer members, but high
dependency ratio. This high dependency ratio could limit female-headed households'
participation in RNFE, for example, by limiting their ability to operate a non-farm
enterprise farther from residence such as in a nearby market. Similarly, compared to
male-headed households, female-headed ones have less physical capital such as land and
cattle in both countries. More female-headed households have been exposed to natural
shocks in Uganda. Overall dierence in exposure to shocks and their frequency is not
economically and/or statistically signicant. On the other hand, there is no statistically
signicant gender based dierence in access to public services.


   Women become household heads under dierent circumstances. In hierarchical rural
communities, like those covered in this study, male spouses typically tend to be the
household heads whenever they are present in the households. For instance, in both
Uganda and Ethiopia, most of the female-heads (more than 70 percent) are either
widow/divorced or never married. Whereas, about 95 and 89 percent of male-heads are
married in Ethiopia and Uganda, respectively (Table A.2). The situation under which
females become household heads could also dictate their participation and return from
RNFE. Therefore, this study attempts to document the heterogeneity in participation
and return between male- and female-headed households with dierent marital status.


   The role of o-farm activities in generating income for rural households and
employing their labor is signicant in both countries. However, it is more pronounced in
Uganda, where about 49 percent of household income originates from o-farm activities.


                                            7
The average annual o-farm income per person is 965 thousand Ugandan Shillings
(UShs).8 The magnitude and share of o-farm income in Ethiopia is relatively small,
and yet it is economically signicant. The national average annual gross o-farm
income is 1,124 Ethiopian Birr (ETB) per capita, which is about 26 percent of the
total household income.9 Only 17 percent of labor time (18 days per person per year)
is allocated to o-farm activities. This is much lower compared to Uganda, where
households allocate 69 percent of their labor time (76 workdays per person per year)
to o-farm activities (Table A.3 in the Annex).


    In addition, there are marked regional dierences in the role of o-farm activities
in both countries. For instance, households in the Central Region of Uganda earn by
far the largest per person o-farm income in the country, with average annual income
of UShs 2.4 million, and o-farm income makes 71 percent of households' income.
This substantially higher o-farm income in the region could, partly, be the result of
proximity to Kampala.10 , 11 The other three regions in Uganda have similar level of
o-farm income, ranging from UShs 0.7 million to 0.9 million, and comparable share of
income originates from and labor is allocated to o-farm activities. In Oromia, Southern
Nations & Nationalities, and Amhara regions of Ethiopiathe regions with better
agricultural potentialshouseholds rely less on o-farm activities. In these regions,
lower share of household income is earned from and lesser labor time is allocated to o-
farm activities. Households residing in low agriculture potential regions such as Tigray
and others (Afar, Somali, Benshangul Gumuz, Dire Dawa, Gambella, and Harari) garner
a signicant amount and large share of their incomes from o-farm activities and also

    8 The annual average of ocial exchange rates for 2010, 2011 and 2012 were 2,523, 2,505 and 2,587
UShs/$, respectively (WDI, 2014).
    9 Average annual exchange rates for the years 2011 and 2012 were 17 and 18 ETB/$, respectively
(WDI, 2014).
   10 Smith et al. (2001) compared households in Central and Eastern regions, and found a similar
pattern higher proportion of households in the Central Region tend to have more diversied
livelihoods.
   11 In addition, Central Uganda is wealthier than the other regions, and previous studies concur with
our ndings (see Sarah and Ibrahim (2012).)



                                                  8
allocate a signicant share of their labor time to o-farm activities (Table A.3).


   Returning to the gender dimension of RNFE, we conducted extensive analysis of how
female-headed households fare in the sector relative to their male-headed counterparts.
In Table A.4, we present a comparison of participation and returns from RNFE, and
household- and community-specic covariates that could inuence access to and income
from RNFE by gender.        Per captial gross return from RNFE is presented for all
households as well as for only those households that are participating in the sector. Both
in Uganda and Ethiopia, when considering average o-farm income of all households,
there is no statistically signicant dierence in per capita gross return for female- and
male-headed households. However, among households participating in RNFE, female-
headed households tend to earn lower returns in both countries.


   Another striking result is that even if female-headed households earn lower returns
from o-farm activities, a higher share of their incomes originate from these activities.
For instance, 36.5 percent of female-headed households' incomes come from RNFE
in Ethiopia. This is much higher when compared to the 23.4 percent among male-
headed households. This result is consistent with the stated share of return from
non-farm enterprises in total household income: about 32 percent of female-headed
households that own non-farm enterprises stated that they earn 50 percent or more
of their incomes from these enterprises. This is much higher than the 20 percent of
male-headed households that reportedly earned at least 50 percent of their incomes
from enterprises (Figure A.1 in the Annex). It should also be noted that female-headed
households in Ethiopia allocate a higher share of their labor to o-farm activities. In
Uganda, female-headed households also earn a higher share of their incomes from and
allocate more labor days to o-farm activities, but they tend to spend lesser share of
their labor on these activities.


   The gender gap in access to and return from RNFE might be the result of dierences

                                            9
in human and physical capital endowments, exposure to shocks, community specic
factors such as access to market and roads, and climatic conditions. Table A.4 presents
dierences in these potential drivers of access and return. In both Uganda and Ethiopia,
female-headed households have lower human capital endowments: their heads are older
and less educated; and they have a smaller household size and high dependency ratio.
They also own smaller plots of land, but their livestock ownership is relatively higher.
In terms of exposure to natural and health shocks, and the frequency of these shocks,
there is little dierence between these groups. The same is true for community-level
indicators of access to market and roads.




2.4. Dierential Access to RNFE by Industry
   Rural o-farm activities vary signicantly in terms of their industrial classications,
and economic activities in dierent industries could have substantially dierent returns.
A clear understanding of the gender dierences in industry of employment could provide
at least a partial explanation for any gender gap in returns from RNFE. Evidently, some
investments and employment opportunities, especially those with higher returns, could
be more dicult to access. They might require higher start-up capital and/or know-
how. For example, a non-agricultural business could be more rewarding than operating
an enterprise that processes agricultural output. But the former may also require
higher start-up capital. Jobs in the manufacturing, transport and communications, and
construction sectors could be more rewarding than jobs in the primary sector. But such
jobs tend to require certain specialized training or skills. Similarly, some households
might be pulled into RNFE by the desire to increase their earnings/prots by engaging
in more rewarding economic activities. Others might be pushed into the sector due
to unfavorable agriculture outcomes, and their participation in the sector could just
be a coping mechanism. The latter group of households might tend to participate in
less rewarding and potentially easy to access o-farm activities. Therefore, inspecting


                                            10
the nature and industry of employment and non-farm enterprise is very important.
To explore the gender dierences in the industry of salaried employment and non-
farm enterprise, we categorized these economic activities into 17 industries based on
the International Standard for Industrial Classication (ISIC) and analyzed the gender
dierences.


    In both countries, there are signicant gender gaps in access to salaried employment
in RNFE. Only 7 and 17 percent of female-headed households had salaried o-farm
employment in Ethiopia and Uganda, respectively. These gures are lower than male-
headed households by 2 and 5.7 percentage points, respectively (Table 1).12 , 13 The
analysis of employment by industry (as per the ISIC) reveals that there are notable
dierences, especially in Uganda.          Female-headed households have lesser access to
employment in construction, transportation and communications, shery, public admin,
and `other social services' sectors of Uganda than their male-headed counterparts. In
Ethiopia, a smaller proportion of female-head households had salaried employment in
agriculture and `other social services' sectors. However, a higher percentage of female-
headed households are employed in health and social work in both countries, and hotel
and restaurant services in Uganda.


    Similarly, a smaller proportion of female-headed households in Ethiopia (19.8%) and
Uganda (33.5 %) owned a non-farm enterprise, which is lower compared to male-headed
households respectively by 6 and 8 percentage points (Table 1). Based on the ISIC, a
higher proportion of male-headed households own enterprises that operate in mining and
quarrying, construction, `other social services', and electricity, gas and water industries

   12 In Table 1, we present the proportion of households that have access to employment in each
industry. Therefore, the sum of the proportion in each industry should be roughly equal to employment
in all industries.
   13 For Ethiopia, we have additional information on employment as casual laborer and under the
Productive Safety Net Project (PSNP). Only 18 percent of female-headed households had access
employment as casual laborer.   This is lower than that of male-headed households by 8 percentage
points. However, there is no gender-based dierence in employment under the PSNP. About 9 percent

in Ethiopia. Similarly, male-headed households have advantage in the shery, sales,
maintenance and repair, transport and communications, and unclassied industries in
Uganda. Whereas, female-headed households tend to participate more in the hotel and
restaurant industry in both countries, and the agriculture and manufacturing sector in
Uganda.


   For Ethiopia, we have an additional broader classication of non-farm enterprises
into seven groups: those in non-agricultural business, processing agricultural output,
trading business, services/sales, professional services, trade/moving services, and hotel,
bar or restaurants. Based on this classication, female-headed households have limited
access to non-agricultural business. Their enterprises seem to be mostly engaged in
processing of agricultural outputs. On the other hand, a large proportion of enterprises
operated by male-headed households engage in non-agricultural businesses (Table A.5
in the Annex).

Note:   `Dierence' refers to mean value for female-headed households minus that of male-headed
households.
For Uganda, only 831 out of the 2,237 the non-farm enterprises have been classied according to the
ISIC.




     In addition, we explore the dierence between female- and male-headed households
in terms of the location of their non-farm enterprises and the sources of start-up capital
for these enterprises. The majority of non-farm enterprises owned by female-headed

                                                       13
households are operated in or around their residence. This is especially true in Ethiopia,
where 44 percent of these enterprises operate inside the residence and another 8 percent
of them operate near/outside the residence (Figure A.2, in the Annex). On the other
hand, enterprises owned by male-headed households predominantly operate in markets
(35%), followed by inside residence (27%) and with no xed location/mobile (12%). In
Uganda, there is a substantial heterogeneity in the locations of female owned non-farm
enterprises: only 20 and 19 percent of the enterprises operate inside and near residence,
respectively. Construction sites (20%) and traditional markets (19%) are also common
places of operation for these enterprises. The gender dierence in enterprise location is
less pronounced in Uganda.


   We also explored the gender-based dierences in the sources of start-up capital
for non-farm enterprises.    In both Uganda and Ethiopia, own resourcessavings,
agricultural income and/or return from laborwere the main contributors of start-
up capital for both male-and female-headed households.         In Ethiopia, agricultural
income contributes 65 and 46 percent of the start-up capital for male-headed and
female-headed households, respectively.      It seems that female-headed households
have better diversied capital sources: they acquired resources from non-farm self-
employment (17%), family/friends (14%) and private moneylender (8%). In Uganda,
own resource/savings is also the main source of start-up capital for both female- and
male-owned enterprises.

3.     Empirical Strategy


     This section outlines the empirical approaches adopted to address the four inter-
related issues presented above. To study the patterns of participation in RNFE among
female- and male-headed households, and the determinants of access to RNFE, we use a
combination of descriptive analysis, t-tests for mean dierences, and probability model.
We implement t-tests to compare mean value of participation in dierent types of non-
farm activities and return from RNFE among male- and female-headed households
as well as dierences in endowments that could potentially explain the gender gap in
RNFE. Then, we estimate a logit model for participation in RNFE (Pit )dened as
engaging in any o-farm activity through employment or self-employmenton a gender




                                          15
dummy and other covariates as follows:


                                 Pit = Î± âˆ— Genderi + Xit Î² + Âµit                      (1)


...where Xit is a vector of covariates such as human and physical capital, and household
i's exposure to shocks, community specic factors such as access to infrastructure and
markets, and climatic conditions. Genderi is a dummy for female-headed household,
and Âµit is the error term. Estimation results from this equation would be used to study
the gender gap in access to RNFE, after accounting for other potential determinants of
participation. In addition, the estimation would help us in identifying the important
variables that might inuence households' participation in RNFE.


   We implement Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition to assess whether female-headed
households face a dierent return structure relative to their male-headed counterparts
in RNFE. Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition (Blinder, 1973; Oaxaca, 1973) enables us to
separate the dierence in return between female- and male-headed households into two:
one that is explained by groups' dierences in endowments of productive assets, and a
residual part which is not explained by endowments dierences, as in a counterfactual
manner.


   For households participating in RNFE, household i's return from o-farm activities
can be represented as:
                                        Yit = Xit Î² +   it                            (2)

...where Yit is (log) o-farm income per capita for household i; Xit is a vector of
regressors (household- and community-specic characteristics, exposure to shocks, and
climatic conditions); and   it   is random error. For the two groups of households (male-
                                                   j    j j
headed, m, and female-headed, f ), we can write: Yit = Xit Î² + j
                                                               it , where the superscript

indicates the gender of household i's head.

   For these two groups, the average dierence in o-farm return, D = E (Yit          m
                                                                             ) âˆ’ E (Yit ),
can be decomposed into three components:


 D = [(E (Xit
           f          m
              ) âˆ’ E (Xit )) Î² m ] + [E (Xit
                                         m
                                            ) (Î² f âˆ’ Î² m )] + [(E (Xit
                                                                    f          m
                                                                       ) âˆ’ E (Xit )) (Î² f âˆ’ Î² m )] (3)



                         f
The rst component, [E (Xit         m
                            ) âˆ’ E (Xit )] Î² m , represents return-dierential attributable
to dierences in endowments.            The second component, E (Xit
                                                                  m
                                                                     ) (Î² f âˆ’ Î² m ), reects
return gap due to dierences in marginal returns to these endowments. And the nal
                f
component, [E (Xit         m
                   ) âˆ’ E (Xit )] (Î² f âˆ’ Î² m ), reects the interaction of gaps in endowments
and marginal returns to these endowments (see Blinder (1973) and Oaxaca (1973))
   Equation (3) compares female-headed households' return against that of male-
headed households. In eect, male-headed households' vector of coecients is taken as
a reference vector of marginal returns. Alternatively, a `neutral' vector of coecients,
Î² âˆ— , could be used (in place of Î² m ) to attribute the return gap to gender-based
discrimination.14 We can then decompose the return gap into two components: the
part that is    `explained' by endowment dierences, [E (Xit
                                                          f          m
                                                             ) âˆ’ E (Xit )] Î² âˆ— , and the part
that is   `unexplained', E (Xit
                             f
                                ) (Î² f âˆ’ Î² âˆ— ) + E (Xit

                                                                               ) (Î² âˆ— âˆ’ Î² m ]      (4)


The part that is not explained by endowment dierence could be considered as a result
of discrimination against women in RNFE (see Jann (2008)). This, however, assumes
that there are no omitted variables that could explain the return gap. In reality, there
are observable and unobservable variables that are potentially omitted from the model.
Therefore, the unexplained return gap could be the result of discrimination and/or
omitted variables.


  14 There are a number of approaches for constructing the neutral coecient,   Î²âˆ—.   We adopt a simple
average of marginal returns for male- and female-headed households (Reimers, 1983: CI Jann, 2008)



                                                   17
   The above decomposition is based only on those households that are participating
in RNFE. Therefore, we need to correct for selection (into RNFE) bias (see Heckman
(1976) and Heckman (1979)). In the presence of selection bias, the error term ( it ) in
the return equation aboveYit = Xit Î² +    it will   have a non-zero conditional mean, i.e.
E ( it |Xit , Yit > 0) = 0. It has been extensively documented that access to opportunities
to diversify, especially into more lucrative activities in RNFE, does not seem to be evenly
distributed. There are signicant entry barriers into RNFE (Reardon, 1997); well-
o household have disproportional access to RNFE (Woldehanna and Oskam, 2001;
Reardon, 1997); geographically isolated households might not take full advantage of
RNFE (Lanjouw et al., 2001) or might be forced to diversify more to satisfy own demand
for diverse consumption (Omamo, 1998: cited in Barrett et al., 2001).


   Therefore, Blinder-Oxaca decomposition with Heckman correction is employed to
address the selection bias. This involves a two-step procedure, and the correction
procedure needs to satisfy the exclusion restrictioni.e. at least one variable that
drives participation, but not return, is identiedif it were not to rely on a very strong
assumption, specically the joint normality of the error terms in the selection and return
equations. In this study, we argue that households' ownership of agricultural resources
such as land and livestock is inversely correlated with their participation in o-farm
activities, but it is unlikely to inuence return from non-farm activities. Households
that own more farmland compared to the number of adult members who are able to
work are more likely focus on agriculture. Similarly, ownership of oxen, an important
farm input, could encourage households to devote their time to farming. However,
the ownership of pack animals such as horses and donkeys is deliberately excluded as
one might argue that those who own pack animals are more likely to be productive
in some non-farm activities such as trade and provision of shipping services. There
are potentially contradictory arguments as to why ownership of agricultural resources
might also inuence non-farm returns, in addition to participation in the sector. First,
due to the physical eort requirements, households that own more farm resources and

                                            18
hence engaged in agriculture are not only less likely to engage in o-farm activities
but also earn lower return from these activities. This argument, however, is not quite
valid in context of Ethiopia and Uganda where agriculture is rainfed and its labor
requirements are very seasonal. On the contrary, others might argue that households
with more agricultural resources generally earn high non-farm return due to inherent
ability. This might be true in a context where the non-farm sector is skill intensive and
requires sophisticated know-how. However, rural non-farm activities tend to be low
skilled employment and/or operation of labor intensive non-farm enterprises.



4.     Results



4.1. Determinants of Participation
     We have descriptively shown above that female-headed households have limited
access to RNFE. In addition to gender, a number factors could be contributing to low
participation. To study whether female-headed households' participation probability is
still lower after accounting for other determinants, we estimate a logit model and the
results are presented in Table 2. The dependent variable is a participation dummy,
which is equal to one if the household engages in any o-farm activity and zero
otherwise. For the purpose of analysis, the sample is divided into rural areas and
rural+ areas, which includes households in rural areas and small towns in Ethiopia and
households in rural areas and other urban centers excluding Kampala in Uganda.


     After controlling for other factors, the gender of the household head seems not
to inuence the probability of participation in RNFE of Ethiopia.           Whereas, in
Uganda, female-headed households continue to have lower probability of participating
in the sector even after accounting for other factors. Some characteristics such as
household head's education level, household size, dependency ratio, asset ownership,
and frequency of shocks stand out as major determinants of participation. In both


                                           19
countries, households with more educated heads are more likely to participate in RNFE.
This evidence is consistent with the argument that economic activities in the non-
agricultural sector tend to require specialized skills. On the other hand, households
with a high dependency ratio and very old heads are less likely to participate in RNFE.


   In Ethiopia, large household size and frequent exposure to shocks are positively
associated with participation, but households that own livestock are less likely to
engage in o-farm activities. This could be an indication that push factorsshocks
and limited agricultural resourcesplay a signicant role in encouraging households
to diversify outside agriculture. Distance from roads and market also matter. In
Ethiopia, households that are located farther from roads tend to participate less in
RNFE. Residing far from a market also decreases participation probability in Uganda,
but seems to increase participation in Ethiopia.

We also control for climatic conditions (precipitation during the wettest season and mean annual

   As noted above, women become household heads under dierent circumstances,
and male spouses typically tend to be the household heads whenever they are present
in the households. Here, we analyze the heterogeneity in participation gap across

heads with dierent marital statuses. Table 3 presents the heterogeneous participation
probability dierences between male- and female-headed households with dierent
marital status.15 In Ethiopia, there is no statistically signicant dierence in the gender
gap in participation by marital status of the female-head. It should also be noted that,
as shown in Table 2, there is no overall dierence in participation between male-and
female-headed households. On the other hand, married female heads in Uganda have
less participation than married male household heads. It should be noted that 42
percent of the male spouses of female-headed households are migrants. However, there
is no dierence in participation between never married, divorced or widow/widower
male- and female-heads.

   The results presented in Table 2 show determinants of participation in RNFE for
both male- and female-headed households. In order to identify the factors that are
strongly associated with female participation in RNFE, each variable in equation 1 is
  15 The results presented in Table 3 are based on re-estimation of Equation 1 by introducing additional
interaction between gender dummy with marital status of the head as follows:


Pit = Î±1 F emaleâˆ—N everM arriedi +Î±2 F emaleâˆ—M arriedi +Î±3 F emaleâˆ—Divorcedi +Î±4 F emaleâˆ—W idowi +Xit Î² +Âµit

Where, the vector   Xit   includes, in addition to the covariates included in main estimation results
presented in Table 2, four dummies corresponding to marital status of the household head. We also
excluded the constant term to allow the coecients   Î±1 -Î±4   to represent comparison between female and
male heads with corresponding marital status.

interacted with a dummy for female household head.16 The results show that households
headed by females with primary or secondary education are more likely to engage
in RNFE both in Uganda and Ethiopia. While, households headed by older females
tend to engage less in RNFE. High dependency ratio decreases participation in RNFE,
more strongly in Uganda. Female-headed households that own sucient agricultural
resources appear to engage more in agriculture instead of RNFE (Table A.6).


4.2. Return Gap
    In this section, we present the results from the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition of
return. As noted in the introduction, households self-select into the non-farm sector.
Therefore, return gap analysis among households that are in the sector would be biased
if such selection bias is not addressed. Accordingly, in all the decomposition results
presented in Table 4, we apply Heckman's correction for selection biases. This typically
involves a two-step procedure where a selection equation is estimated rst, and return
decomposition is conducted after accounting for selection probabilities estimated in the
rst stage. The correction procedure needs to satisfy an exclusion restrictioni.e. at
least one variable that drives participation, but not return, is identiedif it were not
to rely on a very strong assumption, specically the joint normality of the error terms in
the selection and return equations. In this study, we argue that households' ownership
of agricultural resources such as land and livestock is inversely correlated with their
participation in o-farm activities. Households that possess such resources typically
engage in agriculture, and this somehow limits their engagement in o-farm activities
(Table 3). However, possession of such resources is unlikely to inuence return from
non-farm activities.


    In the return analysis, we control for the following covariates: household character-

  16 In other words, we estimate the following equation:    Pit = Î± + [F emale âˆ— Xit ] Î² + Âµit   ...where   Xit
is the same covariates as in equation 1, and   Female   is a dummy equal to one if the household head is
female and zero otherwise.



                                                   23
istics, shocks, community characteristics, climate, and zone FEs in Ethiopia (region-
urban/rural FEs in Uganda).        Household characteristics include household head's age
and age squared, head's education, household size, and dependency ratio.                    Shocks
include exposure to natural shocks such as drought, landslide etc., and health shocks
as well as frequency of the three major shocks households have faced in the past year.
Community characteristics include distances from market, roads and national borders.
Climate refers to precipitation during the wettest season, mean annual temperature,
and topography.       In addition to these variables, the selection equation includes
ownership and amount of agricultural resources: dummy for usufruct/ownership right
over farmland and the per adult size landholding, dummy for ownership of livestock
and number of livestock owned, and dummy for poultry ownership.


   After accounting for selection bias, we conduct analysis of the return gap between
female- and male-headed households that are participating in RNFE.17 The return
decomposition results reveal that female-headed households in both countries are placed
at a relative disadvantage. The results are presented in Table 4, which includes four sets
of decomposition for each country. In both countries, under all of the four alternative
sets of decomposition, female-headed households earned signicantly less from engaging
in RNFE. In Ethiopia, for instance, female-headed households earned 29 percent less
in gross non-farm return than male-headed households. This return gap, accompanied
by similar levels of return gap in farming (see Aguilar et al. (2015)), would have huge
adverse welfare eects on female-headed households. The net-return gap is even greater:
37 and 40 percent in rural+ areas and rural areas of Ethiopia, respectively.


   Similarly, the gross return gaps are as high as 61 percent in Uganda. In terms of
net-return, the gender gaps in rural+ areas and rural areas of Uganda are 56 and 60
percent, respectively.18
  17 We consider two measures of returns: gross and net return.
  18 These kinds of return gaps between women and men are not unique to non-farm sectors of Ethiopia
and Uganda.   As documented in Hertz et al. (2009), the gender gap in both non-agricultural and



                                                24
    Female-headed households in rural areas are at a much greater disadvantage,
compared to those in rural+ areas. For instance, in Ethiopia, the net return gap in
rural areas is 38 percent, which is 3 percentage points higher than the gap in rural+
areas. The net return gap in rural areas is also high in Uganda: 60 percent, which is
higher by 4 percentage points compared to the gender gap in rural+ areas.


    The return gaps are further decomposed into two: (1) the part that is explained
by dierences in endowments; and (2) the portion that is not explained by endowment
dierences and hence could be the result of gender bias and/or omitted variables. In
Ethiopia, the major portion of the gender gap in return is not explained by dierences
in endowments of physical and human capital, exposure to shocks and access to
infrastructure. In fact, all of the dierences in return between female- and male-
headed households seem to be unexplained by endowment, and could be the result
of discrimination against female. The result is similar in both rural areas and rural+
areas. In Uganda, we nd that part of the gender gap is explained by the endowment
dierence both in rural and rural+ areas. The large proportion of the gender gap remains
unexplained by endowment dierence in Uganda as wellreecting a potential gender
based discrimination in the RNFE. The nding that a good portion of the return gap
remains unexplained by endowment dierences is indicative of discrimination against
women entrepreneurs and employees in the sector. Of course, unobserved factors such
as innate ability could also be responsible for the return gap (Table 4).

approximation.      In Ethiopia, the gross return gaps in rural  areas and rural areas are 29 and 30

percent, respectively. In Uganda, the corresponding return gaps are 61 and 65 percent. In terms of
                                       +
net-return, the gender gaps in rural       areas (& rural areas) in Ethiopia and Uganda are 37 (& 40) and

56 (& 60) percent, respectively.




    Heterogeneity by marital status : There are substantial heterogeneities in return gap
between female- and male-headed households with dierent marital status, especially
in Uganda. Widow household heads in Uganda earn substantially less than widower
heads. Similarly, divorced and married female-heads earn less than male-heads with the
corresponding marital status. Whereas, households with never married female heads

have lower return than those with never married male heads.


     In Ethiopia, households headed by married females earned less than those head by
married males. In rural Ethiopia, divorced female heads have had a lower gross return
than divorced male heads. However, there is no statistically signicant gender gap
between widows/widowers and never married household heads.

5.     Conclusion


     A number of previous studies have shown that RNFE oers a decent alternative
income source and improves well-being. The extent of women's engagement in and

                                           27
their returns from RNFE is not clearly documented, and previous studies seem to oer
contrasting accounts. This study investigates the relative position of female-headed
households in accessing employment/self-employment in RNFE and the amount of
earnings.


   We nd that returns from RNFE account for a fairly high share of household
income, especially in Uganda where about 50 percent of gross household income
originates from o-farm activities. In Ethiopia, only 28 percent of gross household
income is from o-farm activities. There are also signicant gender gaps in access
to salaried employment and self-employment in RNFE. For instance, only 7 percent
of female-headed households in Ethiopia had salaried o-farm employment and 20
percent of them owned a non-farm enterprise, compared respectively to 9 percent and
24 percent of male-headed households. Analysis of industry of employment and self-
employment shows that, in both countries, female-headed households have less access
to potentially more rewarding industries such as manufacturing, and transport and
communications. In addition, enterprises owned by female-headed households typically
operate near/inside the residence, and engage in processing of agricultural outputs
instead of non-agricultural businesses. These enterprises were also typically established
using own resources as a start-up capital.


   Results from the return analysis reveal that female-headed households benet less
from engagement in RNFE. Female-headed households in Ethiopia and Uganda earned
less gross return than male-headed households. In addition, the major portion of the
gender gap in return remains unexplained by dierences in endowments, especially in
Ethiopia.


   Four direct policy implications are drawn based on the ndings from this research:
(1) The analysis presented in this paper shows that there are noticeable gender gaps
in access to some industries. These access gaps are likely to translate into return gaps,

                                             28
especially when females do not manage to engage in industries with high return and
substantial entry barriers. Policy makers need to adopt policies that facilitate females'
participation in industries that have high returns such as construction, transport and
mining, but where socio-cultural factors limit female participation. For instance, female
employees could be selectively targeted in public infrastructure investments such as
road construction within their communities. Due to common social practices and
cultural role assignments such as increased responsibilities bestowed upon women to
care for children and elderly, encouraging female participation in national road projects
might however be challenging. (2) Education is identied as one of the major drivers
of participation in non-farm employment and self-employment. Policy measures that
address the skill shortage among females could improve their chance of accessing the
RNFE. Even short-term training to improve employability and business skills could
help alleviate the skills and know-how challenges facing female-headed households. (3)
Non-farm enterprise owners, both female and male, reported that they rely extensively
on personal savings/incomes to start their enterprises. Only a handful of enterprise
owners (less than 5%) were able to access loan from formal nancial sources such as
credit/savings associations, micro-nance or banks to start their business. Policies
that improve access to nance could help level the playing eld for poor female-headed
households that have limited personal resources to start a lucrative non-farm enterprise
that would require large initial capital. (4) Return analysis shows that female-headed
households earn less, and endowment gaps explain only part of the return gaps. Policy
measures that address gaps in human and nancial capital (outlined in points 2 &
3 above) could address some of the endowment gaps, and hence reduce the return
dierential. However, most of the return gaps remain unexplained, and hence policy
makers would also need to address gender based discrimination in the non-farm sector
to reduce the gender gap in return.

We also control for climatic conditions (precipitation during the wettest season and mean annual
temperature) and topography.       In addition, for Ethiopia, we have included zone FEs in all of the
regressions. For Uganda, we have also included region and rural-urban FEs.
