  There is an additional expense for connection that has to be borne by the household after the network is operational, in addition to the public deposit
contributed. Since the payment of the public deposit, which is <INR 5,000/household is a substantial investment already made by the household, its payment
encourages households to make the balance (but smaller) additional investment for connection and plumbing within the house, thereby improving network
utilization.

  GoTN has instructed cities vide a government circular that deposits cannot exceed INR 5,000 per household (as a weighted average amount for the city)
In order to adhere to this, a graded structure was devised in most cities based on the plinth area, such that the weighted average amount for the entire city
amounts to INR 5,000/household.

  It was observed that the towns used a mix of strategies to encourage households to pay the public deposit, and subsequently connect to the network.
These included provisions for payment in installments, enforcing regulatory provisions mandating households to connect to a network when available within
100 meter (m) of the household boundary, and expending significant resources towards communication and awareness generation within the community on
the need to connect to the network.
5
   Low collection efficiency was reported in three of the eight towns. The reasons are linked to use of official figures for registered users only (whereas
unauthorized users may also be connected and using the network, with the utility working on rectifying this situation) and ongoing works related to provisioning
of connections (especially work in progress within the household premises). The report discusses this issue in more detail, and the reasons for the low
connection efficiency in some cities.
6
  Funding provided under TNUDF mandated that ULBs pass council resolutions to provide sewer connections only after payment of the public deposit. Most
ULBs have also resolved to increase tariffs and deposit rates every five years, which was an incentive for beneficiaries to contribute the public deposits early
in the project cycle.
7
  In case a household does not pay the deposit, the connection chamber outside the house boundary is provided by the ULB, however, connection with the
household chamber is not provided.
8
  The impact of public deposit collection on annuity and user fees is on account of reduction in the loan required for CAPEX funding. This reduction may only
be realized in cities where CAPEX funding is dependent on the loan and user charges go towards capital repayment.

   Computed for the actual number of households connected to the network.
12
   The lower deposit collection efficiency appears to have been a result of a lack of drive on the part of the ULB which may, in turn, be a result of no direct
incentive for the ULB to raise funds from public deposit contribution. In the absence of any loan and the entire project funds coming through grants, collection
of the public deposits does not appear to have been a priority and may have suffered.
13
   In Sivaganga, the deposit collection drive has been slow, due to delay in implementation owing to change of land and also due to a litigation.
14
   The lower collection of deposits in Sivaganga is on account of delay in the project commissioning due to an ongoing litigation at the National Green Tribunal
related to the STP site.
15
   While all public deposits are aimed to be collected prior to project commissioning to contribute towards the project CAPEX, in reality, deposit collection
from all targeted households can extend beyond commissioning, whence CAPEX funding requirements have already been met. In such cases, the deposit
collected can go into a revenue account.

   The project was originally designed for a target of 6,500 households (covering the denser areas of the city). The city has now expanded to 55.24 square
kilometer (km2) from the original area of 10.24 km2. If we consider the target of 6,500 households under the project, the city has achieved more than 100
percent household connections, and is meeting connection demands on a priority basis.
25
   Connection efficiency increases to 111 percent with the originally targeted connections.
26
   While connections from the household compound wall to the manholes have been provided for all the households, provision of internal plumbing within
the household premises is still underway, and this percentage reflects the actual number of household where work related to internal plumbing has also been
executed. The municipality is in the process of ensuring connections for the balance households as well.

    under the TNUDP is based on the MBR+RO treatment                            A mix of grant funds, loans and public equity through deposit
    technology with the objective of treating wastewater                        collection was utilized for implementing the sewerage projects
    up to tertiary treatment levels and reusing the treated                     in Tamil Nadu. All cities studied had a significant share of
    wastewater for industrial use. Annex 6 discusses the                        the project cost covered through grant support, as may be
    salient features of this scheme (under implementation in                    observed from Table 11. It may be surmised, however, that

3.	 Cost of project: The cost of providing sewerage                             cities is relatively higher as compared to that in projects
    infrastructure comprising both the network and STP                          implemented under the TNUDP III. The share of loan and

    TNUDP III (except the scheme based on the advanced
    MBR+RO treatment technology) as compared to the                             As is evident from Table 11 and Figure 1, the following
                                                                                key observations can be made related to funding of capital
    projects implemented with NRCP support. This is
                                                                                expense:

    implemented after the NRCP projects, and that most
                                                                                1.	 Schemes implemented with NRCP support have a

    in the NRCP schemes. It should be pointed out that,
                                                                                    or no loan component at all (two of the three schemes

    on the basis of the least cost for the bill of quantities                   2.	 The schemes implemented under TNUDP-III have a
    provided in the bid documents; the TNUDP III projects                           varying mix of both grant and loan to meet the capital
    provided flexibility to the bidders to choose the treatment                     expense, with the share of loan ranging from 20-45
    technology option that would be cost-effective and meet                         percent of the total project cost. The loan-grant mix

  The funding pattern across cities included under TNUDP III varies (varying loan-grant blends), based on the borrowing capacity of ULBs, as well as the
capacity of ULBs to service the loan raised to meet capital expenses. The approach adopted by ULBs to determine the loan-grant blend is discussed in Box 1.

leads to revenue deficit.
31
   DS/TR – Debt Servicing/Total Revenue – should be less than 30 percent; the ULB incurs roughly about 45 percent on an average for establishment, and
20 percent for O&M. Therefore, if debt servicing is at 30 percent, it leaves them with a minimum surplus. This is based on a thumb rule and there are no

   Based on actual HSC provided @ INR 5,000/household.
34
   The lower deposit collection efficiency appears to have been a result of a lack of drive on the part of the ULB which may, in turn, be a result of no
direct incentive for the ULB to raise funds from the public deposit contribution. In the absence of any loan and all project funds coming through grants,
collection of the public deposits does not appear to have been a priority and may have suffered.
35
    This is 111 percent based on the original number of targeted households as the originally targeted number of households was 6,500, and the
connections are based on this number. The area within the municipal boundary was subsequently increased, along with the scope of the sewerage
scheme.
36
   In Sivaganga, the deposit collection drive has been slow, due to delay in implementation owing to change of land and also due to litigation.
37
   The lower collection of deposits in Sivaganga is on account of delay in project commissioning due to an ongoing litigation at the National Green
Tribunal related to the STP site.
38
   The only exception appears to be Karur, where only 37 percent of households are reported to have official connections. Interviews with the ULB staff,
however, indicated that the actual number of connections is much higher, and close to about 12,000 households (while 5,503 connections are legitimate
connections, the balance are unauthorized, and are in the process of being regularized by the ULB).
39
   This estimate is for deposits actually collected by ULBs and not the deposits targeted to be collected based on 100 percent HSCs.

  This is estimated when considering the utility as a whole (and considering the expenses and revenues for seven plants). When looking at individual plants,
the sale of treated wastewater can meet almost a 100 percent of the plant’s O&M requirements. This is discussed in more detail in subsequent sections.

on a DBFOT basis. The project is being implemented on               The project will result in benefits for all stakeholders, ensuring
a PPP basis for a concession period of 30 years (including          that untreated sewage is not being discharged into the sea,
two years of construction), with the TMC responsible for            thereby controlling water pollution resulting from rampant
providing land for construction and supply of sewage free of        dumping of untreated sewage and providing industries access
