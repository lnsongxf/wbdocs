                             EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Gambia is the smallest country in continental Africa and is surrounded by Senegal,
except for a 60 km Atlantic Ocean front. The economy is largely dependent on agriculture,
which accounted for around 25 percent of GDP over 1994-2013 and provides an activity
for 70 percent of the labor force. The industrial sector (about 15 percent of GDP over the
same period), consists mostly of construction and agro-processing activities. Services
accounted for 60 percent of GDP, with trade and transport, and communications being its
two largest components. Tourism is Gambia’s primary foreign-exchange earner.

With a per capita income at $500 in 2013, The Gambia is among the poorest countries in
Africa. Poverty remains widespread in spite of a decline in the last decade; the overall
poverty headcount index still stands at 48.5 percent - with a poverty line at 1.25 a day - in
2010. This reflects gains in education and health. While mixed, there has also been progress
in the areas of public sector, economic and fiscal management, civil service and justice
reform, anti-corruption and public procurement reform. However, The Gambia remains
vulnerable to external shocks as the main sources of domestically generated foreign
exchange come from tourism and re-export trade whose fate depend largely on exogenous
factors. In addition, a major part of the labor force is engaged in farming, and agriculture is
vulnerable to weather conditions.

– which in itself depends on weather             -6.0
conditions - and the ability of the other
sectors of the economy, especially tourism, to eventually counterbalance swings in output
are key elements that explain growth variability. In addition, over the past two decades,
although total investment has been catching up with SSA it has remained below what was
observed for low income countries and small states. Over 1993-2012, gross fixed capital
formation averaged 13.9 percent of GDP in The Gambia compared with 17.1 percent for

                                                                                                51
SSA, 20.5 percent for LICs and 25.7 percent for small states. Finally, a challenging and
unpredictable macroeconomic policy environment characterized by sudden policy shifts,
extra-budgetary spending, excessive borrowing, weak institutions and a lack of
transparency has affected growth. This has generated uncertainty and hampered economic
activity, and over the long term undermined confidence in the economy. For example,
persistent fiscal deficits have largely been financed by short-term domestic borrowing,
pushing up interest rates and crowding out private sector investments.

Given past growth patterns, an important challenge confronting The Gambia is to find ways
to foster steadier and higher economic growth. This can be done, first, by reinforcing
growth generating sectors. In this respect, tourism and agriculture and are key sectors to
support, given their share in employment (agriculture), their income generation
capabilities (both sectors), FOREX earnings abilities (tourism) and countercyclical
potential (tourism). Related sector policies are developed in Volume 3 of this report.
Secondly, specific economy wide issues also affect the country’s growth prospect and are
now analyzed in detail.

Economy-wide influences on growth: finance, trade and energy.

Besides macroeconomic policies and purely sectoral issues, other factors are at play in The
Gambia that affect firms ability of operate, invest and ultimately generate growth. The
working of the financial system – and its weaknesses – influences the little funds that can
be directed to investment. Issues related to trade and electricity supply also affect firm’s
operations and therefore long term growth in the country.

The Gambia’s financial sector consists of commercial banks, insurance companies, foreign
exchange bureaus, microfinance institutions and other non-bank finance companies. It is
relatively small and is dominated by a highly concentrated banking system - in terms of
banks' assets, of credit and of deposits: concentration is high with the six largest banks
accounting for 81 percent of assets in the system while the top four borrowers account for
54 percent of the total loan portfolio. Competition for deposits combined with high funding
and operating costs limits banks' profitability. Other elements of the system are much
smaller, for example microfinance only accounts for about 0.25 percent of the population
in terms of borrowers and depositors. The financial sector as a whole does not fulfill one of
its key role which is to promote sustained growth by channeling savings to profitable
investment opportunities. Access to finance remains indeed a key issue in The Gambia and
is impeded by banks' high operating costs, some crowding out by government debt, high
interest rates and collateral requirements, and the mismatch between bank’s requirements
and firms abilities.

Trade has traditionally played an important role in the economy of The Gambia as the
country used to play the role of a regional entrepôt. As of 2012, Import and Export of goods
and services accounted for 79 percent of GDP. The importance of trade in the economy is
predominantly driven by the role of imports; in 2012, they amounted to 47 percent of GDP.
The composition of Gambian exports has been highly variable, reflecting the importance of

                                                                                          52
re-export trade. In the past, the Gambian development and trade strategies were largely
based on reaping the long-held advantages of the country as an entrepôt. The Gambia's re-
exports are currently estimated at 85-88 percent of gross exports and are mainly directed
to West African countries.

However, the re-export sector has become less attractive over time. Trade policy changes
have eroded the country’s advantage as a trade hub (especially the ECOWAS CET
implementation) and, owing to weak logistics (Gambia’s performance on most components
of the Logistics Performance Index is worse in 2014 than it was in 2007,) and limitations of
the port - high shipping rates and equipment deficiencies - the sector appears at risk.

Finally, electricity supply remains a major impediment to growth in The Gambia. Strengths
of the sector include good staff skills, a relatively new transmission and distribution
network (T&D), an established prepaid metering system and the possibility to connect to
the OMVG in the medium term. Weaknesses are however significant and include a lack of
fuel diversity, a deficient planning capacity, technical design weaknesses (such as the lack
of redundancies in T&D), a poor MIS and NAWEC’s debt. All of this contributes to increase
prices and make the quality and reliability of the electricity a major issue for the private
sector.

CHAPTER 1. MACROECONOMIC PATTERNS: AN UNSTABLE AND
MODERATE LONG TERM GROWTH.


1.      The situation in The Gambia is a good example of the many challenges faced by small
states. The country is faced with institutional capacity constraints, and due to a narrow
resource base and a small domestic market, its production base and exports show little
diversification. Tourism and groundnuts remain the leading exports and are key sources of
foreign exchange. Like other small states, the country tends to rely heavily on external trade
and foreign investment to overcome its scale and resource limitations, increasing its
vulnerability to external shocks. Growth in recent decades in the Gambia has accelerated,
but not at pace with the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa and is below the regional average. As a
result, with a per capita income at $500 (2013), and a ranking of 172 out of 187 countries
in the Human Development Index (2014), Gambia is among the poorest countries in the
world, and among the poorest in Africa.

2.     Poverty remains widespread in The Gambia, although there has been a marked
decline in the last decade. The overall poverty headcount index declined to 48.5 percent at
the national poverty line (roughly $1.25 a day) in 2010 from 58 percent in 200324. Income
inequality has also diminished over the corresponding years with the reduction in the
incidence of poverty. The GINI coefficient, which measures the distribution of income and
for which 100 percent represents maximum inequality, has slightly improved, diminishing
46.2 percent in 2003, and most recently to 45.8 percent in 2010 (and down further from
46.6 percent in 1998). Despite these gains, food insecurity is high and The Gambia remains
heavily reliant on food imports, which account for one third of merchandise imports.

I. GROWTH PATTERNS.
1.1. An unstable growth.

3.    Over the past twenty years - from 1994 through 2013 - annual real GDP growth in
The Gambia averaged a modest 3.5 percent a year, against an average of 4.1 percent for
SSA. The GDP path was also highly variable (Chart A.1). Alternating periods of expansion
and contraction were largely tied to swings in agricultural production and the ability of
other sectors to compensate. Hence, the economy has periodically benefited from
countervailing dynamics across the key sectors. For example, overall economic activity has
been partially supported by services during periods of weak or negative agricultural sector
outturns, providing for some buffer to the drag on growth. This is evident during the 2011
drought25 and in 2006, when agricultural production contracted and services sector
expansions largely offset the drag on activity. Correspondingly, The Gambia’s GDP growth

24- The overall poverty rates are estimates from the 2010 and 2003 Integrated Household Budget Surveys, and while not directly
comparable, indicate nonetheless a significant reduction in poverty.

25   - The severe drought in 2011 resulted in a 36 percent collapse in crop production, and led to a 4.3 percent contraction in GDP.

                                                                                                                                       54
was substantially buoyed by the robust 2008 harvest, which supported above trend growth
despite a contraction in services sector activity (Chart 1).

4.      However, as the population growth rate, which averaged 3.1 percent from 1994
through 2013, has nearly matched the pace of GDP growth in The Gambia, on a per capita
basis GDP growth has been limited. Considering comparator data for the two decades from
1993 through 2012 (through which period data is available) with other developing
countries, The Gambia achieved a cumulative increase in per capita GDP of 5.1 percent26,
significantly lagging behind the cumulative average increases of 45.0 percent and 46.3
percent, respectively, for all low income countries and small states worldwide. Growth in
developing Sub-Saharan African countries was weaker with a cumulative increase of 25
percent, but nevertheless fivefold stronger than in The Gambia. Considering the most
recent decade of 2003 through 2012, The Gambia’s average per capita growth rate
accelerated - rising to an average of 0.5 percent per annum from zero in the previous
decade - but more markedly lags that of SSA developing countries, which recorded
acceleration in the average per capita growth rate to 2.3 percent from 0.2 percent over the
same period. (Error! Reference source not found.).

26 - The difference between the cumulative rates of GDP per capita over the two periods - 5.1 percent for 1993-2012 and 6.6 percent for

1994-2013 - reflect the lower GDP per capita growth of 0.1 percent in 1993 versus 1.6 percent in 2013, i.e., a 1.5 percentage point
difference.

                                                                                                                                   55

5.      A number of factors might have contributed to this weaker growth performance, but
a record of improved macroeconomic policy conditions across the subset of SSA countries
supporting the stronger SSA-regional growth outturn suggests that The Gambia’s track
record of inconsistent and ad hoc shifts in policies is of importance (Box A.1 and Table 1).
Over the last two decades, The Gambia has enjoyed two periods of relatively strong growth
- from 1997 through 2001, and from 2007 through 2010 - when GDP expanded by average
rates of growth of 5.2 percent and 5.6 percent, respectively. These periods of strengthened
activity were tied in part to good harvests with an agricultural expansion averaging 10.7
percent and 11.8 percent, respectively. Improved macroeconomic policy implementation
was also conducive to growth; as indicated, for example, by relatively more sustainable
fiscal positions, contained inflationary pressures, and stable exchange rates. Further,
during both of these periods, The Gambia was pursuing IMF supported economic reform
programs—guided by the Gambia’s longstanding key growth and development policy
document, Vision 2020, published in 1996.

6.    However, growth faltered markedly in 2002 and 2011. In both cases, The Gambia
experienced extreme weather conditions that led to contractions in agricultural sector

                                                                                                                                                           56
production of 18 percent in 2002 and 36 percent in 2011, which contributed to the
contractions in real GDP of 3.2 percent and 4.3 percent, respectively. These economic
disruptions also correspond with deteriorations in the macroeconomic policy framework,
evident for example in the first period with an extremely sharp rise in the fiscal deficit in
2001 and ahead of the onset of drought. For both periods, the fiscal deficit expanded to
unsustainably high levels - equivalent to 8.5 percent and 4.7 percent of GDP in 2001 and
2011, respectively. Deterioration in market confidence is indicated by an estimated two-
fold and three-fold rise in capital flight over the same periods, respectively.

1.2. A relatively weak investment.

7.    Investment activity remains relatively weak in The Gambia. Over the past two
decades through 2012, total investment as a share of GDP has been catching up with SSA,
but remains below what is observed for low income countries and small states (Chart A.2).
Over 1993-2012, gross fixed capital formation averaged 13.9 percent of GDP in The Gambia
compared with 17.1 percent for SSA, 20.5 percent for LICs and 25.7 percent for small states.

8.     During the two strong growth and reform periods (1997-01 and 2007-10),
investment activity initially strengthened, but then weakened along with private sector
credit growth as policy slippages became manifest. The growth rate of gross fixed capital
formation was close to zero at the start of both periods, but surged as reforms advanced
over the years; peaking at 30 percent in 2000 and 39 percent in 2009. In December 2008,
The Gambia achieved completion of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative
and substantial debt forgiveness, which might have helped support the especially sharp

                                                                                          57
upswing in investment in 2009. With the subsequent policy deterioration following the
periods of growth and reform, investment faltered, decelerating to a 1 percent growth rate
in 2001, and contracting by 14 percent in 2011. Corresponding to the rise in the fiscal
deficits in 2001 and 2011, the growth rates of domestic credit to the private sector also
decelerated markedly. During 1997-2001, and 2007-2010, credit to the private sector
expanded by average annual growth rates of 30 percent and 18 percent, respectively. With
deterioration in the macroeconomic policy environment, including the expansions in the
government’s domestic borrowing requirement, growth in credit to the private sector
decelerated to 0.6 percent and 5.3 percent in 2002 and 2011, respectively (Chart 3. ).

9.     In addition, The Gambia’s real effective exchange rate (REER)27 has generally
depreciated over the past two decades, and posted strong depreciation in the early-2000s.
For The Gambia, sustained periods of depreciation seem to have contributed to higher
domestic investment rates in the 2000s, which strengthened from very low levels in the
1990s. Subsequently, the REER has been relatively stable, at least until 2013, and
investment activity has remained relatively consistent as a share of GDP, except for 2008,
when there was a dip in investment activity with the onset of the global financial crisis
(Chart 3).

Chart 13. Investment and REER.




Source: WDI, September 2014

10.    In comparison, the median REER for SSA developing countries depreciated by 22
percent over the two decades through 2012, versus 57 percent for The Gambia over the
same period. And, as a share of GDP, gross domestic investment in developing SSA rose
from an average of 16.3 percent during 1993-2002 to 19.1 percent during 2003-2012,

27 - The real effective exchange rate is the nominal effective exchange rate (a measure of the value of a currency against a weighted

average of several foreign currencies) divided by a price deflator or index of costs. For small open economies, such as The Gambia, REER
depreciation tends to promote growth, as it increases the demand for domestically produced goods by reducing their relative price
compared with imported goods. It also supports tradables by improving relative prices, i.e., supports the competitiveness of Gambian
exporters. Finally, sustained depreciations support growth by raising the relative profitability of investing in tradables.

                                                                                                                                    58
whereas in The Gambia it rose from a very low average of 6.1 percent to 19.8 percent over
the same period. In comparison, gross domestic investment averaged 20.5 percent and 22.4
percent for low-income countries (LICs) during the decades of 1993-2002 and 2003 and
2012, respectively. And, among developing small states, gross domestic investment
averaged 26 percent during 1993-2002 and 25.1 percent during 2003-2012.

1.3. Recent developments.

recently, as the fiscal deficit deteriorated sharply in 2013 to 8.8 percent from 4.5 percent
of GDP in 201228. Preliminary estimates indicate that the fiscal deficit deteriorated further
to an estimated 13.3 percent of GDP in 2014. Aside from pronounced fiscal slippage, there
were sudden shifts in the exchange rate policy during the third quarter of the 2013, when
the Office of the President issued a series of directives that variously set the value of the
Gambian Dalasi against the US-dollar to about 20 percent to 25 percent above the
previously market-determined exchange rate. The exchange rate policy shifts, which
included controls on US-dollar shipments, led to heightened uncertainty and contributed
to a jump in borrowing costs, as predictability and transparency of policy determination
diminished greatly. Government borrowing interest rates rose as a consequence—from
about 12 percent (or about 6.2 percent real) in June 2013 to about 18.5 percent (or about
12.7 percent real) in October 2013 for one-year treasury bills—before the government
reintroduced a flexible, market determined exchange rate. For 2013, capital flight is
estimated at US$ 88 million, or the equivalent of about 10 percent of GDP29. Again, in early
May 2015, a significant exchange rate policy shift happened. GoG and the CBRG set a new
nominal rate for the dalasi (to be exchanged in a 35-40 dalasi to a dollar band) coupled with
restrictions on capital movements according to which no foreign exchange movement of
more than ten thousand dollars, euros and pound sterling can be taken out of The Gambia
without approval from the Office of the President.

12.    Real GDP growth recovered in 2012 and 2013 with rates of 5.6 percent and 4.8
percent, respectively, but much of this was recovery from the 4.3 percent contraction in
GDP in 2011. The economy has declined again in 2014 with an estimated GDP growth of -
1.4 percent (EIU 2015). This is due to the combined effects of Ebola on the tourism sector
(despite no recorded outbreaks in The Gambia), a bad harvest and weak macroeconomic
management. The regional Ebola outbreak is expected to cut by more than half tourism
receipts for the 2014-2015 season in The Gambia. It has further led to the emergence of
balance of payments needs for the country (IMF 2015)30. Therefore, it appears that per
capita incomes have fallen in the last four-five years and poverty has probably increased.


28   - This is to be compared with a programmed budget consolidation of the deficit of 1.8 percent of GDP for 2013.

29- Economist Intelligence Unit estimates. This is equivalent to about half of the country’s international reserve holdings recorded for
the year of $161 million, which was equivalent to 4 months of imports of goods and services, implying capital flight for the year equivalent
to about 2 months of import-cover.

30- The impact of the various exogenous shocks on the balance of payments, although partially offset by lower fuel prices, is estimated
to amount to US$ 12 million in 2014 and US$ 28 million in 2015 (IMF 2015).

                                                                                                                                        59
13.    Net domestic borrowing is estimated to have reached 12 percent of GDP in 2014.
Government borrowing interest rates remained elevated, above 18 percent for one year
treasuries in 2014, and in December 2014 rose to 19 percent (or about 13.0 to 13.5 percent
in real terms). The situation remains fragile as fiscal credibility remains weak—with
persistently high government borrowing interest rates—and deterioration in the public
domestic debt position. A number of factors have contributed to deterioration in 2014:
spending tied to Ebola spillover effects31 and drought to a lesser extent, the government
taking over the financially strapped national power company's obligations and fiscal
slippages to a greater extent.

14.     In part, the persistent low level of market confidence may reflect the more
challenging public financial circumstances, which have intensified with the policy slippage
in 2013 and in 2014. Public sector domestic debt is high, rising (from 37.1 percent of GDP
in 2013 to an estimated 47.1 percent in 2014), short-term, and increasingly costly. Interest
payments on domestic debt absorbed an estimated 30 percent of domestic revenues in
2014, up from 24.6 percent in 2013, and as public domestic debt is held largely in short-
term denominations, it is being rolled over at significantly higher rates (e.g., at 19 percent
at end-2014 versus 12 percent in mid-2013). And, since auctioning government securities
at a steeper discount (e.g., 19 percent instead of 12 percent) requires a larger issuance to
raise the same level of funds, the government’s domestic level of debt is rising. The interest
payments are squeezing out public expenditures for development objectives.

15.     There are also significant indirect risks to economic growth, as the sharply elevated
interest rates are discouraging private investment. In 2013, durable capital goods
investment is estimated to have declined to 13.4 percent as a share of GDP from 16.2
percent in 2012. Commercial loans with 2-3 year maturities are running at about 25-28
percent, which implies that a business would need to generate a return of about 35 percent
in order to service the loan, adjust for inflation and pay their operating costs, including
salaries. This assumes that they can get a loan, since the heavy government borrowing has
largely tapped out the thin local financial markets. Given the difficult financing conditions,
NPLs deteriorated in 2014, and in mid-2014, two commercial banks (local subsidiaries of
Nigerian banks) were intervened, and put under CBG supervision and received CBG cash
injections (see section on the financial sector). Despite the CBG intervention, there was no
indication that this led to a loss of confidence in the banking system.




31 - While there are no reported cases of Ebola yet in The Gambia, its spread to neighboring countries has led to an estimated 60 percent

cancellation rate for travel packages and bookings for the 2014/2015 tourist season. While figures on the impact to goods trade are not
available, goods trade activity, including re-exports are also being affected. This is due to border closures/disruptions (for example
between Senegal and Guinea) and to falling demand as economic activity and external demand in the Ebola-affected countries has fallen
off markedly. Health experts expect the current Ebola outbreak to persist for a year, so even if Ebola is held at bay from Gambia, and
there are no outbreaks in The Gambia’s only direct neighbor, Senegal, there is a risk of persistent headwinds and weak demand across
the sub-region. An outbreak in The Gambia or more widespread contagion in neighboring countries would lead to greater economic
disruption.

                                                                                                                                     60
II. STRUCTURE OF THE ECONOMY.
16.    The structure of The Gambian economy has changed very little over the past twenty
years, as indicated by the sectoral shares of GDP (Chart 4).

Chart 14. Structure of GDP by sector.
Percentage share of Factor Cost GDP*




Nb. Excludes adjustments (e.g., taxes and subsidies)

Sources: WDI and GBoS.

17.    Agricultural activity has averaged about one-fourth as a share of GDP and the
services sector has averaged nearly two-thirds of GDP (60 percent) from 1994 through
2013. The manufacturing and other industries sectors have accounted for about 7 percent
and 8 percent, respectively, over the same time period—although the shares of both of
these sectors have diminished slightly in the last decade (2004-2013) relative to the
previous decade (1994-2003), largely to the benefit of agriculture and to a lesser extent
services.

2.1. The Agricultural Sector.

18.    Economic activity in The Gambia is largely based on subsistence and rain-fed
agriculture. While the sector only represents one-fourth of GDP, about 70 percent of the
labor force is employed in the sector through farming, husbandry and fisheries, so it has a
strong impact on the population at large. While livestock rearing and fisheries industries
are primarily carried out for local consumption, over a third of cultivated arable land is
farmed for groundnuts that are mainly grown for export.

19.     Historically, agricultural production has fluctuated widely in Gambia, tied to its
dependence on rainfall, as adverse weather conditions of drought and heavy rains can
significantly cut into crop harvests. Only 3 percent of the arable land is under irrigation.
Over the past two decades through 2013, real agricultural production expanded by an
average of 3.7 percent. Underscoring the variability in output, during the past 45 years for
which data is available (1968-2013), the sector only once recorded more than three
consecutive years of positive growth; about 40 years ago in 1972-76.

                                                                                         61
20.     Poor harvests result in higher prices, which also cut into disposable incomes. Given
high poverty rates and the prevalence of subsistence farming - with the vast majority of the
labor force employed in agriculture - food security is weak. Hence, private consumption is
also strongly affected by agricultural sector outturns. The Gambia is heavily reliant on food
imports, which account for about one-third of merchandise imports. This has only
diminished modestly over the past two decades, during which food imports have averaged
36 percent as a share of total merchandise imports, more than double the average 15.3
percent share recorded for low-income countries globally and 12 percent for developing
African countries.

2.2. Industrial Sector.

21.     The industrial sector represents an estimated 14.6 percent as a share of GDP over
the past decade through 2013 on average, and primarily serves the domestic market. Of
this, the manufacturing sector component accounts for 6.2 percent as a share of GDP, and
other industries combined account for an average of 8.4 percent. For manufacturing,
activities are largely small-scale light industry and include processed groundnuts, fish,
hides, and beverages, along with soap-making, woodworking, and metalworking, among
other activities. Other industries are comprised of construction, power generation, and
mining, which account for about 5 percent, 1.5 percent, 2.5 percent, respectively, as a share
of GDP over the same period. Construction firms operate both on private and public
infrastructure projects and are focused on the local economy. Power generation,
transmission and distribution of electricity and water are supplied by the National Water
and Electricity Company (NAWEC). The mining sector is very small and is geared toward
the domestic economy and lower value minerals, such as clay for bricks, silica sand,
cockleshell, sand and gravel for construction, among other minerals32.

2.3. Services.

22.     The tourism sector, defined as including both direct and indirectly related activities,
in The Gambia accounts for an estimated 13-15 percent of GDP in recent years33. As such,
it represents the largest share of services activity. While the tourism sector is widely
considered as being quite dynamic, the share of GDP measured on this basis has remained
fairly stable over the past decade for which data is available (2004-2013). Tourism activity
is a key source of foreign exchange for The Gambia, and is the second biggest source of
employment following agriculture, and provides employment for a large proportion of the
coastal population.



32 - The small mining sector is largely geared to the domestic economy, although in the mid-2000’s an Australian mining firm was

established to prospect zircon, rutile and silica sands, for commercial production including export. Under the Gambia Mineral Sands
Project, it was envisioned to produce 20,000 tons of zircon/rutile concentrate per year for export to China. In 2008, however, the mining
firm, Carnegie Corporation, was charged with illegal activities, including the failure to pay royalties, and it was shut down. In early-2014,
the Special Criminal Court in Banjul in its ruling on the charges against Carnegie Minerals dating from 2008, ordered the company to pay
fines, otherwise the machines and other assets would be forfeited to the State. (http://m.allafrica.com/stories/201401150770.html).

33 - The tourism sector in The Gambia is widely recognized as a key sector, however, data collection is limited and exact figures on value

added as a share of GDP are not available.

                                                                                                                                         62
23.    After tourism, financial intermediation and communication represent the next two
largest components of the services sector. The banking sector has expanded significantly
over the past decade, rising from 6.4 percent as a share of GDP in 2004 to an estimated 10
percent in 2013. This reflects the expansion of participation by foreign banks, particularly
from Nigeria. Despite the increase in public domestic borrowing, lending rates have come
down marginally during this period (averaging 31.2 during 2003-2008, and 28.3 percent
during 2009-2013 in nominal terms, and 25 percent and 23.4 percent in real terms,
respectively).34 The telecommunications sector has also expanded as share of GDP, from
7.7 percent in 2004 to an estimated 12.7 percent in 2013. This largely reflects the expansion
of mobile telephone and internet usage in The Gambia.

2.4. Expenditure.

24.    Household final consumption expenditure accounts for the lion’s share of GDP,
equivalent to an average 87.1 percent of GDP at market prices for the 2004 through 2012
period, for which data is available. Government final consumption expenditure averaged
8.7 percent of GDP over the same period. Gross capital formation represents an average of
20.9 percent, of which, private sector gross fixed capital formation represents a bit more
than half - at an average of 12.7 percent for the same period. The average share of imports
of goods and services 45.4 percent of GDP is much higher than that of exports of goods and
services at 28.8 percent. As a consequence, the external balance on goods and services has
averaged a deficit of 16.6 percent of GDP during the 2004 through 2012 period (Table 1.3).

25.     As private and government consumption expenditures have increased as a share of
GDP over the decade through 2012, gross national savings (GNS) has decreased. During
2004 through 2007, GNS averaged 14.9 percent of GDP, and declined to represent an
average of 5 percent during 2008 through 2012. As a consequence, The Gambia has become
significantly more dependent on foreign saving to support investment activity. Foreign
savings averaged 7.5 percent of GDP during 2004 through 2008, and expanded to an
average of 13.1 percent during 2008 through 2012. Estimates of 2013 gross national saving

indicate that the share has shrunk further, to a mere 1.7 percent of GDP, while foreign
saving shrank as well to 9.3 percent, indicating that investment as a share of GDP has
declined correspondingly. Clearly, it will be important to rebuild national savings in order
to sustain growth and avoid total dependence on unpredictable foreign savings.

III. TRADE AND CAPITAL FLOWS.
3.1. Merchandise and Services Trade.

26.    Merchandise trade exports - equivalent to $102 million - account for an estimated
11 percent of GDP in 2012. The Gambia’s exports are largely comprised of re-exports, with
domestic goods accounting for about 5 percent of merchandise exports. The country
remains an important supplier of foreign-manufactured goods and other essential items to
the sub-region countries. Locally produced goods for export are largely comprised of
groundnuts, and to a lesser extent cashews and fishery exports. Over the past decade,
export activity has been sluggish, as transit trade has been hampered by various
developments, including political disruption in key destination countries (Guinea and Mali)
and deterioration in The Gambia’s export competitiveness, as neighboring countries have
developed their port facilities.35 Additionally, for domestically produced goods, poor
weather conditions have recently contributed to lower groundnut exports. Due to a low
level of food security, food and beverage imports account for one-third of The Gambia’s
total merchandise imports. Machinery and transport equipment represents about another
third of imports. Minerals and fuels and manufactures imports together comprise the
remaining third of the country’s imports, led by minerals and fuels. Overall, imports
amounted to about 47 percent of GDP in 2012.


35   - Similarly, the Ebola outbreak in key markets could substantially reduce The Gambia’s transit trade in 2014.

                                                                                                                     64

27.   Trade openness36 has grown by 20 percentage points to an average of 74 percent of
GDP during 2003-2012 from an average of 54 percent during 1993-2002, reflecting
deepening integration with the world economy (Chart 6). However, as a small country, The
Gambia’s trade openness remains relatively low. For example small countries as a group
recorded trade openness at an average 109 percent as a share of GDP during the past two
decades through 201237.

28.    Services exports are largely comprised of tourism receipts, which reached $92
million in 2012 or the equivalent of 10 percent as a share of GDP, up from $75 million in
2006 or the equivalent of 11.5 percent of GDP. A more detailed analysis of the sector
appears later in this volume.



36   - Exports plus imports of goods and services as a percent share of GDP.

37 - Gambia’s trade openness had been significantly higher historically, averaging 98 percent as a share of GDP from 1973 through 1992,

which was much more closely in line with the small countries’ average of 107 percent over the same period. The economy experienced
significant disruption in trade tied to the 1994 coup with the imposition of sanctions by international donors and collapse of tourism
activity. Further, The Gambia has experienced persistent, if periodic, disruptions in trade with its sole neighbor Senegal—also dating to
the early-1990s. Periodic border closures with neighboring Senegal, the main trade route for The Gambia’s re-exports, disrupt trade
flows (and passenger traffic) and undermines export growth. This has contributed to the erosion of Gambia’s advantage as a trade hub,
along with an ageing port facilities and a poor investment environment. Events of 2013 provide a good example, when the border with
Senegal was shut for much of the first half of the year tied to a transport trucking and border fee dispute. A shift to informal trade and
deterioration in reporting practices subsequent to the political upheaval in the mid-1990s might also explain the lower openness
indicator.

                                                                                                                                      65
3.2. Worker Remittances.

29.    Worker remittances inflows to the Gambia provide another key source of foreign
exchange, while supporting domestic consumption and investment, and have averaged
10.4 percent as a share of GDP during the decade through 2012. Based on this measure, The
Gambia is among the highest recipients of worker remittances as a share of GDP in the SSA
region, which averaged 2.7 percent as a share of GDP, and among low-income countries,
which average 6.3 percent as a share of GDP over the same period. According to UNCTAD,
The Gambia is the fifth highest recipient as a share of GDP among the 39 countries in its
annual report on the least-developed countries in the world.38 Worker remittances inflows
have varied significantly since 2003 in The Gambia, dipping to a low of 6.7 percent of GDP
in 2008, and subsequently rising to a decadal high of an estimated 15.5 percent of GDP in
2012.

3.3. Current Account.

30.     The Gambia’s current account deficit is increasing. It was around $72.1 million39 in
2012 (7.9 percent of GDP) and $96.1 million in 2013 (10.7 percent of GDP). Estimates for
2014 suggest further widening of the deficit - largely because of Ebola induced losses in the
tourism sector, policy slippages and difficulties in public enterprises – up to an estimated
$105.1 million or 12.7 percent of GDP (IMF 2015). This compares with a current account
deficit of 6.9 percent of GDP in 2006. Besides the 2014 Ebola shock, this widening of the
current account deficit largely reflects a rising merchandise trade deficit, which has nearly
doubled from $138 million in 2006 to $262 million in 2012. The expansion of the trade
deficit is due primarily to higher imports, but also reflects weakness in export growth. The
financing of the current account deficit is largely comprised of FDI inflows, followed by
development assistance.

•       Foreign Direct Investment. Net foreign direct investment (FDI) averaged 6.8 percent
        as a share of GDP during the decade of 2003-2012 in The Gambia, slightly above the 6.2
        percent average recorded by small states over the same time period (Chart 7). The
        Gambia attracted significantly larger inflows, more than double, measured as a share of
        GDP, than developing SSA countries and LICs, which recorded average inflows
        equivalent to 3.2 percent and 3.0 percent shares of GDP, respectively. During this
        period, FDI had more than tripled from 3.8 percent as share of GDP in 2003 to over 12.5
        percent in 2006. From 2007 forward, however, net FDI inflows have diminished as a
        share of GDP, falling back to 4.4 percent in 2009, from which they have gradually
        decreased to 3.7 percent of GDP in 2012. As a share of gross fixed capital formation, FDI
        inflows have declined sharply to 8.2 percent in 2012 from 14.9 percent in 2011, and
        from an average of 31 percent during 2005-2007.40

        A number of factors have likely contributed to the fall-off in FDI flows to The Gambia,
        over recent years. In particular, the negative impacts of the global economic crisis that
        took hold in 2008 are likely a key factor, as evident across many developing countries.
        However, as the fall-off in The Gambia is particularly pronounced, other factors could
        be at play and might be attributed to a relative drop in its attractiveness vis à vis other
        African countries. For instance, implementation of the Free Trade Zone (FTZ) with the
        Gambia Gateway Project (launched in 2002) has floundered, and no exporting firms
        have opened for business at the FTZ near the airport. In contrast, as of 2011, there were
        27 economic free zones in other West African countries, some of which have attracted
        significant numbers of exporters.41 Aspects of the business environment appear to be a
        factor as well. The Heritage Foundation’s annual Freedom report notes that commercial
        law is not always applied in a transparent or consistent manner in The Gambia, and that
        judiciary is subject to pervasive political interference, which to the extent such
        dynamics are evident, would discourage foreign investment42,43. The 2009 World
        Bank’s Investment Climate Assessment reached similar conclusions.

43 - One example is the short-lived experience of Spectrum, a foreign investor that secured 50 per cent of the state-owned
telecommunications (GAMTEL) and cellular phone (GAMCEL) companies in 2007. After failing to clarify its accounts with the authorities,
for which it was given a 72 hour notice, its contract was terminated in November 2008 because of "a fundamental breach of contract at
the expense of the Gambian people (The Gambia: 2009 Investment Climate Statement, US Embassy). In 2008 as well, the Gambia
authorities cancelled the license for the extraction and processing of heavy mineral sands to the Australian mining company, Carnegie
Minerals. The case held up in the courts until early 2014, when the Gambian court ruled that if Carnegie Minerals failed to pay the
determined fines, the government would seize its equipment and assets remaining in The Gambia.

    •  Official development assistance (ODA) represents a significant source of
       financing for The Gambia and has expanded significantly since 1999, especially over
       more recent years (Chart 8). ODA increased by an average of 10 percent per annum
       since 1999 through 2012, nearly tripling from $49 million to $139 million (at
       constant prices). Notably, ODA reached the equivalent of an average of 15 percent
       of GNI over the four years of 2009 through 2012, up from an average of 11 percent
       of GNI in the preceding four year period of 2005-2008. On a per capita basis at
       constant prices, this represents a 33 percent increase in ODA from an average of
       $US58 per annum during 2005-2008 to $US77 during 2009-2012.
    The general rise in ODA inflows to The Gambia over the past decade is attributable to a
    number of factors, including that new donors have come to the fore globally, notably
    from high income countries in the Middle East and from private sector donors. New
    important sources of ODA include the Global Fund for health, which rose from zero
    during the 1990s to an average of 11.9 percent of total ODA to Gambia during 2010-12.
    The Islamic Development Bank’s ODA to Gambia rose to an average of 8.2 percent from
    2010 through 2012 from an average of 0.6 percent of total flows in the 1990s (Table
    A.1).

IV. GAMBIA’S GROWTH: A SYNTHESIS.
31.    This chapter underscores that long term growth in The Gambia has been unstable,
below the SSA average, and barely higher than the rate of demographic growth, thereby
inducing a limited and below average growth in per capita incomes. In addition, over the
past two decades, although total investment has been catching up with SSA it has remained
below what was observed for low income countries and small states. Given the above, it is
not surprising that The Gambia, with a per capita income at US$500 in 2013, remains
among the poorest countries in the world.

32.   Agriculture and tourism fundamentally affect growth in The Gambia. The
performance of agriculture and the ability of the other sectors of the economy, especially
tourism, to counterbalance swings in output are indeed key elements that explain the long
term growth pattern in The Gambia. Furthermore, agriculture employs a majority of the
population and its evolution has a major impact on poverty, while tourism is the country’s
primary forex earner and has a positive effect on poverty reduction through jobs creation.

33.     Another factor that has affected long term growth patterns is a challenging and
unpredictable macroeconomic policy environment recently characterized by sudden policy
shifts, extra-budgetary spending, large borrowing, weak institutions and a lack of
transparency. This has generated uncertainty and hampered economic activity, and over
the long term undermined confidence in the economy. For example, persistent fiscal
deficits - which averaged 7.4 percent over the past five years through 2014 - have largely
been financed by short-term domestic borrowing, pushing up interest rates and crowding
out private sector investments. Although this expansionary fiscal stance has been partially
balanced by generally more restrictive monetary policies, this has come at the cost of
prohibitively high nominal and real lending interest rates that have further dampened
incentives to invest (Chart A.4). The recent experience of 2007-10 demonstrates that
significant growth and poverty reduction can be achieved—that Gambia’s growth potential
is high, if sound macroeconomic management is combined with good harvests, investment
in tourism, and steady reforms.




                                                                                        69
CHAPTER 2 – ECONOMYWIDE INFLUENCES ON GROWTH:
FINANCE, TRADE AND ENERGY.


34.    As shown previously, long term growth in The Gambia is primarily affected by the
performance of the agriculture sector and to a lesser extend tourism44. A common feature
of these two sectors and of the economy as a whole is a relatively low level of investment,
especially compared to the needs. This can be explained by the overall unpredictability of
the macroeconomic environment and the crowding out private sector investments by State
borrowing. Besides this, other factors are at play in The Gambia that affect firms ability of
operate, invest and ultimately generate growth. The working of the financial system – and
its weaknesses – influences the little funds that can be directed to investment. Issues
related to trade, electricity supply and the overall legal framework also affect firm’s
operations and therefore long term growth in the country.


I. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR.
35.     A sound financial sector matters for development as: i) it promotes sustained
growth by channeling savings to profitable investment opportunities and monitors firms
to ensure proper use of such financial resources; and, ii) it protect consumers and investors
from the risks inherent in every economic activity. Furthermore, a sound financial sector is
critical to Gambia’s development as two of the sectors most likely to generate significant
growth and employment – agroindustry and tourism – face significant challenges in
accessing funding for working capital and investment, which undermines their
competitiveness.

36.    The Gambia’s financial sector consists of commercial banks, insurance companies,
foreign exchange bureaus, microfinance institutions and other non-bank finance
companies. The Gambian financial system is relatively small and is dominated by the
banking system. Private credit to GDP is only 14.4 percent compared to a regional median
of 20.0 percent and an income group median of 17.8 percent (Chart 9). This compares well
with Liberia (4.2) and is on par with the rate in Guinea-Bissau (14.8) but lower than
Comoros (21.0) and Lesotho (18.8). This, despite the fact that the domestic deposits are
higher than comparator countries, which suggests structural credit market constraints.




44   - Issues specific to these sectors are detailed in the next volume of this report.

                                                                                          70

1.1. The banking system.

37.   The banking system accounts for the majority of financial sector assets and is the
predominant form of financial intermediation. The Gambian banking system provides the
standard range of financial services, such as current accounts, savings accounts, fixed
deposits, electronic funds transfers, GoG T-Bills45 and private and business loans.

38.    Concentration is high with the six largest banks accounting for 81 percent of assets
in the system. The banking sector grew rapidly from 2007 to 2010 with the number of
banks operating in The Gambia doubling to 14 during that period. Since 2010, two banks
have voluntarily exited the market after choosing not to meet the minimum capital increase
required by the central bank46.

45   - Treasury Bills are issued (every Wednesday or as decided by the CBG) with maturities lasting either 91, 182, or 364 days.

46- The 12 banks in The Gambia include: Standard Chartered Bank, Trust Bank, Bank PHB, Arab Islamic Bank, First International Bank,
Guaranty Trust Bank, International Commercial Bank, Access Bank, Ecobank, Banque Sahelo-Saharienne pour L'investissement et le
Commerce (BSIC) and Oceanic Bank.

                                                                                                                                   71
39.    Capital adequacy47 of the banking system as a whole remains high, with regulatory
capital equivalent to 27.7 percent of risk weighted assets in 2013 but aggregate figures can
mask variability at the individual bank level. At the six largest banks, the average capital
adequacy ratio was 11.9 percent as of end-2013 with ranges between 6.1 to 21.1 percent.
As a result, the capacity of some of the larger banks to absorb an increase in nonperforming
loans (NPLs) or an external shock is potentially lower than the aggregate CAR would
suggest. The system is characterized by high degree of liquidity due to significant holding
of treasury bills relative to total assets (Chart 10).

40.    Credit risk is high and exacerbated Chart 21. Asset quality and provisions.
by the degree of loan concentration. The
top four borrowers account for 54 percent
of the total loan portfolio. Nonperforming
loans, while declining in recent years, still
comprise a significant portion of total
credit at 11 percent with provisions
equivalent to 9.5 percent of total capital in
2013 (Chart 11). There is significant
variation between banks with asset quality
issues predominating in a few banks48.
Deposit concentration is also a risk. In
2009, one financial institution (the national
pension fund) accounted for 45 percent of
deposits in the system. At least one bank Source: CBG and IMF.
reported difficulty in redeeming deposits
withdrawn by a large depositor over a short period of time.

41.     Competition for deposits combined with high funding and operating costs limits
bank’s profitability. Net interest margin49 is high with lending rates of between 23-25
percent and time deposit rates of 8-10 percent and net interest income represents 35.3
percent of gross income. Operating expenses represent 57.7 percent of gross income. As a
result, returns on assets have been relative low at 1.2 percent and return on equity also in
the single digits at 8 percent, albeit a better performance that what was achieved in 2010-
11 (Chart 12, Table A.2).




47 - The capital adequacy ratio is a measure of a bank's capacity to absorb losses as is expressed as a percentage of the bank’s risk weighted

credit exposures.

48- Two banks were intervened by the CBG in May 2014 following impairment of their loan portfolio, which negatively impacted their
capital adequacy. Hence, the CBG injected GMB 600 million (1¾ percent of GDP) into these two commercial banks to preventively
recapitalize them. Subsequently, one bank was returned to its owners after they reimbursed the CBG. The other bank is still under the
control of the CBG, but an exit strategy which includes the creation of a special purpose vehicle that will collect nonperforming assets is
being implemented (IMF 2015, p15).

49 - Net interest margin (NIM) is a measure of the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest

paid out to their lenders, relative to the amount of interest-earning assets.


                                                                                                                                          72

42.    The capacity of the Central Bank of the Gambia (CBG) to supervise the banking
sector has improved with the introduction of a new electronic system to collect data from
banks as well as with the hiring of additional staff. However it remains constrained by low
capacity particularly for effective off-site analysis and assessment. Efforts to move to a
more risk based supervision model are nascent. The CBG regularly engages in joint
supervision of cross border banks, particularly with the Central Bank of Nigeria, which is
helping with the introduction of a risk based supervision model.

1.2. Insurance and Pensions.

43.     The insurance sector in The Gambia is small in terms of assets with non-life
insurance premia representing only 0.69 percent of GDP – this is to be compared to 1.92
percent in Lesotho.50 The sector includes 13 insurance companies and 9 brokerage firms.
Ten of the insurance companies are general insurers (operating in non-life areas), and two
are life insurance provider. A small branch network of 27 offices is spread across the
country. 46 percent of insurers are fully locally owned while 15 percent have full foreign
ownership and the rest has mixed ownership. The industry is regulated by the Insurance
Act 2003, the Insurance Regulations 2005 and the Insurance Amendment Act 2006. The
Insurance Regulations 2005 set out the basic requirements such as paid up capital, deposits
for every class of business, the amount of solvency margin and components of its
calculation as well as investment requirements amongst others (CBG 2014). The key player
is the national pension fund; the Social Security and Housing Finance Corporation (SSHFC).

44.   SSHFC was created to administer a compulsory social security scheme including
pensions (both public and private), injuries and compensation fund, and a housing fund.
Contributions to the SSHFC pension fund are levied on all formal enterprises with a
mandatory contribution rate of 5 percent. The public pension fund is the largest and is
comprised of mandatory contributions of 15 percent of all public sector gross wages (two

                                                                                        73
thirds paid for by the employer and one third by the employee). Contributions are invested
and at retirement beneficiaries receive either a monthly pension or a lump sum balloon
payment with all interest included.

45.     SSHFC is the largest holder of government securities and is the largest single
depositor in the banking system. Despite the long term nature of SSHFC’s liabilities, the
majority of its portfolio is invested in bank deposits and treasury bills along with some
investment in the tourism and agribusiness sectors. As pension funds are intended to
transform current savings into future income, it is desirable for them to invest in long-term
assets. An asset allocation skewed towards short-term deposits and T-bills may reflect the
lack of alternative investment opportunities in The Gambia. As a result, this pool of capital
is not channeled into long-term investment and does not contribute to overall economic
growth. In 2013, return on investment was between 12-14 percent according to
management, which is above the average of 7-8 percent achieved in previous years. Among
its investments, SSHFC has equity stakes in two of the largest domestic bank, Trust Bank,
and the largest foreign bank, Standard Chartered, where it is the largest domestic minority
shareholder. SSHFC is also invested in two large hotels, Ocean Bay and Sun Bay. It also has
investments in state-owned enterprises, particularly in the telecommunications sector.
SSHFC only provides loans to state-owned enterprises.

1.3. Microfinance and Credit Unions.

46.    The microfinance sector could play a more important role in increasing access to
finance. As of now, it is of a small size and only accounts for about 0.25 percent of the
population in terms of borrowers and depositors, way below what is observed in countries
like Ghana or Liberia (Chart 4.5). In effect, is not currently being run as a sustainable
business in most cases and is reliant on donor funding.

Chart 23. Importance of MFIs.




Source: World Bank


47.   The only exceptions are credit unions, which have a sustainable business
model premised on mobilizing the savings of their members (more than 60,000). The
majority of companies operating in The Gambia are micro-enterprises with limited capacity
to demonstrate credit worthiness and reliant on fixed asset collateral and guarantees to

                                                                                          74
access funds. Basic elements such as a culture of financial reporting and contract
enforcement are lacking. MFIs, a natural source of borrowing for micro enterprises and
small proprietorships, have little money to lend, weak management, and are inadequately
regulated and supervised.

48.    The National Association of Cooperative Credit Unions of Gambia (NACCUG), the
domestic coordinating body for savings and credit cooperatives, provides liquidity and
technical support to its 69 member institutions involved in microfinance activities.
Although most of its members are in rural areas, the majority of the deposits are urban. It
can offer its members loans equivalent to 2-3 times their subscribed capital from a common
fund (the Central Finance Facility, CFF) in the form of liquidity provisions. Excess funds are
invested in T-bills with short-term maturities. Given their prevalence in rural areas, most
credit cooperatives are licensed by the Ministry of Agriculture and are therefore not
regulated in any meaningful way. NACCUG, with a critical role in liquidity provision to its
membership, is seeking formal recognition for its role as the apex institution for credit
unions from the Central Bank.

1.4. Access to Finance.

49.     Domestic credit to the private sector is low, on average 14.7 percent of GDP over
2007-2012, against a regional average of 58.7 percent (Chart 13). It reached 15.2 percent
of GDP in 2013. The majority of credit is in the form of trade finance (29 percent). Relatively
little credit flows to agriculture (3.9 percent), tourism (5 percent), or manufacturing (6
percent). Most firms use internal sources of funds and retained earnings to finance their
working capital and their long term investments. At the sector level, in the late 2000s,
internal funds represented about 65 to 90 percent (respectively for manufacturing
enterprises and informal firms) of funds used to finance long term investments. The use of
bank finance remains very limited for manufacturing or retail services enterprises (less
than 13 percent of the global long term investment) and almost non-existent for other
sectors and micro/informal enterprises (World Bank 2009, Chart 13).




                                                                                            75
Chart 24. Credit to private sector, distribution of credit in 2012 and financing by banks.




Source: IMF (2013) and World Bank (2009).

50.    Access to finance is impeded by banks' high operating costs, some crowding out by
government debt, high collateral requirements, and the mismatch between bank’s
requirements and firms abilities.

•   Large fiscal deficits, partly financed by the CBG, have led to high levels of domestic
    borrowing that have driven up interest rates and, to a certain extent, crowded out the
    market for private borrowing (see Chapter 1). Interest rates on T-bills have increased
    sharply in recent months. In countries with high T-bill rates, such as The Gambia, banks
    tend to hold a sizable part of their balance sheets in Government securities, which can
    discourage lending. In financial systems with weaker legal and regulatory structures
    and capacity there appears to be a strong negative relationship between banks’
    willingness to lend to private companies and the availability of “safer” investments
    opportunities, such as T-bills.




                                                                                             76

                             Source: IMF (2013).

•    High operating costs and the attractiveness of the safer T-bills imply that banks are
     fairly risk adverse. This translates, inter alia, into high collateral requirements. The
     value of collateral needed for a loan is almost two times the value of the loan (193
     percent) and three times the levels recorded in Liberia (69 percent) and Lesotho (87
     percent). Although high relative to comparators, it is in line with regional averages.
     Almost all loans (86 percent) require some form of collateral, typically real estate or
     third party guarantee. As a result, only 16.6 percent of firms reported a bank loan or
     line of credit, which is below the SSA average (23.7 percent) and in the middle of rates
     reported by comparator countries. Microenterprises and informal firms face even more
     difficulties accessing banks as only about 4 percent of them report having access to
     finance (World Bank 2009, Chart 16). Firms often state that the high cost of financing
     available from banks is a deterrent to accessing loans.

•    Firms face challenges in meeting banks' collateral requirements. Real estate is seen as
     reliable collateral given the challenge and cost associated in determining the viability of
     firms that can lack audited accounts. The absence of viable credit information systems
     to assess credit applications also increased in the past banks' reliance on physical
     collateral. Moreover, the legal infrastructure necessary to support collateralized
     lending requires an effective and efficient judicial system to enforce contracts, which
     many countries including Gambia struggle to produce. A movable collateral registry is
     being implemented, which is a positive step51.


51- The CBG is developing a Collateral Registry. A Security Interest in Movable Assets Act was passed into Law in October 2014 and took
effect on January 1, 2015. The infrastructure for the registry is in place and it should be operational before mid-2015 (IMF 2015).

II. THE TRADE SECTOR.
2.1. Trade in goods and services.

51.     Trade has traditionally played Chart 27. Import and Export of goods and services.
an important role in the economy of
The Gambia. It accounted for more
than 100 percent of GDP at the
beginning of the 1990s. This share has
since declined, from a height of 131
percent in 1990 down to 52 percent in
1999. Trade has re-gained traction in
early 2000s, it accounted for as much
as 83 percent of GDP in 2004. However,
it has ever since played a smaller role
in Gambian economy. The drop in trade
share has been significant in the
aftermath of the financial crisis when, Source: WDI, September 2014
in 2008, trade amounted to only 63 percent of GDP (Chart 17).

52.     Imports account for the largest component of net trade. The country has
traditionally been in a trade deficit growing in magnitude since the 1990s. In 2012, imports
tallied above 353 million in constant US$ or 47 percent of GDP. Imports to The Gambia are
more slightly concentrated relative to its peers in ECOWAS or Sub-Saharan Africa, as
measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman index.52 The lack of diversification is reflected in
the origins and types of goods imported. More than one third of imports consist of food and

live animals, food staples such as rice and sugar are at the top of the list.53 A large fraction
of rice arrives from Brazil, while other popular food staples such as refined linseed oil, flour
and dried legumes are imported from Malaysia, Turkey and UK respectively. China is a key
market for imported manufacturing goods, chiefly represented by woven fabrics. A sizeable
share of manufacturing goods is also taken by cement and construction material from
Senegal. Among machinery and transport equipment are German passenger cars, and
power-generating machinery and equipment from Northern European countries such as
Finland, UK, and Germany (Chart A.5).

53.    Exports in the form of transit and (illegal) re-export trade have traditionally played
a relevant role in The Gambia’s economy.54 Re-exports still amount to about 88 percent of
gross exports (Comtrade, Chart A.6 and Chart A.7). Food items are mainly re-exported to
neighboring countries such as Senegal and Nigeria while China used to be the largest
foreign buyer of wood (wood wool and veneers)55. Direct exports account for the remaining
fraction (12 percent) of gross exports and are directed to India, UK and China. The
harmonization of external tariffs within the region56 and the reduction of trade distortions
in neighboring countries57 have progressively eroded the profitability of re-exports which
currently consist on a few items with limited value added. Cashew nuts are imported by
India while Netherlands, Spain, Senegal and Singapore import fish and related products.
Groundnuts and fruits are mainly exported to the UK. The Gambia appears to still maintain
a comparative advantage in the export of food items with a revealed comparative
advantage (RCA)58 above 1, at 4.7 in 2012. However, this has substantially fallen down from
the 2007 level of 9.6.

54.    Overall, three main destination countries typically make up for more than 50
percent of total exports (re-exports and direct exports). Yet, these countries have varied
over the past few years. In 2006, Great Britain alone attracted 49 percent of total exports.
The share has significantly dropped since then and in 2011 UK bought less than 20 percent

53 - Rice accounts for more than 13 percent of total imports, or US$30 million. Improving agricultural productivity becomes of paramount

importance once the President’s announcement to ban rice imports from 2016 will be a reality.

54 - Re-export trade implies payment of Gambian tariffs upon entry and then payment of Senegalese tariffs upon exit, but few if any products can
support such treatment and be competitive. In reality, goods are smuggled into a neighboring country, sometimes with the connivance of customs
officials. This trade is driven by distortions in the bordering market, due to high protection. See the 2007 Diagnostic Trade Integration Study
for additional details.

     - A presidential ban on wood re-exports was imposed in 2012.
56
   - The Gambia’s role as regional entrepôt has been challenged since the early 2000s. In 1998-2000, trade taxes in Senegal and Guinea fell
substantially with the implementation of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (2007 DTIS). In response, The Gambia simplified its
custom tariffs system in 4 brackets, with a top rate of 18 percent. These changes was reversed in 2006 when The Gambia increased the ceiling
on import tariffs from 18 to 20 percent and the sales taxes on imports from 10 to 15 percent, to align with the Economic Community Of West
African States (ECOWAS) customs union structure. The Gambia may further drop tariffs on imported goods from the EU as part for the
negotiations to replace its non-reciprocal preferential trade agreements.

  - For example in the case of Senegal, the partial liberalization of sugar imports, and the full liberalization of vegetable oils diminished
the profitability of this trade.

of total Gambian exports. France has also been consistently present among the main
destination markets for Gambian exports. Due to limited data availability from Gambian
sources, statistics on geographical trade are from partner countries, so the resulting picture
of shifting trade patterns could be somewhat distorted to the degree that some activity is
not captured. With that caveat, there have been significant shifts in Gambia’s key trade
partners over the past decade. Guinea, Guinea Bissau and more recently India are the other
popular exporting markets.

55.    On a regional basis, The Gambia’s trading profile complements well that of Guinea
Bissau and Niger based on the relatively high Trade Complementarities Index (TCI)59,
above 50 (Chart 4.10). Conversely, the TCI with Liberia is less than 10 indicating that the
two countries tend to export similar products and therefore would not gain from expanding
trade to one another. As a result, not surprisingly, the Trade Intensity Index (TII)60 between
The Gambia and Liberia is fairly low at around 53. Burkina Faso and Cote d’Ivoire have the
lowest TII, well below 10, while on the other side of the spectrum are Guinea Bissau, Guinea
and Mali with extremely high TII of more than 100,000.

Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). In response, The Gambia simplified its custom
tariffs system in 4 brackets, with a top rate of 18 percent. These changes were reversed in
2006 in order to align with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)
customs union structure. Specifically, The Gambia increased the ceiling on import tariffs
from 18 to 20 percent and the sales taxes on imports from 10 to 15 percent. Further
changes in trade tariffs are expected as the country harmonize its regime to the ECOWAS
Common External tariff (CET)61.

57.     First established in 2006, the CET was originally organized in four tariff bands: 0
percent for essential social goods, 5 percent for goods of primary necessity, raw materials
and specific inputs, 10 percent for intermediate goods and 20 percent for final consumption
goods. However, its implementation has encountered a number of obstacles with respect
to the classification of product lines and the definition of tariff bands62. Another important
point of contention regards the modalities of collection of the CET. Each country insists on
collecting payments at its border, instead of at the point of entry into the community.

58.     As of late 2014, the comprehensive implementation of the CET is not a reality yet, as
indicated by the fact that two key products for The Gambian economy face widely different
tariffs within ECOWAS. The average ad valorem duty for rice and groundnut is respectively
0 percent and 20 percent in The Gambia, and 10 percent and 2.5 percent in Guinea.
Disparities are not limited to selected goods or countries, as evident from Table 4.1 that
reports a synthetic indicator of the trade tariffs faced at the ECOWAS and regional level. An
evolution from the current system is expected to take place soon, since the CET is planned
to become fully operational as of January 1, 2015.

developed countries to a smaller extent. The Gambia, similarly to most other African LDCs,
receives a preferential treatment to access to foreign markets through the Everything But

61 - The CET is part of a larger effort to establish a custom union among ECOWAS members. The ECOWAS Trade Liberalization Scheme

(ETLS) aims at introducing the CET while eliminating customs duties and taxes, and non-tariff barriers among its members. These
policies are intended to be applied to a selected group of goods including unprocessed goods, traditional handicraft products, and
industrial products of community origin. The scheme - originally articulated in 1979 - was first launched in 1990. After some (internal
and external) resistance in implementation, ETLS has gained momentum and now about sixteen Gambian companies are certified to
operate under the Scheme. The remaining barriers to fully capitalize the benefits of the ETLS are supply-side related.

62 - More recently, Nigeria has asked for the introduction of a fifth band at 35 percent for “specific goods for economic development”
(essentially agricultural goods), based on the observation that disparities in domestic cost of labor and tax rates undermine economic
competition across ECOWAS members. For example, there is a wide variation in the range of VAT tax rates. On one side of the spectrum
is Nigeria that applies a 5 percent, while The Gambia charges 10 percent, Ghana 15 percent, and the francophone countries (such as Togo,
Benin, Burkina Faso) charge 20 percent.

African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) of the United States63. Under these programs
no quota or duty restrictions are levied. Trade with the EU or the US is hampered not by
trade regulations per se, but rather by technical barriers as well as sanitary and
phytosanitary measures. For instance, The Gambia has not yet been able to take advantage
of the AGOA because of its inability to meet safety standards and procedural requirements.
Analogously, phytosanitary concerns, for example those related to the presence of aflatoxin
in groundnut, have hampered sales to EU markets. On the contrary, Senegal has been able
to some extent to take advantage of the preferential treatment exporting to the US mostly
agricultural and energy-related products.64

60.    The authorities also recognize that non-tariff barriers may tremendously raise the
cost of trading in The Gambia. Road transportation has been hampered by numerous
checkpoints, the consequent delays in the flow of goods add to the cost of doing business
and transiting goods from The Gambia. Cognizant of these inefficiencies, The Gambia in
concert with other ECOWAS members has started implementing the protocol on the Inter-
State Road Transit (ISRT) scheme, in order to promote a more efficient and transparent
movement of transit goods within the sub region.65

61.    Customs operations are another important element to consider when assessing the
extent of NTBs. The “quality and comprehensiveness of services provided by customs
authorities and related agencies” is slightly above the regional and sub-regional average in
The Gambia (Global Express Association, 2014). However, among the factors that prevent
the country from improving its performance is the fact that the ASYCUDA++ system for
custom clearance is yet to be adopted at all major entry points. Moreover, notwithstanding
dedicated meetings in 2013, the system interface is not yet integrated with GAINDE, the
automated solution used in Senegal. The differences are not limited to the software used,
but extend to custom administration practices. Senegal follows the West African Economic
and Monetary Union (WAEMU) laws, regulations and documents whereas The Gambia
adopts the ECOWAS parameters. As a result, the countries tend to use different
administrative documents, leading to higher bureaucratic costs. The issues are to be
addressed by the full implementation of the ISRT.

62.    Large gains are to be obtained from improving the relationship with Senegal. Better
coordination with such a strategic neighbor is needed in order to tighten border control
and reduce trading costs. In the absence of an efficient and effective collaboration between
the two countries, the Senegalese authorities require The Gambia Revenue Agency (GRA)
to receive hard copies of landing certificate that goods have reached their final destination,
and not simply left The Gambia, before clearing the shipment and releasing the custom

63 - The United States dropped The Gambia starting from January 1, 2015, according to a presidential proclamation on December 23,

2014 that said the country is not making continual progress in meeting the requirements of the 1974 Trade Act.

64 - The port of Dakar is directly connected to the American continent, as Grimaldi has two dedicated lines: Grimaldi ACL-US-West Africa

Ro/Ro service and Grimaldi Africa-South America Line-West Africa ESCA string. The port of Banjul on the other hand does not have
direct service to North or South America.

65   - Further details about the ISRT are discussed later.

                                                                                                                                    82
bonds. Such costly and inefficient practice should be abandoned with the full
implementation of the ISRT.

2.3. Trade logistics

63.    The decline in the importance of trade over the past few years in the Gambian
economy is reflected in the country’s average ranking (77th out of 185 countries) in the
DB2015 indicator for “trading across borders”. Since 2006 the amount of time, documents
and cost per container required to trade has remained stable. There has been only a mild
contraction in the number of days required to imports that however has not translated into
a reduction of costs. From a comparative perspective, The Gambia does better than
ECOWAS members - except Senegal which is very close. Senegal outperforms The Gambia
in the number of days to export or import, it takes 7 more days to export from and 5 more
days to import to The Gambia than in Senegal. These delays are however counterbalanced
by lower trading costs that allow the country to remain competitive (Chart 19).

64.    Taking a broader perspective encompassing all aspects of trade logistics besides the
previous details of the clearance process, it appears that over the past few years The
Gambia’s performance worsened significantly. Gambia’s performance on all
components of the Logistics Performance Index66 (LPI) is worse in 2014 than it was
in 2007, with the exception of the “international shipment” sub-index which is stable
(Chart A.8). Hence, The Gambia has fallen in the LPI rankings, from the 77th position (out of

66   - The logistics performance (LPI) is a weighted average of a country scores on six key dimensions:
-       Efficiency of the clearance process (i.e., speed, simplicity and predictability of formalities) by border control agencies, including
        customs;
-       Quality of trade and transport related infrastructure (e.g., ports, railroads, roads, information technology);
-       Ease of arranging competitively priced shipments;
-       Competence and quality of logistics services (e.g., transport operators, customs brokers);
-       Ability to track and trace consignments;

150 countries) in 2007 down to 146th in 2014 (out of 160 countries) in 2014. Furthermore,
in 2014, The Gambia has performed worse than any other ECOWAS members, according to
the LPI, achieving a score of 2.25, while the average has been 2.66 and 2.47 among ECOWAS
and Sub-Saharan countries respectively. The Gambia lags well behind Senegal in almost
every subcomponent of LPI, with the exception of a similar capacity at “timely” shipments.

65.      To try to reverse this evolution, The Gambia has undergone several custom reforms
in recent years. In 2008, the authorities abolished the compulsory scanning of all
containers, and opted instead for a system of random inspections in order to save
processing time and costs. In 2012, the country pursued further improvements in customs
operations by adopting the Automated System for Customs Data (ASYCUDA). However, the
system is not yet fully functioning at each point of entry to the country and there are reports
of still duplicate custom operations, using both electronic and paper procedures, resulting
in an inefficient increase in costs.

2.4. Infrastructures for trade.

66.    The port of Banjul is at the core of The Gambia’s economy as international trade
accounts for a large share of GDP and it handles almost the totality of the country’s
international trade flows (Table A.3). Gambia’s economic competitive edge therefore also
depends on the quality of port’s infrastructure and efficiency of operation specialists.
Import traffic accounts for the majority of international trade flows, and typically
comprises ro/ro67 vessels and containerized cargo with sugar, rice, flour, cement and liquid
bulk products. The Gambia Ports Authority (GPA) handles over 350 vessels per year, and
more than 1.7 million metric tons of “throughput” or overall imported and exported
cargoes.


67 - Ro/ro stands for roll-on/roll-off vessels designed to carry wheeled cargo driven on and off the ships, as such the use of crane is not

needed to load and unload the cargo, as in the lo/lo or lift-on/lift-off vessels.

                                                                                                                                       84

suffers in particular from the
comparison with Senegal that
has ranked consistently higher
for the past 10 years. Higher
ranking     of    Dakar’s    port
translates into more business
opportunities as it is more
frequently included in the
maritime routes of major
shipping companies. This is
evident by going through the
routes followed by Maersk,

Banjul’s port.                    Source: Maersk


69.     Maersk stops in Banjul along only one out the nine direct routes connecting the West
Mediterranean and West Africa (Chart 4.14). Analogously, Delmas (CMA CGM) includes
Banjul’s port in two out of seven routes connecting Mediterranean and West Africa, while
it includes Dakar’s port not only in one Mediterranean-West Africa route, but also in two
Africa-Northern Europe routes. Regarding MSC’s routes, Banjul appears directly connected
only with New York, while Dakar is linked with 10 other US ports besides New York’s.




                                                                                                                     85
70.    Similar findings emerge from a more in depth analysis of the quality of port
infrastructure. Banjul’s port enjoys a relatively positive ranking since overall infrastructure
quality is estimated to be higher than in regional or sub-regional ports. Yet Banjul’s port
remains below Dakar’s. Several factors contribute to challenge Gambian entrepôt role:
•    First, shipping rates tend to be higher than in other West African ports. Banjul’s offers
     competitive terminal handling charges (THC), on par or below those charged in Dakar,
     Conakry or Abidjan. Yet freight rates are much higher, more than compensating the
     potential savings in THC (Table A.4)68. Higher shipping costs are typically blamed on
     the low draught that prevents from hosting ships with capacity above 2000 TEU. This
     constraint is expected to become a more relevant obstacle in the future as operators are
     investing more and more in higher capacity vessels in order to exploit economies of
     scale;
•    Second, the gap in quality infrastructure is not sufficiently high to establish a strong
     advantageous position. The port lacks both (i) proper equipment and (ii) adequate
     infrastructure in order to be fully competitive. Regarding the former, the port lacks for
     example dedicated cranes for over-the-quay cargo-handling operations, meaning that
     loading and discharging cargo is largely done through ships’ own gear. Regarding the
     latter, the port has limited capacity, with a 10m draft and a 300m quay. While Senegal
     enjoys a similar position according to international rankings on port’s overall quality,
     Dakar’s port has a substantially higher capacity than Banjul’s port, in terms of both
     storage capacity and stevedoring equipment (Table A.5). This disadvantage is likely to
     play an increasingly important role in the future as more and more operators are
     moving to higher capacity ships in order to exploit economies of scale. The lack of
     adequate equipment and infrastructure to handle larger volumes would negatively
     affect the competitiveness of The Gambia.

71.    Aware of this, the GoG has developed in the early 2000s a master plan that details a
series of interventions to upgrade the port. Within this framework, noteworthy is the
recent adoption of a mobile scanner for container’s inspection that has contributed (i) to
substantially cut the time spent for cargos’ physical inspections and (ii) to streamline the
administrative procedures for goods clearance69. Besides, more recently, the construction
works for the expansion of the containers yard have started.

72.    Roads. Land transportation is at the core of rebuilding Gambia’s entrepôt role.
Roads account for more than 90 percent of the total motorized freight and passenger
movements (World Bank 2009). By 2007, The National Road Network (NRN) of The
Gambia comprised 1,559 km of classified roads of which 495 km were paved and 1,064 km
were unpaved. There was also approximately 1,300 km of unclassified earth roads giving
access to rural settlements as well as residential areas in some urban settlements. The road
network in and around the capital city, Banjul is much better developed than those in other
68 - Everything else equal, it currently costs 14 percent less to ship from Dakar, 11 percent less from Lagos, 10 percent less from Lome, 9

percent less from Cotonou or Abidjan, 4 percent less from Conakry or Freetown, 3 percent from Monrovia, and 1 percent less from Accra.
Only shipping from Bissau is more expensive, costing 39 percent more.

69 - The process for cargo clearance from landside facilities receive praises from the private sector for its efficiency, especially when

compared with other West African ports, thanks to the cooperation between custom and port authorities.

                                                                                                                                       86
parts of the country. The road conditions in The Gambia are generally poor, resulting from
under-investment in routine and periodic maintenance (PRSP 2007).

73.     In this context, the ECOWAS ISRT is an essential component to reduce transit costs
and facilitate the shipment of transit goods throughout the sub-region. After decades of
discussions, the ISRT was launched on July 15th 2013 under the patronage of the Gambia
Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI), designated as the Guaranteeing Institution.
The IRST is a regime that allows the transportation of goods by road from one Customs
Office in a Member State to another Customs Office in another Member State through one
or more Member States free of duties, taxes and restrictions while in transit. Such goods
are to be accompanied with a set of customs documents and shall not be off-loaded or
transferred while in transit. In particular, ISRT trucks need to (i) mount on the front and
back the ECOWAS plates and (ii) lock with a seal their doors as proof that goods will not be
transferred along the way; drivers need to send their vehicle for inspection and carry the
ISRT logbook and return sealed with stamp. The GCCI is in charge of implementing the
scheme, but despite having been appointed in 2008, it has not been actively involved in the
implementation of the ISRT until 2011. Insufficient capacity (lack of adequate financial
resources, tracking system) has contributed to the delays in implementation. As a
consequence of the ISRT, the number of internal checkpoints has formally dropped to
three70. The authorities appear determined to proceed with the full implementation of the
ISRT and the MOTIE has offered support to the GCCI in order to strengthen their capacity
and expedite the roll out of the scheme. To this end, coordination and cooperation with
Senegal would be of strategic importance in order to maximize the benefits from the ISRT.

74.     For the future, the rehabilitation of transit corridors in the Gambia is another crucial
element to reduce the cost of transporting goods from the port of Banjul. The authorities
have launched an ambitious program, the “National Transport Policy”, and with the support
of the EU have almost completed the restoration, upgrading and maintenance of five main
trunk roads (Barra-Amdallai, Soma-Basse, Basse-Velingara, Mandinaba-Seleti and the
Trans-Gambia road). The EU is also funding the rehabilitation of fourteen feeder roads, the
construction of infrastructure for axle load control as well as a number of capacity building
activities with the National Road Authority.

75.    Airport. Airport cargo is underutilized, due to the lack of dedicated infrastructure.
Less than 0.1 percent of overall cargo in transit to and from The Gambia passes through the
airport. The quality of the services delivered by airport authorities and the level of fees and
charges levied were identified as major challenges by freight forwarders and express
carriers during recent interviews. Conversely the quality of the airport infrastructure is not
deemed as problematic. A possible explanation for such findings lies in the low volumes
outbound traffic due to other supply-side constraints. Banjul’s airport has the potential to
become a regional hub, because of its (unusually for the region) long runway and the
relative higher proximity to Europe and United States. The Kuwait Fund for Arab
Development has funded a US$35 million investment to rehabilitate and expand the airport

70- However discussions with local stakeholders suggest that long queues of vehicles at borders, roadblocks and demands for informal

on this, the Swedish cooperation agency, Sida, is investing to promote more efficient
institutional arrangements, building human capacity and improve access to airport
services for exporters and smallholders in order to boost horticulture and fisheries exports.


III. ELECTRICITY SUPPLY.
76.     Access to electricity is a critical issue in The Gambia. At around 35 percent
nationwide, access to power in the Gambia is modest: 60 percent of the population in the
greater Banjul area is served while as low as 6 percent has access in the outlying provinces.
In the late 2000s, 75 to almost 80 percent of formal firms, depending on the sector, stated
that electricity was a major or very severe constraint to their operation (World Bank 2009).
Due to a combination of unfilled demand and an inefficient distribution system, the highest
volume of complaints from industrial and residential consumers concern either the
unreliability of power or, during those periods when reliability is relatively good, the very
high price of electricity.

77.    In 2014, the country has one of the highest electricity tariffs in the region with
approximately 0.23$ per kWh which does not even fully cover costs. These high costs
further limit access to power and restrict business growth. In 2013, the country has
witnessed 124 MV outages and 3,985 LV fault lead to frequent daily interruptions. The
pattern of these outages was not regular enough to permit rational responses such as
working shifts. As a result, most firms had to produce their own electricity. Little seem to
have changed today.

78.      Power supply within the Gambia is provided by the state-owned National Water
and Electric Company (NAWEC). NAWEC maintains a monopoly in the production,
distribution and transmission of electricity. It manages the Kotu, Farafenye and Kerewan
electricity-generating plants. An attempt was made to open the generation segment by
entering into a power purchase agreement with an Independent Power Producer (IPP) in
2006 and by launching the GAMWIND project71; however this attempt to involve private
participation was later reversed. In 2012, The IPP transferred its operations to NAWEC and
shortly after commissioning in 2013, GAMWIND also stopped its operations.

79. The main constraints in improving access include the current production capability,
the inadequacy of the transmission and distribution network, a lack of fuel diversity,
regional disparities and NAWEC’s poor financial performance.
•       Current production capability. Only 43.7 MW of the 88.8 MW installed capacity is
        available. This does not allow peak load to be met and current projections show the
        need for an additional 135 MW of capacity between 2014 and 2020. NAWEC operates
        a thermal power station that runs mainly on heavy fuel oil. There is no reserve margin,

71   - It sells 900kVA wind generated electricity to NAWEC.

                                                                                            88
     machines are strained disproportionately and the risk for further damage is significant.
     Production cannot keep pace with increasing demand. Nevertheless, new customers
     are constantly connected to the grid, mostly in connection with electrification projects,
     leading to an increasing instability in the power. As a result, several system failures
     occur per day, often in combination with total breakdowns. NAWEC’s generation and
     transmission and distribution teams are constantly fighting emergency situations.
     Population suffers from blackouts several times per day and load shedding is common.
     Scheduled maintenances are skipped which can lead to more serious damages72; and
     critical spare parts, tools and equipment are lacking because of financial constraints.
•    Transmission and distribution network. Although the existing transmission network
     is in good physical condition, it has a limited reach and inadequacies that reduce its
     effectiveness. An assessment of the transmission and distribution shows a number of
     issues. The first one is that there is no continuous criteria (n-1) applied on transmission
     level, therefore not enough redundancies in the network – i.e. a failure of one
     component can lead to system collapse. Operational activities are coordinated in six
     operations centers via telephone due to lack of automated control mechanisms, thus
     bearing a high risk if communications infrastructure were to break down. The
     inadequacies of the system therefore contribute to large technical losses (estimated at
     23 percent), which reduce the effectiveness of the already low generation capacity in
     the country, and further restrict access to power. Also, the current state of the
     transmission and distribution system restricts the ability of IPPs to enter the country
     and provide generation facilities without pairing their generation plans with a
     transmission and distribution upgrade plan (something that most IPPs do not wish to
     get involved in).
•    Fuel diversity. There are few alternatives to fossil fuels and high cost of power.
     Although potential interconnections with Senegal and the West Africa Power Pool offer
     an opportunity for The Gambia to access generation capacity from proposed hydro
     projects at Sambangalou (128 MW) and Kaleta (240 MW), few alternatives to fossil fuels
     have been developed. This contributes to the high cost of power which has been
     identified as an issue by the Government and the regulator.
•    Regional disparities. In the provinces of the Gambia NAWEC operates six remote areas
     with local power stations and local network grids that are not connected to each other.
     Existing engines are high speed LFO engines, not originally meant for base load power
     stations and with very high operational costs. NAWEC has never been able to deliver
     sufficient energy in the off-grid areas. Electricity is not available more than 12-14 hours;
     load shedding is practically done every day. Apart from the extraordinarily high fuel
     costs, logistics is also a constraint. Sufficient fuel cannot be transported to the provinces
     as a single tank truck has to provide all stations in one trip.
•    NAWEC’s financial performance. NAWEC has suffered financial distress in the past
     few years. A combination of earlier spike in oil prices worldwide, exchange rates shifts,
     an inability to raise tariffs, and high commercial losses have contributed to compromise
     NAWEC’s financial situation which shows significant operating and net deficits as well

72 - Due to the variety of different engine manufacturers, it is difficult to keep adequate stock of spare parts and tools; also for the

maintenance staff it is more difficult as every type of engine has its own specialties

                                                                                                                                    89
    as high indebtedness. Fuel is the main driver of NAWEC's costs, accounting for 81
    percent of its expenditures. NAWEC has had three consecutive years of losses that
    eroded its capital which is increasingly negative, increased liabilities that represent
    about four times its annual revenue and current liabilities that exceed current asset in
    the same proportion. NAWEC has therefore been financing its operations through
    liabilities and is now in a position where it can no longer honor its debt. These
    difficulties are now impacting State finances with significant Government support in
    2013-2014 that is now close to $US 22 million (GMD 1 billion).

80.     Despite major constraints, the electricity sector has some strengths and
opportunities, including the relatively new transmission and distribution system, the
established prepaid metering and the chance to connect to power generated with
neighbors in the region through projects developed under the River Gambia Development
Organization (OMVG) which include the Gambia, Guinea, Guinea Bissau and Senegal. The
OMVG sub-region (particularly Guinea) has abundant hydro resources that are considered
suitable for power generation, but have not been exploited yet. Studies estimate that
Guinea’s hydro-generation potential (technically and economically feasible) could reach
6,000MW. Regional cooperation under the OMVG/WAPP can help Guinea to unlock this
potential, with the benefits for the whole sub-region73. For The Gambia, the OMVG
interconnection represents a critical infrastructure to access increased competitively
priced and clean base load generation. From the first plants that will come online, the OMVG
interconnection will provide an additional 38 MW of base load capacity.


IV. AN AVERAGE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT.
81.     Based on the 2014 Index of Economic Freedom (Chart 22), Gambia is ranked 92nd
out of 178 economies. The Gambia's 2014 economic freedom score is 59.5 (on a maximum
of 100). In the terminology of the IEF, the Gambian economy is considered as “mostly
unfree”. The country has been rated a “mostly unfree” economy throughout its history in
the Index since 1997, but has achieved its highest score ever in the 2014 Index. In recent
years, there have been gains in trade freedom, labor freedom, and fiscal freedom which
were however offset partially by declines in business freedom, control of government
spending, and freedom from corruption. The Gambia is ranked 11th out of out of 46
countries in the Sub-Saharan Africa region, and its overall score is just below the world
average (IEF 2014).

82.    The World Economic Forum, in its 2014 “Global Competitiveness Report 2014-
2015”, ranks The Gambia 125th country out of 144 countries (Chart 22). This indicates a
relatively limited competitiveness of the Gambian economy as a whole. According to the
2014 WEF ranking, the most important constraints to do business in The Gambia are i)
access to financing, ii) tax rates and iii) foreign currency regulations.

     report. Regulations remain fairly complex in spite of an improvement compared to 2013
     (the country was ranked 144th). Key areas of concern include i) Getting Credit, ii) Protecting
     Minority Investors (despite recent significant improvements) and iii) Paying Taxes.

84.    Hence, a common complain among investors and trade operators concerns the
administration and level of taxes. The number of payments required and the time spent
paying taxes is not disproportionately higher in The Gambia than in neighboring countries,
such as Senegal and Guinea, so that the situation doesn’t appear particularly troubling on
the surface (Chart 24). Yet tax rates are higher than the average country in ECOWAS or Sub-
Saharan Africa.

85.    Indeed, looking at the total tax rate (measured as percentage of profit) reveals the
challenges faced by investors in the country that have to pay in taxes 63.3 percent of
commercial profits, after accounting for allowable deductions and exemptions (Chart 25).
Conversely, the total tax rate is only 46.1 percent for the average ECOWAS country. The
profit or labor tax rates charged in The Gambia are in line with the regional rates. What
triggers the difference are “other taxes”. In 2013, the sales tax has been replaced with a
value added tax74 set at 15 percent. The introduction of the VAT has encountered some
delays due to the confusion about the precise rules and lack of proper equipment to process
transactions. Depending on the source of information, estimates about not compliance with
VAT application were as high as 70 percent of the cases. Several stakeholders identified as
the most recent severe obstacles to trade the combined effect of VAT introduction and
simultaneous increase in custom fees. The ports in Guinea-Bissau and Guinea Conakry are
deemed to have benefited from the lower competitiveness of The Gambian, due to higher
transaction costs.



74 - The main differences between sales taxes and VAT concern traded goods and services. First, VAT is charged on exports while sales

tax is not. Second, VAT is charged only on component accounting for the value added by the importer and reseller, while the sales tax is
charged on the whole value of imports. These discrepancies in taxation may give rise to Non-Tariff Barriers (NTB), since goods may be
taxed twice depending on the tax system adopted by the trading countries. To overcome possible issues, export goods should be exempt
from VAT payments (claiming VAT rebates), and import goods should be charged for the full price the first time they are sold.

V. CONCLUSION.
86.    Besides macroeconomics and the purely sectoral issues seen previously, other
factors detailed in this chapter are at play in The Gambia that affect firms' ability to operate,
to invest, and therefore the country’s growth.

87.     The Gambia’s financial sector consists of commercial banks, insurance companies,
foreign exchange bureaus, microfinance institutions and other non-bank finance
companies. It is relatively small and is dominated by a highly concentrated banking system
- in terms of banks' assets, of credit and of deposits. Competition for deposits combined
with high funding and operating costs limits banks' profitability. Other elements of the
system are much smaller, for example microfinance only accounts for about 0.25 percent
of the population in terms of borrowers and depositors. The financial sector as a whole
does not fulfill one of its key role which is to promote sustained growth by channeling
savings to profitable investment opportunities. Access to finance remains a key issue in The
Gambia.

88.    Trade has traditionally played an important role in the economy of The Gambia as
the country used to play the role of a regional entrepôt. However, the re-export sector has
become less attractive over time. Trade policy changes have eroded the country’s
advantage as a trade hub (especially the ECOWAS CET implementation) and, owing to a
weak business environment and ageing port infrastructure - Senegal outperforms The
Gambia in the number of days to export or import - the sector appears at risk.


                                                                                                                                         93
89.     Electricity supply remains a major impediment to growth in The Gambia. Strengths
of the sector include good staff skills, a relatively new transmission and distribution
network (T&D), an established prepaid metering system and the possibility to connect to
the OMVG in the medium term. Weaknesses are however significant and include a lack of
fuel diversity, a deficient planning capacity, technical design weaknesses (such as the lack
of redundancies in T&D), a poor MIS and NAWEC’s debt. All of this contributes to increase
prices and make the quality and reliability of the electricity a major issue for the private
sector.

                   Box A. 1, Five fundamental changes in Emerging African countries.

Recent research (Radelet 2010) on a turnaround in economic activity and development outcomes in
seventeen ‘emerging African countries’ (excluding oil-exporting economies) provides some insights on the
key drivers of growth. It underlines the importance of ‘sensible’ economic policies. Economies of Africa
are classified as: emerging African countries, threshold (to becoming an emerging economy); and other non-
oil exporters. The sixteen members of latter group—which includes Gambia—are characterized by “relatively
little change in income levels, social indicators and governance” and a lack of “fundamental change since the
mid-1990s.”

Over 1996-2008, the seventeen emerging economies shared the following characteristics:
• Economic growth rates in each country reached a minimum of 2 percent per capita in real terms, and as
   a group averaged 3.2 percent per capita, which is equivalent to an average real GDP growth rate of at
   least 5 percent per year over the whole period;
• The proportion of people living below the poverty line of US$1.25 per day declined from 59 percent in
   1993 to 48 percent in 2005;
• Trade and investment more than doubled;
• And, there were marked improvements in education and health indicators.

This turnaround can be attributed to five fundamental changes:
• The end of the debt crisis and changing relationships with the international community;
• The spread of new technologies that supported higher rates of productivity;
• The emergence of a new generation of public and private sector leaders;
• The rise of more democratic and accountable governments; and
• The introduction of more ‘sensible’ economic policies.

With respect to the fifth fundamental change tied to economic policies, it must be noted that as of a generation
ago, policies in most African countries were markedly different, and contributed to large budget deficits,
double-digit inflation, rising debt burdens, thriving black markets, and shortages for basic commodities.
These conditions discouraged investment, generated capital flight and led to economic stagnation and rising
poverty. He suggests that a shift in policy frameworks started to become evident in the late-1980s for the
seventeen ‘emerging’ African countries, and continued to gradually improve, such that budget and trade
deficits have become more sustainable, and trade and investment barriers have been brought down.
Similarly, the business environment has become friendlier, marketing boards have disappeared to a large
extent, and the private sector has expanded to play a more important role in the economy and in supporting
growth. He notes that while further improvements in the policy environment are needed, they have ‘vastly
improved’.

The table below extends the calculations on real per capita income from 1996 through to 2012 for all but the
oil exporting economies (though in the interim Ghana might be more appropriately classified as an oil-
exporter). The figures indicate the persistency of the improved growth dynamics in the ‘emerging’ countries
as a group, as they recorded a 3.3 percent rate for 1996-2012 compared with a 3.2 percent rate recorded for
1996-2008. Notably, this positive growth outcome coincided with the global financial crisis and aftermath,
when countries faced weakened external demand. The performance of the ‘threshold’ countries, which as a
group are converging with the performance of the ‘emerging’ countries, is masked by Liberia’s post-war
recovery and robust growth. Most of the ‘threshold’ countries have recorded weaker outturns. The
performance of the ‘other’ African countries remains weak, as the cumulative GDP per capita for the group
remains in negative territory, albeit it is less negative at minus 0.4 percent for the 1996-2012 period
compared with the minus 4.2 percent for the 1996-2008 periods.
