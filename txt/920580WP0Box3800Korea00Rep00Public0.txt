THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

        BuildCo must obtain proof of ownership from the Property Register to
        show that BuildCo has the right to construct a warehouse on the land.
        The issuance date stated in the Land Registry should be within 3
        months prior to the date of submitting the application for a building
        permit. Once the application for a building permit and the relevant
        documents are filed with the licensing authority, the authority will

        1,000 for issuance via internet.

        Agency: Property Register



        Purchase National Housing Bonds (NHB)

        To qualify for a building permit, BuildCo must purchase National
        Housing Bonds (NHBs) at any commercial bank. The NHB is calculated
        at a rate ranging from KRW 600.00 to KRW 1,300.00 per sq. m.,
        depending upon the structure of the warehouse. If the warehouse is
        constructed in steel frame, the rate of KRW 1,300.00 per sq. m. is
        applied.

   2    BuildCo can either receive the money paid for the NHBs upon maturity         1 day         KRW 169,078
        or sell them at a discount (the discount is 10%). Upon purchase, the
        bank issues a receipt, which must then be presented to the Building
        Authorities. The cost is calculated as follows: KRW 1,300.00 x 1300.6 sq.
        m. = KRW 1,690,780.00. However, many sell the NHBs immediately at a
        discount of 10%, which brings the actual cost incurred by the company
        to KRW 169,078.00.

      Request and obtain building permit

      BuildCo must submit an application for a building permit to the County
      (Ku) Office of Construction. The application must include:
      • The size of construction lot;
      • Documentation showing BuildCo's ownership or the right to use the
      construction lot; and
      • Basic design drawings, which must specify the approximate location
      of the water pipes, sewage, septic tank, electrical facilities, and
      telephone lines.

      Once the application for the building permit with the relevant
      documents is filed with the licensing authority, this authority forwards
      the design drawings to the relevant regulatory agencies (such as the
      sewerage department and the fire department). Thus, it is not necessary
      for the company to obtain separate project clearances from these
      departments.

      Under the Article 10 of the new Building Code, anyone who intends to
      construct a building may opt for a fast-track procedure and apply for
      an "advance decision regarding building permit" before applying for a
      building permit. If an advance decision is obtained for the construction,
      the builder must separately apply for and obtain a building permit for
      the construction. However, when the advance decision is obtained, the
      relevant approval for the development or re-characterization of land
3     (such approval is needed in certain zoning areas under several relevant       9 days     KRW 121,500
      laws) is deemed to be obtained. This effect of the advance decision is
      valid for 2 years from the date of issuance, before the builder applies
      for the building permit itself.

      In addition, it is possible to submit simultaneous applications for an
      advance decision and for the traffic and environment impact
      assessment procedures, and the like, if those procedures are necessary.
      Accordingly, if the builder obtains an advance decision before applying
      for the building permit, the time before the construction may be
      reduced more or less. However, this has not worked well in practice and
      many companies follow the traditional way.

      According to the Standard for Civil Petitions Treatment published by
      the Korean Government on December 30, 2005, the duration for
      obtaining a building permit for a two-story, 1,300-square-meter
      building is estimated to be 3 -- 14 days, subject to certain
      circumstances, including whether the work is performed by an agent (a
      certified architect). The duration can take a few days longer, as the case
      may be.

      Before construction work begins, the company informs the authority
      thereof. BuildCo must present a notification application, including:
      • A copy of all relevant contract(s) between the relevant parties (owner,
      construction company, architect, building inspector, etc.)
      • The design drawings, which must specify the location of the water

      Hire a certified inspector

      A certified inspector conducts inspections throughout the period of
      construction. If the company does not hire a certified inspector during
      construction, there is a penalty of up to 2 years’ imprisonment or a fine
      of up to KRW 10 million. The inspector is independent of the company.
      The frequency of inspections varies depending on the size and cost of
      construction. Generally, an inspection takes place if the inspector and
      the company deem it necessary. However, in some instances, the
      contract between the company and the inspector contains a clause
      specifying the frequency of inspection. There must be at least two
4     inspections throughout the construction, during which the construction          1 day     KRW 18,510,090
      work does not stop.

      The cost of KRW 9,059,980.00 is calculated by multiplying the value of
      the project, KRW 702,324,000.00, with the relevant rate of 1.29%, in

      Report the real transaction price

      There is a system of reporting 'real transaction price' in Korea. The
      Parties that are going to enter into an agreement for sale of real
      property should report real transaction price to the Tax Department of
      jurisdictional district office (usually to Gu-Office, in case of there's no Gu:
      to City Hall, etc.) within 60 days after signing the sale agreement. This
      procedure is required to prevent tax evasion.



      Both seller and buyer are in duty of reporting the sale price, which can
      be performed via the website (www.moct.go.kr) of the Ministry of land,            Less than a day
      infrastructure and transport.                                                         (online

      After the price of the sale has been reported, the Office of the Tax
      Department issues the "Certificate of reporting real transaction price".



      With this certificate, the District Tax Office will calculate taxes to be paid
      as below ('real transaction price' of the certificate can also be the
      'purchase price').

data comparable across economies, Doing Business
uses several assumptions about the case:

ENFORCING CONTRACTS
Economies in all regions have improved contract                   reducing backlogs by introducing periodic reviews to
enforcement in recent years. A judiciary can be improved          clear inactive cases from the docket and by making
