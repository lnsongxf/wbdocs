THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: DB2014 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2014 that capture the effects of s uch
factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

        practice without a license. However, EDC is de facto the licensor of
        electrical engineers because they provide training courses. Attendees of

      Pay transfer tax at the Tax Collection Office

      A transfer tax of 4% of value of the property is paid to the Ministry of
      Economy and Finance at the Tax Collection Office of the location of the
      transferred property. A Tax Receipt is issued to prove that the tax has
      been paid. The 4% transfer tax is set out in Article 40 of the Law on
      Finance for the year 1995. In Phnom Penh, this tax is not assessed based
      on the true transacted value of the property but based on a schedule of
      price of property determined by the Phnom Penh Municipality. The
      assessed value is usually based on the total number of square meters,                         4% of property

      which the land is sold; rather it is based on the assessed value. For the
      land of more than 1200m², the surplus is subject to unused land tax. For
      the land less than 1200m², the unused land tax is not applicable. The
      time for the tax office to complete the calculation of transfer tax will
      depend on the location of the land and its size.

the case from simple debt enforcement. To make the
data comparable across economies, Doing Business
uses several assumptions about the case:
       The seller and buyer are located in the
        economy’s largest business city. For the 11
