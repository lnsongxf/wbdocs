FOREWORD


Bangladesh has an impressive track record of growth and development. Since its Independence in 1971, Bangladesh has
emerged as a global leader in poverty reduction and is creating opportunities for improving the livelihoods of its people.
In the last two decades, rapid economic growth at nearly 6 percent a year has propelled Bangladesh to become a lower
middle-income country. More than 20 million people escaped poverty in the same period. Bangladesh now grows enough
food to feed its large population with relatively little arable land. Despite being among the countries most affected by climate
change, Bangladesh has been a forerunner in adaptation and disaster preparedness. The world can learn from Bangladesh’s
remarkable development experience in innovations such as conditional cash transfers and financial inclusion, gender equity
in education, and successful family planning. With the right policies and investments, the country is poised to achieve upper
middle income status by 2021.

The World Bank is committed to support Bangladesh to bring positive change to its citizens, through more than forty years
of partnership with the government of Bangladesh. This commitment is reflected in better rural connectivity, increasing
use of solar irrigation systems resulting in lower irrigation costs, new and improved agriculture technology increasing farm
productivity, more healthy babies, and higher number of children going to school. Yet the country’s development journey
is far from over. Bangladesh needs to sustain its economic and remittances growth, create more and better jobs, address
bottlenecks in energy and transportation infrastructure, and make progress on improving the quality of service delivery in
health, education, and social protection.

Under the Country Partnership Framework for Fiscal Years 2016-2020, the World Bank is committed to working with the
government to strengthen Bangladesh’s economic resilience in the years to come. The World Bank will continue to support
Bangladesh in addressing its development priorities, including creating more and better jobs for the more than 2 million
youths entering the job market every year.

To accelerate growth in Bangladesh, the World Bank will concentrate its support on increasing access to reliable electricity,
improving transport connectivity, and creating an environment that encourages innovation, entrepreneurship and private
sector development. The World Bank will support efforts towards providing equitable access to quality health, education and
skills development, with a focus on gender equality. Additionally, the World Bank will help expand social protection coverage
for the poorest, ensure access to clean water and sanitation, and provide livelihood support to poor rural people to help
them benefit from and contribute to the country’s progress. Last but not the least, the Bank will support the government to
strengthen its climate and environment management to boost Bangladesh’s resilience to natural disasters, improve water
and natural resource management, and modernize agriculture by enhancing productivity with climate-smart technology.

This book captures the development results of World Bank-supported projects in Bangladesh that contribute to the twin
goals of ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity. It highlights where and how the World Bank’s partnership
with the government has made the greatest impact on poverty reduction and brought changes in the lives of millions of
Bangladeshis. It is my hope that development policymakers, practitioners as well as all those interested in Bangladesh’s
future, will find this a useful reference.

new lines and associated substations) in order for
any additional electricity to reach consumers.


APPROACH
The primary focus of the Project is to reduce
technical losses in the system in order to effectively
make available more energy to the consumers,
thus improving quality of supply and increasing
sales. The investments envisaged will also increase
the capacity of the distribution system to supply
and distribute additional power to consumers as
additional generation becomes available. The
project will also strengthen the institutional capacity
of the two implementing agencies - Bangladesh
Rural Electrification Board (BREB) and the Power Grid
Company of Bangladesh (PGCB). Implementation
of the project has started with 1,000 km of line
construction completed.

TOWARDS THE FUTURE
The project will make an important contribution
towards meeting the vision of universal access
to electricity in Bangladesh by the year 2021 by
strengthening the rural electrification network. By

improving the efficiency of the system, the project
will ensure more power is available to the end
consumers. The project will contribute towards
improving the reliability and quality of electricity
supply in rural Bangladesh.

APPROACH
IPFF aims to increase private sector investment
in a range of infrastructure sectors through PPP
following Financial Intermediary Lending (FIL) model.
The financial Institutions, selected based on some
qualification criteria, can apply for IPFF fund through
Bangladesh Bank for financing infrastructure sub-
projects. The project also provides technical assistance
for identifying PPP projects starting from the feasibility
stage, transactions advisory and tendering. IPFF has
already delivered seven fully operational small power
plants and added 178 MW to the national grid providing
cheap and reliable electricity. In addition to facilitating
investment in power sector, IPFF is also working to
bring in private provision in other critical infrastructure
areas as ports, container terminals, water treatment
plants, waste disposal projects, and others. With support

from IPFF, the PPP Office, in collaboration with Board of
Investment and Bangladesh Bank organized a number
of international conferences to attract foreign investors.
The project also provided technical assistance for
launching three feasibility studies in Health and Port
sector. In order to accelerate the pace of project
implementation, the World Bank and the Government
of Bangladesh recently restructured the project. The
restructured project broadens the scope to finance
ventures from health, education and information
communication technology (ICT) sectors and
reallocated more resources for supporting PPP Office in
preparing the sub-projects.

APPROACH
CWSISP aims to increase the supply of safe potable
water to over 4 million people living in Chittagong.
The project will install water treatment plant in the
Modunaghat area of the city and rehabilitate and
extend the distribution facilities, especially in the
under-served areas, to improve the city’s water supply.
Furthermore, the project will support the updating
of Chittagong’s wastewater management and
drainage master plans. These plans will help identify
priority investments in Chittagong city’s drainage and
sewerage networks, for initiatives aiming to improve
the city’s urban environment. The project also supports

CWASA’s pilot expansion of water supply services in
selected Chittagong slums, bringing better services
to urban poor. Finally, CWSISP aims to strengthen
the operations and institutional structure of CWASA
by increasing the sustainability and accountability
of operations, and improving coordination for water,
sanitation and drainage services between key
stakeholder agencies in Chittagong. Specific utility
modernization and capacity building activities have
been provisioned under the CWSISP.

                                                                        8,000 MW. Thus, the large gap between demand and power supply results
                                                                        in frequent outages and load shedding.

To resolve the severe power shortage, the government has
awarded several large gas-fired/dual fuel power plants and
large coal fired plants based on imported coal both in the
public and the private sector. But, still not much capacity
has been added to the grid. To ease the situation, the
government contracted about 2,400 MW rental and quick
rental plants, running on expensive liquid fuel. This has
impacted power sector’s financial position due to the huge
subsidy for payments to these private generators.


APPROACH
With the shortages in natural gas production, improving
the efficiency of gas based power plants and prioritizing
gas supply for higher efficient plants are critical to the
power sector. The Ghorashal Unit 4 Repowering Project will
convert Unit 4, one of the four 210 MW gas-fired steam units
at Ghorashal power station, into a combined cycle unit for
an upgraded total capacity of 409 MW. A new Gas Turbine
and Generator and a new Heat Recovery Steam Generator
will be added to the current steam turbine unit; the existing
boiler will be dismantled.
                                                                  © Tanvir Murad Topu




The targeted unit for repowering was identified through a
feasibility study. Currently, the generation capacity of Unit
4 is 170 MW and the overall efficiency of the unit is around
30%. The Project would increase the overall efficiency of
the unit to 54% and the generation output will also be more
than doubled with only 18% increase in gas requirement.
Consequently, specific fuel consumption (per GWh) would
be reduced by 44% and lead to lower Green House Gas
emissions. The Project will provide operational flexibility to
the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) as it will
be designed to operate the new gas turbine and existing

by the NID Wing. The mapping of the 17-digit NID number
containing year of birth and geographical information of
citizens into 10-digit Unique Identification Numbers has
been completed.
In FY14, the NID Wing issued 91.4 million paper-laminated
NID cards to citizens enrolled in the NID database, which
are being accepted as valid identity tokens by service
providers in public and private sectors. These paper-
laminated cards will soon be replaced by smart NID cards
which have robust security features. The centre for the
personalization of smart NID cards has been set up and
the mass production of the smart cards has started. The
citizens are expected to start receiving smart NID cards
from September 2016.

APPROACH
The VAT Improvement Program will support the                 At least1 percentage point increase for the ratio of VAT
implementation of the new VAT Law. The program               to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2019.
is framed such that tax administration activities
are sequenced in a way that introduces the
VATprogressively. In the first phase, business process
reengineering will beat the core of the program. Based
on the new business processes, the software solution
will be customized for the Bangladesh context. Once
the software application has been tested and piloted, it
will be launchedto enable end-users to fulfill their VAT
tax obligations. Throughout the implementation of core
modules (i.e. registration, filing, payment, and refunds),
the program will orient and train involved taxpayers to

to become fully compliant with Bangladesh’s Right to
Information (RTI) Act.

APPROACH
The project intends to provide funding for long-term
investments by SOBs toward their modernization through
improved governance, better IT systems, business
process reengineering (BPR), and better decision making
                                                                     © Mahfuzul Hasan Bhuiyan




and operational processes. Advisory assistance to the
banks and the MOF (as the representative of the owner)
- on the decision-making and operational processes,
improved governance, and change management - would
complement the investments in physical IT infrastructure.

TOWARDS THE FUTURE
The project became effective on July 02, 2013 and targets
to complete all project related activities by December 31,
2016. Bangladesh has also been selected as one of the
pilot countries for the Forestry Investment Program (FIP) for
designing the investment plan. This is expected to lead a
follow-up program on afforestation and reforestation, which
will upscale the on-going activities in other coastal areas and
play an important role in improving the resilience of the extreme
poor and vulnerable forest depended people.
