Foreword
In the fight to end poverty, there are no easy answers.

But one thing is clear: By creating innovative business models,
                                                                    Built for

share knowledge gained from working with these successful,
driven entrepreneurs. To inspire others to innovate. And to
demonstrate that doing good is not only possible—it’s also
good business.

The stories outlined here are unique, but there are common
threads in each company’s success. Each has sought to create a
scalable business model and focused on minimizing costs. Each
has invested in training and educated their customers. And each
has recognized the value of partnerships.

Sixty years ago, IFC was created to combine development
impact with profitability. The companies described in this report
embody that concept. They have been built to create change in
their communities and around the world. One by one, they are
doing just that.

1. PLAN FOR SCALE

bKash built partnerships with multiple mobile network operators rather than a single
company in order to make mobile financial services available to millions of Bangladeshis.

Bridge developed a management structure and lesson delivery system that could be
easily replicated at a low cost as it expanded; it also leveraged technology to streamline
administrative and managerial functions.

MicroEnsure worked with multiple partners to build a large enough risk pool of
low-income customers, thus reducing the cost of insuring people who can only afford
small premiums.


2. FOCUS ON LOW-COST DELIVERY

bKash leverages a network of existing commercial distributors rather than build a costly
distribution network from scratch.

Bridge uses computer tablets to regularly disseminate electronic lessons to teachers,
cutting production and physical delivery costs.

MicroEnsure uses mobile phones to deliver insurance to poor customers rather than
using insurance sales agents who need to be paid a commission.

NephroPlus reduces personnel costs for kidney dialysis centers through a lean staffing
model, enabling it to build more centers in hospitals and as standalone facilities.

Probiotech uses regional depots and a network of dealers for efficient physical
distribution of animal feed to customers across remote terrain.



3. INVEST IN CAPACITY BUILDING

bKash trains micro entrepreneurs to register and support customers, equipping these
entrepreneurs with anti-money laundering, fraud management and other financial
protection knowledge.

Bridge hires and trains local teachers through its own teacher training institute because
it is difficult to attract teachers from cities to move to rural and semi-urban schools.

technicians to fill an industry-wide shortage in India and to support its own expansion.

Probiotech welcomes all farmers—regardless of whether they are currently part of the
Probiotech supply chain—to gain expertise through the company’s extension services,
veterinary helpline and farm management trainings.

4. EDUCATE CUSTOMERS

bKash educates customers about mobile financial services, helping to slowly raise
awareness about the benefits of shifting from cash to electronic money. This, in turn,
increases bKash’s market penetration.

Bridge engages local leaders, parents, and teachers through open houses to solicit input
on the need for a school in the community, helping to build buy-in before entering a
new location.

through community events, enabling it to attract new patients.

Probiotech educates poultry producers on farm management, helping producers lower
production costs and improve livelihoods while building brand loyalty for its products.



5. FORGE SMART PARTNERSHIPS

bKash was established through a partnership with BRAC Bank, which enabled it to
leverage BRAC’s strong reputation of serving the poor to introduce them to mobile
financial services.

Bridge is beginning to partner with governments to bring its teaching and management
methodologies to public schools in order to continue to improve learning outcomes
for children.

MicroEnsure partners with telecom firms and other companies that already reach
the poor. It adds value to its partners’ products, for example mobile phone airtime, by
bundling them with insurance.

NephroPlus partners with public and private hospitals to introduce kidney dialysis
services in locations where they were not previously provided; it also assumes
management responsibilities to improve existing dialysis services at hospitals.

holds a bank account at a formal financial institution.1 This is a major problem for the working
poor, many of whom migrate from villages to towns, cities, and even overseas in search of
work, and who have no choice but to use informal options to send money home. Some find
an acquaintance willing to carry cash on the journey to their home village; others work with
middlemen who charge high fees.

its well-recognized and trusted brand made it attractive

committed to establish a joint venture between Money in

MOVING TOWARD GREATER
PROSPERITY

Today, the name bKash is synonymous with mobile
financial services in Bangladesh. bKash has made great
strides in enabling the unbanked to access financial
services and the company continues to work toward this
goal. In 2015 over $16 billion worth of e-money moved
through the bKash system which, at the very least, has
increased the efficiency of Bangladesh’s $200 billion
economy. Most importantly, bKash has enabled the
unbanked to gain a foothold on the ladder to financial
inclusion and, ultimately, to bikash—the Bengali word for
prosperity and the inspiration for bKash’s name.

outcomes for children in these regions be radically

  and Taban runs their small business selling plants

  Two years ago Sabbir and Taban decided to
  enroll their two younger children into Bridge.
  As Tabban explained, “The little education I got
  has helped me get several jobs. I know that
  if my children can get more than I did then it
  would really change their lives and that of

across the world. For example, Bridge sees the potential
to sell resource materials to other schools, to use its
teacher training methods for other organizations and
governments, and to enter into additional public-private
partnerships. Bridge is also focused on transitioning
children to secondary school.


Bridge sees itself as one of many organizations that refuses
to accept the status quo in education and one that is
pushing the boundaries of how we teach and learn. Bridge
will continue to innovate and strive for radical change
in order to create the level of access and quality that all
children deserve.

MicroEnsure
The insurance industry has long been perplexed by the economic realities of insuring the world’s
poor. As a group they represent a $40 billion market opportunity,1 yet they also present greater
risks than typical insurance customers and are able to afford only miniscule premium payments.
How, then, can this group of four billion people become a viable business opportunity? One
company, MicroEnsure, has found solutions.

    amount of mobile airtime purchased or the amount deposited in a savings account.

MicroEnsure attract more commercially-minded investors

an opportunity to support innovative approaches in the

were all too aware of the potential for risks to devastate
their lives. So the company decided to expand insurance
benefits to address a wider variety of risks rather than
spend money on agent-based customer education
and enrollment. This strategy included the decision to
offer “Three for Free,” another “freemium” product that
combined life, accident, and hospital coverage, and also
helped mobile network operators attract and retain

fast” mindset, which looked to constantly innovate and
rapidly revise strategies that weren’t working, helped
the company learn and adapt along the way so that it
could remain responsive to the needs of the low-income
customers it aimed to serve.


Since the poor largely didn’t value insurance and wouldn’t
pay outright for premiums, MicroEnsure found ways to
make insurance more palatable and attractive to them.
Partners were critical to the endeavor. Microfinance
institutions could use insurance to lower the risk of loan
default by embedding insurance within a loan at a low
fee to the borrower. Mobile network operators paid
customers’ premiums for basic insurance coverage as an
incentive to attract and build loyalty. MicroEnsure found
that once the poor experienced the benefits of insurance at
little or no cost, they quickly became willing to pay a small
premium to expand their coverage.


MicroEnsure has made great strides in insuring the poor,
but continues to strive to change perceptions of insurance.
The company will maintain an iterative approach to refine
its business model as it embarks on the next phase in its
evolution.

KEEPING COSTS DOWN

Another priority for NephroPlus was achieving and
maintaining profitability, which has long been a challenge
for Indian dialysis providers plagued by inefficient operations.
From its inception NephroPlus kept operational costs low
through several measures:


             LEAN STAFFING. Many hospitals in India
              mostly used nurses to perform all tasks
              including lower-skilled, non-medical tasks
              such as data entry and machine operations.
NephroPlus opted to create new staffing categories such
as a dialysis therapist for medium value-add tasks and a
dialysis assistant for low value-add tasks. Nurses could then
be used for very high value clinical care and tasks related
to medical complications, reducing the number needed
to manage a single clinic. At the same time, NephroPlus
trimmed overall staffing costs through a differentiated pay
scale commensurate with skill and training level.


             VIRTUAL SUPERVISION. NephroPlus
              introduced a centralized patient monitoring
              system which enabled medical staff at its                 centers. This ensured optimal distribution of resources and

line.6 People using white-card insurance plans paid no out-
of-pocket costs for treatment. This enabled NephroPlus
to deliver dialysis to those least able to pay for services
even at a reduced price point. As of 2015, approximately 25
percent of NephroPlus patients used public insurance to
cover their treatment costs.7


But even with no out-of-pocket expenses for treatment
many poor Indians faced transportation expenses and
foregone income which prevented them from seeking
treatment. So NephroPlus introduced other measures,
including subsidized travel, to make treatment more
accessible for public insurance patients.                            NephroPlus’s early centers had been set up as standalone

To reach more low-income patients, NephroPlus also bid
for government contracts to build dialysis centers in public
hospitals. As of 2015, the company had four dialysis centers                 NephroPlus offers

Through a hands-on approach to productivity, quality,
and efficiency in Nepal’s agriculture ecosystem, Probiotech
demonstrates how the private sector can embrace new
roles in development. It was never simple. Probiotech
had to work to identify and address the key obstacles
that prevent its suppliers, distributors, and customers
from maximizing their economic potential. In turn, the
company has benefited from the strengthened capabilities
of these key players in its value chain. Ultimately, the
sustained involvement of businesses like Probiotech, along
with government and civil society, is critical to promote
sustainable agriculture. Probiotech shows companies how
this can be done through their core operations as well as
through multi-stakeholder partnerships.
