                                        result of this tax increase (Table 3).

                                        TaXSiM also calculated the percentage reduction in total cigarette
                                        consumption (%) due to the suggested tax changes. These taxation changes
                                        result in non-smokers’ (predominantly young people) not initiating smoking;
                                        smokers’ quitting, and smokers’ reducing the number of cigarettes smoked.

     While taxation which results in increased real prices of tobacco might reduce                                 Townsend that there are different views on the temporal impact of a tax:

     55 percent of the change in smoking prevalence was due to a reduction in                                      There were two scenarios:

     Among females, 100 percent of the change in consumption was due to “not

     could arise, because some of those smokers who become never smokers may
     already have a smoking-related disease.                                                Further work should also explore the impact of other potential policies in

     sample sizes, it was not possible to model the long-term health impacts on

     tobacco taxation could contribute to reducing social inequalities in health.           long-term impacts on disease incidence and subsequent health costs.
     One specific limitation of any predictive model is that it does not take account
     of major future changes in circumstances, such as the behavior of the tobacco
     industry, or the introduction of new drugs or technologies. In theory, their
     effects can be estimated by altering parameters in the model, but these will
     significantly increase the degrees of uncertainty. However, they could be
     simulated as additional scenarios in the future relative to a “no change” scenario.

     At present, the model does not take account of multimorbidity and the joint
     effect of several risk factors on disease occurrence and related mortality.
     However, individuals can get more than one smoking-related disease in their
     lifetime. Future work could expand the scope of the model to take account of
     technological and economic changes and their potential effects, and also to
     model the clustering of risk factors and diseases in the same individuals.
     The model did not take account of passive smoking/secondhand smoke.
     Understanding the combined risk of smoking and passive smoking on later
     disease outcomes will enable us to model the combined impact of these risk
     factors on later disease outcomes.

     It was beyond the scope of this study, given the time constraints, to carry
     out an in-depth uncertainty and sensitivity analysis. We are aware that this
     is good practice; however, there is a lack of validated datasets by which to
     compare our outputs. Furthermore, the microsimulation is complex, relative to
     spreadsheet models, for example. It involves many thousands of calculations
     which are completed during the simulation of 50 million individuals. Given
     this complexity, local uncertainty analysis would demand many thousands of
     consecutive runs and would require a supercomputer to complete the exercise
     in a realistic time scale. However, we did carry out a small sensitivity analysis of
     the costs – running the model with and without a 5 percent discount rate.
     Further work should develop more sophisticated interventions, for example,

     In a meta-analysis on the possible risks of stroke from cigarette smoking              In the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study on Cancer and

     differences were seen in relative risks among the subtypes: Cerebral infarction        and public health center, were 1.27 (1.05 to 1.54) for total stroke, 0.72 (0.49 to
     1.9, cerebral hemorrhage 0.7, and subarachnoid hemorrhage 2.9. An effect               1.07) for intraparenchymal hemorrhage, 3.60 (1.62 to 8.01) for subarachnoid

     seemed to retain an appreciably increased risk of stroke (1.5); for all ages, the      for men. A similar positive association was observed between smoking and
     relative risk in ex-smokers was 1.2.                                                   risks of lacunar infarction and large-artery occlusive infarction, but not embolic
