and create jobs are significantly delayed.

v.	As Lebanon contemplates prospects of
sizeable hydrocarbon discoveries, the country
is in the process of designing an institutional
framework to manage these resources. One such
issue is the establishment of a Sovereign Wealth
Fund (SWF), as required by the 2010 Hydrocarbon
Law. This Special Focus provides an overview of the
various types of SWFs that have been established
across countries, draws lessons from these
experiences, highlights some pitfalls, and proposes
preliminary recommendations for Lebanon as it
moves towards establishing its SWF. Key among
these recommendations is that the Lebanese SWF’s
design should include (i) integration with the budget
system, (ii) some (limited) flexibility in operational
rules, (iii) no (or limited) earmarking but no extra-
budgetary spending, (iv) coherence with country
investment strategy, and (v) transparency and
accountability.

vi.	Faced with weak economic statistics in
Lebanon—which impede analysis and decision
making—World Bank staff developed two
indicators of economic activity for Lebanon:
a coincident indicator (WB-CI) and a leading
indicator (WB-LI). These indicators, which are
based on an expanded NBER-Conference Board
methodology, reveal promising statistical properties
that should make them valuable coincident and
leading (one-year ahead) indicators for the Lebanese
economy. Based on these indicators, GDP growth for
2012 and 2013 is estimated to be, respectively, 2.2
and 0.9 percent while growth in 2014 is predicted
to reach 1.5 percent. Aside from having a high
degree of accuracy, both indicators are of relatively
high (monthly) frequency and are available with a
relatively small time lag (2-3 months), which make
them well suited for economic analysts, investors,
and policy makers alike. In contrast to the BdL-CI,

(25%), Employment (20%), Suppliers’ Delivery Times (15%) and Stocks of Purchases (10%). A value of the PMI above 50.0 signals an

despite the wide spread between domestic and
international interest rates that reached an average
of 353 basis points in 2013, is likely attributable to
(i) lower inflows from tourism, and (ii) an expected
decrease in foreign direct investment due to the
heightened political and security risks caused by the
Syrian conflict.

foreign capital, income and services, foreign
reserves at BDL increased during 2013. The

shocks through countercyclical policies and suggest
the need to drastically improve the efficiency of
government spending. Lebanon will have to rely on
expansionary monetary policy, such as the planned
stimulus package of BdL in 2014, to boost growth.
BdL’s new stimulus package might also entice
commercial banks to diversify their investments
away from holding sovereign debt by lending to
small and medium size enterprises. The increasing
debt-to-GDP ratio and recurring fiscal deficits will
expose Lebanon to shifts in investor sentiment. An
additional source of risk is an increase in interest
rates which results in larger debt servicing costs. In
fact, the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will “taper-off”
its purchases of assets in 2015. The Fed’s tapering-
off likely precedes an increase in US interest rates
in 2015 or 2016. Given the foreign exchange rate
peg of the Lebanese pound to the dollar, an increase
in US interest rates will result in higher Lebanese
interest rates and, consequently, an increase debt
servicing costs.

21.	     Disruptions to Russian oil and gas supplies,
due to a worsening of the Ukrainian crisis, are
likely to adversely affect Lebanon. Russia plays
an integral role in global oil markets and European
countries heavily depend in Russian natural gas
imports. Disruptions in Russian supplies of oil and
natural gas or imposing sanctions on Russia are
likely to ensue in higher global energy prices. Given
that Lebanon is a net importer of energy, increased
energy prices will result in large trade-in-goods and
balance of payments deficits. The Ukrainian crisis
might also lead to an increase in global food prices
(such as wheat) that would adversely affect the most
vulnerable Lebanese households.

22.	 Water shortages in the Levant can
negatively affect employment and the livelihood
of the most vulnerable Lebanese households.
Given the low level of precipitation this winter
relative to prior years, water shortages in Lebanon
are a serious risk. Such shortages would negatively
affect the employment in the agricultural sector
thereby worsening the conditions of the most
vulnerable Lebanese households.

    Volatility is computed as the squared monthly returns on crude oil or natural gas. While different gas prices exist worldwide, the
natural gas index provided by the World Bank is used for illustrative purposes. Crude oil is a more fungible commodity than natural
gas so that the deviations between different oil prices (Brent and crude oil, for example) are usually not pronounced.

    This should not be construed to imply that a Lebanese SWF would necessarily mimic the Chadian experience as Lebanon differs
in many other important respects from Chad, for example Lebanon enjoys abundant human capital, including a well-established and

    As discussed earlier, a savings SWF would have as a financial objective to match the returns of long-term indices. To do so it would
have to invest in asset classes with high risk-return, and therefore high price volatility and potentially limited liquidity (e.g., real estate,
private equity). Should politicians during a recession require the SWF to liquidate its assets to help pay for a fiscal stimulus program,
then the SWF would have to liquidate some of its non-liquid and high volatility portfolio at the worst time (when assets prices of high
risk-return assets are significantly down). Such a misalignment between the investment strategy required of the SWF and the use of
the SWF assets would result in large financial losses.

it is likely that some revenue from Lebanon’s
hydrocarbon resources should initially be used
to pay down some of the country’s debt. From an
asset-liability perspective, it is likely that, in the first
few years when hydrocarbon resources are turned
into financial assets, rapid asset accumulation of
SWF assets might not be desirable; instead, repaying
some of the country’s sovereign debt to a lower
debt-to-GDP ratio so as to generate a large drop
in the country’s risk premium could be desirable.
Several benefits would arise from this strategy. First,
a lower sovereign risk premium would reduce the
total cost of Lebanon’s public debt (i.e., a reduction
in Lebanon’s debt-to-GDP ratio to, say, 100 percent
would reduce the interest cost of these entire 100
percent of GDP; if as a result of the repayment of

    As noted in paragraph 49, financial considerations are only one of the factors to consider regarding the best use of the SWF
resources. Thus, once all factors, such as economic, institutional, governance, financial are taken into account, it could be that rapidly
repaying Lebanon’s large public debt is not warranted.

observations for 13 variables covering all the sectors of the economy (real, external, monetary and fiscal) from
December 2004 to December 2011 (85 observations). The data was obtained from the Ministry of Finance
(MoF), BdL, Lebanese Customs, and Ministry of Tourism (MoT).

74.	    The methodology for constructing the WB-CI, which is based on the NBER-CB approach, follows
nine distinct steps. In the methodology (M) below, represents the current month while denotes the raw
data for variable             at period          .

           1.	 The X-12-ARIMA technique is used to remove the seasonal trend from all the variables                            .

           2.	 In order to measure the real economic activity, all the variables that are in monetary terms are
               deflated by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) published by the Consultation and Research Institute
               (CRI)57 with December 2006 as the base year.

           3.	 Some of the variables exhibit unusual volatility at a monthly frequency. To eliminate this “noise”
               we smooth all the series using moving averages.

               Following the data transformations in steps 1, 2 and 3, all the variables will be denoted by:




           4.	 Then, the month-to-month symmetric percentage changes are calculated.58 If the variable is an
               interest rate or in a percentage form, then the percentage change is calculated as:




               In any other case, the symmetric percentage change formula is applied.




               Before proceeding, let          denote the weight assigned to each variable                                         .

           5.	 Afterwards, random weights              are chosen for each variable            so that:                   .

           6.	 Using steps and the growth rates                  of each variable are then calculated using the following
               formula:



           7.	 Next, the growth rates of all the variables are summed in order to get the month to month growth
               rate, , of the WB-CI such that




57
   The CRI CPI is used rather than the CAS CPI do to the fact that the latter started to compile its corresponding CPI series in January
2008 while the WB-CI starts in December 2006. CRI’s CPI, however, dates back to January 1988.
58
     The symmetric percentage change formula treats negative and positive changes symmetrically (with the same magnitude). For
example, when a variable increases by one percent followed by a one percent decrease, the level of the variable would return to its
initial value. This would not be true with the standard change formula.
                                                                                                               Special Focus | 35
The World Bank



              8.	 Assuming that the base year of the WB-CI is the first period (i.e.                   ) the level of
                  the index is calculated recursively using equation (4) and the below symmetric percentage change
                  formula,




              9.	 Finally the model is calibrated so that the final weights                  satisfy equations (6) and (7) below:




World Bank Leading Indicator of Lebanon (WB-LI)

75.	In a turbulent and volatile environment like Lebanon, a high-frequency leading indicator is a
natural complement to a coincident indicator. A leading indicator for the Lebanese economy (WB-LI) would
help to (i) detect early signs of turning points in the business cycle and (ii) forecast GDP growth during the
next 12 months. To our knowledge, the designed WB-LI would be the only publicly available leading indicator
for the Lebanese economy.

76.	     The WB-LI is constructed based on a methodology similar, but not identical, to the NBER-CB
approach. The main difference resides in the choice of weights. While the NBER-CB methodology computes
the weights of each variable as the inverse of its respective standard deviation, the WB-LI weights are chosen
in order to minimize the difference between the growth rate of the leading indicator at time and the growth
rate of the coincident indicator at time . In other words, the weights are selected so that the growth rate of
is as close as possible as the growth rate of . The rationale for such an approach is to increase (decrease) the
forecast confidence (error) of GDP growth for the forthcoming year.

77.	    The next steps in constructing the WB-LI are to (i) choose an appropriate reference series, and (ii)
determine the relevant components of the WB-LI. Given that the WB-CI is a reliable measure of the current
state of the economy (Figure 24), it is used as the benchmark series. It should be noted that one of the two
following conditions should be met in order that a certain variable be used in the construction of the WB-LI.
The first condition is economic significance, implying that a certain variable has “expectational components,

that would (under some economic theory) respond rapidly to some shocks to the economy” (Stock and
Watson, 1989). The second is statistical significance which means that the correlation coefficient between a
certain variable at time and the reference series at time should be larger than 0.5 in absolute value. Based on
the above two conditions, 9 variables (Table 9) from a pool of 17 potential variables (Table 10) were used to
construct the WB-LI.

difference residing in the minimization problem. The WB-LI is computed and tested against the WB-CI

listed in Table 9. To develop the WB-LI the same methodology followed in the construction of the WB-CI
is used, expect for the use of a different minimization problem (step 9). A prime () is used to represent the
variables corresponding to the WB-LI. As a result, equations (6) and (7) of Step 9 of methodology (M) become,




Results and Implications
79.	    The designed WB-CI measures the economic activity in Lebanon very accurately.60 The criteria
used to assess the effectiveness of the WB-CI in predicting the Lebanese economic activity is the absolute
value of the error between the yearly growth rate of the WB-CI and the actual (realized) GDP growth rate.
When this error tends, on average, to 0 and its standard deviation converges to 0 this implies that the WB-CI

59
   Our sample for the WB-LI starts from December 2006 and not December 2004 (as the WB-CI) given that 2006 was subject to an
unexpected exogenous shock represented by the conflict with Israel. Hence, any attempt to estimate in 2005 the state of the Lebanese
economy in 2006 would have been misleading.

reflects accurately the dynamics of the Lebanese real economy. When calculating the yearly growth rate of the
WB-CI and comparing it to actual GDP growth, the results are promising as the average error and the standard
deviation between 2006 and 2011 were both equal to 0.0 percent. This compares favorably to both the BdL
and the IIF coincident indicators. For the BdL-CI (IIF-CI), the average growth rate was 2.37 (1.53) percent and
the standard deviation was 1.29 (1.14) percent over the same period (Table 11 and Figure 24).

80.	Using the WB-CI decomposition (Table 12), we can examine the impact of unexpected changes
in macroeconomic variables on economic growth. We employ the Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model61 to
examine the relation between the variables forming the World Bank coincident indicator and real GDP growth
as proxied for using the growth rate of the WB-CI. A necessary condition for VAR models to be econometrically
valid is the stationarity of the variables. When used in log differences, the variables WB-CI, cement deliveries,
VAT revenues, taxes on real estate, deposits to the private sector (PS), cleared checks and administrative
fees and charges, are found to be stationary at the 5 percent level (stationarity tests are undertaken using
the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test).62 Let                 denote the growth rate of the of the WB-CI at time (or
month)               2007, ... ,      2013 and by       the growth rate of variable 63 at time . The -variable
VAR model is given by:




where denotes the optimal lag length as determined using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). 		
 Using equation (8) we estimate our k-variable VAR model corresponding to the stationary variable and
generate impulse response functions (IRFs) to quantify the impact of a one percentage point shock in each
variable at time , on the growth rate of the WB-CI during the following next two years64. Based on these
results, the economy would be expected to grow by 0.03, 0.12, 0.17, 0.40 and 0.52 percentage points during
2013 if we observe a one percentage point increase in cement deliveries, taxes on real estate, cleared checks,
deposits to the private sector and VAT revenues, respectively, in December 2012 (Table 13).

61
   A VAR model is a system of equation in which each endogenous variable is related to its own lags as well as to lags of all the other
endogenous variables in the system.
62
     Tobacco excise, M3, tourist arrivals, primary spending, net exports (without energy) and lending to the private sector are not
stationary at the 5 percent level, hence we did not use them to generate impulse response functions.
63
     represents one of the following stationary variables: cement deliveries, VAT revenues, taxes on real estate, deposits to the private
sector, cleared checks and administrative fees and charges.
64
    A one percentage point shock increase in administrative fees and charges does not have a statistically significant impact on the
growth rate of the WB-CI.

81.	     The one-year ahead forecasting performance of the constructed WB-LI65 is encouraging. The
yearly average growth rate of the WB-LI leads the yearly growth rate of the WB-CI by a year (Table 13).
Furthermore, the yearly growth rate of the leading indicator at time follows almost the same pattern as the
yearly growth rate of the WB-CI at time , indicating that the WB-LI should be a useful forecasting tool (Figure
25). In fact, between December 2008 and October 2012, the average error between the yearly growth rate of
the WB-LI at time and the yearly growth rate of the WB-CI at time was only 0.36 percent, while the standard
deviation of this error was 0.35 percent.

82.	    To illustrate the importance of having timely and accurate economic data, it is instructive to look
at the (opposite) monetary policy implications arrived at depending on whether one uses the (new) WB-
CI or the existing BdL-CI. As detailed below, the latest reading from the BdL-CI points to an acceleration in
economic activity in Lebanon. The WB-CI, however, is showing an economy that is decelerating. A sustained
period with such diverging trends would result in sharply different monetary policy decisions. The growth rate
of the BdL-CI increased from 0.5 percent during the first ten months (10M) of 2012 to 2.9 percent during the
10M of 2013, suggesting that the Lebanese economy grew at faster rate in 2013. On the contrary, the WB-CI
showed that the economy grew by only 0.7 percent (yoy) during the first ten months of 2013 compared to 3
percent during the same period of last year, reflecting a deceleration in economic activity.

83.	Notwithstanding the deceleration in economic activity during 2013, the Lebanese economy is
expected to slightly pick up in 2014. Based on a blend between the WB-CI and the WB-LI we expect the
economy to grow by 0.9 percent during 2013. On the other hand, and based on the WB-LI, the economy is
forecasted to grow by 1.8 percent in 2014 assuming that the security conditions do not change compared to
2013. However, as events unfolded in January 2014, Lebanon was hit by five suicide attacks. As a result, as
detailed in the Prospects section, real GDP growth is expected to expand modestly, by 1.5 percent, in 2014.

seem to mount, in part due to imports substitution
away from cheap Syrian products, and localized price
pressure from the large Syrian refugee influx (e.g., on
rents). The refugee influx is also creating pressures
on both employment and nominal wages for host
communities, and crowding out access to and
lowering the quality of public services. The resulting
hardship for hosting communities is stirring social
tensions, which could further erode confidence
and, ultimately, macroeconomic stability. Prompt

The Brunt of the
Syrian Conflict
Lebanon: Economic and Social Impact of the
Syrian Conflict: (Special Focus 1) During the 2012-
2014 period, the conflict in Syria is having a large,
negative, and rapidly growing impact on Lebanon’s
economy, its social fabric, and its public services.
On the economic front, the deteriorating security
situation is undermining consumption, investment
which is dragging down growth. The cumulative
losses in economic activity could reach an estimated
USD7.5 billion. On the social front, social cohesion
is rapidly deteriorating partly due to combination of
rising poverty—approximately 170,000 Lebanese
would be pushed into poverty (over and above the
1 million currently living below the poverty line)—a
worsening labor market which is estimated to result
in a doubling of the unemployment rate to above
20 percent, rising insecurity, amid deteriorating core
public services. Public services are under pressure
given the sudden and large increase in their demand
arising from the Syrian refugee influx. The fiscal cost
of Syrian conflict is estimated at USD2.6 billion,
of which USD1.5 billion stems from foregone
government revenue collection while the remaining
USD1.1 billion are expenditure incurred by the
government to meet some of the surge in demand
for public services. Across all core public services,
the surge in demand is currently being partly met
through a decline in both the access to and the
quality of public service delivery. It is estimated that
an additional spending of USD2.5 billion would be
required for stabilization, i.e., to reinstate the access
to and quality of public services to their pre-Syrian
conflict level.
