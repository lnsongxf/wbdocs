   INTRODUCTION



1. Overcoming the twin challenges of child labour and youth employment will
be critical to Uganda’s progress towards the Millennium Development Goals.
Estimates presented in this report indicate that over 2.4 million children
aged 6-13 years are in employment. At the same time, most young people
remain trapped in informal sector jobs offering little prospect for
advancement or for escaping poverty and exploitation. The effects of child
labour and poor youth employment outcomes are well-documented: both
can lead to social vulnerability, societal marginalisation and deprivation, and
both can permanently impair lifetime patterns of employment and pay.
2. The report examines the related issues of child labour and youth
employment in the context of Uganda and builds on previous research
cooperation in Uganda involving the Uganda Bureau of Statistics, ILO-IPEC
and UCW in 20081 . Guided by observed outcomes in terms of schooling,
work activities and status in the labour market, the report considers the
economic as well as the social determinants of child labour and youth
employment. The 2011/2012 Uganda Labour Force and Child Activities
(NLF&CAS) survey and the 2012/2013 ILO School-to-Work Transition Survey
(STWT) are the primary data source for the report.
3. This report was developed jointly by the Government and the three UCW
partner agencies. As such, it provides an important common basis for action
in addressing child labour and youth employment issues. Four related
objectives are served by the report: (1) improve the information base on
child labour and youth employment, in order to inform policy and

   COUNTRY CONTEXT



6. Uganda is a landlocked country in East-Central Africa. Uganda is divided into
four regions, the Northern Region, the Central Region, the Eastern Region
and the Western Region, and subdivided into 111 districts. Kampala is the
largest city and capital of Uganda. The country’s terrain is mostly plateau
with rim of mountains. About 15 percent of Uganda consists of lakes, rivers
and swamps; and about 7 percent comprises highlands. Arable land accounts
for about 28 percent of the total area and permanent crops for over nine
percent. Draining of wetlands for agricultural use, deforestation, overgrazing,
soil erosion, water hyacinth infestation in Lake Victoria, widespread poaching
are among the environmental challenges facing the country.2
7. The country’s population of some 35 million is primarily rural –over 80
percent of the total population resides in rural areas. Population growth
represents an important challenge to poverty reduction in Uganda. Between
2003 and 2011, the population grew at 3.2 percent per year. In 2011, almost
half of the total population was below the age of 15, meaning dependency
rates are very high. Despite a decrease in the total fertility rate3 over the
period from 1991 to 2011, it remains very high, at 6.1 births per woman.4
8. Uganda experienced economic growth varying between four percent and 10
percent over the past decade. Growth remained well above the Sub-Saharan
Africa average in the face of consecutive exogenous shocks, including the
secondary effects of the global economic crisis, bad weather and surges in
international commodity prices.5 GDP grew by 4.1 percent in 2009, by 6.2
percent in 2010 and 2011 and by 2.8 percent in 2012 (Figure 1).The positive
GDP growth was mainly supported by the services, manufacturing and the
construction sectors.6

                9. The economy has experienced gradual structural transformation over the
                past two decades, moving away from subsistence agriculture to a mix of
                commercial agriculture, services and industry. As share of total output,
                services increased from 35 percent in 1990 to 51 percent in 2011; industry
                increased from 12 percent in 1991 to 25 percent in 20117, and agriculture
                decreased sharply from 53 percent in 1991 to 23 percent in 2011.These
                structural changes have helped to fuel migration from rural zones to the
                capital and to other urban centres where the new economic opportunities
                are concentrated.
                10. Given Uganda’s natural competitive advantage in terms of fertile land and
                a good climate, it is not expected that Uganda will move away from
                agricultural production altogether, but that it will orient its agricultural
                output towards regional and international exports. Consequently, the
                government’s agricultural strategy is focusing on the production and
                processing of agricultural exports, both traditional exports such as coffee and
                cotton and non-traditional exports such as horticulture, vanilla and
                honey.8The labour market transition has lagged the structural change of the
                economy, and, as discussed in this report, the bulk of new entrants into the
                labour market are absorbed by agriculture and by non-wage small
                enterprises.
                11. Infrastructure problems represent a major constraint to development in
                Uganda. Access to clean water and sanitation remains low in both urban and
                rural areas. The same is true for access to electricity due to limited national
                power grid coverage and low generation capacity. In terms of geographical
                divide, only six percent of the households in the rural areas have access to

grid power as compared to 40 percent of urban households.9 The vast
majority of households use fuel wood or charcoal to meet part of their
energy needs. The lack of adequate roads in rural areas is also a major
challenge. Human development indicators are slowly improving. Life
expectancy at birth, for example, increased from 47 years in 1991 to 58 years
in 2011, and the under-five mortality rate fell from 176 to 74 per 1,000 live
births over the same period.10 Access to improved sanitation facilities rose
from 28 to 34 percent over the period from 1991 to 2010. Uganda’s UN
Human Development Index (HDI) improved from 0.306 in 1990 to 0.456 in
2012. Notwithstanding these advances, Uganda ranks 161st out of 187
countries in the 2012 Human Development Index.11
12. During the period from 1992 to 2009, poverty in Uganda decreased by
more than half (from 56.4 to 24.5 percent). Poverty is mainly a rural
phenomenon: in rural areas 27 percent of people were living below the
poverty line in 2009, compared to 9 percent in urban areas.12Human
development indicators are also generally much better among urban
households, but there are some particular problems faced by the urban
poor. Northern Uganda has the highest rate of income poverty at nearly 60
percent, and poverty reduction in north and north-eastern regions has only
been marginal.13Inequality has decreased in recent years, but remains higher
than in the early- and mid-nineties. The Gini coefficient, a measure of
consumption inequality, was 37.1 in 1996, rose to 45.8 in 2002 and then fell
to 44.3 in 2009.14
                                                              15
13. Gender disparities in Uganda persist in many dimensions. Women are
                            16
generally poorer than men, participate less in the labour market, and their
wages are significantly lower than men’s. Women’s land rights are limited in
Uganda both by inequitable legal structure and by traditional practice. In
education, while there is increasing gender equity at the primary school
level, large disparities persist at higher levels of schooling. The gender
inequality index17 was 0.517 in 2011.

16 Households headed by female widows are consistently poorer than others, and household headed by married women
(probably mostly married to polygamous or absent husbands) are poorer than other households.
17 The Gender Inequality Index(GII) reflects women’s disadvantage in three dimensions—reproductive health, empowerment
and the labour market—for as many countries as data of reasonable quality allow. The index shows the loss in human
development due to inequality between female and male achievements in these dimensions. Further details are available at

14. Thanks to significant investments in education, Uganda has made great
strides in raising children’s school enrolment.The primary net enrolment has
hovered above 90 percent in recent years, contributing to increase literacy.
The literacy rate of youths aged 15-24 years has increased from 81 percent
in 2002 to 88 percent in 2008.18However primary completion rates remain
low, especially for girls, due to class repetition and a variety of other supply-
and demand-side factors. Curriculum relevance, inadequate school facilities,
inadequate sanitation, lack of school feeding/lunch programmes, long travel
distances and an unfriendly school environment are among the supply-side
factors affecting completion. Demand-side issues include poverty, out-of-
pocket costs, HIV, early marriage or pregnancy, domestic responsibilities and
attitudes towards schooling. Further, with the introduction of Universal
Primary Education (UPE) in 1997 the number of children attending school
increased considerably, leading to very large classes at the lower grades and
poorer school quality, in turn negatively affecting completion rates.19An issue
associated with low completion rates is that of over age students. Estimates
from the 2006 Demographic and Health Survey indicate that 77 percent of
the male primary school students and 74 percent of the female students
were over-age.
15. Uganda made important progress during the 1990s against HIV/AIDS
(Figure 2). The success was due to a variety of measures that enabled
changes in sexual behaviour, as well as provision of care and support
services. The decrease in HIV prevalence was particularly rapid in urban
areas. However, the situation has deteriorated in recent years. Recent
estimates indicate that the annual number of new HIV infections in the
country increased by over 11 percent in the period from 2007/08 to
2009/10.20 Prevalence has decreased among adults in the age range 25-34
years but increased among youth aged 15-24 years and adults in the 35-49
years age group.21This rise among youth has been exacerbated by a lack of
youth-friendly adolescent and HIV services.

                       16. Uganda has made much progress towards many of the Millennium
                       Development Goals (MDGs). Progress has been most impressive in reducing
                       the proportion of the population that lives below the national poverty line
                       and suffers from hunger. Moreover the target of gender parity in primary
                       education has been achieved and the country is also on track to meet targets
                       for access to safe water. In other areas progress has been slow, towards
                       targets such as child mortality, maternal mortality, access to reproductive
                       health and the incidence of malaria and other diseases. In a few cases, as for
                       the target on reversing the spread of HIV/AIDS, there has been a reverse
                       trend over the past years.22 (Table 1).

       CHILDREN’S INVOLVEMENT IN WORK AND
       SCHOOLING



    17. This chapter looks at the time use patterns of children in Uganda,
    focusing in particular on the extent of children’s involvement in work and
    schooling. The analysis is based on data from the 2011/2012 Uganda Labour
    Force and Child Activities Survey (NLF&CAS), a nationally representative
    household-based survey designed to study the country’s labour market
    across all age groups to provide information on children’s activities. The
    survey collected detailed information on the time uses of children, including
    their involvement in employment, household chores and schooling, their
    working hours, workplace hazards and work-related ill health.
    18. The chapter focuses primarily on children aged from six years, rather than
    from five years, as six years is the age at which compulsory schooling begins
    in Uganda.23 The lower bound of six years therefore permits assessing the
    interplay between employment and schooling.


3.1 Extent of children’s employment


   Almost one-third of all children aged 6-13 years are in employment
   Aggregate estimates of children’s involvement in employment mask significant
    variation by age, sex, place of residence and migration status, with important
    implications for policy and targeting.


                                                                                  24
    19. Children’s involvement in employment    remains common in Uganda25.
    Thirty-one percent of children aged 6-13 years, about 2.4 million children in
    absolute terms, are in employment. The share of older, 14-17 year-old,


    23Statistics on children’s involvement in employment from the age of five years are provided in Table A1 in the Statistical
    Appendix.
    24Children  in employment is a broad concept covering all market production and certain types of non-market production
    (principally the production of goods for own use) (see also Panel 2). It includes forms of work in both the formal and informal
    sectors, as well as forms of work both inside and outside family settings. For reasons of comparability across countries, the
    employment definition used in this Report does not include the collection of firewood and water fetching.
    25   Involvement in child labour is discussed in further detail in section 3.10 of this report.

             children in employment is much higher at 57 percent. These aggregate
             estimates of children’s employment mask important differences by age, sex,
             residence, migration status and other background factors, as discussed
             further below.


Panel 2.   Children's work and child labour: A note on terminology
In accordance with the standards for national child labour statistics set at the 18th International Conference of Labour
Statisticians (Res. II), this study distinguishes between two broad categories of child workers – children in employment and
children in other productive activities. The definition of children in employment in turn derives from the System of National
Accounts (SNA) (Rev. 1993), the conceptual framework that sets the international statistical standards for the measurement of
the market economy. It covers children in all market production and in certain types of non-market production, including
production of goods for own use. Children in other productive activities are defined as children in productive activities
falling outside the SNA production boundary. They consist mainly of work activities performed by household members in
service to the household and its members, i.e., household chores.

    ACTIVITIES




The term “child labour” is used to refer to the subset of children’s work that is injurious, negative or undesirable to children
and that should be targeted for elimination. It can encompass both children in employment and children in other productive
activities. Three main international conventions – the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), ILO Convention No.
182 (Worst Forms) and ILO Convention No. 138 (Minimum Age) – provide the main legal standards for child labour and a
framework for efforts against it.
Child labour in the context of Uganda is defined primarily by the Employment Act 2006, No. 6 and the Occupational Safety and
Health Act No. 9, 2006. The specific statistical definitions employed to measure child labour in the context of Uganda are
discussed in section 3.10 of this report. For reasons of comparability across countries, the employment definition used in this
report does not include the collection of firewood and water fetching.


             20. One way of viewing the interplay between children’s employment and
             schooling is by disaggregating the child population into four non-overlapping
             activity groups – children in employment exclusively, children attending

            school exclusively, children combining both activities and children doing
            neither. This disaggregation shows that about 62 percent of all children aged
            6-13 years attend school exclusively while 29 percent of all 6-13 year-olds
            work while also attending school (Table 2 and Table 3). Only about two
            percent of children are in employment exclusively, i.e., are working without
            also going to school, while the remaining seven percent of 6-13 year-olds are
            not involved in employment or in schooling.

            21. Activity patterns differ somewhat for children in the 14-17 years age
            group. A smaller share of this group is in school exclusively (40 percent) and
            a greater share is in employment exclusively (14 percent) (Table 4 and Table
            5). This is not surprising, as compulsory school ends at age 12 years, so by
            the age of 14 many children may have already transitioned to work. By the
            age of 17 years, 24 percent of children are in employment exclusively, 37
            percent are still in school exclusively and 34 percent are combining
            employment and schooling. School to work transitions, and youth
            employment outcomes more generally, are taken up in Chapter 4 of this
            report.

            22. Children’s involvement in work rises with age, especially from seven years
            of age onwards, reaching more than 49 percent at age 13 years (Figure 3).
            This pattern is undoubtedly in large part the product of the fact that
            children’s productivity (and therefore the opportunity cost of keeping them
            in school) rises as they grow older. Numbers of very young children in work
            are nonetheless far from negligible. Already at age six years, almost one in
            ten children is involved in employment. Involvement in schooling peaks in
            the age range of 9-11 years at almost 97 percent and decreases thereafter as
            children drop out to work in employment and/or to undertake a greater
            share of household chores. The move out of schooling, therefore, begins
            prior to the end of compulsory schooling, as illustrated in Figure 3 below.26




               is important to highlight that Uganda has free and compulsory primary education up to and including age 12 years, but the
            26It

            general minimum age for work is 14 years, which creates a gap between the minimum age for work and the ending age for
            compulsory education. Children aged 13 years are not required to be attending school but are not legally permitted to be
            engaged in work other than “light” work.

               23. Children’s involvement in employment does not differ appreciably by sex i.
               Girls aged 6-13 years are as likely to work as boys in the same age range (31
               percent) (Table 2). School attendance also differs little by gender; the school
               attendance rate of girls is higher than that of boys by less than two
               percentage points. But in interpreting these figures it is worth recalling that
               household chores, such as child care performed within one’s own home, a
               form of work in which girls typically predominate, are not considered in the
               estimates. It is also worth underscoring that girls are often
               disproportionately represented in less visible and therefore underreported
               forms of child labour such as domestic service in third party households.
               Employment estimates, therefore, may understate girls’ involvement in
               employment relative to that of boys.
               24. Children’s employment in Uganda is prevalently a rural phenomenon.
               Children in rural areas are three times more likely to be in employment than
               their peers in cities and towns (34 percent against 11 percent) (Table 3). The
               rural nature of children’s employment is even more evident in absolute
               terms: rural children in employment number 2.3 million while their
               counterparts in cities and towns number only 106 thousand Explanations of
               the marked rural-urban difference in children’s employment are the large
               participation of children in subsistence agriculture and the fact that over 80
               percent of Uganda’s total population resides in rural areas. Rural children are
               also disadvantaged in terms of their ability to attend school. Overall, the
               school attendance rate of rural children is about four percentage points less
               than that of urban children for the 6-13 years age group (Table 3).

                                                                                                               27
Orphanhood is very common in Uganda, a result in part of the HIV/AIDS crisis. Estimates from NLF&CAS
                                                                                       28         29
2011/2012indicate that about 1,240,700 Ugandan children aged 6- 13 years are maternal, paternal or double
         30
orphans, accounting for about 16 percent of this age group (Panel Table A). An additional large number of the
children, 836,600, or 11 percent of the 6-13 years age group, are in a fostering arrangement. Fostering
arrangements refer to situations in which both parents are alive but the child is being fostered in another
household, usually headed by a grandparent or by another relative.

The descriptive evidence indicates that there is a higher share of orphan children in employment. However,
regression results do not suggest that orphaned children are at greater risk of employment and denied
schooling when other child-, household- and community-related background variables are controlled for (Table
10). This suggests that the conditions in which orphaned children find themselves (e.g., household poverty),
rather than orphanhood per se, explain the difference in the employment and school attendance between
orphans and non-orphans.



           25. Children’s involvement in employment varies considerably by region of
           residence (Figure 4). In Kampala, only three percent of children are in
           employment against 30 percent in Eastern region, 31 percent in Western
           region and 45 percent of children in the Central region. Variations by region
           in terms of school attendance are also large; school attendance ranges from
           84 percent in the Northern Region to 96 percent in the Central Region.

                  26. Uganda has seen only small progress against children’s employment in
                  recent years. A comparison of the results of the Uganda National Household
                  Survey (UNHS) 2005/2006 and the Uganda Labour Force and Child Activities
                  Survey (NLF&CAS) 2011/2012 indicates a decrease in children’s employment
                  by 1.4 percentage points (Figure 5). The reduction in children’s employment
                  has been accompanied by an almost equivalent increase in the school
                  attendance rate.

      3.2 Children’s household chores


               Around seven of ten children aged 6-13 years perform household chores as part of
                their daily lives, adding to their total work burden.
               Twenty-five percent of children face the triple burden of employment, household
                chores and schooling, with obvious consequences on their time for study, rest and
                leisure.

                27. A large proportion of Ugandan children also work in unpaid household
                services (i.e., household chores). Around seven of ten children aged 6-13
                years perform household chores as part of their daily lives. This category of
                production falls outside the international System of National Accounts (SNA)
                production boundary and is typically excluded from published estimates of
                child labour (see Panel 2 on terminology). A higher share of girls than boys
                perform chores, although the difference by sex in involvement in chores is
                not large up to the age of 13 (Figure 6). Performing household chores is
                more common among rural children than among children living in towns or
                cities (not shown). This result is likely attributable in part to the better
                coverage and closer proximity of basic services in urban areas.

                28. Fetching water, cleaning and collecting firewood are the most common
                forms of chores performed by children (Figure 7). Gender-based differences
                are clearer for specific types of chores –girls are much more likely than boys
                to be assigned responsibility for chores such as cleaning, cooking and care-
                giving. A very large share of children in rural areas is given the task of
                collecting firewood. It is worth noting that the chores listed in Figure 7 are
                not mutually exclusive – indeed, most children performing chores are
                responsible for more than one type of chore within the household.

      29. Considering household chores adds another layer of complexity to the
      discussion of children’s time use. Children may perform chores in
      combination with school, employment or in combination with both school
      and employment (Figure 8). This more complex – but also more
      comprehensive – picture of children’s activities is depicted in Figure 9.

      30. Twenty-five percent of children face this triple burden of employment,
      household chores and schooling, with obvious consequences on their time
      for study, rest and leisure. An additional 39 percent of children perform
      household chores while also attending school. Only 23 percent of children,
      by contrast, are able to attend school unburdened by any work and
      household chores responsibilities. About four percent of Ugandan children
      are completely inactive, i.e., not attending school or performing any form of
      productive activity.31

            31. Involvement in work rises to 73 percent among Ugandan 6-13 year-olds,
            over 5.6 million in absolute terms, using a combined measure of work.32This
            measure simply combines involvement in economic and non-economic
            activity as defined in the 2011/2012 Uganda Labour Force and Child
            Activities Survey questionnaire, i.e., children spending at least one hour in
            employment during the week prior to the survey and/or some time on
            household chores in the week prior to the survey. Girls’ work involvement
            using this combined measure exceeds that of boys at almost every age
            (Figure 10). Differences are also large by residence; indeed in rural areas
            children are consistently more likely to be involved in some combination of
            employment and household chores.




            32Developing such a combined measure, however, is not straightforward, as it requires decisions concerning how a unit of time
            in chores should be weighted vis-à-vis a unit of time in employment. This remains an area of some debate, as underlying it is
            the question of whether housework has similar implications on child welfare as work in employment.

3.3       Nature of children’s work


         Working children are concentrated primarily in unremunerated family work in the
          agriculture sector.

          32. Information on the various characteristics of children’s work is necessary
          for understanding the nature of children’s work and children’s role in the
          labour force. This section presents data on broad work characteristics that
          are useful in this context33.
          33. The agriculture sector accounts for almost all of children’s employment.
          Figure 11, which reports the composition of children’s employment by sector
          and status, indicates that 96 percent of employed children aged 6-13 years
          work in agriculture. The small remaining fraction of children in employment
          (four percent) is distributed across commerce, manufacturing and services.
          Those in services include children working as domestic servants, a group
          particularly vulnerable to exploitation and abuse (see Panel             5).
          The overwhelming majority of children in employment (88 percent) work for
          their families as unpaid labourers. Almost ten percent of the remaining
          children are in self-employment and two percent are in paid work.

     Panel 5.         Child domestic servants are especially vulnerable to exploitation and abuse
     Children working as domestic servants are especially vulnerable to exploitation and abuse in Uganda. These children commonly lack
     clear terms of service, work long hours with little or no remuneration, lack opportunities for education, are given insufficient food, and
     risk sexual exploitation and physical abuse from their employers.
     In 2011/2012, according to the Uganda Labour Force and Child Activities (NLF&CAS) survey, 1.6 percent of children aged 5-17 years in
     employment were domestic workers, 67,900 in absolute terms. The share of domestic workers among employed girls stood at 2.1
     percent while that of boys at 1.0 percent. Girl domestic workers logged an average of 80 hours per week in domestic service, while boys
     an average of 39 hours. Only eight percent of girl domestic workers were attending school in combination with work.
     It is important to highlight that these estimates represent an underestimation of the phenomenon. The effective measurement of child
     domestic workers is complicated by the fact that they work in private homes, hidden from public scrutiny and under a variety of formal
     and informal work arrangements. Confusion can also occur in drawing the line between involvement in household chores in a chi ld’s
     own home and situations of child domestic work, as many child domestic workers are not remunerated directly but instead provided with
     lodging, food, clothing, and sometimes schooling in exchange of many hours a day in housework.




               34. The composition of children’s employment differs substantially from that
               of youth (i.e., 18-30 year-olds) and prime-age adults (i.e., 31-64 year-olds).
               As also reported in Figure 12, child workers are much more concentrated in
               unpaid family work and in agriculture relative to older segments of the
               labour force.

          35. The nature of children’s employment differs between rural and urban
          areas. Agriculture predominates both in rural and urban areas (Table 6); 96
          percent of rural children and 79 percent of urban ones work in agriculture.
          The large share of urban children in agriculture is a reflection of the
          continued importance of the agriculture in the urban informal economy in
          Uganda.34Services and commerce play a relatively more important role in
          urban areas, accounting for 10 and eight percent, respectively, of urban
          children in employment, but for only a negligible share of rural children in
          employment. In terms of status in employment, urban children are more
          likely than their rural peers to be in paid employment, although unpaid
          family work predominates for urban and rural children alike. There are also
          differences in terms of nature in employment between male and female
          children, but these differences are not large (Table 6).

          36. Uganda children aged 6-13 years in employment log an average of 12
          working hours per week. The time intensity of work rises with age, from
          seven hours at age six years to 14 hours at age 13 years (Figure 13). Not
          surprisingly, working hours are strongly negatively correlated with school
          attendance: the small group of working children not in school puts in 18
          more working hours each week than children combining work and school (28
          hours versus 10 hours) (Table 7).

             37. Differences in working hours across sectors of work are considerable
             (Table 8). The average working week is longest in the commerce sector (22
             hours), followed by services (21 hours), manufacturing (20 hours) and
             agriculture (11 hours). The time intensity of children’s employment also
             appears to be influenced by status in employment. Children in paid work, for
             example, log an average of 21 hours per week (about 11 hours more than
             their peers in unpaid family work). There are not big differences by sex and
             residence in the hours devoted to work across employment sectors and
             statuses, with the exception of paid workers in urban areas, who work an
             average of 15 hours more than those in rural areas.

                                 38. A significant number of Uganda children put in extremely long working
                                 hours.This point is illustrated by Figure 14 which reports the density
                                 distribution and the cumulative distribution of working children by working
                                 hours. The density distribution of children in employment indicates that
                                 while working children are clustered in the range of hours per week below
                                 14 hours, there is a non-negligible number of working children in the “tail” of
                                 the distribution performing long working hours. Similarly, the cumulative
                                 distribution of children by working hours shows that eight percent children in
                                 employment log at least 30 hours per week and that four percent, some
                                 51,200 in absolute terms, put in more than 40 hours per week. These are
                                 among the worst off working children, as their work responsibilities preclude
                                 their rights to schooling, study, leisure and adequate rest and their
                                 prolonged exposure to workplace risks increases their susceptibility to work-
                                 related sickness and injury.

        3.4 Exposure to hazardous workplace conditions


               Three-quarters of all children in employment are exposed to dangerous conditions
                in their workplaces.

                40. Hazardous conditions are alarmingly common in the workplaces where
                children are found and affect both younger (6-13 years) and older (14-17
                years) children. In all, 75 percent of 6-13 year-olds in employment, 981,000
                children in absolute terms, were exposed to at least one of the hazardous
                conditions listed in Figure 16. Poor environmental conditions (i.e., exposure
                to dust and smoke), insect or snake bites, dangerous tools were the most

       41. Exposure to hazardous conditions appears to depend considerably on the
       sector in which children are working. For children aged 6-13 in employment,
       exposure is highest among those in the “other” sector (which includes
       children in construction, mining and quarrying) and for those in agriculture.
       (Figure 17).

           42. Information from other sources also highlights the dangerous conditions
           faced by many Ugandan working children in agriculture. They are exposed to
           the following hazards: noise and vibration, carrying heavy loads, exposure to
           dust, fumes, hazardous chemicals (pesticides), extreme temperatures,
           dangerous machinery, long hours of work, exposure to smoke and animal
           attacks. The risk and possible consequences include loss of hearing,
           poisoning (acute and chronic), cuts and wounds, fatigue, long term health
           problems, respiratory diseases, musculoskeletal injuries.35


           Panel 6.              Children working in the fishing sectors
           An assessment conducted on children working in the fishing sector contributes to shed light on the hazards to which children
           are exposed. These children receive little or no pay, work long hours processing and smoking fish, and risk injuries from burns
           and fatigue. According to an ILO study on child labour in the fisheries (2008), which collected data on 292 children aged 5-17
           years, of all children taking part in the study, 94 percent were in hazardous work and 71 percent were injured or fell sick in the
           six months previous to the survey. Malaria affected children the most (49 percent), followed by injuries and wounds (42
           percent). Majority of children (59 percent) were not attending school and only 11 percent studied beyond primary.

           13 percent of 6-13 year-olds in employment and 14 percent 14-17 year-olds
           in employment report experiencing some form of verbal or physical violence
           in the workplace (Figure 18). Violence is more likely to occur in the

            work for someone other than their parents or close relatives. Girls are more
            likely to suffer violence in the workplace than boys, especially as they grow
            older.

3.5 Educational impact of children’s work


           Children’s employment is associated with lower levels of school attendance and
            grade-for-age, but these effects are limited primarily to children in the post
            compulsory schooling age range.



            44. The degree to which work interferes with children’s schooling is one of
            the most important determinants of the long-term impact of early work
            experience. Reduced educational opportunities constitute the main link
            between child labour, on the one hand, and youth employment outcomes,
            on the other. Clearly, if the exigencies of work mean that children are denied
            schooling altogether or are less able to perform in the classroom, then these
            children will not acquire the human capital necessary for more gainful
            employment upon entering adulthood. This section looks at evidence of the
            educational impact of children’s work. Links between child labour, human
            capital levels and youth employment outcomes in Uganda are explored in
            more detail in Chapter 4 of this report.

               45. The school attendance of children in employment lags behind that of non-
               working children at the post-compulsory level.37An attendance gap favouring
               non-working children begins from age 13, which corresponds to the end of
               the compulsory cycle. The gap in attendance increases from five percentage
               points at age 13 years to almost 30 percentage points at age 17 years (Figure
               19).
               46. Not surprisingly, involvement in work and the time children actually
               spend working are negatively correlated with school attendance. As
               illustrated in Figure 20, the likelihood of a working child attending school falls
               off sharply as the number of hours he or she must work each week increases.
               The school attendance of working children varies by work sector; children
               working in the service sector and those in wage work are least likely to
               attend school (Figure 21). About one in five children working in services and
               about one in four in wage employment do not go to school. Working children
               have also a shorter school life expectancy than non working children




               36School attendance refers to children attending school at the time of the survey. As such it is a more restrictive concept than
               enrolment, as school attendance excludes those formally enrolled in school according to school records but not currently
               attending.
               37Indeed,   among young children, the attendance rate of working children actually exceeds that of non-working children, although
               this is likely in large part due to the distorting effects of late enrolment. Separate calculations indicate that non-working children
               are more likely to be late entrants; the reasons for this, however, require further investigation. Enrolment figures by age in
               Uganda points to a general problem of late enrolment. The average age of students attending school if higher than what it
               should be, for all grades or levels of education. The average age of children in the first grade is 7.3 rather than six years, and is
               8.6 years in the second grade rather than seven years.

                                           47. But most Ugandan working children do in fact attend school, so a key
                                           question is how work affects their school performance. Data on average
                                           grade-for-age show that children in employment lag slightly behind their
                                           non-working counterparts in terms of grade progression, but again these
                                           differences relate primarily to the post-compulsory age range(Figure 22).38


                                           38Butbecause child workers are more likely to drop out after primary school, and because drop outs are presumably those with
                                           higher accumulated delay, the gap reported in Figure 22is likely to underestimate the true gap in completed grades between
                                           working and non-working children, i.e., the gap that would be observed in the absence of selective drop out.

 3.6 Out-of-school children and “second chance learning needs”


           A large share of children are out of school and in need of second chance learning
            opportunities.



            48. Out of school children constitute another important related policy priority
            in Uganda. Some 659,500 children aged 6-13 years, over eight percent of
            this age group, are out of school (Figure 23). Many of these children are
            simply late entrants, as shown by the sharp decline in out-of-school children
            from the age of six to nine years. Taking the narrower group of 10-13 year-
            olds to eliminate most potential late entrants, some 193,000 (almost five
            percent) are out of school. About 48 percent of these children never
            attended school and the remainder dropped out prematurely.

                  49. What are these out of school children doing? Around 78 percent of
                  children aged 10 to 13 years work in some form of productive activity, about
                  8 percent in employment exclusively, 24 percent in household chores
                  exclusively and 47 percent in both (Figure 24), again underscoring the close
                  link between getting children out of work and getting them into school. Out-
                  of-school girls are more likely than boys to be involved in productive
                  activities by almost ten percentage points (Appendix Figure A4).

Panel 7.    Disability and educational marginalization in Uganda.
The disabled are among the least visible of the marginalized children. Children with disabilities face
significant hurdles in enrolling, attending and completing school. Beyond the immediate health-
related effects, physical and mental impairment carries a stigma that is often a basis for exclusion
from society and school.
A recent study indicates that children with disabilities are at least two times more likely to be out of
school than other children. For those disabled children who are in school, grade progression is is
slower than for other children. The disadvantage that disabled children face depends on the nature
and extent of their impairment. For example, about 71 percent of children who report facing a lot of
difficulty seeing with glasses were attending school compared to about 36 percent of children who
had a lot of difficulty with self-care (Moyi, 2012).
Limited statistical information exists on disabilities in Uganda, and evidence is even scarcer on the
linkages between disabilities and children’s employment. The African Child Policy Forum (ACPF)
found that of the 540 disabled children surveyed, 12 percent children were involved in paid work
outside their home. Most of them were engaged in selling goods, farm work and domestic work. As
many children with disabilities between the age of 14 and 18 years become disillusioned about the
value of continuing in education, the ACPF study indicates that their parents seek alternatives in
skills training, mainly through informal apprenticeship with local artisans.
Uganda recognizes the need to reach all children with educational opportunities, and ensuring
access to education for children with disabilities is a key objective of the Ministry of Education and
Sports. Notwithstanding the government’s efforts, much needs to be done with regard to properly
assessing the disabilities, collecting more accurate and reliable data, training teachers for working
with children in different special needs categories, and providing all schools with educational
resources to serve these children.

50. The second chance learning needs of Ugandan children are significant.
Some 279,000, or 40 percent, of out-of-school children in the 10-17 years
age group39 suffer what UNESCO terms “education poverty”, i.e., possess
less than four years of education, the minimum amount of school time
considered by UNESCO as necessary for acquiring basic literacy skills. Of this
group, 215,500, or 31 percent, suffer and “extreme education poverty”, i.e.,
possess less than two years of schooling (Table 9). Reaching the group of
out-of-school children with second chance educational opportunities is
therefore critical to ensuring that these children do not graduate into
adulthood lacking the basic skills needed for work and life.




39 Younger, six to nine year-old, children are excluded from consideration because many from this age group that are out of
school are likely to enrol as late-entrants, as discussed above. Older, 15-17 year-old, children are included because many from
this group have also had their education compromised by premature involvement in work and therefore are also relevant to the
discussion of school chance learning needs.

 3.7 Children’s work and health


        Ugandan working children face a very high risk of ill-health and injury related to
         work.



         51. Ugandan working children, especially the youngest, face a very high risk of
         ill-health and injury related to work.40Working children face about a 47
         percent chance of suffering ill-health related to work over the course of a 12-
         month period.41 Children aged 5-11 years face a 70 percent chance of work-
         related ill-health or injury, while 14-17 year-olds face a 39 percent chance.
         The risk of ill-health among child workers appears to depend on the type of
         work they are involved in: incidence is highest for the agriculture sector (57
         percent) and for unpaid work within the family unit (61 percent).




         40The general ill health variable reflects illnesses (such us skin problems, eye problems, breathing problems, stomach
         problems, diarrhoea, fever, extreme fatigue, or other illnesses) or injuries (such as superficial injuries or open wounds, fractures,
         dislocations, sprains or stains,burns, corrosions, scalds or frostbite back/muscle pain or other injuries) in the last 12 months. The
         work-related ill-health variable reflects illnesses/injuries in the last 12 months and, that, in the opinion of the respondent,
         occurred because of work.
         41To   take exposure into consideration, a standard incidence density is computed as follows:

         where “total person time” is cumulated exposure for all the individuals considered

                          52. But the relationship between child work and health is complex, and often
                          difficult to disentangle empirically. The negative impact of child work on
                          health, for example, may be obscured by the selection of the healthiest
                          children for work. Health perceptions may also differ across population
                          groups, and levels of reported illness among working children and non-
                          working children may be affected by different perceptions of illness. Much of
                          the relationship between child health and work is dynamic (i.e., current
                          health is affected by past as much as present work, and current work affects
                          future as much as present health), a fact not captured by measuring
                          reported illness over a short period. This is an area where further
                          methodological work is required.42


      3.8 Determinants of children’s work


                         Household decisions concerning children’s work and schooling are influenced by a
                          number of individual and community background factors.
                         Children’s age, sex and orphan status, household structure, household education
                          level, and household wealth, inter alia, all play a significant role in determining
                          children’s involvement in work.

53. As most children (excluding those living on their own) exercise little
control over their time allocations, determining why children work requires
investigating why parents choose to engage their children in work rather
than sending them to school. Both socio-cultural and economic
considerations are important in this context. Households are influenced by
the perceived costs of child labour and benefits of schooling. But social
norms, cultural attitudes and perceptions, e.g., regarding girls’ schooling or
early marriage, also direct household decisions on children’s school and
work.
54. This section makes use of econometric evidence from NLF&CAS
2011/2012 to identify some of the factors influencing parents’ decisions
concerning their children’s time use. A bivariate probit model is employed to
jointly determine the correlated decisions on child schooling and work. A
simple economic model of household behaviour is used to guide the
empirical specification.43Two regression analyses are conducted. One taking
into consideration children aged 6-13 in employment and the other one
considering children aged 14-17 years involved in hazardous employment.
The results indicate that many of the variables looked at, e.g., migration
status, orphan status, parental illness, household head education and
household employment benefits, have a particularly important role in
determining the involvement of older, 14-17 year-old, children in
employment and schooling.
55. Annex I and Table A5 describe and present the summary descriptive
statistics of the variables included in the econometric analysis.




43For detailed information on the model, see Cigno, A.; Rosati, F.C. 2005, The economics of child labour(New York, NY,
OxfordUniversity Press). The analysis carried out in this section is, obviously, conditioned by the information available.
Notwithstanding the extensiveness of the survey utilised, potentially important variables are missing. In particular, information on
the relative price of child work is difficult to capture: indicators for returns to education, work and household chores are not easily
available (for a discussion of the role played by unobservables refer to Deb and Rosati, Determinants of Child Labour and
School Attendance: The Role of Household Observables, December 2002).

                                                                                                                                                              UGANDA INTER-AGENCY COUNTRY REPORT|Children’s involvement in work and schooling
56. Results of the econometric analysis are reported in Table 10; some of the
key qualitative inferences from the analysis are presented below.
      Sex of child. Parents’ decisions concerning whether to involve their
       children in school or work do not appear influenced by gender
       considerations. There is, however, one exception to this general
       finding: male children aged 14-17 years appear to be more likely than
       their female peers to be in hazardous employment while also
       studying, and less likely than their female peers to be neither working
       nor studying.
      Internal migration. Migration has a negative impact on children’s
       time use for the 6-13 years and 14-17 years age ranges. Migrant
       children aged 6-13 years are about four percentage points less likely
       to attend school than non-migrant children and at the same time are
       about two percentage points more likely than non-migrant children
       to work in employment. Migrant 6-13 year-olds are about three
       percentage points more likely to be inactive (i.e. in neither
       employment nor education) than their non-migrant peers. The
       negative impact of migration appears even greater for older, 14-17
       year-old, children. Older migrant children are six percentage points
       more likely to be in hazardous employment exclusively and about 13
       percentage points less likely to attend school exclusively than non-
       migrant children in the same age range.
      Orphan status. About 1. 2 million children aged 6- 13 years are
       orphans, accounting for about 16 percent of this age group. While
       descriptive evidence indicates that there is a higher share of
       orphaned children compared to non-orphans in employment and a
       lower share in schooling, the regression results do not indicate that
       orphaned children in the 6-13 years age range are at significantly
       greater risk of employment and denied schooling when other
       background characteristics are controlled for. This suggests that the
       conditions in which orphaned children find themselves (e.g.,
       household poverty), rather than orphanhood per se, explain the
       difference in the employment and school attendance between
       orphans and non-orphans. Older children who have lost both parents
       are four percentage points more likely to be in hazardous
       employment exclusively and are nine percentage points less likely to
       attend school exclusively compared to their non-orphan peers.
      Illness of mother and/or father. The parents’ temporary or
       permanent unavailability for work due to illness appears to push
       children out of school and into work to support the family income or
       alternatively to keep children from going to school to take care of the


             UGANDA INTER-AGENCY COUNTRY REPORT |Children’s involvement in work and schooling   46
    sick. Again, older child labourers belonging to households with both
    or one parent sick are much more exposed to child labour and denied
    schooling.
   Household composition. The presence of elderly household members
    significantly increases children’s risk of employment and denied
    schooling. This result suggests that, the social vulnerabilities
    associated with aging (e.g., loss of the ability to earn income,
    declining physical health) can increase the social vulnerability of the
    household as a whole, and can force families to rely on child labour
    as a coping strategy. The presence of more prime-age adults (and
    therefore breadwinners) in the household has instead the opposite
    effect, reducing the likelihood of children’s employment and
    increasing the probability of children attending school exclusively.
   Household wealth. Younger children from poorest households are
    more than eight percentage points less likely to go to school
    exclusively and almost three percentage points more likely to
    participate in employment exclusively compared to children from
    richest households.
   Household ownership of livestock. Children belonging to household
    owning animals are more likely to be in employment and less likely to
    be exclusively attending school. One reason for this is that when a
    household owns livestock there is an increase in the demand for
    labour within the family unit, outweighing the income effect
    associated with livestock ownership.
   Household head education. Higher household head education levels
    make it more likely that a child attends school and less likely that he
    or she is in employment. A 6-13 year-old child from a household
    whose head possesses a secondary education, for example, is three
    percentage points less likely to work and ten percentage points more
    likely to attend school, compared to a child from a household whose
    head has no education. The effect of parent’s education on older
    children is amplified. A 14-17 year-old child from a household whose
    head possesses a secondary education, for example, is about seven
    percentage points less likely to be in hazardous work exclusively and
    13 percentage points more likely to attend school exclusively
    compared to a child from a household whose head has no education.
   Household employment benefits. Children in the 6-13 years age range
    belonging to household where the head is an employee with social
    security and/or medical benefits are almost six percentage points less
    likely to work in employment compared to children from other
    households. Again, the effects are even stronger for older children.

       This in turn underscores the importance of social security in reducing
       the household vulnerabilities associated with child labour.
       Households with a basic social protection floor under them are less
       likely to have to rely on child labour as a coping strategy.
      Access to basic services. Access to electricity reduces the likelihood of
       involvement in employment among 6-13 year-olds by almost 22
       percentage points while making it two percentage points more likely
       that a child attends school. Access to tap water is also very relevant.
       Children aged 6-13 years from households with tap water are five
       percentage points less likely to work and more than four percentage
       points more likely to attend school. Basic services are important
       determinants, in large part they influence the value of children’s time
       outside of the classroom. In contexts where access to electricity and
       water are limited children must often shoulder a greater burden for
       tasks such as hauling water and fetching fuelwood.
       Place of residence. Children aged 6-13 years living in urban areas are
        18 percentage points less likely to work, exclusively or in combination
        with schooling, and are 16 percentage points more likely to attend
        school exclusively, consistent with the descriptive evidence
        presented previously. Region of residence also affects the division of
        time between work and school.
57. Children’s employment is a complex phenomenon and the factors
mentioned above clearly represent only a partial list of determinants. Better
data and more in-depth analysis are needed for a more complete
understanding of why children become involved in work. More information
on availability of infrastructure, school quality, access to credit markets,
coverage of social protection schemes, is especially needed. As stated at the
beginning of this section, decisions concerning children’s work and schooling
are driven by both economic and socio-cultural factors, and a better
understanding is also needed of the role of the latter. The unique
circumstances causing children’s involvement in worst forms of child labour
other than hazardous, not captured by traditional household surveys, is
another area requiring particular research attention.

3.9 Child labour for elimination


   Child labour is a narrower concept than children’s employment or work, and refers
    to work that is injurious, negative or undesirable to children as set out in national
    legislation and international labour standards.
   Child labour is still common in Uganda: a total of 2.95 million children aged 5-17
    years, accounting for more than 24 percent of all children in this age range, are in
    child labour measured in accordance with national legislation.


    58. Child labour is a narrower concept than children’s employment or work,
    and refers to work that is injurious, negative or undesirable to children as set
    out in national legislation and international labour standards.44It is this
    smaller group of child labourers that is most relevant for policy purposes.
    Estimates of child labour are presented below following the global guidelines
    for child labour measurement45 and with reference to national child labour
    legislation.
    59. The Employment Act (No.6, 2006), the Occupational Safety and Health
    Act (No. 9, 2006) and the National Child Labour Policy (2006)provide the
    primary legal framework regarding child labour in the country. The
    Government also has a National List of Hazardous Employment Prohibited
    for Children46and guidelines for labour inspectors for identifying incidences
    of hazardous child labour (See Appendix Table A13). Ugandan legislation
    prohibits the employment of children under the age of 12 years in any
    business, undertaking or workplace47 and prohibits the involvement of
    children aged 12-13 years in any employment except for light work carried
    out under the supervision of an adult aged over 18 years that does not affect
    the child’s education.48Light work is defined as work not in excess of fourteen


    44Threemain international conventions – the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), ILO Convention No. 182 (Worst
    Forms) and ILO Convention No. 138 (Minimum Age) – define child labour and provide a framework for efforts against it.
    45Global   guidelines for child labour statistics are set out in Resolution II (2008) of the Eighteenth International Conference of
    Child Labour Statisticians (ICLS). For further details, see: Resolution II, Resolution Concerning Statistics of Child Labour, as
    cited in: International Labour Organization, Report of the Conference, 18th International Conference of Labour Statisticians,
    Geneva, 24 November–5 December 2008. Resolution II. Rpt. ICLS/18/2008/IV/FINAL, International Labour Office, Geneva,
    2009.
    46The list of hazardous forms of labour was compiled following the adoption of the National Child Labour Policy in 2006. The list
    is published and incorporated into the Regulations on Employment of Children2012 which contains a matrix listing hazardous
    occupations and activities which are conditionally hazardous, that is, they are hazardous under certain circumstances: the age
    of the child, the particular circumstances of the child’s activities, and the child’s working conditions. The matrix specifie s
    occupations and activities and the conditions under which they are hazardous.

                  hours per week. Hazardous work, including night work between 19:00 and
                  07:00,49 is prohibited for all persons under the age of 18 years.
                  60. For a complete estimate of child labour in accordance with national
                  legislation, it is therefore necessary to look at (1) all children aged 5-11 years
                  in employment; (2) all 12-13 year-old children working in excess of 14 hours
                  per week and/or in hazardous work (including night work); and (3) all 14-17
                  year-old children working in excess of 43 hours per week and/or in
                  hazardous conditions (including night work).

                  61. Child labour is very common in Uganda. Some of 1.4 million children
                  below the age of 12 years are in employment, 492 thousand children aged
                  12-13 years work in excess of 14 hours and/or are in hazardous work and 1.0
                  million children aged 14-17 years are in hazardous work (Table 11).
                  Summing these three groups yields a total of 2.9 million children aged 5-17
                  years in child labour, accounting for more than 24 percent of all children in
                  this age range. The decompositions by sex and residence reported in Table
                  11 indicate that rural children are at particular risk of child labour in Uganda.
                  By region, incidence of child labour is highest in the Central and the Western
                  regions and lowest in Kampala.

62. It is worth emphasizing that this constitutes a lower-bound estimate of
child labour, as it excludes the so-called “worst forms of child labour other
than hazardous”. These extreme forms of child labour include child
trafficking, child commercial sexual exploitation, child slavery and child
involvement in illicit activities.50In Uganda as in most countries, information
about children involved in worst forms other than hazardous is very scarce.
63. A number of studies have been conducted targeting the worst forms of
child labour other than hazardous using specialized methodologies, but they
fall short of offering a satisfactory quantitative assessment.
64. Child trafficking. A rapid assessment conducted by ILO/IPEC in
200751shows that traffickers target mainly children who have lost their
parents and those living single in the city. Traffickers are mostly relatives,
peers and well-established individuals. Some children are forcibly abducted
even in non-war zone areas, others are tricked and a few move on their own.
In some instances children who move on their own fall into traps of
traffickers when they move to other towns. The trafficked children are
subjected to intolerable inhuman and degrading slavery activities including
killing, smuggling drugs, drug conduit, sexual exploitation. The study also
shows that cross border trafficking appears to be increasing. Cross border
trafficking is mainly driven by factors such as new employment
opportunities, marriage proposals and the search for a better life. While this
rapid assessment provided information on the nature of the problem, there
is little information concerning its magnitude in Uganda.
65. Child commercial sexual exploitation. The Uganda Youth Development
Link (UYDEL) conducted a study on commercial sexual exploitation of
children (CSEC) in Uganda in 2011 based on a sample of 529 children.52 The
UYDEL study was a follow up to the first national study on commercial sexual
exploitation of children done in 2004 by ILO/IPEC and the Ministry of
Gender, Labour and Social Development. The 2004 study had revealed that
over 12,000 children were affected by trafficking and prostitution in Uganda
while the 2011 study estimates that the number of children affected by CSEC
has increased to 18,000 in 2011 with more girls affected than boys.

50 In more specific terms, worst forms other than hazardous refer to Art. 3(a)-(c) of ILO Convention No. 182: (a) all forms of
slavery or practices similar to slavery, such as the sale and trafficking of children, debt bondage and serfdom and forced or
compulsory labour, including forced or compulsory recruitment of children for use in armed conflict; (b) the use, procuring or
offering of a child for prostitution, for the production of pornography or for pornographic performances; and (c) the use,
procuring or offering of a child for illicit activities, in particular for the production and trafficking of drugs as defined in the relevant
international treaties.

According to the 2011 study the age at which children get involved in CSEC is
getting younger, although the majority are between 14 and 17 years old.
66. Lack of responsible parental care, mainly caused by orphanhood, is
identified as one of the principal factors exposing children to CSEC since
approximately 80 percent of the children in CSEC are staying alone. Further,
lack of sustainable opportunities for education also emerged as a key driver
to CSEC since most victims (88 percent) are out of school and most of them
have not gone beyond primary level. Trafficking is indicated as one of the
conduits of CSEC and most female victims of trafficking end up in
prostitution prone environments.

Chapter 4.
   YOUTH EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES



67. This chapter focuses on the labour market situation of young Ugandans
aged 18-30 years.53 It first provides an overview of the activity status of
Ugandan young persons and then looks in more detail at job access, job
quality and at how human capital levels influence both. The timing and
nature of the transition to working life and the relative position of youth vis-
à-vis adult workers are also addressed.
68. Levels of human capital remain low for many Ugandan young people,
compromising their future prospects. A high proportion of urban youth are
not in education, employment or training (NEET) and therefore at risk of
social marginalisation. Unemployment is high in urban areas and in the
capital Kampala, particularly when discouraged workers are taken into
account. Unemployment spells are very long for many youth without jobs,
leading to the risk of skill depreciation and making it more difficult to
ultimately find work. Youth employment is dominated by poor quality
unremunerated work concentrated in the agriculture sector. Almost all
youth jobs are in the informal sector and therefore offer little in the way of
benefits or job security. Educated young people face greater difficulty
securing jobs, but the quality of the jobs they eventually do secure is typically
better. These and other youth labour market challenges are looked at in
detail in the sections below.




53The age group 18-30 years is used for analysing youth employment issues in Uganda. Results for the standard 15-24 years
age group are presented in the Statistical Appendix for international comparative purposes.

 Panel 8.   Youth employment definitions
 Labour force participation: The labour force participation rate is defined as the labour force expressed
 as a percentage of the working age population. The labour force is in turn the sum of the number of
 persons employed and the number of persons unemployed.
 Employment: A person is considered to be in employment if he/she has worked during the week prior
 to the survey for at least one hour for pay (or without pay), profit, in kind, or family business. A person
 is also considered to be in employment if was not working but had a job to go back to.
 Unemployment: A person is considered to be in unemployment if he/she did not work during the week
 prior to the survey but is actively seeking work and is available for work.
 Unemployment “relaxed definition”: Includes the persons who do not have a job and are available for
 work. It 'relaxes' the actively searching for work criteria that is required for the strict definition of
 unemployment. Relaxed unemployment is therefore defined as the sum of persons who did not engage
 in any work or economic activity and were available for work but did not actively seek it.
 Underemployment: The underemployed are defined as persons working less than 40 hours a week but
 wanting and available to work longer hours. The underemployment rate is the underemployed
 expressed as a percentage of the total employed population.
 Inactive: The inactive population is the population that is not in the labour force. The inactivity rate and
 labour force participation rate sum to 100.
 NEET: Refers to youth who are not in education, employment or training. It is a measure that therefore
 reflects both youth who are inactive and out of education as well as youth who are unemployed.




4.1 Youth activity status


    Labour force participation is very high among Ugandan youth and education
     participation is relatively low.
    Youth activity status in Uganda varies considerably by sex, residence, region and
     migrant status.



     69. Labour force participation is very high among Ugandan youth and
     education participation is relatively low. Figure 26 reports the overall
     decomposition of the youth population by activity status. More than four of
     every five 18-30 year-olds (82 percent) are economically active. Among this
     group, most (68 percent of all youth) are in employment exclusively; only a
     relatively small proportion continues their education while working (11
     percent) and an even smaller share (three percent) is unemployed. Those in
     education exclusively constitute the largest share of young persons outside
     the labour force (11 percent of all youth), although there is also a non-
     negligible share both outside the labour and outside education (six percent).

         70. Youth activity status has an important gender dimension. Female youth
         are less likely to be in the labour force and more likely to be inactive and out
         of school. At the same time, female who are in the labour force are at
         greater risk of unemployment. (Table 12). Gender differences in terms of
         education participation are also quite pronounced: 29 percent of male youth
         are still in education against 17 percent of female counterparts.
         71. Labour market participation is consistently higher for rural youth (84
         percent versus 71 percent), while urban youth are much more likely to be
         inactive and out of education (12 percent versus six percent). There are also
         large differences between urban and rural youth in terms of unemployment
         (lower in rural areas) and job quality (better in urban areas), as discussed in
         subsequent sections of this chapter. In terms of being able to continue with
         their education, however, the difference between urban and rural youths is
         small: 24 percent of urban youth are still in education against 22 percent of
         their rural peers.

                          72. Internal migrant youth appear to face particular labour market challenges.
                          A much lower share of internal migrant youth are in education (12 percent
                          versus 25 percent) while a higher share are inactive and out of education (10
                          percent versus seven percent). Among those in the labour force, a higher
                          share of migrant youth are unemployed, It is important to note, however,
                          that econometric evidence indicates that migration does not have a
                          significant influence on whether youth are in employment (rather than
                          unemployed or inactive and out of education) when other individual and
                          household characteristics are controlled for (Table 14).
                          73. National estimates also mask differences in the activity status of young
                          persons across regions. The labour market participation rate ranges from 73
                          percent in Kampala to 85 percent in the Western region, and the share of
                          youth inactive and out of education from 12 percent in Kampala to five
                          percent in the Western region. Education participation also varies
                          considerably, from a high of 28 percent in the Eastern region to a low of 20
                          percent in Kampala and in the Central and Northern regions. The
                          unemployment rate and the relaxed unemployment rate are much higher in
                          the capital city of Kampala (16 percent and 24 percent, respectively) than in
                          the rest of the country.

                                  74. Aggregate labour market indicators for youth over the last six years
                                  suggest that young people are staying in education longer before joining the
                                  labour force. A comparison of the results of the Uganda National Household
                                  Survey (UNHS), 2005/2006 and Uganda Labour Force and Child Activities
                                  Survey (NLF&CAS) 2011/2012 shows that education participation has risen
                                  by eight percentage points and labour participation has fallen by four
                                  percentage points (Figure 27), indicating that Ugandan young persons are
                                  remaining in school longer and joining the labour force later. The youth
                                  unemployment rate, on the other hand, has not changed over the period.

4.2 Determinants of youth employment


   Age, sex, place of residence, marital status, vocational training, labour market
    demand and household composition, inter alia, appear relevant in determining
    whether or not youth are employed.



    75. A number of factors appear to influence whether youth enter employment
    upon leaving education. A regression model was estimated to assess the link
    between the probability of youth employment and a set of individual and
    household characteristics. Key results, reported in Table 14, are summarised
    below.
          Youth age, sex and marital status. The probability of employment
           rises with age. Female youth have a lower probability of employment,
           as they tend to specialize on domestic duties Married youth are more
           likely overall to be employed, but the opposite pattern prevails for
           married female youth.
          Internal migration. Migrant status does not have a significant impact
           on the likelihood of employment when other individual and
           household characteristics are controlled for.
          Education level. Higher education does not increase the probability of
           employment. Indeed, youths with primary education are the only
           ones whose likelihood of being employed is significantly higher than
           that of non- educated youths.
          Vocational training. Youths who have learned a trade or technical skill
           at a vocational school/course (or from a friend or family member or
           from an NGO or community organization) are more likely to be
           employed than those who have not.
          Household composition. The likelihood of youth employment is also
           influenced by the number and ages of siblings within the household.
           Young persons with more 6-13 year-old siblings are more likely to
           work. These results suggest that young persons play an important
           role in helping maintain dependent children within their households.
          Local labour demand. Local labour demand54 has a strong positive
           impact on the chances of youth securing employment, underscoring
           that youth employment is driven in important part by the state of the

                         differences in the rural and urban labour markets for youth.

           56
              The Uganda Labour Force and Child Activities (NLF&CAS) 2011/2012 does not collect information on household expenditure
           or household income to be used as a measure of welfare. In the cases of other surveys, such as the Demographic and Health
           Surveys, which also lack direct welfare information, a common solution has been to generate a wealth index using a principal
           components approach, following Filmer and Pritchett (2001). The approach involves constructing an index based as the first
           principal component of a vector of assets, including durables goods, housing characteristics, and access to utilities. The
           principal components approach involves defining the wealth index in terms of the first principal component of the variables used.
           The Wealth Index was constructed taking into consideration two sets of possible variables; housing characteristics, and service
           infrastructure.

  4.3 Youth access to jobs


              Unemployment is an important concern in urban areas, particularly when
               unemployment is defined to include discouraged workers
              A high proportion of urban youth are also not in education, employment or
               training (NEET) and therefore at risk of social marginalisation.
              Rates of both unemployment and NEET are especially high for urban female youth.


               This section reports descriptive evidence of youth labour market challenges
               as reflected by lack of access to jobs. Two main groups of young people are
               looked at in this context: youth not in education and not in the labour force;
               and unemployed youth. Taken together, these groups constitute the “NEET”
               youth population.57


               Inactive and out of education
               76. Seven percent of all youths are inactive and out of education. Inactivity is
               particularly high for female youth in urban areas: the share of urban female
               youth that are inactive and not in education is almost four times that of
               female youth in rural areas and six times that of male youth in rural areas.

         77. This difference is primarily a product of more female youth being out of
         education: rates of education participation are almost 12 percentage points
         lower for female youth aged 18-30 years than male youth in the same age
         range. Household work or other family motives are cited by 43 percent of
         female youth who are neither in the labour force nor in education but by
         only nine percent of their male peers (Figure 29).

         Unemployment
         78. About four percent of young people in the labour force are without jobs.
         But this low overall unemployment rate disguises important differences by
         sex and residence (Figure 30). Unemployment rates are much higher in
         urban areas than in rural areas – almost 12 percent versus two percent. In

              79. Unemployment spells are very long for many youth without jobs. As shown
              in Figure 31, almost half (44 percent) of unemployed youth have been
              without a job for at least one year and 20 percent have been without work
              for at least three years. Thirteen percent of young persons have been in
              unemployment for at least five years. The length of unemployment spells is
              important to determining the likely harm caused by unemployment. High
              outflows and short spell durations may merely reflect active search on the

               unemployment spells are likely to constitute a more serious policy concern.

               81. One of every 10 Ugandan young persons is not engaged in education,
               employment or training. The group of NEET youth consists of both youths
               who are unemployed and youths who are not in education or the labour
               force, and therefore NEET is a more comprehensive measure for assessing
               youth labour market difficulties. The share falling into the NEET category is
               much higher among female compared to male youth, due both to their
               higher unemployment and higher inactivity rates. NEET status is particularly
               pronounced for urban female youth, of whom more than one-quarter (27
               percent) fall into the NEET category. NEET status is also much more common
               in the capital Kampala compared to other regions. Almost 22 percent of all
               youth in Kampala fall into the NEET category compared to only 12 percent of
               youth in the next-highest (Central) district.

  4.4 Youth job quality


              A variety of measures suggest that the quality of jobs held by Ugandan young
               people is generally low.
              Youth employment is dominated by informal, unremunerated work concentrated
               in the agriculture sector.

82. Labour force participation, unemployment and the other aggregate
labour market indicators reported above provide only a very partial picture
of the employment challenges facing young persons in Uganda. This is
because in countries such as Uganda where poverty is widespread, most
youth simply cannot afford to remain without work altogether and must
accept jobs regardless of the conditions and pay associated with them. In
this context, the key policy concern is not only whether young people are
working but rather the quality of the jobs they hold, and the extent to which
these jobs offer a path for advancement and route out of poverty. Job
quality, however, is difficult to define and there is no single accepted
indicator of job quality. In this section, data for a range of proxy indicators of
job quality are reported in order to assess the quality of jobs secured by
young Ugandans. These indicators include underemployment, sector and
status in employment, non-farm employment and employment formality.


Underemployment
83. Youth    underemployment, sometimes referred to as “hidden
unemployment”, effects 12 percent of employed youth in Uganda. A person is
considered in a situation of under-employment if he or she works less than
40 hours a week and would like to work more hours than he or she actually
does.59The Northern region, one of the least-urbanised regions, has the
highest underemployment rate for employed youths (19 percent). The
capital Kampala has the lowest rate of youth underemployment (six percent)
but the highest rate of youth unemployment (16 percent). This suggests that
while young people in the capital have greatest difficulty in securing jobs,
these jobs are most likely to be full-time in nature. The opposite holds true in
rural areas where unemployment is much lower, but where youths are more
likely to be working fewer hours than they would like to, with presumably a
negative impact on their earnings and living standards. Underemployment is
seven points higher in rural areas than in urban areas (Figure 34).




59Time-related   underemployment, as the only component of underemployment to date that has been agreed on and properly
defined within the international community of labour statisticians, isthe best available proxy of the underutilized labour force. The
time-related-underemployed as share of total employment is measured as those who work less than 40 hours per week and
who want and are available to work more hours. The underemployment rate is defined here as the number of employed persons
in situations of underemployment expressed as a percentage of total persons in employment.

               Sector and status of employment
               84. Youth employment is dominated by unremunerated work concentrated in
               the agriculture sector. Sixty-eight percent of youth workers are found in the
               agriculture sector, while the remainder are divided among the service sector
               (14 percent), commerce (11 percent) and manufacturing (4 percent) (Figure
               35). The large majority (62 percent) of employed youth are in self-
               employment. The rest are found in unremunerated employment as unpaid
               family workers (16 percent) and paid employment (21 percent). Female
               youth are less likely to enjoy remunerated jobs and are more likely to be
               found in low-productivity subsistence agriculture (Table 15 and Table 16).

               85. The composition of youth employment differs significantly by residence.
               A larger share of employed rural youth is unsurprisingly in the agriculture
               sector, while the commerce and services sectors absorb relatively more
               urban youth. A relatively larger share of rural youth are in self-employment
               (65 percent) and in unremunerated family employment (18 percent), while a
               relatively larger share of urban youth work as paid employees (45 percent).

               Non-farm enterprise employment
               86. Only about one in five rural youth work off the farm. Employment in non-
               farm enterprises is least common among rural youth workers at the lower
               end of the 18-30 years age spectrum (17 percent) and among female rural
               youth workers (17 percent)(Figure 36). The Central region stands out as
               having the highest levels of youth non-farm enterprise employment (32
               percent). A wide body of evidence indicates that the productivity and
               profitability in non-farm enterprises is generally better than in the farm
               sector, as are average wages and working conditions.

                         more likely to be in subsistence agriculture than their male counterparts.
                         Subsistence agriculture absorbs up to 32 percent of youth employment in

                         60A strict definition of subsistence agriculture is used, which excludes households producing mainly for household consumption
                         but partly for sale/barter, as the data does not provide information on the percentage of the household agricultural production
                         which is marketed. For this reason the figures on subsistence agriculture presented in this report are likely to be
                         underestimated.

           88. Almost all employed youth are in informal employment . Ninety-eight
           percent of all youth jobs are informal in nature (Figure 38) and informality is
           remarkably high across all sub-categories of youth. In rural areas informality
           covers 99 percent of youth employment while in urban areas it covers 94
           percent. Kampala, the capital city, has the lowest share of employed youths
           in the informal sector (94 percent) while informality stands at above 98
           percent in other regions. The formality of employment is perhaps the best
           proxy for job quality, associated with more job stability, higher income and
           access to job benefits. The high rate of informality therefore highlights the
           fact that improving the quality of employment outcomes for youth remains a
           major challenge in Uganda.

4.5 Transitions to working life


          Transitions to working life are frequently lengthy, especially for youths in urban
           areas.




           61Informality is defined as including unpaid family workers, employees with no social security, paid leave or paid sick leave in
           case of illness or injury, and self employed whose business is not registered for income tax and is not organized in the form of
           an incorporated enterprise.




                                                             UGANDA INTER-AGENCY COUNTRY REPORT |Youth employment outcomes                                                     69
              89. The discussion in this chapter has thus far focused on key outcome
              indicators of the transition to working life. In this section, attention turns to
              the some of the key characteristics of the transition process itself, making
              use of information from the ILO School-to-Work Transition Survey (STWT)62
              programme.
              90. Table 17 reports the transition status of young persons in the 15-29 years
              age range in Uganda and in the other Sub-Saharan Africa countries where
              the ILO School-to-Work Transition surveys have been implemented.
              Specifically, the table reports the shares of persons in the 15-29 years age
              range no longer in education who have (a) found a first job in the labour
              market, (b) who are in the process of transiting to a first job and (c) who
              have not entered the labour market but who have instead spent time
              performing chores within their own homes. The table also reports the
              remaining young persons in this age range who are outside the transition
              process, namely those (d) who are in still in school and therefore have not
              begun the transition and those (e) who have never been to school and
              therefore never technically transition from school to work.

              91. Forty-eight percent of Ugandan youth aged 15-29 years have already
              transited to a first job, highest of the seven Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)
              countries where data are available. An additional two percent of Ugandan
              youth are still in the process of transiting to a first job, and five percent of

              62The  ILO SWTSs provide a wealth of information on current and retrospective information on schooling and training, work,
              joblessness and job search experiences of youth aged 15-29. One unique feature of these data is that, in addition to recording
              spells out of and into employment, these data measure the quality of jobs, through both objective characteristics (i.e. type of
              contract, benefits, pay) and individuals’ subjective evaluations (i.e. satisfaction and desire to change jobs).

                Ugandan youth (39 percent) are also still in education and therefore by
                definition have not yet begun the transition from school to their first (post
                education) job. Finally, four percent of Ugandan youth in the 15-29 years age
                range have never been in education, the second-lowest share of the SSA
                included in the table.
                92. The category of young persons that has already left school and transited
                to a first job in the labour market can tell us the most about the transition
                process. This is the group reporting having had at least one job at some point
                in time since leaving education (regardless of whether they currently hold a
                job). In Uganda, as reported above, 48 percent of youth have transited to
                the first job after leaving school.
                93. How long does it take young persons to find an initial job after leaving
                school? An important distinction in addressing this question is between
                those transiting directly from school to a first job and those not finding a job
                immediately. In Uganda, two-thirds of youth that have transited to a first job
                found that first job immediately, with no intervening period of
                unemployment, inactivity or involvement in household chores. As reported
                in Figure 39, this share is third-highest of the seven SSA countries where data
                are available. This high share of direct transiters should not, however, be
                interpreted as positive per se, as it is likely driven in important part by
                poverty and by the consequent inability of many young persons to “afford” a
                period of unemployment or inactivity.

          4.6 Human capital and youth employment outcomes


              Many Ugandan young people have had little opportunity to acquire human capital:
               69 percent have primary education or less.
              More educated young people face greater initial difficulty securing jobs, but the
               quality of the jobs they eventually do secure is better.



               95. The most obvious connection between child labour and poor youth
               labour market outcomes is through compromised education. This section
               looks at the role of education in determining youth labour market
               outcomes.63
               96. Levels of human capital remain low for many Ugandan young people,
               compromising their future prospects. Almost 13 percent of young people not
               currently in education have no schooling and 56 percent have primary

               63A lack of longitudinal data and/or of retrospective questions on involvement in work as children prevents exploring the link
               between youth employment outcomes and child labour involvement directly.

                   education or less. Female youth are particularly disadvantaged in this regard
                   – the share of female youth with no education is eight percent higher than
                   the share of male youth. Low human capital is especially pronounced in rural
                   areas, where 15 percent of youth not currently in education have no
                   schooling and 62 percent have primary education or less (Figure 41). A
                   number of regions also lag behind national averages in this regard. The
                   Northern region, for example, registers a very high percentage of youth with
                   no education (24 percent). What is the impact of low human capital on youth
                   employment outcomes? The descriptive evidence presented below suggests
                   that more educated young people may face greater initial difficulty securing
                   jobs, but that the quality of the jobs they eventually do secure is better.

                   97. Unemployment is highest among youth with the most education. Youth
                   unemployment in urban areas is nonetheless also a concern for youth with
                   lower levels of education, particularly when unemployment is defined to
                   include discouraged workers(Figure 42b).The higher rate of unemployment
                   among most-educated youth is partially the product of the fact that this
                   group by definition began its transition to work at a later age, and therefore
                   has had a shorter length of exposure to the labour market and less time to
                   secure employment. To the extent that youth education is correlated with
                   household income, most-educated youth may also be more able to afford
                   spells of unemployment. But the positive link between unemployment and
                   education levels may also be a reflection of mismatches between the skills
                   produced by the education system and those needed in the labour market,
                   and of the need for better mechanisms for bringing together young skilled
                   job seekers and employers.

Notes: (a) Relaxed unemployment considers both unemployed workers and all individuals who are not working, searching job or/and would accept a job if offered. The
relaxed unemployment rate is the sum of unemployed workers and not working individuals available to work expressed as a percentage of the expanded active
population. The expanded active population, in turn, comprises not working individuals available to work and the active population.

                       98. Level of education is clearly linked with job quality. Figure 43 shows that
                       the likelihood of paid work and of work in the tertiary services sector both
                       rise consistently with more education. Similarly, Table 18 indicates that more
                       educated youth are more likely to enjoy formal employment.

                              99. Higher education is associated with a very large earnings premium. Figure
                              44 shows that successive levels of educational attainment are associated
                              with higher earnings. The moves from primary to secondary and from
                              completed secondary to tertiary education are associated with especially
                              large jumps in earnings.

                                   100. Econometric evidence confirms the importance of education as a
                                   determinant of earnings.64Estimation results65, reported in Table 19, indicate
                                   that, youth with primary education can expect earnings 23 percent higher
                                   than their peers with no education while youth with secondary or higher
                                   education can expect 84 percent higher earnings compared to their
                                   uneducated peers. It is interesting to note that vocational education, on the
                                   other hand, is not associated with an earnings premium. Table 19 also shows
                                   that earnings rise with age and that married youth enjoy higher earnings.
                                   The gender disparities in earnings are very large, even controlling for
                                   education levels and other factors – male youth can expect 26 percent
                                   higher earnings than female youths. Finally, earnings depend on the area of
                                   residence; employment in urban areas is associated with significantly higher
                                   earnings relative to earnings in rural areas.

                    101. In summary, the balance of evidence points to substantial returns to
                    education in the Ugandan labour market. While high unemployment levels
                    indicate that educated young people have greater initial difficulty in securing
                    jobs, the jobs that they do eventually secure are likely to be of better quality
                    and, in the case of those with higher education, are significantly better paid.
                    This in turn has important implications in terms of trade-offs between child
                    labour and education earlier in the lifecycle. Theory and evidence suggests
                    that positive returns to education can have an important feedback effect on
                    parents’ decisions to invest in children’s education.66 In situations where
                    there are opportunities for better paid jobs for educated young persons,
                    parents have greater incentive to invest in their children’s schooling, and to
                    not send their children to work prematurely.

           4.7 Relative position of youth in the labour market


                  Young persons appear to fare worse than their adult counterparts in terms of both
                   job access and job quality



                   102. Comparing the labour market status and job characteristics of young
                   persons and adults provides an indication of the extent to which young
                   workers are disadvantaged in relation to their adult counterparts in securing
                   quality jobs.
                   103. The youth unemployment rate is higher than the adult rate, although
                   unemployment is relatively low for both groups. Four percent of active youth
                   are unemployed against only one percent of adults. Female active youths
                   appear even more disadvantaged in terms of unemployment rate with
                   respect to adult females (4.3 percent against 1.2 percent), especially in
                   urban areas (16.1 percent against 5.2 percent).The same pattern holds when
                   discouraged workers are included in the calculation of unemployment (not
                   shown).These figures suggest the existence of special barriers to youth
                   employment in Uganda, especially for female youths in urban areas, which
                   need to be addressed by policy makers.

                   104. The jobs held by young workers appear to be of poorer quality. Employed
                   youth are slightly more likely than their adult peers to be underemployed (12
                   versus 10 percent) and much more likely to work in low-productivity
                   unremunerated family work (16 percent versus six percent) (Appendix Figure

                                          A13). Earnings levels for young workers in paid employment are considerably
                                          lower than for their adult counterparts (UGX 194 versus UGX 300) (Figure
                                          46). Both youth and adult workers are heavily concentrated in the informal
                                          sector (98 percent and 97 percent, respectively).

           NATIONAL RESPONSES TO CHILD LABOUR AND
           YOUTH EMPLOYMENT CONCERNS



5.1 Responses to child labour



    Legal framework for responding to child labour
    105. The Government of Uganda has put in place a legal framework for
    protection of children against child labour including the worst forms of child
    labour. Uganda has ratified important international conventions67and is also
    party to international commitments regarding orphans and vulnerable
    children.68To fulfil the commitments of ILO Convention 182 on the
    prohibition of the worst forms of child labour, the Government defined the
    types of hazardous work for children. The government has developed
    relevant national laws for protection of the rights of children, including child
    labour. Principal among these are the following:
         The National Constitution: The 1995 Constitution of the Republic of
          Uganda provides the overarching legislative framework for protection of
          the rights of children in Uganda. Article 34 (4) of the Constitution
          provides for the protection of children against social and economic
          exploitation. It further prohibits the employment of children in work that
          is likely to be hazardous or interfere with their education or is harmful to
          their health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral, and /or social
          development.
         Employment Act No. 6 of 2006: The Employment Act of 2006 prohibits
          employment of children in any work, which is dangerous or injurious to
          the child’s health. Sec.32 (1) of the Act states that, “a child under the age
          of twelve shall not be employed in any business, undertaking or work
          place”. Clause 2 of the same section states that, “a child under age of
          fourteen years shall not be employed in any business, undertaking or

    67Including the Minimum Age of Employment, 1973, (No. 138); the Worst forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999, (No. 182);
    The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) 1989; The Optional Protocol to the CRC on Combating the
    use of Children in Armed Conflict; The Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Pornography, and Child Prostitution; and
    The African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of Children.
    68Theseinclude declaration of the commitment on HIV/AIDS, UNGASS on HIV/AIDS 2001, a world fit for children declaration
    2001 and the Millennium Declaration that was launched at the UN Summit in September 2000.

        workplace, except for light work carried out under supervision of an adult
        aged over eighteen years, and which does not affect the child’s
        education”. Furthermore, Sec.32 (4) prohibits the employment of a child
        in any employment or work that is injurious to his or her health,
        dangerous or hazardous or otherwise unsuitable. Sec.32 (5) prohibits the
        employment of children at night (7.00 pm to 7.00 am).
     The Children’s Act Cap 59: The Children’s Act Cap 59 adopts the principles
      of the international and regional instruments on the rights of the child
      that Uganda has ratified. Regarding the employment of children, Section
      109 of the Act states that no child shall be employed or engaged in any
      activity that may be harmful to his or her health, education, mental,
      physical and/or moral development.
  106. Other laws that have a bearing on prevention of child labour include the
  Mining Act (2005) that protects children from working in mines, the
  Trafficking in Persons Act (2009)69 and the Penal Code Act 120 (amended
  2007).70

  National policy framework for child labour
  107. The   National Development Plan (2010/2011-2014/15) highlights
  strategies aimed at promoting access to education and skills development
  and consequently addressing child labour. The NDP prioritizes 8 thematic
  areas for national transformation and development: (a) increasing household
  incomes and promoting equity, (b) enhancing the availability and quality of
  gainful employment, (c) improving stock and quality of economic
  infrastructure, (d) increasing access to quality social services, (e) promoting
  science, technology, innovation and ICT to enhance competitiveness, (f)
  enhancing human capital development, (g) strengthening good governance,
  defence and security, and (h) promoting sustainable population and use of
  the environment and natural resources (NPA 2010).71
  108. Some of the key policies and programmes that have been put in place to
  directly address child labour include the National Child Labour Policy, the
  National Action Plan for Elimination of Worst Forms of Child Labour and the
  Orphans and Other Vulnerable Children’s (OVC) Policies discussed below.

  69The Trafficking in Persons Act, 2009, provides for the protection of both children and adults from trafficking which leads to
  various forms of exploitation and other insidious human rights abuses

  as a slave or to unlawfully compel another to labour against his free will. The Penal Code Act 120 (amended 2007) criminalizes
  abduction, child trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation of children.

  109. The National Child Labour Policy (2006): The objective of the Child
  Labour Policy is to integrate child labour concerns into national, district and
  community development programs, establish legal, legislative and
  institutional frameworks for combating the Worst Forms of Child Labour
  (WFCL), and to stimulate collective and concerted mobilization against child
  labour at all levels. To operationalize the policy, with the support of ILO/IPEC,
  a National Action Plan (NAP) for the Elimination of Worst Forms of Child
  Labour was developed and launched in August 2012 (see below). The
  Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development is charged with the
  implementation of the National Child Labour Policy in collaboration with line
  Ministries particularly Ministry of Education and Sports, Ministry of Local
  Government, the workers and employers organization and the civil society
  (MGLSD 2006)72.
  110. The National Action Plan for the Elimination of Child Labour (2012/13-
  2016/17): Developed in 2012 by the Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social
  Development, with support from ILO/IPEC and input from national
  stakeholders,73the National Action Plan (NAP) for Elimination of the Worst
  Forms of Child Labour aims at operationalizing the National Child Labour
  Policy (2006). The overall goal of the NAP is to eliminate worst forms of child
  labour while at the same time laying a firm foundation for eradication of all
  other forms of work that affect the overall wellbeing and development of
  children. The NAP prioritizes 5 key strategies for preventing and addressing
  child labour:
         access to education and vocational training;
         strengthening household livelihoods through alternative forms of
          incomes for families affected by the worst forms of child labor;
         advocacy and awareness raising;
         strengthening the capacity of relevant institutions, reviewing the legal
          framework as well as improving coordination and tri-partism to enable
          effective delivery of programmes for elimination of child labour,
          strategies for addressing child labour; and
         withdrawing rehabilitating, and integrating children in the worst forms of
          child labour and instituting programmes for sustainable livelihoods.

  73The  development of the NAP was a participatory and consultative process that sought views from officials from Ministry of
  Gender, Labour and Social Development (MGLSD) in collaboration with key government line ministries including Ministry of
  Education and Sports (MoES), Ministry of Local Government (MoLG) and Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries
  (MAAIF), employers and workers organizations including FUE, NOTU, COFTU UNATU. Others were UNICEF, the civil society,
  district officials and community members.

  111. The NAP represents a robust policy framework for the operationalization
  of the Child Labour Policy (2006), providing a framework for actions by
  different stakeholders and spelling out the roles and responsibilities for each.
  The total budget for the NAP is UGX510.1 billion for five years. However,
  limited funding from the government and lack of a clear resource
  mobilization strategy undermines its effective implementation.
  112. The Orphans and Other Vulnerable Children’s (OVC) Policy: With the
  overarching goal of attaining “full development and realization of rights of
  orphans and other vulnerable children”, the main thrust of the OVC policy is
  to reduce vulnerability of OVC, ensuring social inclusion of marginalized
  groups, and ensuring participation of OVC and their families. The OVC policy
  mentions working children as one vulnerable category and highlights
  education and child protection as some of the key priority policy strategies.
  113. National Social Sector Programme Plan for intervention (NSPPI-2) for
  Orphans and other Vulnerable Children: NSPPI-2 is designed to target
  particularly the critically and moderately vulnerable children who constitute
  51 percent of the child population in Uganda. It has a budget of UGX 3.3
  billion for five years and is mainly funded by USAID. Worst forms of child
  labour (WFCL) and hazardous work are key categories of vulnerable children
  targeted by the NSPPI-2. The key objectives and core programme areas of
  NSPPI-2 are all relevant to efforts against child labour:
      strengthening the capacity of families, caregivers and other service
       providers to protect and care for orphans and other vulnerable children;
      expanding access to essential services for orphans and other vulnerable
       children, their caregivers and families/households (including education,
       food and nutrition security, health, water, sanitation, and shelter,
       psychosocial support and basic care);
      increasing access to protection and legal services for orphans and other
       vulnerable children, their caregivers and families/households; and
      strengthening the institutional, policy, legal and other mechanisms that
       provide supportive environment for a coordinated OVC response.74

  Improving school access and quality
  114. Education Sector Strategic Plan 2004/05-2014/2015 (ESSP): The ESSP is
  designed to contribute to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and

  Development, Kampala.

  Education for All (EFA) goals.75 The ESSP thus aims to support programs
  targeted to disadvantaged children and youth, lower costs of education by
  allocating capitation grants to schools through taking into account the
  differences among schools in the populations they serve, lower social-
  cultural barriers to girls' attendance, expand and improve primary school
  facilities and increase equitable participation in a coherent and flexible post-
  primary system. Under the ESSP, the MoES also plans to reconfigure post
  primary education sector to align it with the labour market requirements.
  Efforts have also been made by the government to increase budgetary
  allocation to the education sector. The Ministry of Finance, Planning and
  Economic Development anticipated that the budget for education will
  increase by 76 percent between 2003/04 and 2013/14. The share of
  education in the total government expenditure is expected to increase from
  19 percent to 21 percent between 2003/04 and 2013/14
  115. The National Integrated Early Childhood Development Policy (IECD): The
  IECD policy aims at harmonizing the existing ECD initiatives for holistic
  service provision, set standards and guidelines for equitable access to quality
  and relevant ECD services, and strengthen institutional capacity of ECD
  Systems for quality and sustainable ECD services (MGLSD 2012).76The policy
  will promote Early Childhood Education by establishing an Early Childhood
  Development (ECD) centre at every primary school to allow for easy access
  of ECD Services by all children and caregivers but also easy transition to
  primary level education. Although the development of the IECD policy is a
  positive step towards creating strong foundations for children, there is need
  to develop a National Action Plan that will provide a framework for
  mobilizing resources for the implementation of the policy.
  116. Universal Primary Education (UPE) and Universal Secondary Education
  (USE) policies: The introduction of Universal Primary Education (UPE) in 1997
  resulted in a surge of enrolments in primary school from 3.1 million in 1996
  to 7.4 million in 2008 (UBOS 200977). Uganda was one of the first countries in
  Sub-Saharan Africa to introduce Universal Secondary Education (USE) policy
  in 2007. Although enrolment has increased dramatically since 2008, primary
  school completion rates remain relatively low at 47 percent. With the low

  Expanding second chance learning opportunities
  117. Second chance programmes provide opportunities for children who are
  engaged in child labour to be reintegrated into school and eventually transit
  to formal schooling. There have been a number of second chance
  programmes implemented in Uganda, although not all remain active and
  those that are still operational cover only a minority of those in need.
         Child Centered Alternative Non-formal Community-based Education
          (CHANCE): Since 1999, Save the Children in partnership with the district
          local governments of Central Region79 and other stakeholders has
          implemented the CHANCE programme targeting children in hard to reach
          communities without any formal schools or basic social services. As of
          October 2012, over 5,000 children were accessing quality basic and early
          childhood education, 94 NFE teachers had been trained in professional
          teaching methodologies, certified and recruited by government and 41
          CHANCE centers had been coded by government and included on the list
          of schools to receive grants and support from governments.

          between Save the Children, UNICEF and the Ministry of Education and
          Sports (MoES),80was introduced in 1998 to bridge the gap between
          formal public schools and the semi-nomadic pastoral lifestyle of
          Karamojong children. ABEK learning centers are managed by a learning
          center committee which identifies the school location and recruits and
          manages local teachers/facilitators.81 An evaluation conducted by Save
          the Children in 2011, however, indicated that levels of literacy and
          numeracy were low in the ABEK centers, that the learning environments
          were not always safe and child-friendly, that participation was limited
          primarily to girls while boys continued to engage in herding, and that
          transition into primary schools could not be ascertained because of the
          limited record keeping. Although the programme has been embraced

        uncertain since it is mainly dependent on support from Save the
        Children.

  Expanding social protection and basic services
  118. Expanding Social Protection Programme (ESP). The government has
  prioritized social protection as a key strategy for poverty reduction. The
  Expanding Social Protection Programme (ESP) by the Ministry of Gender,
  Labour and Social Development is aimed at “embedding a national social
  protection system that benefits the poorest as a core element of Uganda’s
  national policy, planning and budgeting processes”. The programme is
  responsible for developing and implementing a national social protection
  framework for Uganda, including strengthening the capacity of the
  government to deliver it.
  119. Social Assistance Grants for Empowerment (SAGE). Initiated in 2011, the
  Social Assistance Grants for Empowerment (SAGE) aimed at addressing risk,
  vulnerability and shocks that affect vulnerable households. SAGE is
  implemented by the Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development as
  part of the Expanding Social Protection Programme and is overseen by a
  multi-institutional Steering committee.82SAGE comprises two grants: Senior
  Citizens Grants (SCGs) and the Vulnerable Family Grants (VFGs). During its
  initial five years, the programme will be supported by international partners,
  in particular DFID, Irish Aid and UNICEF with a total funding of £41 million
  and by a contribution of Uganda Shillings 31 billion from the Government of
  Uganda (ESP 201283). The SAGE programme aims to reach 600,000 people in
  95,000 households at pilot (2011–2015). This represents approximately 15
  percent of households in the pilot districts.84
  120. The Senior Citizens Grants target older persons aged 65 years and above
  (60 years in the case of Karamoja region). The Vulnerable Family Grants are
  household grants targeted to households with extreme labour capacity
  deficiencies and high dependency. Thus, VFGs are intended to reach
  households containing a high proportion of older people, children and
  people with disabilities.85Orphans and their caregivers are also prioritized by

  82The Steering Committee comprises the ministries of Finance, Local Government, Health, Education, the Office of the Prime
  Minister, the National Planning Authority and development partners.

  this Programme. Both schemes are being piloted in 14 districts in the
  country. Beneficiaries of both the SCGs and VFGs receive a monthly grant of
  UGX 23,000 (about US$8) per month linked to inflation. This amount
  represents about 20 per cent of the monthly household consumption of the
  poorest of Uganda’s population..
  121. The National Policy on HIV/AIDS and the World of Work: This policy
  recognizes that the HIV/AIDS epidemic affects the most productive segment
  of the labour force in Uganda and aims at providing a framework for
  prevention of further spread of HIV/AIDS and mitigation of the social
  economic impact of the epidemic within the world of work. The policy also
  notes that children who have been forced out of school due to HIV/AIDS-
  related factors are often forced to join the labour market, with the dual
  consequence of engaging in exploitative labour and increasing the pool of
  unskilled workers.


  Efforts of social partners in addressing child labour
  122. A range of development partners including international development
  agencies, international NGOs and civil society are at the forefront of
  implementing and testing a range of interventions and approaches for
  addressing child labour. Below some of the good practice models
  implemented by different agencies that provide valuable lessons for scaling
  up interventions for preventing child labour are illustrated.
  123. EduTrac: Mobile technology for quality education outcomes in Uganda.
  EduTrac is an innovative mobile phone-based data collection system being
  piloted by UNICEF Uganda in partnership with the Ministry of Education and
  Sports, (MoES), since May 2011 to complement and collect data more
  frequently at primary school level than currently done with the paper-based
  annual school census. The MoES is using EduTrac to monitor priority
  indicators that need to be collected on a more frequent basis than the
  annual school census allows. The system is currently implemented in 21
  districts and covers all primary schools in each (UNICEF n.d86).
  124. International Stop Child Labour Campaign: The Netherlands Stop Child
  Labour Campaign (SCL) is supporting three NGOs87in implementing a project
  entitled “Omar’s Dream: The beginning of the end of child labour”. The total
  funding for the Omar’s Dream is Euros 388,735 over an 18-month period.
  The project calls for the creation of CLFZs which are “Geographical areas

    where all children are systematically withdrawn from work and
    (re)integrated into formal, full-time schools”.
    125. Stopping Child Labour through Education: Implemented by the Ministry
    of Education and Sports and a group of NGOs,88 the “Stopping Child Labour
    through Education” project aimed at ensuring that attention to child labour
    is better reflected in national education sector plans and programmes. It also
    supported strengthening skills training programmes for vulnerable youth and
    measures to implement key actions called for in the Roadmap emerging
    from The Hague 2010 Global Conference on Child Labour. The project
    strengthened the capacity of partners to implement direct actions that assist
    children, undertook research and knowledge generation, and advocated for
    policies that support the elimination of child labour and promote access of
    children to school. The three-year project ran from September 2010 to
    August 2013 and was financed by a grant of USD 633,000 from ILO-IPEC.

    grant of US$1,104,000 from the Eliminating Child Labour in Tobacco Growing
    (ECLT) Foundation, is aimed at eliminating child labour in two tobacco
    growing sub counties in Hoima district. Implemented by the NGO
    UWESO,89the project is developing community-based initiatives for
    strengthening the livelihoods of vulnerable families, improving access to
    quality education, and raising awareness about the problems associated with
    child labour in tobacco growing.


5.2 Responding to youth employment concerns

    126. This section discusses national efforts to promote improved youth
    employment outcomes. The government of Uganda recognizes employment
    creation as a central tenet to the national socio-economic development
    process. It is at the core of the transformation of Uganda from a poor
    agrarian economy to a modern, prosperous and skilled society. To address
    the needs of the large unemployed and underemployed youth population,
    the Government of Uganda has initiated a number of policies and
    programmes that are explained below.
    127. The National Employment Policy (2011): The National Employment Policy
    aims at ensuring productive and decent employment for all women and men

    88Uganda Women’s Concern Ministry in Mbale, Orphans Community Based Organization in Rakai district, Federation of
    Education NGOs in Uganda (FENU), and Uganda National NGO Board.
    89Uganda   Women Efforts to Save Orphans (UWESO).




  UGANDA INTER-AGENCY COUNTRY REPORT |National responses to child labour and youth employment concerns                  88
  in conditions of freedom, equity, security and human dignity. The National
  Employment Policy proposes eight policy priority areas including promoting
  youth employment. Since employment is a crosscutting issue, the policy
  promotes a multi-sectoral approach and integration of employment issues at
  all levels of government and private sector programmes. The financing of the
  policy is therefore spread over the line ministries, departments and agencies
  as well as local governments, social partners and Civil Society Organizations.
  Each sector ministry shall identify employment concerns, budget and fund
  them within their Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) ceilings.
  128. National Action Plan (NAP) for Youth Employment. The Government
  plans to develop and implement a National Action Plan for Youth
  Employment within the overall framework of the National Employment
  Policy. Key elements of the NAP include:
      Providing support to young people, particularly women to make
       transition from informal to formal employment through improved access
       to training, business development services, and access to low interest
       microfinance.
      Strengthening the capacity of career guidance to youth in order for them
       to study practical technical courses.
      Providing young entrepreneurs support through tax rebates at least for
       the first five years of establishing business.
      Integrating of youth in sectoral plans and programmes including National
       Agricultural Advisory Services (NAADS), Northern Uganda Social Action
       Fund (NUSAF), and any other programmes.
      Promoting job-placement, volunteer schemes and or internship to enable
       young acquire the requisite job training and hands on experience.
      Encouraging the youth to form associations and cooperatives for the
       purpose of developing entrepreneurship and creating employment.
      Establishing of one stop centre to offer technical advisory services
       including information on existing investment opportunities to youth
       entrepreneurs.
     Strengthening existing regional youth skills centres through retooling,
      staffing and capitalization.
  129. However, the draft NAP has not been finalized and launched by the
  government thus hindering effective planning, implementation and
  coordination of youth employment initiatives. Limited government
  commitment to funding youth employment activities is another key barrier
  to realizing the goal of youth employment in Uganda.
  130. Uganda Decent Work Country Programme (2013-2016): The Uganda
  Decent Work Country Programme (DWCP) places youth employment at the

UGANDA INTER-AGENCY COUNTRY REPORT |National responses to child labour and youth employment concerns   89
  centre of its future development strategies. Priority Area No. 2 of the DWCP
  aims at: (a) promoting youth employment by finalizing the National Action
  Plan for Youth Employment and by setting guidelines for mainstreaming
  youth employment into sectoral strategies; and (2) increasing youth
  employability through training youth in vocational and business skills and
  through developing a Labour Information and Analysis System.
  131. The Externalization of Labour programme: Government acknowledges
  that labour markets abroad provide employment opportunities for Ugandans
  in the short run as the country develops its capacity to generate sufficient
  jobs for its labour force. Government efforts to promote the externalization
  of labour include establishing bilateral agreements with Governments of
  receiving countries; strengthening the department responsible for
  employment services to regulate, guide, monitor and coordinate activities of
  various stakeholders involved in employment of Ugandans abroad; and
  establishing a revolving fund to facilitate Ugandans seeking employment
  abroad. The externalization of labour programme mainly targets youth. One
  of the key challenges affecting the programme is a lack of a comprehensive
  labour market information system to enable job seekers access adequate
  information about the availability of job opportunities abroad. Inadequate
  regulation of the programme has also resulted in violation of rights of
  workers abroad including forced labour, abuse and deportation.


  Skills development
  132. Business, Technical, Vocational Education and Training Strategic Plan
  (2011-2020): The strategic plan has five objectives (a) making BTVET relevant
  to productivity development and economic growth, (b) increasing the quality
  of skills provision, (c) increasing equitable access to skills development, (d)
  improving the effectiveness in BTVET management and organization, and (e)
  increasing efficiency and resources available to BTVET. The BTVET strategic
  plan has prioritized improving youth employability by increasing the quality
  of skills provision. This will be achieved through strengthening institutional
  capacities for BTVET provision, deployment of instructors/tutors and
  managers by reforming qualifications and recruitment practices, and
  introducing better quality assurance systems for public and private BTVET
  providers. The plan further plans to increase equitable access to skills
  development by ensuring access to formal and non-formal BTVET, expanding
  private training provision, and enhancing access of disadvantaged target
  groups particularly females and persons with disabilities to skills
  development through bursaries. The cost estimates in the plan foresee an
  increase of publicly sponsored non-formal training enrolment to 40,000
  annually in 2015 and 60,000 by 2016, compared to 20,000 in 2010/11.

  133. The Northern Uganda Social Action Fund Project (NUSAF):NUSAF, funded
  by the World Bank with $100 million over the period 2002-2009,aimed to
  empower communities in Northern Uganda by enhancing their capacity to
  systematically identify, prioritize, and plan for their needs and implement
  sustainable development initiatives that improve socio-economic services
  and opportunities. The Youth Opportunities Programme (YOP),the principal
  youth-focused program within NUSAF, had three main objectives: to provide
  youth with specific vocational skills and tool kits to enable them earn
  incomes and improve their livelihood; to contribute towards community
  reconciliation and conflict management; and to build capacity of NGOs,
  CBOs, and Vocational Training Institutes (VTIs) to respond to the needs of
  youth. YOP offered cash transfers to groups of youth to increase
  employment and reduce conflict, with the money deposited in a joint bank
  account.90 On a per-person basis, grants generally ranged from $200 to
  $600, or about one year’s income for a young adult. Four years later, most
  grant recipients were practicing skilled trades and earning more money than
  the control group.91 A second phase of the project (NUSAF II) was launched
  in 2009.


  Promoting youth entrepreneurship and self-employment
  134. The Youth Venture Capital Fund: The government has made available a
  venture capital fund of Uganda Shillings 25 Billion to support growth of
  viable and sustainable Small and Medium Enterprises by the youth in the
  private sector. The objective of the fund is to provide venture capital debt
  finance to viable projects proposed by the young entrepreneurs as well as
  enable the youth benefit from associated mentoring services from the
  participating bank. The Fund is used to support the business ventures owned
  by young entrepreneurs in manufacturing, agro-processing, primary
  agriculture, fisheries, livestock, health, transport, education, ICT, tourism,
  construction, printing and service contractors among others. The fund is
  implemented in a Public-Private Partnership arrangement between
  government ministries, the local government and commercial banks. A total
  of 50 youth have been targeted in each district reaching 5,750 youth in 115
  districts in the country. However, there are teething challenges relating to
  disbursement of loans by banks since some districts, particularly in

  90World   Bank, 2013.
  91A randomized evaluation of the Northern Uganda Social Action Fund (NUSAF) project showed that participants who received
  vocational training and enterprise development support experienced positive economic and social impacts, as indicated by
  improvements in earnings, profits, savings, and living standards and reduction in aggression among young men.Women in
  particular benefited from the cash transfers, with incomes of those in the program 84% higher than women who were not (ibid,
  Blattman, C, Fiala N, and Martinez S, 2013 ). However, there is limited information on the exact number of beneficiaries of YOP.

  Northeastern Uganda, do not have access to banks. Moreover, there is still
  limited awareness about the procedures for accessing the funds among
  youth.
  135. The Youth Entrepreneurship Facility (YEF):The YEF supports small-scale
  youth entrepreneurship development projects implemented by youth-led
  organizations. It is a 3-year initiative undertaken with the support of the
  Africa Commission and the Youth Employment Network (YEN).92The YEF
  provides a competitive grant scheme for youth-led organizations to propose
  innovative project ideas on how to create entrepreneurship and business
  opportunities for their peers. The organizations with the most innovative
  project ideas receive a grant and complementary capacity building to help
  them implement their projects and test the viability of their ideas. Through
  the YEF, a Replication Fund Scheme has also been launched in order to
  replicate the most successful of the formerly-implemented entrepreneurship
  projects. The Replication Fund is part of the YEF's effort to promote the
  proven entrepreneurship development projects identified and tested
  through the original project to enable as many youth as possible to benefit
  from the successful models to creating self-employment.
  136. The UN Joint Population Programme for the Youth: The ILO is
  implementing a Joint Population Programme for youth in order to create
  employment opportunities for the large number of young people entering
  the employable age group. This Programme is a partnership involving
  Government of Uganda, 10 UN agencies, civil society and development
  partners. The programme is implemented in 15 districts.93


  Efforts of social partners supporting youth employment
  137. Several development partners including international development
  agencies, international NGOs and civil society are implementing and testing a
  range of interventions and approaches for improving youth employment
  outcomes in Uganda. Below are illustrated some of the good practice models
  addressing youth unemployment implemented by different agencies.
  138. Swisscontact Uganda: Swisscontact, a Swiss foundation for technical
  cooperation operating in Uganda for the last 15 years, supports programmes
  in the areas of skills development, access to financial services, enterprise
  development and agricultural value chain enhancement.


  92Youth   Employment Network (YEN) is a partnership of United Nations, International Labour Organization, and World Bank.
   Participating districts include Abim, Nakapiripirit, Amudat, Bundibugyo, Arua, Kitgum, Gulu, Yumbe, Oyam, Kanungu,
  93

  Mubende, Kaabong, Kotido, Moroto and Katakwi.

  139. Private Sector Foundation Uganda (PSFU): PSFU is made up of 175
  business associations, corporate bodies and the major public sector agencies
  that support private sector growth. Since its founding in 1995, PSFU has
  served as a focal point for private sector advocacy as well as for capacity
  building and dialogue with Government on behalf of the private sector. PSFU
  programmes contribute to youth employment by providing advisory services
  for youth employment and opportunities, supporting business initiatives and
  initial capital investments for business development, providing market
  information and technical support and lobbying government to ensure a
  conducive business environment.
  140. Uganda Small Scale Industries Association (USSIA): Uganda Small Scale
  Industries Association (USSIA) is an umbrella body aimed at supporting and
  enhancing growth and competitiveness of micro and small scale
  industries/enterprises in Uganda. A sister organization, the Northern Uganda
  Manufacturers Association (NUMA), plays a similar role in the Northern
  region. Key activities include technical skills upgrading for members and non-
  members, business management and development for members and
  member associations, building market linkages, business information sharing
  and dissemination, and business advisory and consultancy services.
  141. Africa Institute of Strategic Animal Resource Service and Development
  (AFRISA): AFRISA is a collaboration programme between Makerere University
  in College of Veterinary and Animal Medicine (COVAB) and Government of
  Uganda to promote wealth creation in the animal production sector. AFRISA
  provides skills training and supports follow up and incubation of the trainees
  in skill areas. All training is centralized on AFRISA farms only. AFRISA is a key
  gateway for youth employment since young people receive professional skills
  training and certification that enables them seek wage or self-employment.
  In addition, young people who receive training are easily supported by
  financial institutions to start their own enterprises and businesses. However,
  the program is structured within the framework of formal university training
  making it expensive for the vast majority of youth who are poor and have no
  access to land. Moreover, the training covers a small geographical area due
  to limitations of technical resource persons.
  142. Uganda Industrial Research Institute (UIRI): Operating under the auspices
  of the Ministry of Trade Industry and Cooperatives (MTIC), UIRI is the lead
  government agency for industrialization. UIRI promotes youth employment
  by training youth in business skills, supporting them to set up enterprises,
  and creating linkages to financial institutions that support the enterprises to
  maturity. Some of the key challenges the institute faces include highly
  capital-intensive models and processes that most youth cannot afford,
  replicate and maintain over a period of time.



UGANDA INTER-AGENCY COUNTRY REPORT |National responses to child labour and youth employment concerns   93
  143. Uganda Association of Public and Private Vocational Institutions
  (UGAPRIVI): Uganda Association of Public and Private Vocational Institutions
  is a 5,000 member association of vocational institutions operating in all the
  regions in Uganda. UGAPRIVI has been mandated by the Directorate of
  Industrial Training (DIT) to offer support to the vocational training
  institutions in capacity assessment, assessor trainings, and development of
  occupational profiles and accreditation of vocational training institutions.
  However, weak local capacities to implement follow up and support
  vocational institutions in delivery of quality skills training hinder the effective
  delivery of services.
  144. An analysis of the above interventions shows that there is a number of
  actors, both state and non-state that make efforts to improve youth
  employment outcomes in Uganda. There are very few programmes for
  promoting youth employment in Uganda. Most programmes highlighted
  above do not exclusively target only youth. Additionally, existing
  programmes are limited in scope and only cover a small number of youth
  and mainly provide entrepreneurship and training-related programs.
  Moreover, most programmes are project based and donor dependent thus
  raising concerns about sustainability and scaling up of interventions to reach
  a large number of the unemployed youth. There is also lack of impact
  evaluation of the youth employment initiatives to provide important lessons
  on what works well in producing cost effective youth employment outcomes
  for the diversity of youth in Uganda. There is lack of interventions to make
  the labour market work better for youth such as wage subsidies and public
  works programs.

              ADDRESSING CHILD LABOUR AND YOUTH
              EMPLOYMENT: POLICY PRIORITIES



           145. This chapter presents and discusses policy recommendations for
           addressing child labour and promoting youth employment in Uganda
           drawing on the evidence presented in previous chapters and lessons learnt
           from past efforts. Child labour and youth employment are closely linked,
           underscoring the importance of addressing the two issues hand in hand,
           following a lifecycle approach. The figure below illustrates key components
           of an integrated response to child labour and youth employment concerns. A
           set of child-centred policies are needed to promote schooling as an
           alternative to child labour, and, following from this, to ensure that children
           enter adolescence with the basic and life skills needed for further learning
           and practical living. This foundation is in turn crucial to the success of active
           labour market policies for promoting improved youth employment
           outcomes, and to ensuring that youth successfully transition from education
           into decent work in the labour market. This causal chain can also work in the
           opposite direction: successful youth labour market outcomes can increase
           household incentives to invest in children’s education earlier in the lifecycle.

    146. Specific policy priorities for responding to child labour and responding to
    youth labour market concerns are discussed in the next two sections of this
    chapter.


6.1 Accelerating action against child labour

    147. Child labour is a complex phenomenon requiring a policy response that
    is cross-sectoral in nature. Evidence from Uganda and elsewhere suggests
    policy areas relevant in this regard –education and second chance learning,
    social protection, public awareness, social mobilisation and inspections and
    monitoring – building on the foundation provided by adequate political
    commitment and institutional capacity. These policies are discussed in
    further details below.


    Promote early childhood development (ECD)
    148. Evidence from a range of developing countries suggests that early
    childhood education programmes can promote learning readiness, increase
    school enrolment and school survival, and help children away from work in
    their early years. In Uganda, expanding the coverage of ECD programmes
    remains an important challenge, particularly among children from poor
    households. The government has released a National Integrated Early
    Childhood Development Policy (IECD) as a framework for actions aimed at
    improving and extending ECD programmes in Uganda. The IECD policy aims
    at harmonizing the existing ECD initiatives for holistic service provision,
    setting standards and guidelines for equitable access to quality ECD services,
    and strengthening institutional capacity in ECD service delivery. The policy
    will also promote ECD by establishing an ECD centre at every primary school
    to allow for easy access of ECD services by all children and caregivers but
    also easy transition to primary level education. While the development of
    the NIECD policy is a positive step, there is need for an accompanying action
    plan for resource mobilisation and for promoting implementation.


    Promote equal access to education
    149. Continued efforts are needed to remove access barriers to schooling for
    all children, within the framework provided by the National Development
    Plan (NDP, 2010/2011-2014/15) (Chapter 7) and the Education Sector
    Strategic Plan (ESSP, 2004/05-2014/2015). Increasing school coverage




    UGANDA INTER-AGENCY COUNTRY REPORT |Addressing child labour and youth employment: policy priorities   96
remains a challenge, particularly in outlying areas and at the secondary
level.94 Many rural secondary schools also lack basic school facilities such as
desks, blackboards, chairs, drinking water, and toilet facilities. Among the
other factors which hinder children’s access to and participation in education
are the direct costs that parents must bear in the form of non-tuition dues
and levies,95 school books, uniforms and other school items. Socio-cultural
factors such as early marriage and lack of proper sanitation facilities in
school96 pose particular access barriers for girls. Both the NDP and ESSP
outline strategies for increasing access and equity of primary and secondary
education, including reducing direct costs of education to families,
supporting programmes targeted at vulnerable children and youth, reducing
social-cultural barriers to girls’ school attendance and expanding and
improving primary school infrastructure. In addition, school feeding
programmes can offer an important incentive for school attendance, and can
also help improve pupils’ academic performance. Effectively implementing
these strategies across the education system, however, remains a challenge.


Address the quality of education
150. Although the introduction of the Universal Primary Education (UPE) led
to a drastic increase in enrolment in primary schools, there are concerns
regarding the declining quality of education owing to large class sizes,
teacher absenteeism, and lack of appropriate skills by teachers particularly in
rural areas. Evidence shows that when the quality of education is poor,
parents make decisions to remove their children from school due to the
perceived low return on education. Improving quality education in Uganda
will entail introducing reforms that gradually reduce large class sizes and
improve teacher-pupil ratios in order to increase contact between teachers
and pupils; teacher training to strengthen their knowledge and skills; and
introducing methods of learning that encourage questioning and children’s
participation rather than rote learning, and that are adaptive to children’s
different learning needs. Again, these reforms are outlined in the National
Development Plan (NDP, 2010/2011-2014/15) (Chapter 7) and the Education
Sector Strategic Plan (ESSP, 2004/05-2014/2015) and the priority moving
forward will be to effectively implement them across the education system.

Support second chance learning opportunities through transitional education
151. “Second chance” policies are needed to reach former working children
and other out-of-school children with educational opportunities as part of
broader efforts towards their social reintegration. Empirical evidence
presented above on educational attainment indicates that such policies are
particularly relevant in Ugandan: many students leave the system prior to
the end of the primary education cycle and many of those out of school lack
the minimum amount of school time considered by UNESCO as necessary for
acquiring basic literacy skills. Transitional education, involving separate
intensive courses designed to raise academic proficiency to facilitate a return
to the formal school system, offers one possible route for reaching children
with second educational chances. The key advantage to this transitional
education strategy is that it offers children a viable opportunity to re-enter
regular schooling, rather than relegating them permanently to a parallel, and
frequently poorer quality, non-formal education track. Existing second
chance programmes, including the Alternative Basic Education for Karamoja
(ABEK) programme, the Basic Education for Urban Poor Areas (BEUPA)
programme and the Child Centred Alternative Non-formal Community-based
Education (CHANCE), are limited in coverage, lack coordination and are not
uniformly successful in terms of learning outcomes. This underscores the
need for an expanded national second chance education strategy for
children focused on transitional education.


Expand social protection
The importance of social protection in reducing child labour is well-
established. Social protection instruments serve to prevent vulnerable
households from having to resort to child labour as a buffer against poverty
and negative shocks. There is no single recipe for expanding social protection
programmes to reduce household vulnerability and child labour.
Unconditional and conditional cash transfer programmes, including various
forms of child support grants, family allowances, needs based social
assistance and social pensions, are all relevant to ensuring household
livelihoods and supplementing the incomes of the poor. Public works
schemes can serve both the primary goal of providing a source of
employment to household breadwinners and the secondary goal of helping
to rehabilitate public infrastructure and expand basic services, both being
potentially relevant in terms of reducing reliance on child labour. The
government has prioritized social protection expansion and in this context
initiated a social protection programme known as the Social Assistance
Grants for Empowerment (SAGE) in 2011. The programme offers an




UGANDA INTER-AGENCY COUNTRY REPORT |Addressing child labour and youth employment: policy priorities   98
important basis for extending the social protection floor available to
vulnerable households in the country.


Promote greater public awareness of child labour
152. Awareness raising is needed as part of efforts to build a broad consensus
for change. At present, public awareness about what constitutes child labour
and its cost to children and society remains limited in Uganda. Households
require information concerning the costs or dangers of child labour and
benefits of schooling in order to make informed decisions on their children’s
time allocations. Child labour is a clear example in which both social norms
and economic considerations are important, and strategic communication
efforts need to be designed with this in mind. Communication efforts are
needed at both national and local levels. A mix of conventional (e.g., radio,
television and print media) as well as of non-conventional communication
channels (e.g., religious leaders, school teachers, community theatre, health
care workers outreach) is important in order to achieving maximum
outreach. Baseline information on local knowledge and cultural attitudes
towards child labour is needed to tailor communication messages, and to
evaluation changes in awareness and attitudes following communication
activities. The urgent need to address unconditional worst forms of child
labour, including human trafficking and child commercial sexual exploitation,
should be a particular focus of communication efforts. Providing information
on national child labour legislation, presented in terms that are
understandable to the populations and communities concerned, is another
communication priority.


Promote social mobilisation against child labour
153. Social mobilisation is critical to engaging a broad range of social actors in
efforts against child labour. Social actors, including, for example, NGOs, faith-
based organisations, teachers’ organizations, the mass media, trade unions,
employers’ organizations, also have important roles to play in a broader
societal effort against child labour. Care providers in direct contact with
children, including teachers and health workers, are in an especially good
position to identify and refer child labourers, and therefore constitute
particularly important allies in protecting children from child labour.
Initiatives such as community-based child protection networks provide useful
vehicles for bringing together a wide variety of stakeholders to combat child
labour.




UGANDA INTER-AGENCY COUNTRY REPORT |Addressing child labour and youth employment: policy priorities   99
Strengthen child labour inspections and monitoring
154. While the Employment Act No.6 (2006) requires districts to appoint
labour officers to provide technical advice to employers, the government’s
actual capacity to monitor formal workplaces is limited, and the informal
sector of the economy is largely outside formal inspection regimes. Out of 90
districts, only 30 have recruited labour officers to enforce labour legislation.
Moreover, many of the provisions of Children’s Act are supposed to be
implemented by the district probation and welfare offices under MGLSD, yet
these departments are not well resourced and are not fully functional. The
current capacity for labour inspection and child labour follow-up therefore
needs to be significantly strengthened, through both additional training and
additional manpower, so that district labour officers and other specialised
personnel can effectively enforce labour legislation and workplace safety
standards, and follow-up on child labour infractions. But given the extent of
child labour and resource constraints, it will likely continue to be difficult for
the formal system alone to be effective in protecting children from
workplace violations. This points to an important potential role of
community monitoring systems, whereby labour officers join hands with
other organisations (e.g., community volunteers, religious leaders, women
and youth groups, teachers, workers, employers, local leaders and district
staff) to form broad-based child labour monitoring systems at the local level.


Advocate for political commitment
155. A political commitment at all levels is also needed to ensure that child
labour reduction elimination occupies a prominent place in the national
development agenda and is accorded adequate budgetary resources. In this
context, the government released a National Child Labour Policy and a
National Action Plan for the Elimination of Child Labour, (Chapter 7).
reflecting the government commitment to eliminating child labour and
provide a framework for national efforts towards this goal. However, limited
funding from the government and lack of a clear resource mobilization
strategy undermines its effective implementation.


Build institutional capacity
156. Strengthening institutional capacity at all levels of government is needed
for continued progress towards child labour reduction goals. While the
National Child Labour Policy, the National Action Plan and other
development plans provide solid bases for action, these frameworks are
unlikely to be implemented effectively in the face of capacity constraints.
Institutions require strengthening in a number of areas, including using data
for strategic planning, policy and programme design, programme monitoring

UGANDA INTER-AGENCY COUNTRY REPORT |Addressing child labour and youth employment: policy priorities   100
    and evaluation, programme coordination, and the mainstreaming of child
    labour in broader development plans and programmes. As child labour is a
    cross-sectoral issue, requiring close collaboration across a range of
    government bodies, the clear delineation of roles, and the strengthening of
    coordination and information-sharing, will also be critical to the effective
    functioning of government institutions and their social partners in efforts
    combating child labour. Local governments are charged with initiating and
    implementing programmes for preventing child labour, and effectively
    building their capacity to play this role is therefore especially important to
    broader efforts against child labour. Child labour committees exist in some
    districts, although with limited functionality.97 Most districts, however, have
    not integrated child labour concerns in their development plans and lack the
    financial and human resource capacity to effectively do so.


6.2 Accelerating action against youth employment concerns

    157. The results presented in this Report highlight a number of challenges
    facing Ugandan young people entering the labour market.
    158. These results point to the need for active labour market policies aimed
    at improving youth labour market outcomes, building on the knowledge
    foundation acquired during childhood through improved basic education and
    preventing child labour. Four policy pillars are particularly relevant in this
    context, two addressing supply-side constraints to employment arising from
    inadequate or mismatched job skills or inadequate labour market
    information, and two addressing demand-side constraints to employment
    arising from low labour demand and limited entrepreneurial opportunities.
    Active labour market policies are designed to improve labour market
    outcomes for young people within existing institutional and macro-economic
    constraints; the broader structural economic reforms needed to reduce
    youth unemployment in the long run are beyond the scope of this Report.
    159. Supply-side policies should be calibrated to the unique needs of youth
    with different education levels. For better-educated youth, there is a need to
    ensure that the right skills are acquired, that skills mismatches within the
    labour market are reduced, and that labour market mechanisms are in place
    to facilitate matches between job seekers and employers. For less educated
    youth, second chance education in its various dimensions is necessary, in

    development plan and budget (ILO-IPEC 2012).




    UGANDA INTER-AGENCY COUNTRY REPORT |Addressing child labour and youth employment: policy priorities                                  101
order to equip them with the life and job skills needed to exit from low
quality and low productively informal sector work. Relevant demand-side
policies include promoting youth entrepreneurship and labour-intensive
public works as part of a broader effort to address low labour demand and
limited business opportunities for young workers.
160. The active labour market policies are discussed in further detail below. It
is worth recalling at the beginning of this discussion that the Government is
developing a National Action Plan (NAP) for Youth Employment within the
overall framework of the National Employment Policy (Chapter 7). Limited
government commitment to funding youth employment activities is another
key barrier to realizing the goal of youth employment in Uganda.


Promote skills development
161. Improving youth skills and employability requires action on three levels:
first, there is a need to strengthen the quality of basic education and its
relevance vis-à-vis the needs of young people entering the labour market;
second, to provide second chance learning opportunities to young persons
who have been denied sufficient education, a group which includes persons
forced out of school at an early age in order to work; and third, to extend the
effectiveness and reach of technical and vocational education training
programmes. Taken together, these measures help equip young persons
with adequate skills and job experience to be successful in their working life
either as employees or as self- employed workers. Improving basic education
and second chance learning are taken up in section 6.1 of this Report.
Technical and vocational training is dealt with here.
162. Continued investment is needed in strengthening the capacity of the
business technical vocational education and training (BTVET) system to
effectively meet the skills requirements of Ugandan young people. The
BTVET system is hampered by inadequate resources to provide the training
most in demand by the labour market. Training consequently often focuses
on low-cost skills mismatched to current and emerging labour market
needs.98Indeed, less than 40 percent of large and medium firms regard
courses offered by BTVET institutions as relevant.99The BTVET system also
has insufficient programmes for agri-business development and informal
sector employment, the two most important sub-sectors of the Ugandan
labour market for the foreseeable future. Insufficient engagement of
employers, a rigid supply structure in the formal BTVET provider system and

UGANDA INTER-AGENCY COUNTRY REPORT |Addressing child labour and youth employment: policy priorities   102
the lack of a systematic labour market information system are among the
major challenges to increasing the demand-responsiveness of the BTVET
system.
163. The BTVET Strategic Plan (2011-2020) has prioritized improving youth
employability by increasing the quality of skills provision. Ensuring the
effective implementation of the Plan will therefore be critical to progress
moving forward. Particular priorities in this regard include strengthening
existing regional youth skills centres through retooling, staffing and
capitalization. Another priority is promoting job-placement, volunteer
schemes and or internships offering youth hands-on means to acquire work-
related competencies and increase their employability. This in turn
underscores the importance of expanded public-private-partnerships
between training institutions, employers and government. Finally, there is a
need for investment in upgrading BTVET instructors and the BTVET
curriculum, in keeping with the new competence requirements in the
Uganda Vocational Qualification Framework.


Job search support
164. One of the key challenges hindering effective transition of youth to the
labour market is lack of labour market information. Labour market
information is currently not systematically and regularly collected in Uganda.
Available information is scarce and sketchy, especially on skill requirements.
The Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development (MGLSD) runs a
manual labour market information system, but this system is not widely used
or easily accessed by youth. The National Employment Policy contains plans
to strengthen the capacity of MGLSD as the national and regional depository
for labour and employment management information, but does not make
clear how in practice labour market information will be shared with the job
seekers.
165. This discussion points to the need for a full-fledged employment agency
operated by the Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development
responsible for providing timely and accurate information to job seekers
about the available employment opportunities and the skills required. The
agency would help increase the quantity and quality of job matches, reduce
the spells and duration of unemployment and generally increase the
efficiency of the labour market. Such an employment agency should be part
of a broader package of employment services, guidance and career advice to
help students, first job seekers and unemployed young people to make
informed choices about their education and working lives, and thus increase
the opportunity for a successful entry into the labour market. The aim of
career guidance services should be to advise properly about the types of jobs


UGANDA INTER-AGENCY COUNTRY REPORT |Addressing child labour and youth employment: policy priorities   103
available, skills needed, career paths, salary scales, and about the trends and
opportunities of the labour market.
166. Ensuring that at-risk youth are able to access these employment services
programmes constitutes a particular priority. This can be difficult because
most at-risk youth live in either marginal urban or rural areas, while most
employment services are offered in more central locations. One criticism of
employment services programmes elsewhere has been that those who
benefit from the programmes are typically more qualified and connected to
begin with and therefore more likely to become employed. This points to the
importance of targeting job search support to disadvantaged young people
most in need.


Public works programmes
167. The high levels of youth who are not in education, employment or
training (NEET) points to the need for demand-side measures aimed at
improving employment opportunities for young people. Labour-intensive
public works programmes targeting young persons represent one important
policy option in this context. Such programmes can provide both qualified
and unqualified young people with an entry point into the labour market
within broader efforts to reduce poverty and develop rural services
infrastructure. Adding mandatory technical, behavioural skills, financial
literacy, or job search training to the public works initiatives can further
increase their impact. There is a need for collaboration between Ministry of
Gender, Labour and Social Development and Ministry of Transport and other
ministries that implement public works programmes, to exploit the potential
of public works as a targeted employment measure for youth. This is a policy
area that merits further exploration within the context of the National
Employment Policy and the draft National Action Plan (NAP) for Youth
Employment.


Promote youth entrepreneurship and self employment
168. Promoting youth entrepreneurship represents an important demand-
side strategy for expanding youth employment opportunities and improving
employment outcomes for the large proportion of young people currently
underemployed or in low productivity family work. However, a lack of
adequate entrepreneurship skills and experience combined with poor access
to financial services hinder youth entrepreneurship and self-employment. As
a result, the role of youth entrepreneurs in the development of small and
medium enterprises (SMEs) has thus far been limited in Uganda. Rather, self-
employed youth are concentrated in low-productivity and survival-type
activities in the informal economy.

UGANDA INTER-AGENCY COUNTRY REPORT |Addressing child labour and youth employment: policy priorities   104
169. A number of policy measures are relevant to expanding entrepreneurial
opportunities for young people. These include supporting an entrepreneurial
culture by including entrepreneurship education and training in school.
Easing access to finance, including by guaranteeing loans and supporting
micro-credit initiatives, is also critical, as a major stumbling block for young
entrepreneurs is the lack of access to credit and seed funding. Expanding
access to effective business advisory and support services, and the capacity
to deliver them, is another key element in promoting youth
entrepreneurship as isolation and lack of support prevent many potential
young entrepreneurs experience from gaining a foothold in the business
world. The formation of self-help groups, including cooperatives, by young
people would also allow for better access to supplies, credit and market
information.
170. Many of these measures are spelled out in the National Employment
Policy (NEP) and the draft National Action Plan (NAP) for Youth Employment.
Together with the Youth Entrepreneurship Facility (YEF), these efforts
provide an important basis for scaled-up efforts aimed at providing
entrepreneurship opportunities for youth.

 Description of variables used in the econometric analysis


         Child characteristics. The control variables relating to child characteristics
         include: the age of the child (age, age squared), a gender dummy (male),
         a dummy for whether or not the child has migrated over the five years
         prior to the survey (migrated),100 a series of dummy variables for the
         orphanhood status of the child (orphan of mother, orphan of father or
         double orphan) and a dummy variable for whether the child’s mother
         and/or father are sick (Sick mother and/or father). The dummy age
         squared is included to account for the non-linear relationship between
         age and employment (i.e., for the fact that employment rises with age at
         a decreasing rate).

         Household head characteristics. A series of dummy variables are included
         for sex of household head (male household head), for the education of
         the household head (primary, secondary or higher than secondary) and a
         dummy variable for whether the household head is an employee with
         social security and/or medical benefits.

         Household composition. A set of control variables are employed to take
         into consideration household composition: number of persons living in
         the household (household size); number of children (number of children
         aged 0-5 years); number of elderly persons (number of persons aged
         65+).

         Household wealth101. A series of dummy variables are included to control
         for the household wealth (household wealth quintile 2, 3, 4 and 5). A

100   Due to data limitations, we look only at internal migration.
101
    The Uganda Labour Force and Child Activities (NLF&CAS) 2011/2012 does not collect information on household
expenditure or household income to be used as a measure of welfare. In the cases of other surveys, such as the Demographic
and Health Surveys, which also lack direct welfare information, a common solution has been to generate a wealth index using a
principal components approach, following Filmer and Pritchett (2001). The approach involves constructing an index based as
the first principal component of a vector of assets, including durables goods, housing characteristics, and access to utilities. The
principal components approach involves defining the wealth index in terms of the first principal component of the variables used.

      Access to basic services. A dummy variable is included for access to tap

Notes: (a) NEET refers to youth who are not in education or employment. It is a measure that therefore reflects both youth who are inactive and out of education as well as youth
who are unemployed; (b) Relaxed unemployment considers both unemployed workers and all individuals who are not working and available for work.The relaxed unemployment
rate is the sum of unemployed workers and not working individuals available for work expressed as a percentage of the expanded active population. The expanded active
population, in turn, comprises not working individuals available to work and the active population.

          102 Any other sectors/activities that could deny children the right to education by preventing their attendance at school are
          considered hazardous. Consequences of denial of education might include limited cognitive development, lack of basic
          literacy/numeracy skills, and limited opportunities for future productive employment.
          103Any hazardous activity could potentially cause the death of the child. The ultimate consequence of hazardous work, across
          sectors, is death.
