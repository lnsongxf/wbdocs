Executive Summary

Jordan is one of the most water-stressed countries in the world. Its annual
renewable resources of 145 cubic meters per capita are far below the threshold
of severe water scarcity of 500 cubic meters. The competition among water
needs for irrigation, industrial and domestic uses, wetland protection, and
in-stream habitat needs continues to pose serious challenges in Jordan. As a
result of this competition, the available fresh water for farmers in Jordan, and
more specifically farmers in the Jordan Valley, has declined. The five-year
moving average dropped from 155 million cubic meters in 2003 to 131 million
cubic meters in 2009. The drop in fresh water has been accompanied by an
increase in treated wastewater, which although assisting in maintaining access
to water for agriculture, has had an impact on the quality of the available
water. Nevertheless, the total crop area has increased from 28,000 hectares in
1994 to 34,300 hectares in 2012.
   In the past 20 years, agricultural productivity in the Jordan Valley has
increased despite the sector’s major water resource constraints. The increased
reliance on new farming and irrigation technologies (most notably the intro-
duction of greenhouses and drip irrigation technologies) and the expansion
of the area planted have resulted in higher agricultural output. However, the
forces driving these changes are weakening, and in 2012 and 2013 the country
registered negative growth rates in the sector. In the Jordan Valley, this lack of
growth also translated for the first time into a decline in crop productivity per
dunum.1 Despite the modernization of agriculture in the Jordan Valley, crop-
ping patterns have barely changed over the last 20 years. In 1994, the five
major crops (tomato, cucumber, eggplant, squash, and potato) constituted
62 percent of the total cropped vegetable, whereas the share of these five crops
increased to 70 percent in 2012. Banana has shown an expansion due to the
crop’s artificially high prices resulting from import restrictions.
   In the Jordan Valley, the public irrigation infrastructure assets are managed
by the Jordan Valley Authority (JVA), the government organization responsi-
ble for the socioeconomic development of the Jordan Valley. Ensuring that
the Jordan Valley can thrive will depend on the capacity of the JVA to provide
the needed water quantity and quality. Currently, the JVA’s capacity is ham-
pered by its lack of financial viability. Although the JVA has strived in recent
years to improve its revenue base, more effort is needed to secure its financial
sustainability. Although the JVA has increased industrial tariffs, it has left irri-
gation tariffs untouched (which are extremely low at JD 0.011 per cubic meter
and have not been adjusted since 1994).
   The large operating deficits within the context of an increasingly aging
infrastructure have already resulted in depreciation and maintenance pay-
ments increasingly being squeezed out, jeopardizing the medium-to-long-
term viability of the existing water infrastructure. With the increase in energy
prices (and the dismantling of energy subsidies), the JVA’s financial results
will be highly compromised in the short term. The postponement of

The Cost of Irrigation Water in the Jordan Valley	                                ix
investments during the last decade, and increasing energy costs coupled with
new responsibilities regarding the pumping of water to Amman, have con-
tributed to large operating losses which, in 2012, were equivalent to about
40 percent of total recurrent expenditures. In view of the many uncertainties,
including changes in energy subsidies currently extended to the water sector,
the upward risk for further operation and maintenance cost increases seem
higher than the downward risks. Yet, it also shows that the JVA will have to lay
out a roadmap for irrigation water tariff increases that are accompanied by
efficiency improvements and other measures to help farmers make the transi-
tion to higher tariffs.
    The purpose of this study is to determine the cost of irrigation water in the
Jordan Valley, compare this cost with the revenues generated by the JVA,
and  to estimate the impact of increasing irrigation water prices—based on
different levels of cost recovery—on farming.
    The study undertook a financial analysis of the JVA combining data from
the JVA’s administration and the JVA’s budget books, while collecting more
disaggregated data on the JVA’s revenues and expenditure from its financial
and operational departments. It supplemented this analysis with farmer sur-
veys in the Jordan Valley and an assessment of the agricultural sector using
data from from the Jordanian Department of Statistics and an expert team of
the Food and Agriculture Organization.
    The cost of irrigation water in the Jordan Valley. The analysis shows that
the JVA needs significant tariff increases to strengthen its financial sustain-
ability. Depending on the level of cost recovery, the minimum required tariff
increases for irrigation water could be very large. If the JVA wanted to at least
cover its operation and maintenance costs in 2013, it would have required an
irrigation water tariff of JD 0.108 per cubic meter—assuming that the current
cross-subsidies and current inefficiency levels remain unchanged. Yet, if
the  JVA were able to reduce its billing and collection inefficiencies, the
required irrigation water tariff would drop to JD 0.066 per cubic meter. If the
government wanted to pursue its objective as stated in the Government of
Jordan’s Water Strategy (2009) that depreciation should also be covered,
the  irrigation water tariff would have to increase to between JD 0.132 and
JD  0.215 per cubic meter, depending on whether billing and collection
­inefficiencies improve.
    The tariff increases necessary to ensure JVA’s financial viability are rather
 large, especially compared to current tariffs, and will require time to be imple-
 mented. The more efficient JVA becomes in providing irrigation water ser-
 vices, the more able it will be to reduce the size of the required tariff increases.
 The JVA has several routes to improving its efficiency, which include chang-
 ing billing and collection practices, changing revenue policies, and efficiency
 improvements in the delivery of JVA services.
    Change in billing and collection practices. The farmer survey that was under-
taken by the JVA in 2011–12 for this study found that billing efficiency was
only 82 percent and collection efficiency only 75 percent. Hence, JVA is
obtaining less than 62 percent of its potential revenues. Improving billing
and  collection efficiency would go a long way toward lessening the need

x	                                  The Cost of Irrigation Water in the Jordan Valley
for irrigation water tariff increases, while also ensuring fairness in water tariffs.
In addition, the current practice of billing farmers on the basis of quota
allocations, when actual water volumes provided are often significantly lower,
­
will need to be reviewed, because farmers may not be willing to pay for water
that has not been received. Since the JVA is increasingly transferring the dis-
tribution responsibility to water user associations (WUAs), it should consider
putting WUAs in charge of billing and collecting irrigation water tariffs from
farmers.
   Change in JVA’s and WUA’s capability to retain revenues. Currently, the JVA
is a ministerial department that collects revenues, but which then transfers
these revenues to the Treasury, a policy that does not provide many incentives
to increase billing and collection efficiencies. This report, therefore, recom-
mends ensuring that billed and collected revenues are retained by the JVA or
WUAs (if responsibility has been transferred), and allowing the WUAs to
keep their share needed for the operation and maintenance of the distribution
networks, while handing the rest over to the JVA. This would also dovetail
with the government’s vision of transforming the JVA into a bulk water
supplier.
   Efficiency improvements in the delivery of JVA services. Although the JVA
has cut costs significantly over the years, especially with regard to mainte-
nance and investments, there is still ample scope for efficiency gains. These
gains are especially evident in energy cost savings, including a more explicit
agreement with the Water Authority of Jordan on water pumping to Amman,
improvement in staff productivity and maintenance policies and implementa-
tion. Energy makes up an increasing part of the total operating costs of JVA
(due to the increase in electricity prices and reduction of subsidies). In addi-
tion, JVA’s mandate was expanded to include pumping water to Amman,
without explicit agreements on the costs and revenues linked to that p   ­ umping.
An explicit agreement with the Water Authority of Jordan on water pumping,
and a policy to improve energy efficiency, would be first steps in improving
energy efficiency in the JVA. At the same time, staff productivity as measured
by staff per farmer served is very low, and hence there is ample scope to
improve staff productivity in the JVA. Finally, although maintenance has
been  neglected in recent years, and the required irrigation water tariffs
assume  a much higher maintenance provision, the JVA could develop and
implement an asset management plan to extend asset life; rationalize rehabil-
itation, repair, and replacement investment decisions; and rationalizing
maintenance.
   The impact of increasing irrigation water tariffs on farmers. The pro-
posed irrigation water tariffs are much higher than the rates currently in
place. A comparison with other countries shows that the proposed tariff sce-
narios are comparable to irrigation water tariffs in countries for which data
are available. The impact of tariff increases on farmers’ incomes is in general
moderate, because water costs make up only a small part of the total cost of
farming. Yet, as can be expected, certain cropping patterns will be much more
affected by the tariff increases than others. It is especially crops that tend to
consume large volumes of water (especially citrus) that will feel the impact of

The Cost of Irrigation Water in the Jordan Valley	                                 xi
the irrigation water tariffs. In the case of another water-intensive crop as
banana, which benefits from import restrictions, only very large tariff
increases will make this crop unprofitable.
   Because the agricultural sector in Jordan is under stress, having registered
negative growth in 2012 and 2013, any government policy to rationalize irri-
gation water subsidies should, where possible, try to increase the resilience of
farmers in a comprehensive manner. The farming sector in the Jordan Valley
will have to address issues related to, among others, the marketing of crops,
and provide support to introduce new technologies that reduce the risks for
farmers to change cropping patterns. These are not under the purview of the
JVA, but will help improve the productivity in the sector. In addition, the
government should assess the impact of the irrigation water tariffs on poor
farmers. The farmer survey found that 17 percent of the survey respondents
could be classified as poor. Propoor farm policies can come in different forms,
ranging from cross-subsidies in the irrigation tariff structure to direct income
support to poor farmers. Because the number of poor farmers is very small, it
is relatively easy for government to provide income support to poor farmers
in the Jordan Valley.

Chapter 1

Introduction
Background
Jordan is one of the most water-stressed countries in the world. Its annual
renewable resources of 145 cubic meters per capita are far below the threshold
of severe water scarcity of 500 cubic meters (Aquastat 2008; Northcliff et al.
2008). The competition among water needs for irrigation, industrial and
domestic uses, wetland protection, and in-stream habitat needs continues to
pose serious challenges to the country. These challenges are further exacer-
bated by the deterioration of water quality. The competition for increasingly
scarce water resources is reflected in the use of water sources. In 2007,
(the latest year for which data are available), agriculture withdrew about
64 ­percent of the renewable water resources compared to 74 percent in 1992.
The share of agriculture decreased during the same period from close to
8 percent to less than 3 percent of gross domestic product in 2007.
   However, compared to many other countries in the region, Jordan has
made progress in water sector reform. For example, the Government of
Jordan is paying attention to sector policies and is trying to address water
scarcity. The government has a system of quotas and tariffs in place for irriga-
tion water. Favorable institutional arrangements exist, with a regulatory
authority, the Ministry of Water and Irrigation, and two providers for irriga-
tion and water supply and sanitation services, the Jordan Valley Authority
(JVA) and the Water Authority of Jordan. Further, the government has
embarked on the establishment of water user associations (WUAs) to deliver
retail irrigation services to farmers. Farmers in about 40 percent of the Jordan
Valley are in various stages of establishing WUAs. These WUAs interface with
the JVA at the level of the head units along the King Abdullah Canal and in
the irrigation systems in the Southern Ghors. Finally, recent major invest-
ments have both increased the supply of bulk water and enhanced wastewater
treatment capacity (making reuse of wastewater possible).
   The production of agricultural produce in the Jordan Valley could not be
achieved without irrigation. In the Jordan Valley, the total crop area increased
from 28,000 hectares (ha) in 1994 to 34,300 hectares in 2012, with virtually all
of that area being irrigated. Water is delivered to farms through pressurized
closed conduits. The challenge is to allocate the limited supply of water avail-
able to the approximately 10,000 Jordan Valley farms1 in a transparent and
equitable way and to apply it to crops so as to maximize output per unit water,
prevent the accumulation of salts and other soil contaminants, and avoid
deep percolation losses of water below crop root zones.
   The Government’s 2009 Water Strategy lays out the future challenges for
irrigation in Jordan, and focuses on reducing the annual water allocation for
irrigation (in favor of domestic and industrial demand) by improving effi-
ciency through appropriate water tariffs, the use of new technologies, and

The Cost of Irrigation Water in the Jordan Valley	                            1
incentives for farmers to improve the efficiency of on-farm irrigation. The
Water Strategy is supplemented by the Irrigation Water Policy (GoJ n.d.) and
the Irrigation Water Allocation and Use Policy (GoJ n.d.). These policies con-
solidate and elaborate elements of that policy relating to on-farm water man-
agement, management and administration, water tariffs, and irrigation
efficiency, whereas the Irrigation Equipment and System Design Policy (GoJ
n.d.) provides a policy on defining and updating irrigation equipment and
system design standards.



Objectives
Given the general scarcity of water in Jordan, the government is aiming to
sustain or even increase agricultural production while at the same time pro-
moting more efficient use of water. The government expects water demand
management and water conservation to play an important role in achieving
sustainable use of freshwater resources in Jordan. Water demand manage-
ment in irrigated agriculture is expected to generate significant savings in the
water sector. The JVA—through the Ministry of Water and Irrigation—is
expected to undertake all necessary water demand management measures
(economic, technical, and regulatory) to support more efficient use of water,
and in turn, help sustain or increase agricultural production.
   According to the 2009 Water Strategy, irrigation water tariffs will play a key
role in the process of efficiency improvements. Irrigation tariffs aim to cover
actual operation and maintenance expenses,2 and increasingly also fund part
of the capital costs of the services. The cost recovery issue has been discussed
in the sector for many years. Differential prices shall be applied to irrigation
water to account for water quantity and quality, taking into consideration the
socioeconomic aspects. Pricing instruments are to be supplemented by incen-
tive programs and reform of systems so as to promote water use efficiency by
farmers. Such programs might include the establishment of sustainable fund-
ing mechanisms to provide low-interest long-term loans, tax incentives,
grants, and fee waivers for efficient water use equipment. At the same time,
the government will develop and implement incentives to encourage
low-water-consuming, high-value crops so as to increase the highest eco-
­
nomic return per cubic meter of water used and the sustainability and effi-
ciency of the existing irrigation systems.
   The objectives of this study are to (a) determine the financial cost of irriga-
tion water in the Jordan Valley and the levels of cost recovery for irrigation
water that can be achieved by comparing the costs of irrigation water (using
different cost scenarios) and the revenues generated by the JVA in the Jordan
Valley, and (b) estimate the impact of increasing irrigation water prices (based
on different levels of cost recovery) on farm incomes and water productivity
and use in the Jordan Valley.
   A study on the cost of irrigation in the Jordan Valley and its estimated
financial impact on farm income was conducted in 1993 by the Ministry of
Planning and the Ministry of Water and Irrigation, and provided important

input in determining irrigation water policies. The current study will be an
update of the 1993 study but will also expand its scope to (a) examine how
irrigation tariffs and water quotas have affected water use in the irrigation
water sector in the Jordan Valley between 1997 and 2010; (b) look into the
poverty impacts of increasing irrigation tariffs, using the methodology devel-
oped in the Venot, Molle, and Hassan (2007) study to determine how differ-
ent prices will affect different farmer groups, including poor farmers; and (c)
determine any indirect effects that might occur because of the policies imple-
mented since 1993.



Methodology
The study team used, as a starting point, the methodology presented in the
1993 report by the Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ),
which mainly focused on determining the financial cost of providing irriga-
tion water in the Jordan Valley, especially operation and maintenance costs. It
included an analysis on how to improve efficiency in operation and mainte-
nance, how to generate cost savings, and how the different tariffs would affect
farmers’ incomes using various cropping patterns. This part of the study was
later reproduced and detailed in the work of Venot, Molle, and Hassan (2007)
and Molle, Venot, and Hassan (2008) to determine the trends in land tenure,
irrigation water pricing, cropping patterns (production/yields by crop), farm
gate prices, production costs, water costs, and socioeconomic characteristics
of landholdings (size of farm, type of farms, type of landholding, and so on).
   The current study focused on assessing the financial costs of providing
operation and maintenance. It supplemented this methodology with a farm
budget survey in which about 230 farms3 were surveyed about their cropping
patterns, revenue and cost flows, water availability, and consumption to deter-
mine how farmers would react to changes in irrigation water prices.
   Most of the financial cost analysis is based on a public expenditure review
of the JVA to determine its minimum financial needs—under improved levels
of efficiency—to keep on providing water to farmers in the Jordan Valley
(Sommaripa 2011). Budget estimates and disaggregated actual expenditures
are recorded for the period covering 2004 to 2012, with specific focus on 2008
and beyond. Although data before 2008 are available, the format in which
these data are available makes them difficult to compare with data after 2008,
when the JVA accounting systems were upgraded.
   The data collection process raised a number of methodological issues that
were dealt with as carefully as possible. First, data availability and quality dic-
tate the type of analysis of budget allocation and expenditure to be conducted.
Second, special attention was given to ensuring that expenses were analyzed
and classified according to their economic use either as capital or current
expenditure (box 1.1).
   The budget lines were individually examined and assigned to the correct
capital or current expenditure category. As a result, it is possible to quantify
the extent to which misclassification of spending across budget categories has

     Box 1.1  Evidence of Misclassification of Expenditures across
     Budget Types
     Jordan has a dual budget system aimed at separating capital expenses, recorded in the develop-
     ment budget, and current expenses, recorded in the recurrent budget. The data collection process
     examined whether individual budget lines were correctly classified according to their economic
     nature into capital versus current spending, regardless of whether the budget line belonged orig-
     inally to either budget.

     A line-by-line review of the budget reveals that recurrent expenditures constitute a significant
     part of the development expenditure. This misclassification is a result of the sector responding
     to incentives created by less flexible criteria for allocating discretionary shares of the recurrent
     budget than for shares of the development budget.

     Incremental budgeting did not allow for significant changes in the cost structure of the JVA to
     be reflected in the budget, which especially became a problem after 2008, when the accounting
     systems were upgraded. In the JVA budget, recurrent expenditure amounting to about JD 8.8
     million was misclassified in the 2011 budget expenditure as development expenditure against a
     total expenditure of JD 21.9 million. Since then, the misclassification of recurrent expenditure has
     decreased, as has development expenditure.




been taking place (see box 1.1). It has become evident that nowadays, devel-
opment budgets are not always a good proxy for investment, and the func-
tional separation between current and capital spending is increasingly fuzzy.
This reinforces the temptation to postpone maintenance of existing assets and
to delay allocation of resources of ongoing projects, a situation that makes
monitoring of the quality of spending difficult.

Institutional Framework of the
Irrigation Water Sector in the
Jordan Valley
The Jordan Valley Authority (JVA) was established in 1973 as the Jordan
Valley Commission, but was given its current name in 1977. The area of the
JVA’s responsibilities extends from the Yarmouk River in the North to
the Red Sea in the South. The eastern extension of the area is limited by a
300-meter contour line north of the Dead Sea and a 500-meter contour line
south of the Dead Sea. The King Abdullah Canal serves as the backbone
of the JVA water distribution system north of the Dead Sea irrigating farm
units.
   The JVA is a governmental organization responsible for the social and eco-
nomic development of the Jordan River Valley, including the development,
use, protection, and conservation of water resources, and supports the infra-
structure in the Jordan Valley. Its core activities are in land and water resources
development.
   The JVA’s obligations are established in the Jordan Valley Development
Law of 1988 and the 2001 amendments. Article 3 of the law includes respon-
sibilities,1 which focus on the development of water resources in the Jordan
Valley, and on their use for farm irrigation; domestic, municipal, and indus-
try use; generation of hydroelectric power; and other beneficial uses. Also
included is the protection and conservation of these resources and the imple-
mentation of all works related to the development, use, protection, and con-
servation thereof, including among others:
••   Planning, design, construction, and the operation and maintenance of
     irrigation projects and related structures, conveyance and distribution
     networks, surface and subsurface drainage works, flood protection works,
     and roads and buildings for;
••   Soil surveys and classification, identification, and reclamation of lands for
     use in irrigated agriculture, and land division into farm units;
••   Development and improvement of environmental and living conditions
     in the Jordan Valley;
••   Implementation of related works, including:
     •• Setting rules and regulations for land on which construction of
          ­
          buildings is permitted, setback lines, rights of way, outside towns,
          and villages borders;
     •• Land development for residential, industrial, agricultural, and other
          uses;
     •• Planning, design, and construction of farm roads;



The Cost of Irrigation Water in the Jordan Valley	                               5
     •• Social development of the Jordan Valley, which includes the
        involvement of private agencies to help achieve development
        ­
        objectives; and
     •• Additional development activities as requested by the Jordanian
        Cabinet.
   Jordan’s 2009 strategy, “Water for Life,” proposed a new structure for the
delivery of irrigation water. Delivery of bulk water irrigation would be man-
aged by one organization, whereas the retail distribution of agricultural water
would be managed by water user associations (WUAs). In the long term, the
proposed bulk water provider in the Jordan Valley would focus on the regula-
tion and supervision of bulk irrigation water services. Involvement of stake-
holders and the private sector in irrigation management would be introduced
and gradually promoted. It is foreseen that with these changes in the institu-
tional structure, appropriate water tariffs and incentives would be introduced
to promote water efficiency in irrigation, and ensure higher economic returns
for irrigated agricultural products. Yet, progress towards moving to a bulk
supplier has been very modest. By 2013, there were 20 registered water user
associations (compared to 18 in 2009). By that same year, the JVA had trans-
ferred the distribution of irrigation water to 16 of these registered WUAs,
covering 44 percent of the irrigated area in the Jordan Valley.

Water Balance in the Jordan
Valley
Introduction
The Jordan River Valley (JRV) drains an area of about 18,300 square ­kilometers
on both sides of the Jordan River. Within Jordan, it drains an area of about
7,627 square kilometers. The JRV basin is divided into five major subbasins:
Upper Jordan, Yarmouk River, Lower Jordan, East Dead Sea, and the South
Dead Sea. The available resources in the Valley are ground and surface water
resources in addition to treated effluent from the treatment plants to the
Valley or discharging to wadis.
   Upper Jordan River Subbasin. The Hasbani, Banyas, and Lidan Rivers are
the main tributaries of this subbasin, which drains into Lake Tiberias. Other
sources are minor springs and seasonal flow. The total contribution of this
subbasin is 660 million cubic meters per year. The evaporation rate from the
lake is about 270 million cubic meters per year.
   Yarmouk River Subbasin. This subbasin is the biggest contributor to the
Jordan River flow. Historically, the annual discharge to the Jordan River was
about 600 million cubic meters per year. Measurements show that the flow of
the river has declined over the last decade. The annual discharge of the
Yarmouk River (base and winter flow) to the Jordan River is about 200 million
cubic meters. The flow diverted to the King Abdullah Canal and Unity Dam
has declined over the last decade from 108 million cubic meters in 1995 to
about 25 million cubic meters in 2011.
   Lower Jordan Subbasin. The main tributaries to the Lower Jordan River
Subbasin are the Zarqa River (the largest tributary) and the Wadis Al Arab,
Ziglab, Jurum, Yabis, Kufranja, Rajib, Shuieb, Kafreen, and Hisban. The vol-
ume of water from this subbasin amounted to 116 million cubic meters per
year in 2010. This includes the base flows and runoffs and treated effluent
from the As Samra and Irbid treatment plants.
   East Dead Sea Subbasin. Several wadis contribute to the flow in this subba-
sin; the major wadis are Wadi Mujib and Wadi Wala, but their overall contri-
bution is very small.
   Total available water resources in the Jordan Valley have declined in the last
decades due to the construction of dams and other diversions mainly for agri-
cultural use. The available resources in the Jordan Valley are shown in
table 3.1. The contribution from surface water (Yarmouk River) varies from
year to year due to infrastructure development in Syria. Currently, water vol-
umes from surface water sources are between 25 percent and 40 percent of the
1992 contribution. The contribution of side wadis varies based on rainfall
intensity and storage capacity of the dams. The use of treated effluent has
increased significantly in recent years.

                         Table 3.2 reflects how water inflows are used. The water available for
                      irrigation purposes is affected by the diversion of scarce water resources
                      ­
                      for drinking water purposes. An increasing part of the water inflows is used
                      for drinking and irrigation.
                         In addition to these inflows, wastewater is also being reused. In 2011, this
                      treated wastewater flow amounted to 110 million cubic meters, of which JVA
                      estimated 75 percent was being used by farmers in the Jordan Valley (equiva-
                      lent to 83 million cubic meters per year).
                         Hence, with an average freshwater flow of 124 million cubic meters in 2011
                      and an average flow of reused wastewater of about 83 million cubic meters,
                      the available flow for irrigation is estimated at 207 million cubic meters. The
                      flow of reused wastewater becoming available to Jordan Valley farmers is
                      increasing as part of the policy of the government to extend wastewater col-
                      lection and treatment, while planning to reuse these wastewater flows in agri-
                      culture and industry.



                      Water Scarcity in the Jordan Valley
                      The farmer survey conducted between December 2011 and January 2012
                      looked into farmers’ perspectives regarding water scarcity. Farmers facing
                      water scarcity have been defined as those who stated that “access to water for
                      crops” was the most important problem that the government should solve. This
                      amounts to 100 farmers (42 percent of the sample of 236 farmers i

Northern Ghors (71 percent), Karamah (47 percent), or Middle Ghors
    percent). Farmers from the Southern Ghors did not perceive water scarcity
(38 ­
as the most important issue to tackle. Seventy-one percent of the surveyed
farmers living in the Northern Ghors face an acute problem of water scarcity,
unlike the majority of surveyed farmers in the other three regions (table 3.3).
   Among those farmers facing water scarcity, 48 percent are family farms and
52 percent are entrepreneurial farms (the proportions in the full sample were
41 percent and 59 percent, respectively). Table 3.4 shows that 82 percent of
the surveyed farmers growing banana and 76 percent of the surveyed farmers
growing citrus crops face major water shortages. Yet, less than one-third of
the surveyed farmers growing vegetables confirmed facing major water scar-
city issues.
   In general, farmers relying on wells do not face major water shortages.
Farmers facing water scarcity issues often combine sources, while 36 percent
of the surveyed farmers who rely solely on the King Abdullah Canal face
water scarcity (table 3.5).
   Half of the surveyed farmers using open field techniques reported facing
major water scarcity, which is consistent with the previous finding that farm-
ers growing citrus and banana suffer the most from water shortages. A large
majority of the surveyed farmers using plastic houses or plastic tunnels con-
firmed not facing acute water scarcity (table 3.6).

   The majority of farmers using surface irrigation or localized tubes (as
their main irrigation method) reported water scarcity as an issue, while only
one-third of surveyed farmers using drip irrigation technologies did so
(table 3.7).
   Farms facing major water scarcity problems are, on average, smaller (46
dunum) than farms that do not (74 dunum). Farmers with major water scar-
city issues irrigate a larger proportion of their land (91 percent), on average,
than the farmers who do not (81 percent). Farmers dealing with water scar-
city problems are more likely to use open field methods (either exclusively or
in combination with other methods) and are less likely to use drip irrigation
(either exclusively or in combination with other irrigation techniques).
Finally, farmers facing acute water shortages are more likely to grow citrus
and banana and less likely to grow vegetables (table 3.8). As a result, farmers
who complain about water scarcity issues tend to use less water per dunum
than those who do not. Interestingly, even though they have access to less
water per dunum, their net crop revenue per dunum is not statistically signifi-
cant different from other farmers.

12	                                              The Cost of Irrigation Water in the Jordan Valley
                      Farmers facing water quality issues have been defined as those who stated
                    that “water quality” was the most important environmental problem that the
                    government should solve. This amounts to 26 farmers overall (equivalent to
                    11 percent of the sample). Among the farmers reporting water quality issues,
                    73 percent live in the Middle Ghors region, 23 percent live in Karamah, and
                    only 1 percent lives in the Southern Ghors. None of the farmers living in the
                    Northern Ghors experience major water quality problems. Among those
                    farmers reporting water quality problems, 81 percent are entrepreneurial
                    farms. They tend to grow vegetables. Among the 26 farmers facing water
                    quality issues, 73 percent rely on springs as their main source of irrigation
                    water and about 19 percent rely on recycled water. Among the farmers facing
                    major water quality issues, 50 percent use open field as the main farming
                    method and 38 percent use plastic houses, whereas almost all of these farmers
                    use drip irrigation technologies. Farmers who complain about water quality
                    have lower per dunum crop revenues than farmers who do not.
                      Table 3.9 shows some average (and median) characteristics for farmers fac-
                    ing major water quality problems and farmers not facing major water quality
                    problems, along with the significance of the corresponding mean test. Farmers
                    facing major water quality problems are wealthier, on average, and have
                    higher expenditure and gross and net revenues (in total and on a per dunum
                    basis). These farmers are also less likely to use open field methods.

Conclusions
The profiles of farmers who face water scarcity are distinct. Farmers who
complain about lack of access to water tend to be located in the northern part
of the Jordan Valley. Their cropping pattern is more likely to be dominated by
the production of citrus and banana, which are be water-intensive crops.
Farmers who face water scarcity also tend to be more dependent on open field
farming methods and less likely to use drip irrigation methods. Water quality
issues are less prominent in the responses of the surveyed farmers and were
mostly brought up by farmers in the Middle Ghors. Farmers facing water
quality issues are more likely to grow vegetables that are usually farmed under
greenhouse conditions. They also have invested in drip irrigation methods to
use water more efficiently.

Irrigated Agriculture in the
Jordan Valley
Introduction
Development of irrigated agriculture started toward the end of the 1950s
around the side wadis of the Jordan Valley. With the construction of the East
Ghor Canal, later named the King Abdullah Canal, which diverted water
from the Yarmouk River to the Jordan Valley, intensive irrigation became
possible. The King Abdullah Canal, running along the East Bank of the Jordan
Valley, constitutes the backbone of the Jordan Valley hydraulic scheme. The
canal was extended three times to over 110 kilometers. In the past five decades,
10 dams have been constructed with a combined storage capacity of around
322 million cubic meters. The main reservoir is the King Talal Dam on the
Zarqa River, with a total capacity of 80 million cubic meters.1 Irrigation
schemes in the Jordan Valley have been constructed, rehabilitated, operated,
and maintained by the government.
   Agriculture is the main water user in the Jordan Valley, with an average
design consumption of 220 million cubic meters per year. A series of irriga-
tion projects have been implemented over the years (see table 4.1) to serve a
command area of about 360,000 dunum,2 organized around 10,000 farm units
(of 35 to 40 dunum each).
   In 2010, agricultural land in the Jordan Valley made up about 13 percent of
the total agricultural land in use in the country. Yet, unlike the rest of Jordan,
the Jordan Valley almost exclusively depends on irrigated water to grow its
crops. Its cropping pattern is quite distinct from that of the Highlands, with
vegetables being the most important crop (table 4.2).
   Since the 1990s, surface irrigation channels have been converted
into  pressurized piped systems to raise irrigation efficiency. At present,
surface irrigation in the Jordan Valley is virtually nonexistent, although
capital-poor farmers practice a hybrid form of surface and localized
irrigation.
   Despite major investment efforts, overall system efficiency is still a major
challenge because of increasing water scarcity and competing uses of
water  resources. Actual water consumption is only 45 percent of design
­
consumption. Water is allocated through a crop-based water quota system.
Five crop planting categories are acknowledged by the JVA: vegetables,
citrus trees, banana, cereals and grains, and others (fruit trees). However,
­
only three planting categories (vegetables, citrus trees, and banana) are
used for allocating farm water quotas. From the 1960s and throughout the
1980s, quotas (see table 4.3 for the quota schedule) were related to actual
crop water requirements. With the emergence of water scarcity, the JVA

froze the ­existing cropping patterns in the Jordan Valley and decided to
grant “vegetable allowances” to all areas not covered by orchards at the
time. The aim was to avoid further area expansion of citrus and banana,
since they are crops with high water requirements.3 Before 1999, the annual
values of official water allocations (November to April) totaled 4,800, 9,500,
and 17,200 cubic meters per hectare for vegetables, citrus trees, and banana,
respectively. Prolonged drought years have imposed adjustments to quotas
that are still valid today: 3,600, 7,500, and 12,550 cubic meters per hectare
for the same crops, respectively.



Agricultural Transformation in the Jordan Valley
In the last 15 years, major changes have occurred in the Valley. Water scarcity,
as discussed in Chapter 4, resulted in smaller water quota allocations. Farmers
have reacted to this by expanding their cropping area and increasing crop
productivity.
   Between 1994 and 2010, the area under cultivation in the Jordan Valley
grew significantly, at 22 percent. The expansion was especially pronounced for
tree and vegetable crops. During the same period, the area under cultivation
for field crops declined significantly, as can be seen in table 4.4. Concurrently,
the sector has become more productive as measured by increases in average
yield per dunum. The production volume per dunum almost doubled, driven
by increases in productivity in field and vegetable crops. Tree crop productiv-
ity declined over the same period.
   Vegetables. The most important crops planted in the Jordan Valley are
tomato, eggplant, cucumber, potato, and squash. The area planted increased
by 29 percent over the last 15 years. At the same time, average yields
increased by 145 percent over the same period, from 1.86 metric tons per
dunum to 4.75 metric tons in 2010. Expansion beyond 200,000 dunum
appears unlikely and would be achievable only to a limited extent and only
if market or policy shocks occur to other crops (for example, removal of
banana import tariffs).
   The expansion of vegetable production is mainly the result of large
on-farm investments and the commercialization of agriculture in the

Jordan Valley. Most of the productivity increases occurred before 2000
(table 4.5). The sector has become increasingly less diversified. The five main
crops constituted 62 percent of the cropped area in 1994. In 2010, the con-
tribution of these major crops increased to 68 percent. In total production
volumes, this specialization is even more striking. The five major crops made
up 70 percent of vegetable crop production in 1994, but no less than 80 per-
cent in 2010.
   Field crops. The most important field crops are maize, wheat, barley, and
clover. Although the crop area declined between 1994 and 2010, productivity
increased from 0.42 metric tons per dunum in 1994 to 1.39 metric tons in
2010. In 1994, wheat and barley constituted 83 percent of the total cereal crop
area in the Jordan Valley, but in 2010, the share of these two crops declined to
43 percent, with increasing importance of maize and clover. Productivity for
barley and wheat hardly changed between 1994 and 2010, but that of maize
and clover did (table 4.6).
   Fruit tree crops. The development of fruit tree crops presents a complex
picture. Despite the government’s efforts to freeze the existing cropping pat-
terns in the Jordan Valley, further area expansion of citrus and banana—crops
that have higher water requirements4—occurred between 1994 and 2010
(table 4.7). Most of the increase in area expansion took place before 2000. This
expansion is linked to a waiver that was introduced in 2004 to legalize citrus
orchards that were planted between 1991 and 2001. Trends of citrus produc-
tion reflect farmers’ coping strategies through changes in orchard specializa-
tion (that is, species conversion from clementine and mandarin cultivars to
lemon and oranges).

   The area planted with banana crops expanded rapidly between 1994 and
2000, declined during 2000–07, and expanded after 2007. At the same time,
the areas used for more traditional tree crops, such as grapes, olives, dates,
and figs, increased (see figure 4.4).
   Productivity increases vary widely among types of crops. Citrus produc-
tion, despite the increase in area planted with citrus trees, declined rapidly
between 1994 and 2010, with average yields in 2010 only about 65 percent of
those in 1994. Farmers responded to stem the production losses by intensify-
ing production through increasing the number of trees per dunum. Banana
crops show a different pattern. Crop area increased, but so did production
and average yield, with almost all the crop area expansion taking place
between 1994 and 2000 and all productivity growth after 2000. As for tradi-
tional crops, like dates, most of the growth in production has been linked to
area expansion, with limited increases in average yields.
   Major on-farm investments have been made in the past to cope with
reduced irrigation water availability and reliability, while maintaining or
increasing production. To date, almost all farms have adopted some sort of
localized irrigation technology. Even those farmers who are considering using
surface irrigation (on citrus orchards) have in reality adopted a piped system
to irrigate individual trees. The majority of farmers have constructed standby
ponds to collect and store water when it is distributed by the JVA at farm
turnouts to better regulate farm irrigation scheduling. A number of farmers
use groundwater to expand their water quotas. Yet, few farmers have been
able to improve water quality where this has become a major issue (particu-
larly in the middle and southern part of the Jordan Valley, which receives
water from the King Talal Dam).
   Another development that has had an impact on the Jordan Valley are
land  market transactions. Venot, Molle, and Hassan (2007) cite an esti-
mated land rent of US$570 per hectare per year. In discussions with farm-
ers in 2012, land rental values of about JD 143 per dunum per year (which
translates to JD 1,430 per hectare per year, equivalent to US$2,043 per
hectare per year) were registered. A 2012 farmer survey even registered
values approaching JD 4,000 per hectare per year (equivalent to more than
US$5,700). The increase in rental values has resulted in an increase in land
transactions—especially in farms classified as entrepreneurial farms—with
20 percent of the surveyed farmers mentioning a change in ownership or

 rental status in the five years before the survey. These transactions have
 also resulted in a consolidation of farms. Although 80 percent of the farms
 surveyed mentioned they consisted of one farm unit of 35 to 40 dunum,
 20 percent of the farms consist of more than one farm unit, while the aver-
 age farm size increased to slightly over 60 dunum, suggesting that the agri-
 cultural sector in the Jordan Valley is consolidating, with fewer but larger
 farms.
   According to Venot, Molle, and Hassan (2007), 87 percent of farm man-
 agers farmed 51 percent of the total area in the Jordan Valley. In the 2012
 farmer survey, non-owners made up 53 percent of the farm managers
 farming 45 percent of the total farm area. This suggests that agriculture in
 the Jordan Valley is becoming increasingly entrepreneurial. Facing
 increased water scarcity and country-specific market problems, only farm-
 ers with sufficient investment capacity are able to stay profitable in the
 Jordan Valley.



 Current Production Systems and Cropping
 Patterns in the Jordan Valley
 Eight broad farm-type systems prevail in the Jordan Valley. Based on ongoing
 research and survey data5 and as compared to actual cropping pattern infor-
 mation (Department of Statistics), their distribution is shown in table 4.8.
   As shown in table 4.9, 4.10 and figure 4.2, about 342,000 dunum were
 cultivated in the Jordan Valley in 2012, with an irrigation intensity of
 ­
 99 percent.

  The geographic distribution of the Jordan Valley cropping pattern is
depicted in figure 4.3. North Shuna (Northern Directorate) covers about
117,000 dunum of planted area. In this area, citrus is the main crop. The Dair
Alla (Middle Directorate) crop area stands at about 76,000 dunum. The crop
area in Southern Shuna (Karamah) is 66,000 dunum and in Ghor Essafi
(Southern Ghors) 48,000 dunum. In Dair Alla (Middle Directorate), the
Southern Shuna (Karamah), and Ghor Essafi (Southern Ghors), vegetables
are the most important crops. Southern Shuna accounts for 70 percent of the
banana cropping area.



Crop and Farm Economics in the Jordan Valley
Crop and farm budgets have been analyzed by computing elements of the
most representative crops and production systems in the Jordan Valley. With
regard to production costs, the following main assumptions have been used:
(a) Land rental cost has been generalized (as an opportunity cost) to all pro-
duction systems, given that it prevails everywhere in the Valley. (b) Permanent
labor is overwhelming compared to seasonal work, and it has been universal-
ized in most cases. (c) Management input by owner or tenant is significant
and is computed everywhere. (d) Investment cost depreciation is calculated
on actual wear and tear, as discussed with farmers (and not by using technical
proxies). (e) No taxes are applicable.
   Yield outputs are derived using surveys based on discussions with primary
informants and were cross-checked with relevant secondary and other pro-
fessional sources (such as the Ministry of Agriculture, the National Center for

                                        The Cost of Irrigation Water in the Jordan Valley	                                                                         23
Agricultural Research and Extension, the Agriculture Credit Corporation,
and the private sector). Output farm gate prices are also derived from surveys
of multiple primary informants. Sensitivity simulations have been attempted
by using the Department of Statistics’ average 2010 prices and by referring to
free-on-board (FOB) prices,6 deducting marketing costs,7 or by considering
whichever best price is obtainable by the producers.
   At current prevailing price levels, few production systems generate positive
net returns. Only banana, melon grown under greenhouse conditions, and
dates produce net benefits (see table 4.11). Open field potatoes and drip irri-
gated citrus also provide positive benefits.
   To determine returns to investment and farmland, Jordan Valley producers
need to pursue best possible farm gate prices, which are achievable only by
trading either in export conditions (for instance, to European markets) or in
special cases, even in the Amman fresh fruit market (for example, melon), or
else by targeting high-value produce (for example, Medjool dates).



Main Issues Farmers in the Jordan Valley
Are Facing
Based on discussions with farmers and private sector farm representatives in
the Jordan Valley, four outstanding issues have emerged, which may rank dif-
ferently depending on the location and the farming category.
   Irrigation water. About 42 percent of the farmers interviewed reported
access to water for crops as the most important issue to tackle.
   In the northern part of the Valley, it is mainly a question of water quantity
and reliability. Water quality is acknowledged as good, at least for the time
being.8 As evident from JVA consumption data, water is distributed to farm-
ers below quota allocations. Even farmers who have made major investments
to improve their irrigation system efficiency (drip irrigation and farm reser-
voirs) confirmed that they were unable to satisfy the crops’ water require-
ments. Farmers with higher capital resources use groundwater to integrate
irrigation scheduling. However, groundwater is in most cases brackish,
requiring further investment for desalinization purposes.
   In the middle of the Valley and in Southern Shuna (Karamah Directorate),
which is served by the King Talal Dam water, farmers not only mention
water quantity as an issue, but also water quality. Insufficient water quantity
and poor water quality are reported to be affecting cropping pattern choices
and yields. They also impose higher maintenance costs to the irrigation
systems.
   In the Southern Ghors, distributed water quality is not considered an
issue; yet, because of insufficient quantity, farmers now increasingly inte-
grate their irrigation requirements with groundwater, depending on avail-
ability of resources, which is often of lower quality. Where farmers experience
salinity problems, these have been compounded in recent years as a result of
reduced water availability and consequent insufficient (or lack of) leaching
irrigation.

   Farmers in the Jordan Valley generally do not complain about water prices,
which are perceived as the least of their production costs. The majority of
interviewed farmers stated a willingness to pay higher prices, provided that
adequate and reliable water quantity and quality are guaranteed.
   Labor and management. Less than 10 percent of the labor requirements
are provided by the Jordanian workforce. Trustworthy functions are del-
egated to Jordanian workers (for example, supervision, mechanical opera-
tions, plant protection, seedlings production, and asset maintenance),
including females (for example, produce grading, handling, and ­    packaging).
Migrant labor is very important in the Jordan Valley. There are no major
wage differentials between Jordanian and migrant workers, but recently,
migrant workers have been increasingly moving to other sectors (civil
works) that offer better salaries. The situation is perceived as critical by
almost all farmers, and the labor crunch is a reality in many areas of the
Valley. As a result, at the time of the survey in 2012, the cost of labor was
reported to be rising significantly.9 During the past three or four decades, a
number of migrant workers, attracted by labor opportunities, have settled
in these areas. Over time, many have evolved into farm tenants, who use
family labor.10 Some have also engaged in related efficient agribusinesses
and service provision activities. These farmers have become an important
economic segment in the Jordan Valley.
   Finally, farm management has a differentiated pattern in the Jordan Valley.
Broadly speaking, the current pattern appears to be evolving as follows:
management through professional but aging executives in the northern part
of the Valley, foreigner operated in the middle part of the Valley, and quali-
fied younger operators in the southern part of the Valley. A matter for con-
cern is the perspective in the north that market and economic prospects
might not attract a rapid generational shift there. Sustained negative trends
may also persuade other operators to gradually withdraw from the Valley
and eventually also extinguish the enthusiasm of the young professionals in
the south.
   Country-specific market problems. Marketing-related issues are men-
tioned by 38 percent of farmers as their most pressing problem (see also
Nachbaur 2004). Farmers mention issues with access to marketing (25 ­percent
of the farmers), sale price of agricultural products (11 percent), and export
regulations (2 percent) as impediments, while availability of labor, access to
credit, and cost of agricultural inputs are also mentioned. The Jordan Valley is
considered the main agribusiness hub of the country. The domestic market
undoubtedly has its own importance and relevance. However, due to the nat-
ural agroecological comparative advantages posed by this “natural ­greenhouse”
to produce off-season or time-of-year anticipated fruit and vegetable produce
for the European market, export trade constitutes the prime opportunity for
the Valley’s output.
   This opportunity is constrained by the geopolitical shocks to which the
country and the region are regularly subjected. Border transit restrictions,
which occasionally occur11 at the time when markets are more advantageous,
have dramatic consequences on the produce, which is perishable, subject to

26	                               The Cost of Irrigation Water in the Jordan Valley
significantly higher transportation costs, or otherwise subject to lower prices
by traders and domestic markets. Alternative routes to Europe and Russia or
the Commonwealth of Independent States markets could be sought, which
are, however, not always in the reach and capacity of all producers and traders
operating in the Valley.
   Finance for technology. Farmers in the Valley have made important prog-
ress in adopting technology, particularly during the last decade. This has
resulted in conversion from gravity or surface irrigation to localized or drip
irrigation, improved irrigation scheduling by including on-farm water reser-
voirs, increased cropped area under plastic houses, adoption of quality seeds
and seedlings of higher-yielding varieties, cultivar changes based on actual
market demand, and improved plant nutrient management. The farmer sur-
vey revealed that 81 percent of the respondents use drip irrigation, another
5  percent use some other form of localized tube irrigation, and another
  percent use surface irrigation. In the Middle and South of the Jordan Valley
8 ­
and the Southern Ghors, drip irrigation is almost universal. Yet, in the
Northern Ghors only 51 percent of farmers use drip irrigation, 31 percent
depend on sprinkler irrigation, and another 14 percent use some form of
localized tubes to irrigate their plots.
   About 70 percent of the farmer respondents practice open field farming
methods. However, the importance of greenhouses (plastic tunnels and plas-
tic houses) has increased rapidly. Currently, 15 percent of survey respondents
reported growing their crops in greenhouses, and another 14 percent use a
combination of open field farming and greenhouses. Greenhouses are mostly
concentrated in the Middle Directorate to grow vegetables.
   Growing vegetable and fruit crops on a large scale is a major undertak-
ing that requires continuous upgrading and innovation. The producers
who have a profitable economic future in the Jordan Valley are only those
who have the investment capacity to fully upgrade the efficiency of o  ­ n-farm
irrigation ­systems by extending production under high-tech greenhouse
conditions, adopting climate-smart and sustainable agriculture technolo-
gies and methodologies, producing crops of high market value, and
increasing the ­marketing value of their produce. Yet, to be able to make the
necessary investments, farmers will need to have access to convenient
terms of credit so they will be able to achieve the needed investment
upgrades.



Crop Water Productivity
Water productivity is defined in different ways. We have used a simple and
relatively rough definition that measures crop production (in monetary
terms) against the gross inflow of water. Water productivity as measured in
table 4.12 is only an approximation, since water use is based on water quota
allocation in the Jordan Valley. Since it is known that the water available is less
than that of the quota allocation, actual water crop productivity is higher than
presented in table 4.12. However, since insufficient disaggregated data relate

crop production volumes and values with water consumption, it is difficult to
achieve a higher level of precision than the level reflected in the table.
   As shown in table 4.12, crop water productivity (in monetary terms) is
highly dependent on crop prices. The expected relationships have been con-
firmed for the Jordan Valley. Drip irrigation tends to be associated with higher
crop water productivity than surface water irrigation. In addition, the use of
greenhouses tends to also be associated with higher crop water productivity
than the use of open field farming techniques. The table also shows that crop
prices have a big influence on water crop productivity.



Conclusions
To ensure a sustainable economic future for the Jordan Valley, a number of
actions need to be taken, including the following:
••    Ensuring the long-term certainty of the availability and good quality of
      irrigation water
••    Pursuing high productivity through precision agronomic technologies
••    Maximizing production of export vegetables grown under high-tech
      greenhouses (computerized with temperature or humidity control sys-
      tems over 25 percent of the current vegetable area, or about 50,000
      dunum)
••    Optimizing citrus orchards (in the north) by gradually diversifying (over
      50 percent of the current citrus area, or about 30,000 dunum) with other
      high-value fruit trees, including table grapes
••    Expanding date palm area (with Medjool dates variety) to the extent pos-
      sible (doubling the current date palm area to 20,000 dunum), and reduc-
      ing the banana area
••    Improving overall marketing and value-adding capacity.

   If the Jordan Valley Authority does not succeed in ensuring the long-term
quantity and quality or water, it will have to rely more on quota allocation and
reduce overall crop area based on actual water availability, and/or reduce the
length of the cropping season (until April) to enhance market opportunities
for off-season produce.
   These proposed actions would require considerable investment in the
Jordan Valley. The Food and Agriculture Organization estimated the invest-
ment requirement to be about US$1.5 billion (excluding the investment
related to the off-farm irrigation system). Special policy attention to agricul-
ture of the Valley is needed, with an immediate focus on labor and migration
matters, ad-hoc intergovernmental trade agreements, and area-specific
engagements with donors and international financial institutions to source
required funding, and toward the concrete facilitation of credit opportunities
to farmers. Eventually, the government should consider removing any resid-
ual trade barriers. Furthermore, public sector responsibilities and a related
investment in improved irrigation water management and distribution to
guarantee farmers long-term security on a set amount of good quality water.
   Finally, sector service providers (for example, the National Center for
Agricultural Research and Extension) would need to concentrate their
research and development efforts on effectively addressing the major
issues producers are concerned about. The establishment of a modern and
efficient market information system (through, for example, an empow-
ered Jordan Exporters and Producers Association for Fruits and Vegetables)
to guide producers’ planting and marketing strategies may also be
warranted.

Jordan Valley Authority’s
Current Revenues
Introduction
The Jordan Valley Authority (JVA) derives revenues from four different
sources: land and housing revenues, water charges, other operating revenues,
and non-operating revenues. Land and housing revenues consist mainly of
rent and sales of land that has been developed, recovered, or improved by the
JVA. The revenues consist of user charges for land plots for domestic,
­
industrial, commercial, or agricultural uses. The rental and lease revenues
come from farm units, housing units, and leases to investors
   Farm units. The JVA divides the irrigable lands into farm units of between
30 and 40 dunum1 (that is, 3 to 4 hectare). When renting these units, the
contract stipulates that they must be used for agricultural purposes only. The
­
lease value ranges from JD 30 to JD 40 JD per hectare per year. A total of
360,000 dunum (about 36,000 ha) has been developed and distributed to
farmers, to irrigate around 10,000 farm units.
   Housing units. The JVA allocates, develops, and improves some land for
housing purposes when such lands are not allocated for faming units. The
allocation follows the land use plans approved by the board of the JVA.
   Lease to investors. Investors lease the land where a project is implemented.
The investor is entitled to purchase the land, and the value of the lease is
deducted from the price of such land.



Water Revenues
Water revenues consist of the sale of raw water for irrigation and industrial
use in the Jordan Valley. Along the Valley, the JVA has four management cen-
ters in the Northern, Middle, Karamah, and Southern Ghors Directorates.
Each center is in charge of billing and collecting user charges. The water busi-
ness consists of distributing raw water for irrigation in all directorates and for
irrigation and industrial use in the Southern Ghors.
   The data on revenues from the different sources in the JVA vary signifi-
cantly. The major sources of data are the Finance Department and the Control
Center in Deir Allah. The data from the two sources differ widely, with the
Finance Department data being consistently higher than the data reported by
the Control Center since 2004.
   The different sources of revenues are as follows as summarized in figure 5.1:
   Irrigation water tariff. The tariff was established in 1994 and has remained
constant since. It is based on an increasing block rate where consumption
varies from 8 to 35 fils (cents) per cubic meter (table 5.1). The inflation rate

from 1994 to 2011 was 81 percent,2 which means that today’s tariffs are about
half the 1994 price.
   Water charges for industrial use. The JVA charge for industrial use is JD 1.25
per cubic meter since 2011.
   Energy cost of pumping water from the North Conveyor. In January 2011, the
JVA started to charge the Water Authority of Jordan a cost equivalent to the
energy cost of pumping water from the North Conveyor. The water is elevated
1,000 meters to the water treatment plant of Zei, which is operated by
Miyahuna. About 50 million cubic meters of water is pumped per year. This
cost is refunded by the Water Authority of Jordan to the JVA, and started to
enter the books in 2011.
   In addition to the above-mentioned main categories, the JVA also generates
revenues from other operating and non-operating revenues.
   Other operating revenues. This consists of bids, which result from the
works to be awarded to private investors, and stamps, for all legal docu-
ments signed with the JVA, such as leases, registrations, water titles, land
titles, and licenses.
   Non-operating revenues. This category consists mainly of fines and pen-
alties for late payments. It also includes the sales of land, which are one-

started to decline. Most of the revenues associated with the Land and
Housing Department followed a downward trend. Table 5.2 shows that
water revenues make up the majority of the JVA revenues.



Water Revenues from Irrigation
Water revenues are based on the water allocation made by the JVA on the
basis of crop-based quotas. The quotas are set according to water availability
and demand patterns. Given that competition for water has increased, the
quota system is reviewed on a regular basis, according to water availability. In
2004, the JVA established new quotas to better match supply of water and
crop water requirements. The current annual quotas correspond to 3,600
cubic meters per hectare for vegetables, 7,650 cubic meters per hectare for
citrus, and 12,550 cubic meters per hectare for banana (as discussed in
Chapter 4).
   Water volume supplied and billed. The information on the volume of
water supplied by the JVA is not consistent across the different data sources.
The information at the pumping stations of the JVA differs from the informa-
tion registered by the directorates, and also from the information obtained in
Deir Allah (where the control center of the Jordan Valley network is located).
The data suggest that water production has been declining since 2005. This is
to be expected, since a larger share of the water supplied by the JVA is being
used for municipal water supply in Amman.
   It is also not clear what portion of the volume of water is actually used by
the farmers. The JVA bills the farmers according to the quota system, which
does not necessarily correspond to the volume of water used because of dif-
ferences in water availability, type of crop cultivated, irrigation system, type of
farm, and degree of intensification of farming, among other reasons. Water
volume billed is registered by the JVA Control Center as 144 million cubic
meters per year in 2010 compared to 129 million cubic meters of water sup-
plied (table 5.3). This suggests that most JVA customers are charged on the
basis of quota allocations instead of actual consumption levels.
   Billing Efficiency. The JVA does not supply bills for its customers, but
rather provides receipts when customers pay their bills. The farmer survey
data show that 18 percent of the farmers interviewed did not respond to this
question, which could suggest that they do not pay for water from the JVA
(either because they do not use the water or because they use it without pay-
ing), or that the respondent does not know the answer (if the respondent is
not the one paying the water bill).
   Collection Efficiency. Ten percent of farmers responded that they did not
receive a receipt from the JVA, which may indicate that they do not pay for
their water, or that the JVA did not provide them with a receipt. Therefore, it
is likely that up to 28 percent of JVA customers do not pay for the water they
consume. The farmers who do not receive receipts are almost solely concen-
trated in the Karamah Directorate, whereas all the respondents in the
Northern and Southern Ghors receive receipts.

                         Based on data from the Finance Department, in 2010, the JVA billed, on
                      average, 11 fils per cubic meter for irrigation water. In 2010, the JVA was only
                      able to collect about 75 percent of the revenues despite the very low tariffs.
                      Collection efficiency has declined in recent years, which may reflect the diffi-
                      cult financial conditions many farmers face.
                         The low efficiency in collecting revenues (table 5.4) may be linked to the
                      fact that JVA revenues are collected and then transferred to the Treasury. This
                      practice is likely to provide few incentives to the JVA to collect revenues. The
                      low tariffs also do not provide many incentives to bill and collect from farm-
                      ers, since the costs of collecting revenues is high relative to the amount
                      collected.
                         One area for further investigation is the water consumption pattern in the
                      Southern Ghors. Even though the JVA Control Center confirms a large
                      amount of water being supplied and billed to the Southern Ghors, almost all
                      farmers in the directorate who were interviewed in the survey reported using
                      groundwater as their main source of water. When farmers pay for the water
                      they actually use instead of the water they are allocated (on the basis of their
                      quota), it is likely that JVA revenues will decline due to both volume and tariff
                      effects. Based on the JVA’s data presented in table 5.3, actual water volume

million cubic meters (see Table 5.5). Hence, billing inefficiencies were
10 ­percent in 2010 compared to the results of the farmer survey (discussed
above) that registered billing inefficiencies of 18 percent in 2012.



Water Revenues from Industry
The JVA currently charges a tariff of JD 1.25 per cubic meter for raw water to
be used by industry. In 2010, the JVA billed industries for 3.8 million cubic
meters, generating a total revenue from industry of JD 2.4 million. With the
introduction of the new tariff in 2011, revenues from industry increased sig-
nificantly to more than JD 6.3 million in 2012. This sharp increase has resulted
in the share of industrial revenues increasing from 45 percent in 2010 to
65 percent in 2012.
   Since 2011, the JVA has charged the Water Authority of Jordan the electric-
ity cost for pumping water to Amman. This issue will be discussed in more
detail in Chapter 6 on operation and maintenance costs.



Conclusions
The large differences in revenue information generated by the different
departments in the JVA (the Finance Department, the JVA Control Center,
and the four directorates) make it difficult to accurately determine the
revenue-generating capacity of the JVA. As a result, management has to take
­
decisions on the basis of inadequate and unreliable information.
   Nevertheless, in view of the above analysis, it is clear that the JVA can sig-
nificantly improve its revenue flows. The rapid increase in industrial tariffs
shows that the revenue base can be increased. This increase in revenues will
also require a change in accountability regarding the revenues. Currently, all
revenues are transferred to the Treasury and do not return to JVA. As such,
the incentive for the JVA to bill and collect efficiently and effectively to expand
its revenue base is small.

   The revenues flows can be characterized as follows.
   Industrial water revenues. If one assumes no additional fixed charges to
industry, it is likely that the increase in water tariffs has so far not affected the
consumption of water from the industry, suggesting that water was a critical
input into business expansion and that more efficient use of water (recycling)
and/or substitution is not easy to implement in the short term.
   Irrigation water revenues. In 2010, the JVA collected only about 75 percent
of irrigation revenues. The farmer surveys held in 2012 put the collection effi-
ciency even lower, at 72 percent. Reducing billing and collection efficiencies
could result in a significant increase in revenues.
   Water pumping to Amman. If the JVA provides additional services such as
the pumping of water to Amman, the costs associated with this service should
be charged to those benefiting from the service. By not doing so, the JVA is
essentially cross-subsidizing groups of water users outside the Jordan Valley.
If it is assumed that the costs of pumping water to Amman only requires elec-
tricity (and does not require any other input from the JVA), then by not
charging these costs to the beneficiaries of this pumping, the JVA lost at least
JD 2.0 million in revenues in 2010.
   JVA’s practice of charging customers against quota allocations resulted in
higher revenues than if farmers were charged for their effective use of water.
If the JVA reverted over time to an effective scheme where users pay on the
basis of their meter readings, this would need to be taken into consideration
when designing tariffs, since calculating tariffs that cover operation and
maintenance costs on the basis of quota allocations instead of effective use
will result in different tariff requirements.

Jordan Valley Authority’s
Operation and Maintenance
Costs
Introduction
The information available on operation and maintenance (O&M) costs is for
2004 to 2012 (table 6.1). There is, however, a significant difference between
data originating before and after 2008, when a new accounting system was
introduced. The large increases in O&M costs since 2007 are likely the result
of more complete recordkeeping. The period 2007 and 2008 also coincided
with a spike in food and energy prices that may have adversely affected the
O&M costs through significant increases in staff and energy costs.
   Total operating costs in 2008 were more than double the total operating
costs in 2007. Different cost categories show different trends. Personnel costs
increased by 25 percent. Energy was either completely subsidized before 2008
or was not registered at all, since energy costs increased from only JD 57,000
in 2007 to JD 5.7 million in 2008. The JVA has always required sizable amounts
of energy, given the need to pump water to distribute for irrigation and indus-
trial purposes. Finally, there was a fivefold increase in social security, contri-
butions, and third-party services.
   As a result, the share by cost component has changed significantly over
time. Personnel costs were about 90 percent of total costs before 2008, then
decreased to 53 percent in 2008, and have since crept up to 62 percent in
2012. Energy cost has increased rapidly since 2007 (figure 6.1).
   Data on staff numbers vary widely according to source—actual staff work-
ing in the JVA in 2010 varies from 1,400 to 1,800 depending on the source of
information used.1 For this report, we have used the estimate presented in
table 6.2. The number of employees decreased from about 2,000 in 2009 to
1,591 in 2011, which corresponds to a 19 percent reduction in staff. Staff
numbers in the daily wages category declined by 86 percent between 2009
and 2011. The share of JVA employees with a high school degree increased
from 52 percent to 70 percent between 2009 and 2011. The outflow of highly
qualified staff (defined as those with a college degree) continues; between
2009 and 2011, about 8 percent of college-educated employees left the JVA.
   The budget books of the Ministry of Finance show that escalating O&M
costs are a big issue. The actual current costs (O&M costs) increased from JD
5 million in 2004 to JD 13 million in 2010, with almost all of the increase
occurring after 2008.
   A part of the current costs are ending up in the JVA’s capital cost budgets.
                                                                          ­ udget.
In 2004, 10 percent of the total current costs were hidden in the capital b
By 2011, this share had increased to 40 percent. As a result, the share of capital

investment in the total JVA budget has decreased from 90 percent of total
expenditure in 2004 to only 43 percent in 2012 (table 6.3). This expenditure
pattern is not commonly seen in the water sector elsewhere in the world,
which in general tends to be heavily skewed to capital costs because of the
capital-intensive character of the sector.



Water Operation and Maintenance Costs
To estimate the costs associated with water activities, the operating costs of
the JVA, available from 2004, were broken down in two categories: costs
directly associated with the water business and other costs. The first

40	                                            The Cost of Irrigation Water in the Jordan Valley
category consisted of electricity costs related to operation (excluding
pumping costs), costs from pumping stations, costs related to monitoring
the quality of water, maintenance of irrigation equipment, and personnel
costs related to employees in the directorates and Southern Ghors. The
second category of “other costs” consists of all other costs (such as staff
costs, administrative costs, and maintenance of equipment other than irri-
gation). These costs have been allocated to the provision of irrigation water
services based on the share of irrigation costs as measured by employment
in the total JVA costs.



Staff Costs
Because of the widespread difference in actual staff numbers in the JVA, we
assume that the number of staff was 1,591 in 2011 (according to table 6.2),
with 1,501 permanent staff and 90 temporary contracts.2 The data for 2010
show the following:
••   The Water Section of the JVA makes up 79 percent of the total workforce
     in the JVA.
••   Most of the workforce is linked to the four directorates (North, Middle,
     Karamah, and Southern Valley) and the Dams Directorate. These five
     directorates make up 65 percent of the JVA staff.
••   Highly qualified staff (that is, staff with at least a college degree), make up
     only 15 percent of the total JVA workforce.
••   The shortage of professional staff in the JVA is still an issue; 20 years after
     the 1993 GTZ study, only 11 percent of the employees in the JVA Water
     Section have a college degree. The Dams Directorate is the directorate
     with the highest share of staff with a college degree, at 19 percent, which
     is much lower than in 1993.
   In 2012, staff costs made up about 62 percent of total O&M costs. If salaries
and wages are linked to employment numbers, the average monthly salary of
a JVA employee is about JD 387 per month, compared to a minimum wage in
2012 of JD 190 per month. The relatively low level of these base salaries may
explain the rapid increases in allowances. In 2010, allowances made up
15 percent of total staff costs and are likely a tool to supplement salaries and
wages in the JVA.3



Energy Costs
Pumping costs. Given that energy costs are so important to running the
water business at the JVA, special attention was paid to understanding
consumption patterns and energy tariffs charged to the JVA. Information
was obtained for 2005–07 and 2009–10. The information was provided by
the Finance Department but only for Northern, Middle, and Karamah
Directorates.

The Cost of Irrigation Water in the Jordan Valley	                               41
   The available information for the directorates contains energy c ­ onsumption
and the respective cost for each pumping station in each directorate. These
pumping costs make up 78 percent of the total energy costs in the JVA. The
energy use for pumping in the Valley is about 0.39 kilowatt hours per cubic
meters of water supplied, which is much higher than the energy use provided
in the 1993 GTZ study. It is not clear whether the large difference is the result
of information deficiencies, the result of delayed maintenance, or a combina-
tion of these factors.
   The cost per kilowatt hour of energy differs among the directorates and
varies from JD 0.038 per kilowatt hour in the Northern Directorate to JD
0.061 in the Middle Directorate, with an electricity rate for pumping of about
JD 0.041 per kilowatt hour (see tables 6.4, 6.5, and 6.6).
   Pumping costs to Amman. In recent years, an increasing part of the water
that the JVA supplied is used to supply water to Amman. In 2010, this flow of
water was estimated at 53 million cubic meters. In return, the JVA receives
treated wastewater that is blended and reused, especially in the Middle
Directorate. The costs associated with this water pumping are significant
because the water has to be lifted more than 1,000 m. The JVA values these
pumping costs at the electricity rate of JD 0.041 per cubic meter of water
pumped, similar to the cost of electricity. However, this is only a nominal cost.
If the true energy requirement4 (assuming 100 percent pump efficiency) is

2.8 watts per hour to lift 1 cubic meter of water 1 meter, the actual volume of
energy needed to pump water to Amman was about 150 million kilowatt hour
in 2010. If the JVA pumps the water in stages through pumping stations, the
cost of pumping will be lower; but if pumping efficiency is below 100 percent,
the overall energy requirements will increase.
   To better understand the true cost of pumping water to Amman and hence
be better able to price this service, the JVA should collect information on the
volume of energy consumed to pump water to Amman, and the overhead cost
of pumping water to Amman.



Maintenance Costs
The maintenance costs are highly volatile, suggesting that maintenance acts as
a balancing item in the JVA budget. As a result, maintenance costs vary sig-
nificantly over time (table 6.7). In addition, maintenance costs are low. The
total asset base of the JVA in historical prices amounts to JD 356 million.5 The
average total maintenance costs alone are about JD 1 million (equivalent to
0.3 percent of the asset base), which further reflects that maintenance is seri-
ously underfunded. A rapid assessment of the JVA budget shows that mainte-
nance often ends up in the capital budget and as such is crowding out the
capital investment program of the JVA. The current portion of the capital
expenditures amounted to 26 percent in 2010 (equivalent to close to JD 6
million). This translates to a total maintenance cost that is equivalent to about
JD 7 million—equivalent to about 2 percent of the asset value in historical
prices. Ward (2010) noted that where the opportunity costs of irrigation water
are high (as is the case in the Jordan Valley), investments in irrigation infra-
structure maintenance will perform weakly.

Summary of Operation and Maintenance Costs
Based on staff numbers (including overhead), 92 percent of the staff costs,
utility costs, and maintenance of assets not associated directly with irrigation
are associated with the water business. Energy costs and maintenance costs of
irrigation are fully connected to the water business.

   Table 6.8 shows that the JVA is not able to cover its basic operating costs; its
revenues fall far short despite a large increase in industrial revenues after the
price increase in 2011.
   The lack of cost recovery ensures that the JVA’s dependence on taxpayers is
increasing. The taxpayers’ share in covering the JVA’s operating deficit
increased from 23 percent in 2004 to 76 percent in 2009. Since then, due to
the tariff increases for industrial water users and further cost savings (mainly
due to declines in maintenance costs), the operating deficit declined to 60
percent of O&M costs in 2012. Future taxpayers will also be paying for JVA’s
low levels of cost recovery. Shortfalls in basic maintenance will require addi-
tional replacement and rehabilitation of existing infrastructure in the near
future.
   The JVA currently provides three types of services: water for irrigation,
water for industry, and pumping. Pumping services are not explicitly acknowl-
edged, but they are an important service, with the ensuing costs but no explicit
revenue base. Table 6.9 presents the costs associated with providing all three
services. Yet, as noted, the costs of the JVA are mainly driven by the availabil-
ity of budget funds. In recent years—most notably in 2011 and 2012—certain
cost categories have been reduced significantly (energy costs, maintenance
costs, and other costs). Hence, when presenting the cost allocation, we will

                      the different users is based on current billed volume of water.
                         According to the farmer survey, water use as reported by the JVA is about
                      30 percent higher than water users’ estimations (as measured by meters and
                      flows). If the actual consumed volume is the measure at which rates are being
                      calculated, then the irrigation tariff would be 30 percent higher.

                      The income statement reflects all revenues and costs (including depreciation
                      and interest payments). The most important cost item apart from the operat-
                      ing costs and revenues is depreciation, because the JVA has a large asset base.

   Depreciation. Depreciation enables the JVA to replace existing assets in
the future. To estimate the value of assets used for water activities, assets were
classified in two categories: assets exclusively related to water activities, and
assets shared with other activities. The first category of assets refers to dam
and irrigation equipment, and their total value was included. Those assets
correspond to 84 percent of JVA’s total assets. This percentage was used to
allocate the second category of assets as water related. The results are pre-
sented in table 6.10.
   Table 6.10 shows that the JVA had total assets valued at JD 357 million at
historical prices in 2010. Most of the water infrastructure of the JVA dates
back from the 1960s to 1980s. Hence, it is likely that the actual replacement
value of these assets is significantly higher than the historical price
valuation.
   In addition, the asset value base may be higher than is registered in
table 6.10, since the increase in assets as registered in the JVA’s budget books
does not correspond to the investment flows that the Ministry of Finance
registers in its budget books. The JVA’s capital budget (excluding the current
portion in its capital budget) assumes that the asset base should have been
increasing more between 2008 and 2010. Adjusted for the current portion
in the capital expenditure, the JVA’s capital expenditure reached JD
    million in 2010. However, this capital expenditure is only partially
16  ­
reflected in the asset register of the JVA, which registered new capital assets
of only JD 3 million. It is unclear why only JD 3 million of the invested JD
16 million in 2010 entered the JVA books; it is likely that the transfer of
assets is incomplete.
   Currently, depreciation is set at about JD 5.6 million, which is an underesti-
mation of the real depreciation requirements because of the undervaluation of

the asset base (as explained above). A further element of the undervaluation is
the JVA’s use of very long depreciation periods, which is not in line with best
practice. As table 6.11 shows, assets such as furniture, tools, and, to a lesser
extent, vehicles, have very long depreciation periods. The large fluctuations in
depreciation from year to year, moreover, suggest that depreciation is not sys-
tematically charged.
  The decline in the capital budget is worrying because with a total historical
cost asset base of JD 357 million, and an annual capital investment program
of about JD 13 million to JD 16 million in most recent years, total annual
depreciation costs (based on good practice and at historical prices) should
amount to at least JD 14 million. This would mean that virtually the total cur-
rent investment budget is needed to cover the replacement of existing assets
(on a historical cost basis). Hence, the JVA is currently not able to maintain its
current asset base.

   Adjusted income statement. An adjusted income statement for the JVA
water operations is presented in table 6.12, with total depreciation costs of JD
5.6 million per year, increasing the actual net operating loss to JD 16 million
in 2010 when no pumping revenues were collected by the JVA, which assumes
a level of cost recovery of only 24 percent.



Conclusions
 JVA’s capacity to track its operating and maintenance costs needs to be sig-
 nificantly improved, an observation already made in the previous chapter on
 operating revenues. The JVA’s inability to cover a part of its O&M costs
 through its revenues has resulted in pressure on the JVA to curb costs. The
 agency has tried to reduce its energy costs. At the same time, depreciation
 and maintenance payments have been squeezed, which means that the medi-
 um-to-long-term viability of the existing infrastructure is in jeopardy. The
 delays in maintenance have resulted in an increasingly large part of the
 investments being used for ad-hoc maintenance and rehabilitation, whereas
 the lack of current revenues severely affects the capacity of the JVA to attract
­higher-qualified staff.
    Energy costs are currently highly subsidized in Jordan, with the JVA paying
 highly subsidized rates for water pumping. The increase in energy prices and
 the expected further electricity rate increases will affect the JVA, since energy
 makes up about 30 percent of its total O&M costs. The data on actual electric-
 ity consumption—both for pumping irrigation water and for pumping water
 through Amman—are not very consistent, but suggest that there is room for
 improvement.
    Compared to the 1993 GTZ study, energy needs for irrigation pumping
 have increased significantly since 1993, from about 0.10 kilowatt hour per
 cubic meter to about 0.39 kilowatt hour per cubic meter in 2010. The addi-
 tional services provided by the JVA by pumping water to Amman (a rela-
 tively new service for the JVA) explains (part of) this difference. Nonetheless,
 it is likely that information deficiencies and years of delayed maintenance
 have also contributed to this increase in energy intensity. Any investment
 planning program for the JVA should make investments for energy effi-
 ciency improvement a high priority, since they can reduce energy volumes
 significantly and, hence, will help the JVA better cope with increasing elec-
 tricity and energy prices.
    Finally, the JVA uses a nominal rate for pumping water to Amman. The JVA
 should know precisely how much this service costs in terms of energy, but
 also in any ancillary costs in the form of staff requirements and basic over-
 head. This would enable the JVA to value and better price the service it pro-
 vides, since the price of bulk water for the Water Authority of Jordan is now
 implicitly set at JD 0.045 per cubic meter.6

Jordan Valley Authority’s
Operation and Maintenance
Cost Requirements
Introduction
The assessment of the Jordan Valley Authority’s (JVA’s) finances as depicted
in Chapter 6 shows that the its financial viability is severely compromised.
The escalation of operation and maintenance (O&M) costs is the result of
inflation, fuel price increases, and explicit acknowledgment of the assign-
ment of new tasks (that is, increasing flows of water being pumped to Amman
to supplement the public water supply). In the absence of an increase in the
JVA’s revenue, these escalating costs are resulting in increasingly large financ-
ing gaps. The JVA has dealt with the increasing operating losses by crowding
out its investment programs and increasingly diverting capital funding
­
toward paying for operational losses and postponing maintenance. The long-
term effects of this behavior is that the quality of the assets and, hence, the
quality of the service, is and will be adversely affected. The limits to continu-
ing this behavior are becoming evident, since government budgets are likely
to decline in the immediate future.
   The lack of adjustments to the irrigation tariffs has resulted in a real
decline in irrigation tariffs, which provides farmers with few incentives to
use irrigation water more efficiently. Although water availability limits the
increase in irrigation water demand, the effects are shown in irrigation
consumption patterns. The Jordan Valley has seen few changes in crop-
ping patterns over the last two decades (see figure 7.1) due to the combi-
nation of low tariffs (that are declining in real terms), and a quota
allocation that favors banana and fruit tree crops (both crops with high
water requirements).
   In this section, we will calculate the O&M requirements of the JVA to
ensure that the agency can provide services of better quality without compro-
mising its long-term future.


Requirements for Operation and Maintenance
Staff Costs
According to the JVA’s Financial Department, there were 1,501 permanent
employees working in the JVA in 2011 (estimates from the budget books
show a total of 1,658, which increases to 1,756 in 2012). If those in the admin-
istrative offices were distributed proportionally to revenues, 1,361 employees
were in the Water Division and the remaining staff in the Land Division.

   The 1993 GTZ study calculated that about 1,220 employees would be
needed to carry out improved JVA operations in water activities, assuming
that the task of the JVA is to operate and maintain the existing water irrigation
infrastructure (table 7.1). This number is lower than the staff currently work-
ing in the JVA, and hence, efficiency improvements can be made.
   Salaries have increased significantly since 1994, with monthly salaries
increasing from JD 184 per month per employee to JD 379 per month in
2012. Overall, real salary increases have been averaging 1.7 percent per year.
Despite these increases, salaries of JVA employees are still significantly lower
than the salary of their peers in the private sector, making it difficult for the
JVA to attract well-qualified staff. Even though there could be gains in reduc-
ing staff numbers, it is likely that the qualifications of the staff need to improve,
and an active human resources policy is required in combination with a revi-
sion of salary levels and structures. We will assume that the effects of reducing
staff numbers and higher staff costs will balance each other out.



Energy Costs
Energy costs are divided in three categories: electricity cost from the pumping
stations along the distribution system, fuel, and electricity paid for pumping
water in the Northern Conveyor.

The Cost of Irrigation Water in the Jordan Valley	                                            51
   Electricity cost from the pumping stations along the distribution sys-
tem. In 2010, the energy required for irrigation water pumping was estimated
at 0.39 kilowatt hour per cubic meter. Benchmarks elsewhere show that there
is room for improvement in the actual consumption per cubic meter of irri-
gation water. Energy costs are heavily influenced by the price of electricity. A
2012 paper, “Options for Immediate Fiscal Adjustment and Longer Term
Consolidation” (World Bank 2012) shows that electricity is heavily subsidized
in Jordan. The electricity tariff for the JVA has been cross-subsidized by other
consumer groups. Since a realignment of energy subsidies is taking place,
energy tariffs are likely to increase significantly. Tariffs increased in 2012 to
JD 0.066 per kilowatt hour. However, the actual cost-recovery-based tariff
needed to ensure that the National Electricity Power Company’s (NEPCO)’s
tariffs do not fall below its buying tariff is likely to be around JD 0.133 per
kilowatt hour. Hence, in the short term, electricity prices for water pumping
will have to increase from, on average, JD 0.04 per kilowatt hour in 2010 to JD
0.066 per kilowatt hour in 2012. In 2013, the government announced another
15 percent tariff increase, which would bring the rate to JD 0.0759. In the
longer run, electricity prices are likely to further increase to a cost-­
                                                                        recovery-
based tariff of JD 0.133 per kilowatt hour by 2017 (table 7.2).
   Fuel. Between 2008 and end 2010, the Government of Jordan phased out
cash subsidies on petroleum products, causing a sharp drop in oil subsidies.
However, early in December 2010, oil retail prices (except for heavy fuel oil
for industrial consumption, power generation, and aviation fuels) were
again frozen. Furthermore, petroleum subsidies were reintroduced. We
assume that the fuel prices follow the same price developments as that of
electricity (table 7.3).
   Pumping water from the Northern Conveyor. In 2010, the volume of
water the JVA provided to Amman was estimated at 53 million cubic
meters. Since then, according to recent JVA data, the volume of water
pumped increased to more than 100 million cubic meters in 2012. This is

                       a  rapid increase since 2010, and it is not clear whether this increase is a
                       permanent feature of the JVA’s business. In return, the JVA receives treated
                       wastewater that is blended and reused, especially in the Middle Directorate.1
                       The costs associated with this water pumping are significant, especially
                       since the water must be lifted more than 1,000 m. The JVA values these
                       pumping costs at the electricity rate of JD 0.041 per cubic meter of water
                       pumped.2 However, this is a nominal cost only, because energy prices have
                       been increasing, it implicitly assumes that each cubic meter of water
                       pumped requires 1 kilowatt hour of energy, and it assumes that pumping
                       this water requires only electricity but not staff or any other input from the
                       JVA (table 7.4).



                       Maintenance Costs
                       Because maintenance is currently on an ad-hoc basis, an improved mainte-
                       nance program would include routine maintenance taking place to reduce
                       rehabilitation requirements. GTZ, in its 1993 study, included a maintenance
                       plan that would undertake routine maintenance, which it valued at JD

1.7 million at 1993 prices. However, since 1993, the JVA has increased its asset
base by about JD 149 million. It is likely that productivity increases have also
taken place in the corresponding period, which can partially offset the
increase in maintenance costs. We have assumed a net increase of mainte-
nance costs of about 1.5 percent of total historical asset value, compared with
an actual maintenance cost in 2010 of less than 0.8 percent of total historical
asset value (table 7.5).



Depreciation
Currently, depreciation is set at about JD 5.6 million, which is likely to sig-
nificantly underestimate the real depreciation requirements because of the
undervaluation of assets and the fact that depreciation periods are not in
line with best practice (table 7.6). Depreciating against replacement value
would require much higher depreciation payments and has not been
included here.

54	                                          The Cost of Irrigation Water in the Jordan Valley
                      Summary of Operation and Maintenance
                      Requirements
                      Table 7.7 shows that the actual cost requirements are significantly higher than
                      the current costs the JVA registers today. In the table, we assume that the steep
                      increase in salary costs in the JVA in 2012 is structural and that staff costs will
                      increase by 3 percent in 2013. We assume for the remaining costs—electricity
                      and fuel—that they will increase due to electricity price increases. In addition,
                      we assume that maintenance costs will need to increase to a level that allows
                      for a more sustainable use of resources. The cost allocation between the differ-
                      ent users is based on current billed volume of water of the last three years.



                      Conclusions
                      The analysis shows that O&M requirements are significantly higher than
                      what  is currently set aside for the sector through the government’s budget
                      and  the revenue flow from the JVA (by charging farmers and industry for

water provided). The postponement of investments in the last decade and
increasing energy costs, in combination with new responsibilities regarding
the pumping of water to Amman, are resulting in a minimum required O&M
cost of JD 26 million (compared to an actual amount in 2012 that was less
than JD 16 million [both figures excluding depreciation]).
  Improvements in billing and collection are likely to generate more revenues
for the JVA, but these will not be sufficient to cover the O&M cost shortfall
without resorting to either tariff increases, increases in government subsidies,
or both. This is especially true since the JVA currently bills on the basis of
quota allocations, whereas actual water supplied is lower. Hence, unless the
government decides to pay for these increasing operating losses in full, tariff
increases will be necessary to ensure JVA’s financial sustainability.



Notes
	1.	 It is estimated that the volume of wastewater the JVA receives is about 89 million
     cubic meters per year.

     With the altitude differences that must be covered, it is likely that the real cost to
     the JVA is higher.

Proposed Tariff and Cost
Recovery
Concepts of Cost Recovery
The costs associated with the construction of water supply and wastewater
infrastructure and its operation and maintenance (O&M) can include both
financial and economic costs.
   Financial costs are directly associated with the provision of water services
by the agency, in this case the Jordan Valley Authority (JVA), and include
O&M costs to fund the daily operations of the infrastructure; capital costs,
which cover the capital for the renewal of existing infrastructure (deprecia-
tion); and the capital needed for expansion of the service.
   Economic costs are the financial costs of the service and any externalities
related to the environment or the resource costs and benefits of water,1
whereas the financial costs for service provision are adjusted for price distor-
tions and transfer payments. The economic costs of the service reflect the
costs of providing the service for society.
   What constitutes full cost recovery can vary widely. When financial sus-
tainability is the major concern, the recovery of the financial cost is impor-
tant. However, full cost recovery can also include the economic costs of
services, including the pricing of externalities. Paying for the full cost of irri-
gation water services is difficult regardless of the objective being pursued.
This is because the value that users attach to water services is not necessarily
equal to the cost of these services. The results of this mismatch between pri-
vate benefits and social costs is chronic underinvestment in the water sector
and inadequate maintenance, which together result in the provision of
low-quality services, resulting in users not willing to pay for these services.
This results in a downward cycle of low collection efficiencies that result in
agencies not generating sufficient funds to undertake adequate maintenance,
let alone expansion.
   Achieving full cost recovery solely through water tariffs has proved to be
elusive even in many developed countries. In many countries, water tariffs are
low. Increasing these rates to full cost recovery levels will require huge tariff
increases that are often politically difficult to attain because there is a general
concern that full cost recovery rates will clash with the need for affordability
of services, and will therefore not enable the poor to access these basic ser-
vices. Nonetheless, evidence has shown that subsidies are often not well tar-
geted and hence not effective in reaching the poor.
   To achieve financial sustainability, the tariff should be fixed at such a level
that all cash flow needs can be met, which in the case of the JVA is likely to
require at least coverage of direct O&M costs and depreciation funds and, where
possible, a contribution to future capital requirements by collected revenues.

Yet, because the current tariff levels are so low, it is likely that moving to a tariff
system that covers basic cash flow needs will require a phased approach before
that goal can be attained.



Scenario Analysis
Currently, there are three different tariffs: for irrigation water, for industrial
water, and for water for pumping. We make the following assumptions in our
analysis: (a) water for pumping is priced against cost price, with the total
O&M costs for water pumping consisting of staff costs, energy costs, and
maintenance costs allocated on the basis of water volume consumed or
pumped; (b) water for pumping will be fully paid for by either the govern-
ment or water consumers in the cities served by the JVA’s raw water; (c) indus-
trial water is priced against the current rate of JD 1.25 per cubic meters2; and
(d) cross-subsidies are in place, with industrial water users cross-subsidizing
water for irrigation.
   The following scenarios will be tested. In all scenarios, it is assumed that the
costs of water pumping will be fully paid for by the service providers benefit-
ing from these services. All three scenarios are measured in constant 2013
prices.
   Base Case Scenario: Actual O&M Cost Scenario. This includes the current
O&M cost based on actual cost in 2013 prices allocated between industrial
and irrigation water use.
   Scenario I: Optimized O&M Cost Scenario. This is based on the funds
required to operate the JVA in such a manner that all assets are operated and
maintained according to good practice. This scenario assumes that (a) the
electricity prices are at actual cost in 2013; (b) the costs are allocated among
three user categories: industry, irrigation, and water pumping; and (c) a cross-
subsidy policy is in place for the industry that subsidizes farmers’ water use.
   Scenario II: Sustainable O&M Cost Scenario based on billed quota alloca-
tions. In this scenario, we include the optimized O&M cost plus depreciation,
and (a) depreciation is based on full historical costs; (b) the electricity prices
are at actual cost in 2013; (c) the costs are allocated among three user catego-
ries: industry, irrigation, and water pumping; (d) the practice of billing on
quota allocations remains in place; and (e) a cross-subsidy policy is in place
for the industry that subsidizes farmers’ water use.
   Scenario III: Sustainable O&M Cost Scenario based on billed volumes on
effective use. In this scenario, we include the optimized O&M cost plus depre-
ciation, and (a) depreciation is based on full historical costs; (b) the costs are
allocated among three user categories: industry, irrigation, and water pump-
ing; (c) electricity prices are expected to increase to JD 0.133 per kilowatt
hour by 2017; (d) the practice of billing on quota allocations is changed in
favor of a tariff system, where actual consumption volumes are charged; and
(e) a cross-subsidy policy is in place for the industry that subsidizes farmers’
water use.
   Table 8.1 provides details on the three scenarios.

58	                                  The Cost of Irrigation Water in the Jordan Valley
                       The costs of providing irrigation water (depending on the scenario) under
                    the three scenarios range from JD 0.033 to JD 0.343 per m3 in 2013, assuming
                    that the electricity rates will be significantly increased, cross-subsidies from
                    industry will help alleviate the impact on farmers, pumping costs are paid for
                    by those who benefit from them (Amman water users), and the JVA will con-
                    tinue to charge on billed volume (not actual volume).
                       Currently, the most important source of revenues for the JVA is industrial
                    water revenues, which generated more revenues in 2012 than it received for
                    irrigation water, while industrial water use is just a fraction of total water use.
                    In 2012, industrial water revenues constituted 71 percent of total revenues
                    while supplying only 2 to 3 percent of the total water volume consumed. In
                    view of the high price of industrial water and the normally observed high
                    price elasticity of industrial water users, the scope for the JVA to charge indus-
                    trial water users significantly more in the future may be limited.
                       Table 8.1 shows that the costs of providing irrigation water are significantly
                    higher than what is currently charged (an estimated average of JD 0.011 per
                    cubic meter). If the JVA were to charge farmers against water consumed
                    instead of the quota allocations, irrigation water rates would have to be
                    increased even more. In fact, actual irrigation water tariffs should be signifi-
                    cantly higher, since currently (as shown in Chapter 5), billing and collection
                    efficiencies are at 82 percent and 75 percent, respectively. If these efficiencies
                    do not improve, then the actual required tariffs will be significantly higher
                    and would increase to JD 0.343 per cubic meter.

Note: Industrial water revenues have been assumed to be constant over the period. The reason behind this assumption is that
industrial water consumption fluctuates heavily over the years, as do revenues. Since industrial water use tends to be more
price elastic than that of irrigation water or water supply, we have assumed most increases in prices will be offset by declines in
consumption.

Sensitivity and Risk Analysis
The results obtained so far assume that all variables are at current levels of
efficiency. We see different inefficiencies such as energy inefficiency, mainte-
nance inefficiency, staff productivity challenges, low billing efficiency, and low
collection efficiency.
   Results of the analysis, presented in table 8.2, show that the required tariff
increases are sensitive to efficiency improvements, most notably changes in
billing and collection efficiency. If all farmers who use JVA water paid for it,
the O&M costs per unit of water billed would decrease significantly. Other
efficiency improvements can reduce energy, maintenance, and staff costs, but
the effect is less significant. However, the analysis shows that efficiency
improvements alone will not be sufficient to put the JVA on a path of financial
viability. Therefore, tariff increases will be needed.
   This is even more pertinent since there are more downward than upward
risks to consider. There is considerable room to improve efficiencies in
the  JVA, especially regarding billing and collection efficiencies, and to
a  lesser extent, energy efficiency. A combination of different efficiency
improvements will enable JVA to dampen the effect of irrigation tariffs
significantly.
   Figures 8.1 and 8.2 show the most likely tariff required if the JVA were able
to improve its efficiency while maintaining the use of quota allocations. When
we run a risk analysis, assuming cross-subsidies, the effect of efficiency
improvements is significant. Without efficiency improvements, the required

                              improvements, the median required O&M tariff increase could drop to
                              JD 0.09 per cubic meter, and the tariff to cover O&M and depreciation could
                              drop from JD 0.343 to JD 0.196 per cubic meter if these efficiencies were

Benchmarking Jordanian Irrigation Tariffs
Table 8.3 compares the tariff scenarios in Jordan, discussed above, with those
in selected countries. Despite much effort to collect data on irrigation water
tariffs, very little updated information is available. The Food and Agriculture
Organization published an assessment in 2002, but this information has not

been updated. We rely mainly on Dinar, Pochat, and Albiac-Murillo (2015)
for some data on irrigation water tariffs, although even in that publication,
there are far fewer data on irrigation prices than on drinking water and waste-
water tariffs. In addition, the data in that publication are mostly limited to
developed countries.



Conclusions
The analysis above shows that the JVA needs significant tariff increases (and/
or government subsidies) to achieve financial sustainability. Depending on
the level of cost recovery, the minimum required tariff increases are going to
be very large, assuming that the cross-subsidy policy of today is continued,
and government subsidies are not going to be increased. However, the rates
that would be charged would not be very high compared to available interna-
tional benchmarks.
   The most important measures the JVA could take to limit the increase in
tariffs would be to increase billing and collection efficiency and ensure that all
farmers who use JVA water pay for the service. Other measures, such as
improved energy efficiency and cost efficiency, would also offer opportunities
to reduce tariff requirements, but would have less impact than improving bill-
ing and collection efficiency.
   In view of the many uncertainties, including changes in energy subsidies
currently extended to the water sector, the upward risk for further O&M
cost increases seem higher than the downward risks. Although the tariffs
are much higher than the current irrigation water tariffs, a quick compari-
son with other countries shows that the proposed tariff scenarios are not
completely out of line with those in countries that have pursued a more
efficient allocation of water resources. Still, it also shows that the JVA will
have to lay out a roadmap for tariff increases that is accompanied by effi-
ciency improvements and other measures to make farmers aware of the
required tariff increases and, where possible, provide assistance to help
them make the transition to higher tariffs.



Notes
	1.	 Some argue that the cost of regulation and other forms of administration should
     also be included in the full cost of water services.
	2.	 It is assumed that industry in the area served by the JVA will pay the JVA’s water
     rates unless the cost of self-provisioning is lower than the rates that the JVA
     charges.

Impact of Cost Recovery on
Farm Incomes
To assess the effects of changes in tariffs on farmers’ incomes in the Jordan
Valley, farm models were constructed based on observed cropping patterns.
The impact of the different cost recovery tariffs on crop production costs and
farmers’ net revenues will be calculated.



Farm Models
Eight broad farm-type systems prevail in the Jordan Valley. Their distribution,
as discussed in Chapter 5, is as follows: citrus farms with surface irriga-
tion,  citrus farms with drip irrigation, vegetables – open field, vegetables –
greenhouses, vegetables combining open field and greenhouses, banana
­
farms, dates, and mixed farming. For more details on the farm models, see
appendix C.
   Apart from the production systems listed above, field crops and other fruit
trees constitute additional cropping patterns practiced in the Jordan Valley,
under mixed farming conditions in the same farm together with the other
predominant crops. In 2010, about 337,000 dunum were cultivated in the
Jordan Valley, with an irrigation intensity of 99 percent (which remained
quite stable during 2005–10).



Effect of Tariffs on Farm Incomes
Current Farm Incomes
Yield outputs are derived using surveys based on discussions with primary
informants and cross-checked with relevant secondary and other professional
sources (such as the Ministry of Agriculture, the National Center for
Agricultural Research and Extension, the Agriculture Credit Corporation,
and the private sector). Output farm gate prices are derived from multiple
primary informants. Sensitivity simulations have been attempted by using the
Department of Statistics’ average 2010 prices and by referring to FOB prices1
deducting marketing costs2 or by considering whichever best price is obtain-
able by the producers. Detailed crop budgets are presented in appendix C.
   The effect of water tariffs is not negligible, but since many farmers in the
Jordan Valley are already suffering losses on the basis of current market prices,
they are often not able to generate sufficient revenues to offset their produc-
tion costs. Other than farmers who grow dates, none of the farmers are able to
generate profits (excluding numerations for labor and management).
Even  farmers using greenhouse technologies are barely able to produce

                     positive net returns. Yet, when producer prices increase, the effect of a change
                     in irrigation water tariffs can mostly be easily offset. The Jordan Valley is strug-
                     gling with its profitability due to the political conflict in Syria, which has an
                     adverse impact on farmers’ ability to sell their produce outside the country.
                        An attempt has been made to project the economics of the above-described
                     production systems for the entire Jordan Valley (see tables 9.1 and 9.2), based
                     on their respective frequency and proportion, as pointed out by the World-
                     Bank commissioned 2012 survey.3 To that end, only two scenarios have been
                     used for calculations. The first scenario uses current market prices, and the
                     second scenario uses free-on-board (FOB) or best market prices.
                        With current irrigation water tariffs, and under current market prices,
                     farmers in the Jordan Valley suffer losses of about JD 13 million per year. If
                     producers are able to fetch best market prices and conditions, the farmers in

                     The Cost of Irrigation Water in the Jordan Valley	                                             65
the Jordan Valley are able to consolidate a net gain of about JD 296 million per
year using current irrigation water tariffs based on about 300,000 dunum of
planted area under irrigation. In either case, water costs make up no more
than 0.3 percent of the total costs farmers incur to produce their crops. It
shows that banana—a heavily sheltered crop due to import bans—is the most
productive crop in the Jordan Valley. The production of dates, a crop recently
introduced in the Valley, requires the trees to mature to generate positive net
returns. Vegetables are not very profitable as measured by net revenues,
although vegetables grown in greenhouses yield better net revenues than
those grown in open fields.



Farm Incomes under Different Cost Recovery
Scenarios
The impact of the different cost recovery scenarios are calculated for the differ-
ent farm models. We apply the three different tariffs to the different farm mod-
els based on 2013 prices, and calculate for each the effect on net revenues for
farmers and the change in water costs. Note that this is a static analysis since it
is likely that when the cost structure of the farmers’ uses, changes in cropping
patterns can be expected. Because of the change in cost structure, farmers may
decide to change the crops they cultivate in the medium to long term.
   As can be seen in tables 9.3 and 9.4, the effect of producer prices is signifi-
cant. If farmer prices are high, the effect of any increases in irrigation water
tariffs is negligible. Water productivity, measured as the water used per gross

crop revenue under current survey prices, is highest for vegetables grown in
greenhouses (JD 8.74 per cubic meter of water), followed by dates (JD 8.15),
and then vegetables (mixed: JD 6.72), and open field vegetables (JD 4.71).
Banana (JD 1.36, supported by an import ban), citrus drip (JD 1.00), and cit-
rus surface (JD 0.49) show much lower levels of water productivity. It is likely
that farmers will be more driven by net revenues; hence, the importance of
supporting measures that will increase revenues or decrease costs. Banana’s
water productivity is low, but it is an attractive crop for farmers in terms of net
revenues. Vegetables grown in greenhouses generate much higher levels of
water productivity, but with the currently low survey crop prices and high
costs, are not necessarily producing as much net revenues for farmers as
banana.
  Table 9.5 shows how total water costs are affected by irrigation water tariff
increases in the farmers’ total cost of crop production. It is not surprising that
high-volume water crops such as banana and citrus are most affected by any
changes in water tariffs. In the case of banana and citrus crops that are irri-
gated by surface techniques, the farmers’ outlay for irrigation water will
increase significantly. However, for most other crops, the effect of increases in
the irrigation water tariff will be relatively limited.



Effect of Cost Recovery Scenarios for Poor Farmers
Profile of poor farmers. The survey conducted during December 2011–
January 2012 defined poor farmers as those who rated their family as income-
poor (Q6.6), which 39 farmers overall did (17 percent of the sample). About
56 percent of these poor farmers live in Karamah (while this region represents
31 percent of the full sample of surveyed farmers). Poor farmers are less likely
to live in the Middle Ghors; 8 percent of the poor live in this region (while 33
percent of surveyed farmers in the full sample live in this region) (table 9.6).
   About 67 percent of the poor farmers run family farms and 33 percent run
entrepreneurial farms, compared to the full sample, in which 41 percent of the
farmers run family farms and 59 percent run entrepreneurial farms. The poor
farmers experience more water scarcity problems in general and tend to be

Chapter 10

Conclusions
The analysis in the previous chapters reveals that the Jordan Valley Authority
(JVA) is unable to cover its basic operation and maintenance (O&M) costs
from the revenues it generates. In the last two decades, the JVA has been
unable to adjust its irrigation water tariffs at all, so they have remained
unchanged since 1994, whereas expenditures have increased. In 2012, the
JVA’s O&M deficit amounted to more than JD 6 million, equivalent to about
40 percent of total recurrent expenditures. The large operating deficits within
the context of increasingly aging infrastructure will and may already affect
the quality of the service provided (the decline in billing and collection effi-
ciency may reflect that the quality of the service is already being affected),
whereas it also results in a crowding out of investment programs (increas-
ingly diverting capital funding to pay for operational losses). Hence, the risks
are increasing that the current irrigation water infrastructure is increasingly
being compromised.
   For the JVA, an eroding flow of revenues has resulted in an agency that has
become increasingly dependent on government transfers as O&M needs have
increased. The JVA has tried to deal with its lack of revenues while being faced
with increasing O&M costs by selling land assets and postponing mainte-
nance of its infrastructure assets, while using a more aggressive cross-subsidy
policy. However, these interventions have their limits: the income from land
sales is declining rapidly. The current cross-subsidy rate between industry
and irrigation water is huge (average water tariffs of JD 1.25 and JD 0.011,
respectively). Despite a rapid increase in revenues from industry, the price
elasticity of demand suggests there are limits to using this tool much longer.
Postponing maintenance is also a strategy with limited validity, since lack
of  maintenance tends to compromise the ability of infrastructure assets to
provide reliable service to farmers and industry.
   The financial viability of the JVA can be improved by increasing revenues,
decreasing O&M costs, or both. There are several paths open to the JVA to
improve its financial and operational performance through increasing reve-
nues while reducing the costs of service delivery so as to improve O&M cost
recovery in the JVA. While the JVA aims to increase revenues, it also has room
to reduce its chronic inefficiencies. The most important potential efficiency
gains are related to staff employment, maintenance, and energy use in the JVA.



Improving Revenues
Irrigation tariff increases. The analysis shows that the JVA needs signifi-
cant tariff increases to become financially sustainable. Depending on the
level of cost recovery, the minimum required tariff increases for irrigation
water could be very large. If the JVA wants to at least cover its O&M costs

70	                               The Cost of Irrigation Water in the Jordan Valley
in 2013, it will require—assuming that the current cross-subsidies are main-
tained and JVA will be able to achieve 100 percent billing and collection
efficiencies—a tariff of JD 0.066 per cubic meter. If the government wants to
pursue its objective as stated in the 2009 Water Strategy that depreciation
should also be covered, the irrigation water tariff must be increased to JD
0.132 per cubic meter. If the electricity subsidies for water operators are
eliminated by 2017, irrigation water tariffs must be further increased to JD
0.162 per cubic meter to cover JVA’s operation and maintenance. Although
the proposed tariffs are much higher than tariffs currently in place, a quick
comparison with other countries shows that the proposed tariff levels are
similar to those of other countries for which data are available. Yet, the tariff
increases necessary to ensure JVA’s financial viability are large, especially
compared to current irrigation water tariffs, which have not been changed
since 1994, and will require time to implement.
   The more efficient the JVA becomes in providing the service, the lower will
be the required tariff increases. The JVA has several routes to improving its
efficiency.
   Improvement of Billing and Collection Efficiencies. The farmer survey
found that only 82 percent of farmers are actually billed for their water use. Of
the farmers that are billed, revenue collection is only 75 percent. Hence, by
improving efficiencies in revenue billing and collection, the JVA could
increase its irrigation revenues by more than 60 percent. It is the improve-
ment in efficiencies that will most effectively reduce the size of the required
tariff increases. With current billing and collection efficiencies, the required
tariff to cover O&M costs with 2013 electricity prices will be JD 0.108 per
cubic meter; with 100 percent billing and collection efficiency, the tariff drops
to JD 0.066 per cubic meter. Improvements in billing and collection efficien-
cies will also improve fairness of the system, because all who use the irrigation
infrastructure will pay for it. With higher tariffs, the fairness of the system
becomes significantly compromised if a large group of farmers are exempted
from paying irrigation water tariffs.
   Change in billing practices. The JVA currently bills farmers on the basis of
quota allocations, whereas actual water supplied to farmers is often signifi-
cantly lower. It is likely that under a new tariff regime, farmers may not be
willing to pay for quota allocations they do not receive. There are many meth-
ods to measure and charge for actual water volumes used. Although new
technologies play a role, it is important not to neglect the institutional com-
ponent of improved billing practices. In 16 of the 20 registered water user
associations (WUAs), responsibility for the distribution of irrigation water
has been handed over to these associations. The WUAs could be put in charge
of billing and collecting from farmers, use the funds to pay for their opera-
tions, and hand over any surpluses to the JVA. Where needed, the WUAs
could implement awareness programs that aim to ensure that all farmers who
use irrigation water pay for the water they use.
   Change in the ability of the JVA and WUAs to retain their revenues. The
JVA is a ministerial department that collects revenues but which then trans-
fers the revenues to the Treasury. To ensure that the JVA has incentives to

The Cost of Irrigation Water in the Jordan Valley	                            71
improve its billing and collection capacity, redirection of the revenue flow
from the Treasury to the JVA and WUAs could provide better incentives to
bill and collect tariffs from farmers. This may require the JVA to change its
status to one similar to that of the Water Authority of Jordan.



Increasing Efficiency in Service Delivery
Irrigation tariff increases and other measures aimed at increasing the reve-
nue-generating capacity of the JVA will improve its financial sustainability.
Yet, efficiency improvements in the JVA through increasing energy efficiency,
improvements in staff productivity, development of asset management, and
staff productivity increases can further help generate (future) cost savings and
reduce the size of the irrigation water tariffs.
   Improvements in Energy Efficiency. Energy makes up a significant part of
the O&M costs of the JVA. With the dismantling of energy subsidies, and the
resulting increases in energy and electricity prices, the JVA is faced with
increasingly higher energy costs. Due to Jordan’s topography, water often has
to be pumped over large distances and lifted to overcome altitude differences,
which has made the water sector the largest electricity consumer in the coun-
try. More efficient electricity consumption is essential to improve the financial
performance of the JVA and should be a priority in its capital investment
program, especially since the water infrastructure managed by the JVA is
reaching or has reached the end of its economic life. The government’s effort
to use energy more efficiently will have a positive impact on cost recovery in
the JVA, but will also reduce the carbon footprint of the JVA by reducing
emissions, while making the JVA less vulnerable to the volatility of energy
prices.
   The development and implementation of an asset management plan for
the JVA. Linked to the above-mentioned need for energy efficiency improve-
ments and a corresponding capital budget program, the JVA needs to develop
and implement an asset management plan. An asset management plan helps
the JVA, manage its infrastructure capital assets in such a way that it mini-
mizes the total cost while providing the optimum level of water services.
A  high-performing asset management program incorporates detailed asset
inventories, operation and maintenance tasks, and long-term financial plan-
ning to develop and maintain JVA assets. Such a plan can help extend asset
life and assist in rehabilitation, repair, and replacement decisions through effi-
cient and focused operation and maintenance, and improve the security and
safety of assets, while reducing the overall costs for operations, maintenance,
and capital expenditures.
   JVA’s role to change into bulk water supplier. In recent years, the JVA’s
mandate has been extended to also pump water to Amman. This additional
mandate has not been guided by explicit agreements about who pays the costs
for this service, or what costs are actually involved in pumping water to
Amman. It is implicitly agreed that the JVA receives treated wastewater in
return for pumping water to Amman, but it is not clear whether the costs

72	                                The Cost of Irrigation Water in the Jordan Valley
associated with water pumping (especially with lower energy subsidies) are
covering the cost of additional wastewater to be provided by the JVA. In 2012,
water pumping costs amounted to JD 2.7 million (located in the capital
budget)—making up 18 percent of total operating costs. The government
­
should ensure that explicit agreements are reached about the costs of water
pumping to Amman. With the increased importance of water pumping, the
JVA is moving more into the direction of becoming a bulk water supplier.
This move toward becoming a bulk water supplier would also explicitly rec-
ognize the increased role of water user associations in the maintenance of the
distribution systems.



Impact of Tariff Increases on Poor Farmers
The impact of the tariff increases on farmers’ incomes is in general moderate,
because water costs make up only a small part of the total cost of farming. Yet,
as can be expected, certain cropping patterns will be much more affected by
the tariff increases than others. It is especially crops that tend to consume
large volumes of water (citrus and banana), that will feel the impact of the
irrigation water tariffs. According to the cropping pattern simulations, citrus
is not a crop that generates profits even now, with very low irrigation water
tariffs. Increasing tariffs will make these crops even more economically unvi-
able to grow, as has begun to show in the declining citrus production and,
more recently, the decline in cultivated area. In the case of banana, which
benefits from import restrictions, only very large tariff increases (above JD
0.26 per cubic meter) will reduce the profit margin below 10 percent.
   In 2012 and 2013, Jordan registered negative growth in the agricultural sec-
tor, while the productivity per worker also declined. To increase resilience
among farmers to deal with irrigation water tariff increases, the agricultural
sector will have to address issues related to, among others, the marketing of
crops, and provide support to introducing new technologies that reduce the
risks for farmers to transition to other cropping patterns, since the effect of
increases in irrigation water tariffs does affect farmers who grow vegetables
much less than those who grow citrus and banana.
   When planning for irrigation water tariff increases, the government should
evaluate the distributional impact of such increases. The farmer survey found
that 17 percent of survey respondents could be classified as poor. Propoor
farm policies can come in different forms, ranging from cross-subsidies in the
irrigation tariff structure to direct income support to poor farmers. Because
the number of farmers in the Jordan Valley is small, and the number of poor
farmers even smaller, it is relatively easy for the government to provide income
support to poor farmers in the Valley.

Allocation of Water in the
Jordan Valley
Quotas are set according to water availability and demand patterns. Given
that competition for water has increased, the quota system is reviewed on a
regular basis, according to water availability. In 2004, the Jordan Valley
Authority (JVA) established new quotas to better match supply of water and
crop water requirements. Under current water policy directives, agriculture
occupies third place in priority of allocation of freshwater, after municipal
and industrial requirements, and first place in allocation of treated wastewa-
ter. As a consequence, freshwater has been increasingly transferred from irri-
gated agriculture to urban uses. In exchange, agriculture in Karamah is
increasingly supplied with blended water (combining fresh surface water and
treated wastewater (Venot et al. 2007).
   The current annual quotas correspond to 3,600 cubic meters per hectare for
vegetables, 7,650 cubic meters per hectare for citrus, and 12,550 cubic meter
per hectare for banana. The new allocation implied a reduction of about 20 to
25 percent of previous quotas. The resulting water savings, about 20 million
cubic meters per year, are reallocated for domestic water use in Amman
(Venot et al. 2007). Details of the quotas per period of the year and crop is
presented in table A.1.
   The number of farms registered by the Control Centers at the JVA
(Northern, Middle, and Karamah Directorates, and Southern Ghors) is about
10,000 units with a total area of 40,000 ha, of which 36,000 hectares are irri-
gable. The average size per farm is 3.9 hectares, and each farm has an irrigable
area of about 3.5 hectares.

Water User Associations in
the Jordan Valley
In 2001, the Jordan Valley Authority (JVA) launched1 a participatory water
resources management project, with the aim of responsibility sharing
between the authority and the farmers. Water user associations (WUAs) have
been established through a democratic process, including definition of
responsibilities, duties, and management structure. The WUAs are now fully
recognized by the JVA. Contracts with the WUAs regulate tasks transfer,
where the associations are responsible for the distribution of water for irriga-
tion. Although only 12 WUAs out of 23 have formally completed their con-
tracts with the JVA (March 2012), the program encompasses 75 percent of
the irrigated area (see table B.1 and map B.1). Eventually, full coverage of the
Jordan Valley is expected. The WUA system is generally acknowledged as a
positive achievement by the majority of the farmers who have been involved
in the program. Attentive monitoring of the process and system is, however,
warranted, to avoid disputes and to guarantee good management and overall
sustainability.

Appendix D

Subsidy Principles
Principles for access to government subsidies need to be established, such as
the following.
••   Subsidies should be predictable.
     It is important to ensure that water and wastewater systems are realisti-
     cally financed, regardless of affordability and whether alternative sources
     can be used. Fiscal transfers can be provided in the form of investment
     subsidies,1 operation and maintenance subsidies, or both. These fiscal
     transfers should be agreed in advance to ensure that the utility does not
     end up in a vicious circle of inadequate maintenance, low service quality,
     low willingness to pay, and insufficient revenues for basic maintenance.
     To determine the amount of fiscal transfers needed, tariff levels need to be
     predictable, and a clear process for tariff revisions needs to be in place.
     The Bank can use tools like Water Public Expenditure Reviews to address
     the question of the role of government subsidies in the sector and how
     this will affect the development of the sector over time.
••   Subsidies should decline over time.
     The path to full cost recovery should involve a phased approach, with
     tariffs increasing in importance and in stages to cover (a) operation and
     maintenance costs, which ensures that the utility is capable of serving the
     current customer base in the short term; (b) depreciation of assets, so that
     the utility will be able to replace worn-out assets and can serve the cur-
     rent customer base in the medium term; (c) new investment to enable the
     utility to expand its customer base; (d) and eventually, where needed, the
     environmental and resource costs of water.
••   Subsidies should be transparent.
     Subsidies should be reviewed continuously to ensure they provide suffi-
     cient incentives to improve the performance of utilities with respect to
     operational efficiency and investment costs.
••   Subsidies should take affordability concerns into consideration.
     Subsidies should be reviewed continuously to ensure that they target the
     intended beneficiaries. Government subsidies can be provided to fund
     capital and operation and maintenance costs to utilities. Yet, how individ-
     ual affordability can be ensured depends, to a large extent, on tariff levels
     (affected by investment costs and operational efficiencies), their struc-
     ture, and the process of tariff setting.


Note
	1.	 When investment subsidies are provided, it is important that their operation and
     maintenance implications are considered to avoid overdesign.

                tariff—with the area-based

                the type of crop and area

                irrigation where the flow of a
