This report presents a summary of the main finding from the activity “Scaling Up Energy
Efficiency in Buildings in the Western Balkans,” which was financed by the Energy Sector
Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) together with the World Ban k’s Europe and Central
Asia Region.
The team was led by Jas Singh (Senior Energy Specialist and Task Team Leader) and included
Dilip Limaye (Consultant) and Kathrin Hofer (Energy Specialist). The team would like to
acknowledge contributions and valuable feedback provided by Gailius Draugelis, Feng Liu,
Martina Bosi, Peter Johansen, Anke Meyer, Samira El Khamlichi, Jari Vayrynen, Rod Janssen
(Consultant), Violeta Kogalniceanu (Energy Community Secretariat), and Ranjit Lamech. An
interim report was issued in September 2013 and revised to include updates on several indicators
and inclusion of four “guidance notes” in April 2014. The final report and guidance notes were
edited by Chris Marquardt.
The assessment framework is based on six country reports prepared by Edmond Hido (Albania),
Elvis Hadzikadic (Bosnia and Herzegovina), Nexhat Jashari (Kosovo), Ivan Gjoshevski
(Macedonia) and Nenad Pavlovic (Montenegro and Serbia). Additional background case studies
on Western European countries and beyond were also developed to provide additional models
and examples. These cases were developed by Dilip Limaye, Kathrin Hofer, Melis Bitlis, Rod
Janssen and Jas Singh.
The report also benefitted from two practitioners workshops held at the Energy Community
Secretariat’s offices in Vienna, Austria, where representatives from the Western Balkan countries
provided feedback, shared their experiences, and discussed many of the models and options.
Inputs were also provided by representatives from Armenia, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Lithuania,
Poland, and the United Kingdom. Additional feedback was provided by the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the Deutsche Gesselschaft für Internationale
Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and the United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP).

Executive Summary
Within the six countries of the Western Balkans—Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, the
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, and Serbia—energy efficiency (EE) is
increasingly seen as a key pillar in national energy strategies, helping to enhance energy security,
contribute to economic growth, and ensure environmental sustainability.
This is for several reasons. EE can reduce the region’s heavy reliance on expensive imports,
enhance competitiveness and job creation, and reduce the impact of widespread fossil fuel use.
EE can also bring important social benefits, helping to improve local air quality (mitigating
related adverse health impacts), improve indoor comfort levels through improved heating, and
make energy more affordable for low-income families. Finally, EE is seen as a critical tool in
helping to mitigate the effects of necessary and planned tariff reforms by offsetting the higher
energy costs to the entire economy.
To realize these benefits, the Western Balkans countries will have to shift from broad policies and
small-scale pilots to scaled-up financing and implementation. There is an urgent need to develop
viable financing models in all sectors—as well as suitable delivery mechanisms, information
systems, and necessary secondary legislation—in order to meet national targets and fuel
economic development in a more sustainable manner. Buildings, which account for almost half of
energy use in the regions, have been identified as a key sector in all of the country EE plans.

Objectives
With support from the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP), the World
Bank initiated this regional technical assistance activity to help scale up improvements in EE in
buildings in Western Balkan countries through the sharing of best practices, policy and
implementation options, case studies and plans. The project was carried out in two phases, the
first of which delivered the following:
    1. An assessment framework for implementing scalable EE building programs and
       mapping Western Balkan country progress;
    2. Key financing options for public and residential buildings based on experience from
       Europe and elsewhere; and
    3. A “roadmap” setting out a series of actions governments might consider to scale up the
       volume and pace of implementation.

Although per capita energy use in the Western Balkan countries is about half that of the EU, the
energy required to provide the same comfort levels is much higher, indicating significant
potential and need for more-efficient energy use.

Framework for Successful EE Programs in Buildings
Accelerating the pace of building renovation programs in the Western Balkans will require a two-
pronged approach:
       Broadening the portfolio of government interventions. This requires government
        actions in the five key areas: enacting legislation, adopting policy and regulatory
        enhancements, improving market conditions, expanding finance and implementation, and
        building local capacity.
       Deepening implementation efforts. Leveraging commercial financing and investment in
        building renovations by developing national level programs for public and residential
        buildings.

To scale up, governments will need to develop national-level programs with full policy
frameworks, sustainable financing and implementation schemes, and supporting programs:
          Public and donor funds will need to be pooled and strategically leveraged with
           commercial financing.
          Programs will need to offer multiple financial products to reach all market segments.
          Simplified energy service company (ESCO) models will need to be developed to foster
           local industries.
          Greater efforts to implement at scale—from project bundling to wholesale financing—
           will help lower transaction costs and increase pace of building renovations.

Second Phase
The key findings and results of the first phase were presented at a regional workshop in Vienna in
June 2013. At that time, four topics were agreed on for development of detailed guidance notes,
including (i) establishing and operationalizing an EE Revolving Fund; (ii) municipal budgeting
and financing; (iii) residential financing and incentive programs; and (iv) energy service business
models and market development. Draft guidance notes were presented at a May 2014 workshop
in Vienna and subsequently finalized.

Introduction
Background
1.      Within the Western Balkan region, a lack of sufficient and reliable energy supply
threatens to create a regional energy crisis. Currently, the six countries in the region1 rely
heavily on imported hydrocarbons, with energy imports accounting for up to 44 percent of total
energy use (2010).2 In 2012, the cost of energy imports was estimated at over €3 billion (about
2.1 percent of regional GDP). Over the coming two decades, demand for energy is projected to
increase by almost 70 percent. The most rapid growth is expected in the commercial and public
sector (140 percent), followed by the industrial sector (100 percent), and the residential sector (60
percent). This represents an average increase in energy demand of about 3 percent per year and
would require some €53 billion in investments between now and 2030. The challenge of securing
the energy resources needed to maintain economic growth will be further accentuated as the
Western Balkan countries compete with Western Europe and the rising demand in energy
exporting countries.3 Energy efficiency (EE) is the most cost-effective clean and local energy
“resource” that can be tapped to help meet this demand; increasing EE efforts can reduce the
projected demand growth to about 2 percent per year, at a fraction of the cost of new energy
supply infrastructure, while forestalling the impending regional energy crisis.
2.       Improving energy efficiency can also help fuel economic growth in the Western
Balkans. A recent World Bank study estimated energy cost savings of €2.5 billion from
implementing cost-effective EE measures in the region.4 According to a 2011 UNDP report,
Western Balkan governments spend 7–11 percent of GDP on fossil fuel subsidies alone.5
Transfers to financially distressed utilities, combined with direct and indirect subsidies to
consumers, create a massive burden on the fiscal budgets. In addition, estimates indicate that the
public sector in these countries spend over €400 million each year in energy costs for their
buildings.6 EE can help to substantially reduce energy subsidy and service spending, creating
fiscal space for other development priorities. EE can also help reduce energy expenditures in the
private sector, enhancing competitiveness and creating jobs. A European study found that €1
invested in EE has resulted in €4-5 in benefits (such as increased tax revenues, lower operating
costs, and reduced unemployment and subsidies);7 similar European studies found that building
renovations, in particular, can be labor-intensive and create mostly non-exportable jobs, with 15–
19 jobs created for every €1 million invested. 8 If public funds leverage private funds at a
conservative 1:1 ratio, and these funds can revolve five times over a program’s lifetime, this
means that €100 million in public funds can create 15,000–19,000 jobs.
3.      Energy efficiency is also one of the lowest-cost means of reducing carbon dioxide
(CO2) emissions—a major contributor to climate change—and other adverse environmental
and social impacts. It is a relative inexpensive method of reducing both global and local
pollution and, according to the McKinsey Global Institute, the top priority among measures to

mitigate climate change.9 Regional work has shown similar conclusions about the priority
governments should place on EE.10 Further, as the region continues to seek EU integration, the
need for more systematic EE and environmental improvements across the economies will become
more crucial. EE can also help ease the social impacts of tariff reforms, since lower energy use
can offset incremental increases in prices. A recent World Bank report argues that energy
subsidies can be eliminated without hurting the poor through consolidated social assistance
reforms and EE measures.11 It goes on to show how targeted EE interventions can even reduce
energy poverty,12 with energy poor households in Albania benefiting the most from EE programs.
4.      Significant energy savings potential exists in the existing buildings stock. Currently,
buildings consume about half of the energy in the Western Balkans. Estimated energy savings in
buildings range between 20 percent and 40 percent, with the highest potential expected in the
public sector (35–40 percent), followed by the residential sector (10–35 percent). Although some
efficiency gains are expected to be offset by increased demand given under-heating and relatively
low penetration rates of appliances in some households, expected energy cost savings are
significant. A 2012 regional market assessment commissioned by the Energy Community
Secretariat (ECS) concluded that potential annual energy savings amount to about €462 million or
7,940 GWh.13
5.      The region’s governments have identified improving energy efficiency in buildings
as a key priority and have taken initial policy steps. The governments have recognized the
importance of EE and have developed EE Laws and National Energy Efficiency Action Plans
(NEEAPs) targeting at least 9 percent energy savings by 2018.14 Energy savings in buildings are
included as one of the key means of attaining this target. Each country has taken important steps
to strengthen its legislative and regulatory framework, mainly by transposing the relevant
European Union (EU) directives15 and passing some important secondary legislation. Most have
established dedicated EE units, and some have even created incentive schemes through (mostly)
existing environmental funds.
6.       Unfortunately, implementation progress has remained limited and ad hoc. On-the-
ground results have substantially lagged behind the more robust policy measures, and there is
growing concern that some countries may be unable to reach their targets. Reasons for this gap
include generally under-resourced EE units, inaccessible financing mechanisms, depressed
energy pricing and norm-based billing for heating,16 marginally or uncreditworthy municipalities
and homeowner associations (HOAs), poor data on baseline energy use, and underdeveloped EE
service markets. The current budget constraints in many of these countries will likely only
exacerbate the situation. A number of government- and donor-funded programs have been
initiated over the past decade to demonstrate the viability of EE investments in both public and
residential buildings. However, implementation has remained fragmented and piecemeal.

Because most project staff, data, and systems are orphaned as projects are closed, technical and
implementation experience must be cultivated each time. Thus, while hundreds of buildings have
been renovated within the region with positive results, the scale has remained low (most projects
have retrofitted about 20–30 buildings per year)—with very limited replication and country
ownership for national-level programs, a lack of sustainable financing schemes and models, and
an absence of dedicated entities in place to support implementation. Energy service companies
(ESCOs) and other service providers are unwilling to enter a market that lacks stable, predictable
demand and consistent rules for determining baseline energy use and energy savings. Thus, a
recent EU-commissioned report found that, whereas €1.5 billion in financing is available for
clean energy (including EE) investments in the Western Balkans, only a small fraction has
actually been deployed.17

Scaling Up Energy Efficiency
In this context, the World Bank launched a regional project to scale up improvements in energy
use in existing public and residential buildings in the Western Balkans by sharing best practices,
policy and implementation options, case studies, and plans. With support from the Energy Sector
Management Assistance Program’s (ESMAP), the project was carried out in two phases. The first
phase of the project included:
         An assessment framework for (i) implementing scalable EE programs in buildings; and
          (ii) mapping regional progress;
         Financing options for public and residential buildings based on experience from Western
          and Eastern Europe; and
         A “roadmap” for scaling up EE in buildings both in the public and residential sectors.
The key findings and results of the first phase were presented at a regional workshop in Vienna in
June 2013 and are described in this report. Also during the June 2013 workshop, four topics were
agreed on for development of detailed guidance notes. These included:
     4.   Establishing and operationalizing an EE Revolving Fund
     5.   Municipal budgeting and financing
     6.   Residential financing and incentive programs
     7.   Energy service business models and market development
Draft guidance notes were presented at a May 2014 workshop in Vienna and subsequently
finalized. Executive summaries of each guidance note are included in Annex D. The full notes are
available from the authors upon request.

1. Assessment Framework Findings
Overall, energy intensity in the Western Balkans has remained relatively flat over the past 10
years, indicating limited progress on EE implementation.18 While energy and electricity
consumption per capita have been increasing during the same period,19 energy consumption is
still significantly lower than (about half) that of the EU and Europe and Central Asia (ECA)
regional averages (Figures 1a and 1b). With per capita consumption projected to increase
significantly over the next decade and converge toward EU levels, additional pressures will be
placed on these countries to undertake aggressive EE improvements to mitigate import and
supply bottlenecks, maintain their competitiveness, and reduce the impact of this higher energy
use on poorer end users and the environment.

In the buildings sector, energy consumption per square meter varies significantly across the
region in both the residential and non-residential sectors, but is already approaching the EU
average (Figures 2a and 2b). However, given the warmer average temperatures and lower per
capita energy use in these countries, substantial improvements will have to be achieved as their
incomes rise and per capita energy use and indoor heating (or “comfort levels”) increase.

Improving EE has thus been identified as a key priority in all six countries, and, as noted
previously, some important initial steps have been undertaken to improve the enabling policy
frameworks. However, many of these initial steps have not yet translated into large quantifiable
results. As shown in the reported progress toward achieving the 2012 energy savings targets set
forth in the first NEEAPs (2010–12), three countries appear to have met or exceeded the interim
target for the first three-year period, with progress in the other countries falling short (Figure 3).
As the policies adopted begin to take effect and implementation plans are realized, these figures
are expected to improve. However, to achieve the ambitious energy savings targets set for 2018, a
significant scaling up of EE improvements across the region and across sectors will be needed.

Lessons from EU and other international experience show that successful EE programs require a
mix of policy tools and program instruments to overcome the typical financial, institutional,
technical, and behavioral barriers present in most markets. For buildings, an Assessment
Framework was developed to assess individual country progress and identify country-specific and
regional gaps for future interventions, while at the same time improving coordination between
donor programs and investment programs. The Framework includes five major categories, or
“building blocks”: legislation, policies and regulations, market characteristics, financing and
implementation, and capacity building and awareness raising (Figure 4).

Within the Assessment Framework’s five building blocks, multiple indicators were then
developed as proxies for assessing country-specific progress on the basis of documented results.
Most of these indicators represent “check marks” to actions taken (e.g., adoption of NEEAP,
financial incentive program launched) but some also include numeric indicators (e.g., the
percentage of buildings with building-level meters, the number of donor credit lines in place).
The detailed Assessment Framework is included in Appendix A of this report.
Overall progress in each of the five building blocks was then summarized using a simple scoring
system that aggregated the check marks and in some cases specific indicators within each
building block category. The resulting scoreboards (Table 1) give a reasonable representation of
the level of progress achieved by each country in each area as well as well as some of the country
and regional gaps. It should be noted that the Assessment Framework provides only a current
snapshot of progress and is intended as a rapid assessment tool only. It is also based on available
data, which in some cases was incomplete.

2. Financing Options
As noted in the Section 1, the absence of sustainable financing mechanisms for the public and
residential sectors represents a critical gap in the Western Balkans. In the buildings sector,
international experience shows that a wide range of financing options and instruments are
available to address some of the existing market barriers. These options range from
predominantly public financing to commercial financing; their suitability will depend on the
maturity of local markets and the creditworthiness of the underlying borrowers.

A. Financing Options for the Public Sector
The ECS-commissioned regional market assessment identified 515 GWh per year in energy
savings potential for schools and hospitals across the six countries. Assuming each country
expects to achieve 9 percent energy savings in this market segment, in order to contribute to the
national EE targets, investment capital of some €226 million would be needed over a 10-year
period (Table 2). Such a high level of investment would require substantially improving the
leverage for public/donor funds, as well as recycling of these funds, to realize the sizeable energy
savings and relatively attractive payback periods (5.3–7.6 years).

Despite these attractive payback periods and the energy savings potential, EE financing is
plagued by a number of market failures and “barriers .” Global experiences, along with findings
from the Assessment Framework, identified the following key barriers in the public buildings
sector in these six countries: (i) a limited number of creditworthy municipalities and borrowing
capacity; (ii) restrictive budgeting and procurement regulations; (iii) low energy tariffs; (iv)
norm-based billing systems (i.e, billing per square meter rather than actual supply) for heating;
(v) relatively high interest rates charged by commercial banks; (vi) small project sizes, leading to
high project development and transaction costs; and (vii) low existing comfort levels.
The World Bank’s experiences around the world show that there are a number of financing
options for public buildings that can help address some of these barriers (Figure 5) and
adequately serve the target markets. In a given country or market, this “financing ladder” can help
guide policymakers to select one or more options that can then be designed to provide accessible
financing products.
Over time, as local markets evolve, the goal is to move up the ladder to more commercial
financing mechanisms. Once a mechanism is selected, the design should include elements to
facilitate the introduction of a subsequent option, thereby helping to ensure constant evolution
and “climbing of the ladder.” For example, use of public financing schemes—such as MOF




Final Report                                          Page 18                                   June 2014
                                Western Balkans: Scaling Up Energy Efficiency in Buildings


financing with budget capture, EE funds, or public ESCOs20—can address markets not currently
served by existing commercial financial institutions.
However, use of these mechanisms alone may not ensure evolution over time. Therefore,
introducing pilots and other schemes, such as simplified ESCO contracts, could help begin to
develop ESCO markets, thereby allowing public entities better access to commercial financing in
the medium term and ESCO financing in the long term. (A detailed summary of these financing
options is presented in Appendix B.)
Figure 5 – Financing Ladder: Energy Efficiency Financing Options for Public Buildings




Source: Adapted from World Bank Institute, 2013. Financing Options for the National Program for Energy Efficiency in
Public Buildings (NPEEPB) in the FYR Macedonia, 2012–18; and ESMAP, 2013. “Energy Efficient Cities Initiative Guidance
Note on Financing Municipal Energy Efficiency Projects,” World Bank, May 2013 draft.

Of course, this ladder is only meant as an illustrative guide to assist with selection. In reality, not
all mechanisms are mutually exclusive and governments need not move up every step of the
ladder. The selection of appropriate mechanisms and the subsequent design of them will depend
on a number of factors, including (i) current legislative and regulatory conditions; (ii) the
maturity of financial and public credit markets; (iii) the current state of the local EE service
markets, including ESCOs and energy auditors; and (iv) the technical and financial capabilities of
public entities to undertake EE projects.
Once the basic mechanisms are selected, these mechanisms must then be carefully designed to
suit the local market characteristics. During the design phase, one mechanism can be developed
to offer more than one financial product. For example, EE revolving funds are, in their simplest
form, revolving loans using public funds. However, it is common for EE revolving funds to offer
multiple financial products—such as loans, loan guarantees and ESCO financing. Multiple
product offerings are generally recommended, as they allow different municipalities with
different capacities to be better served under one program. On the basis of the analysis in Section
1, the following three options appear most viable in the Western Balkans in the near term:
        1. Ministry of Finance (MOF) financing with budget capture
        2. EE revolving funds
        3. Public ESCOs

                           Western Balkans: Scaling Up Energy Efficiency in Buildings


For each option, a brief description is provided below along with typical design features and
characteristics. Designs can vary, however, and detailed designs can be as important, if not more
so, as the selection of the mechanism itself. Although international finance institutions (IFIs) and
other donors could be potential financiers under all three options, these programs should be
government-led and should ideally include government contributions.

Option 1. MOF Financing with Budget Capture
Under this option, the Ministry of Finance funds municipalities and/or public entities through
existing budgetary mechanisms to pay the upfront costs of EE investments, often based on calls
for proposals or existing budget request systems. The subsequent repayments could be structured
through a budget “capturing” system, where future budgetary provisions are reduced until the
loan has been fully repaid. This would allow these funds to revolve, provided that the MOF uses
the reflows to finance additional EE projects. Ideally, to ensure that the municipality maintains a
positive cash flow, the size of the reduced budgetary outlay should reflect the measured or
estimated energy savings. A portion of the loan could be forgiven as an additional incentive, but
this would reduce the funds available to finance new EE projects.
Project implementation is typically carried out by a temporary project implementation unit (PIU)
located within the MOF. To facilitate implementation of EE projects and address limited capacity
in the public sector, the PIU may provide support for project preparation, implementation and
monitoring either against a fee or covered from the public budget. An example of a budget
capture mechanism is the World Bank–supported Municipal Services Improvement Project
(MSIP) in Macedonia (Box 1).

Box 1. The Municipal Services Improvement Project in Macedonia
Begun in August 2009, the MSIP aims to improve transparency, financial sustainability and delivery of targeted
municipal services in Macedonia. The project is financed by a World Bank loan to the government, which the
Ministry of Finance (MOF) then lends to eligible municipalities and public sector entities based on municipal
investment proposals.
Investments are focusing on municipal services projects that generate revenue and/or reduce costs, including EE
in public buildings and street lighting. Municipalities repay the loans through a budgetary mechanism from
revenues or cost savings generated by the investments.
In addition, the project supports local capacity building through a PIU in the MOF by funding technical
assistance, training or consultancy services for municipalities that lack the capacity for project design and
implementation.
The total loan value of projects completed or approved in the investment pipeline to date is €19.9 million.
Eleven projects have been completed, including a few EE projects, and 20 are currently under implementation.
About one third of municipalities have started to increase their revenue earnings and/or cost savings from the
completed projects. An additional 21 municipalities are preparing investment projects with PIU support.

The budget capture mechanism may be particularly well suited for municipalities that are not
creditworthy or countries with an underdeveloped municipal credit market, as there is no
repayment risk and it is relatively easy to implement. It can also help build capacity among
municipalities to implement such projects while demonstrating the benefits of EE retrofits in
public facilities. However, such schemes may not be sustained once the funds are disbursed
and/or the donor-funded project (and PIU) is closed. Also, it is difficult for such schemes to
achieve larger scale because both the level of MOF resources for such a scheme and the capacity
of the PIU will be limited.

Option 2. EE Revolving Fund
An “EE revolving fund (Fund)” is generally an independent entity established by the government
and managed by either an existing entity (e.g., a development bank) or a fund management
company (referred to as a Fund Manager) selected by the government through a competitive
process. Under either option, the Fund operator is supervised by a board of directors, appointed
by the government, which can include both government and nongovernment stakeholders. When
a fund manager is engaged, it is recommended using a performance contract, taking into account
several factors, such as cost recovery, deal flow, defaults, or customer satisfaction.
Depending on the local market conditions and needs, the Fund may provide a full range of
financial services (such as energy auditing, procurement, supervision, and monitoring) as well as
financial products such as the following:
        Loans to creditworthy municipalities with sufficient collateral and equity (and sometimes
         also to other creditworthy enterprises and utilities);
        Energy service agreements (ESAs) to other entities (Box 2) without their own budgets or
         capacity to implement projects;
        Guarantees for commercial bank loans; and
        ESCO financing and re-financing for public sector EE projects.

Box 2. Energy Service Agreements
Under an ESA, an EE Revolving Fund, ESCO or other EE
service provider offers a full package of services to identify,
finance, implement and monitor EE projects for clients. The
client is usually required to pay all, or a portion of, their
baseline energy bill, to cover the investment cost and
associated fees until the contract period ends. ESA payments
can also be bundled with a client’s energy bills.
In this case, the figure on the right illustrates the basic idea of
a client’s cash flows under the ESA, with payments equal to
their baseline energy bill. In some cases, the contract duration
is fixed; in other cases, the contract can be terminated after an
agreed level of payment has been made, which can encourage
the client to save more energy.
For municipal clients, ESAs are generally not viewed by
MOFs as municipal debt, since they can be viewed as long-
term contractual commitments or a form of utility service. If both the client and the Fund are public, public
procurement rules may not be required, making financing simper. This provides a dual advantage to the client of
being relatively simple to carrying very little risk.

Goodrich & Rosati, May 2013.

Regardless of the financing products, repayments are based on the estimated or verified energy
cost savings, thereby allowing funds to revolve while the public borrower maintains a positive
cash flow. The repayment risk generally rests with the Fund, so some arrangements to secure
payments are often made. This could include bundling energy utility payments with the Fund
repayment; if the municipality does not pay, the threat exists for a disruption in utility services or
possible disconnection. Alternatively, the Fund could request that the MOF redirect a portion of
future budgetary transfers from the public agency to the Fund (similar to a budget capture
scheme) until the Fund has recovered its payments. It is also recommended that the pricing of any
technical assistance (TA) provided by the Fund allow for cost recovery, although the level of
pricing may depend on the sources of the Fund and the nature of the public sector client being
served. An example of an EE Revolving Fund is the Bulgarian Energy Efficiency Fund, or BEEF
(Box 3).

Box 3. The Bulgarian Energy Efficiency Fund
BEEF, established in 2005, was capitalized by a US$10 million Global Environment Fund (GEF) grant and an
additional US$5 million in seed capital from the governments of Bulgaria and Austria as well as private
shareholders (Eurobank EFG, Lukoil AD, Brunata Bulgaria, Enmona AD and others). BEEF was designed as a
self-sustaining, revolving mechanism specialized in financing EE investments in industrial SMEs, public and
residential sectors. BEEF is governed by a Management Board which includes government, private sector, and
NGO representatives. Day-to-day operations is administered by a competitively selected Fund Manager,
constituted by a consortium of three firms (Econoler International, EnEffect Consult and Elena Holding), and
compensated under a performance contract.
BEEF provides EE loans on a commercial lending basis, partial credit guarantees and portfolio guarantees to
ESCOs. The Fund financed or guaranteed about 160 projects valued at over US$80 million by 2011. Around 54
percent of loans were provided to municipalities and the rest to corporate and other clients (such as hospitals and
universities). While the number of partial credit guarantees remained relatively low, BEEF issued more than 30
portfolio guarantees for ESCO projects, providing coverage for the first 5 percent of defaults in the project
portfolio. The self-financing rate of BEEF was at 133 percent in 2010.

In markets where the availability of commercial funding for EE is limited and/or characterized by
high risk aversion or few creditworthy public sector clients, EE Revolving Funds could be used to
provide direct financing. Specific design features could vary considerably, depending on the
existing market conditions, Fund structure, clients to be served, services offered, and so on.
However, all Funds should be designed to develop the market and avoid becoming a monopoly
by crowding out other market actors. If public clients are subject to fee-for-service TA, the Fund
must be incentivized to be efficient in terms of overhead and service costs. Moreover, Funds must
take some risks and not simply seek implicit MOF guarantees for all repayments; otherwise the
Fund will simply be acting as a government PIU.

Option 3. Public ESCO
A public ESCO is a government-owned corporation established primarily to undertake EE
projects in the public sector. As a public enterprise, it can often sign contracts with other public
agencies without going through a competitive process. This helps to overcome some of the more
difficult procurement and other administrative challenges public agencies face when engaging
private ESCOs. The public ESCO is better able to access public, donor, and other funds and, thus,
can offer 100 percent project financing to its clients. Clients generally repay the public ESCO
based on the estimated energy costs savings, although sometimes a verification procedure is
performed. The public ESCO will then subcontract all actual implementation to local contractors,
thereby fostering a local ESCO industry. Public ESCOs can thus serve as an incubator for local
ESCOs, while allowing the concept of energy service performance contracts (ESPCs) to become
accepted and providing the local ESCOs with experience and a track record for their future
marketing (Figure 6).

A number of variations of the public ESCO model have been used, depending on the local
conditions and capabilities of existing entities. Some of the more common include “super
ESCOs,” utility-based ESCOs, utility demand-side management (DSM) ESCOs, and internal
ESCOs.21 Typically, public ESCOs are formed when the local ESCO market is still nascent and
public efforts are deemed necessary to catalyze ESCO business models. It can also be a way of
accelerating investments in the public sector, which private ESCOs may be unable to serve in the
near term, and of providing economies-of-scale. However, caution should be given to the
monopolistic behavior of public ESCOs; appropriate exit strategies and indicators should be
developed to allow them to phase out when their goals have been achieved. An example of a
Fund acting as a super ESCO is the Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund (R2E2)
Fund in Armenia (Box 4).

Box 4. Super ESCO in Armenia
The R2E2 Fund was established in 2005 initially as a PIU for a World Bank –supported EE/renewable energy
(RE) project. The Fund operates on a fully commercial basis and is governed by a board of trustees made up of
representatives from the government, private sector, NGOs, and academia. Day-to-day activities are managed by
a government-appointed executive director, supported by technical and financial staff. The Fund is currently
implementing a World Bank/GEF–supported project that provides EE services in public sector facilities —
including EE investments in schools, hospitals, and administration buildings as well as street lighting—using a
revolving fund scheme. The Fund offers two financing products to eligible public entities:
•    For schools and other public entities that are not legally or budget independent, ESAs are used. Under the
     ESA, a public entity pays the Fund its baseline energy costs (with adjustments for energy prices, usage, and
     other factors) over the 7-to-10–year contract period. The Fund designs the project, hires subcontractors,
     oversees construction and commissioning, and monitors the subproject. In this case, the client entity incurs
     no debt; rather, the Fund directly pays the energy bills to the utility on the client’s behalf, and retains the
     balance to cover its investment cost and service fee. The ESA is designed so that the duration can be adjusted
     if the Fund recovers its full investment earlier (or later).



21
   A public ESCO refers to any publicly owned EE service provider whose loans are repaid through energy cost savings. A
super ESCO is a type of public ESCO that directly contracts with public entities and then subcontracts with smaller
ESCOs/contractors on a competitive basis. Under a utility-based ESCO scheme, a public entity contracts directly with its
utility for EE services without additional procurement and usually repays via its utility bills. A utility DSM ESCO is a
publicly owned ESCO that uses funds from a DSM surcharge to invest in public agencies at no cost to the agency. An
internal ESCO is a unit within a public agency that acts as an ESCO, provides technical and financial services, and receives
payments through internal budget transfers. (Source: Singh et al., Public Procurement of Energy Efficiency Services:

•   For municipalities and public entities with revenue streams independent of the state budget, loans are
    provided. These loans do count as municipal debt, with fixed repayment obligations to be made within their
    budget provisions in future years. The repayment amounts are designed to allow clients to repay the
    investment costs and service fees from the estimated energy cost savings. The client can pay additional fees
    for the Fund to implement the project on its behalf.
R2E2 uses simplified performance contracts to shift some performance risks to private construction
firms/contractors and to support the build-up of an ESCO industry in Armenia. Under these contracts, firms are
selected based on the net present value of the projects they propose, and a portion of their final payment (around
30 percent) is based on a commissioning test.
The R2E2 Fund is expected to finance an estimated 85 projects worth about US$6 million between 2012 and
2015 and to demonstrate a sustainable financing and implementation model for the public sector. As of January
2014, the Fund signed 20 loans and ESAs valued at US$3.05 million since 2011.

B. Financing Options for the Residential Sector
The ECS-commissioned market assessment discussed in Section 2A also estimated potential
energy savings in residential buildings in the Western Balkans to be about 6,162 GWh per year.
To achieve 9 percent of this potential, expected investment needs amount to €2.7 billion (Table
3). While some markets could achieve this through mostly commercial financing, these projects
would likely require both further tariff reforms and some level of incentives to overcome the
longer payback periods associated with these investments, which have an average payback period
of eight years.

The residential sector also faces a number of barriers hampering these EE investments. The key
barriers are (i) small project size and relatively high transaction costs, (ii) low energy tariffs, (iii)
perception of high risk on the part of commercial banks, (iv) HOAs’ decision-making processes
and creditworthiness, (v) norm-based billing systems for heating, (vi) relatively high commercial
bank interest rates, and (vii) high discount rates (or hurdle rates) on the part of residential
consumers.
International experience indicates that there are four major financing options to help overcome
these barriers and support EE improvements in residential buildings:
     1.   EE funds
     2.   Commercial bank financing
     3.   Partial credit guarantees
     4.   Utility EE programs
(A tabular summary of the options—including descriptions, advantages and disadvantages, and
examples—can be found in Annex C.)

The review did not explicitly focus on incentive schemes, which in many developed countries are
equally if not more important than financing. Such mechanisms can include grants or subsidies
for audits and investments, rebates, tax incentives, interest buy-downs, and so on. This was
because it did not appear that any of the Western Balkan countries would be able or likely, in the
near term, to establish a sustainable mechanism for providing financial incentives for residential
EE programs. However, a more detailed review of residential financing and incentive programs
was developed in the second phase, of which a summary is included in Annex D.
As in the case of financing options for public buildings (Section 2A), the selection, design
features, and products offered under each of the four options needs to be tailored to the specific
market conditions. The following sections briefly describe each option in turn, including typical
design characteristics.
Option 1. EE Funds
EE Funds are specialized institutions or funds created by national or state governments (often
with assistance from IFIs/donors) to support EE projects, mostly in the residential sector. Unlike
EE revolving funds in the public sector, this type of fund generally does not require full
repayments from borrowers, but rather “revolves” by offering concessional loans or incentives
and then recovering the funds from various revenue sources—such as annual government budget
allocations, energy or environmental taxes, state or municipal bonds, revenues from
privatizations, and IFI/donor funds. The size of an EE Fund can vary substantially across
countries: in many U.S. states and some EU countries, it has ranged from 1 to 2 percent of
electricity sales revenues.
As in the case of the public sector, EE Funds may be a viable option in countries with limited
availability and/or accessibility of commercial bank financing for a large segment of residential
customers. To address these barriers, EE Funds can offer residential clients a range of financing
products (such as investment grants or rebates, energy audit subsidies, low-interest or longer-
tenor22 loans, and interest buy-downs23 of commercial bank loans) as well as services (such as
audit templates, information on certified auditors/manufacturers/products, guidebooks, case
studies, online EE calculators). EE Funds and commercial bank financing are not mutually
exclusive options; where the EE Fund is providing only a portion of the financing, efforts should
be made to coordinate with partner banks to streamline applications and approvals. An example
of an EE Fund is the Eco Fund in Slovenia (Box 5).

Box 5. Slovenia’s Environmental Fund
The Environmental Fund (or “Eco Fund”) in Slovenia was established in 1993 as a legal public entity to support
investments in environmental protection. Its main sources of financing include earmarked asset funds (revenues
from privatizations), donations, obligations and funds borrowed from national and international institutions. In
2010, the total assets of the Eco Fund amounted to €181 million with a self -sustaining financing rate of around
64 percent. Since 1995, the Eco Fund has provided soft loans and guarantees to companies, municipalities, and
households for EE and RE investments.
In 2008 the Eco Fund began supporting implementation of the NEEAP through a household grant scheme. The
grants support EE and RE investments in existing residential buildings, construction of low-energy and passive
houses, and installation of low-carbon and efficient energy sources (such as solar heating systems, high-
efficiency wood biomass boilers, and heat pumps).
Between 2008 and 2011 the Fund provided households with more than 28,000 grants, worth a total of €39.6
million, for eligible investment projects. The grants were mainly for window replacements (30 percent), thermal
insulation of the façade (23 percent), and installation of solar panels (19 percent) and biomass boilers (10
percent). Also, between 2004 and 2010, the Eco Fund provided €75 million in soft loans for EE and RE projects.

     In an interest buy-down, the EE Fund subsidizes a portion of the interest rate assessed by the lender.

Option 2. Commercial Bank Financing
One of the more common mechanisms for financing residential EE programs is through
commercial bank lending programs. Often this takes the form of IFI/donor credit lines to
commercial banks for on-lending to residential consumers. The purpose of such credit lines is to
provide a dedicated source of financing for homeowners, particularly in markets where no
commercial bank lending exists for residential EE improvements. Such schemes can also (i)
create interest in, and capacity for, financing EE projects on the part of commercial banks and (ii)
support the transition toward market-based, scaled-up EE programs.
Most loans are offered to customers on a commercial basis (i.e., at prevailing interest rates) to
avoid creating market distortions or competitive advantages for certain banks. However,
depending on market conditions, funding sources, and target markets (e.g., special credit lines for
low-income households), credit lines may offer longer tenors and other favorable terms (e.g.,
partial grants in the form of loan forgiveness) in order to stimulate the market, demonstrate
commercial viability or achieve other goals with socioeconomic benefits. Credit lines are often
supported by TA to help standardize project appraisal methods and procedures, increase deal flow
and reduce transaction costs, and strengthen participating banks’ capacity to identify and manage
project risks. An example of commercial bank financing is the Poland Thermo-Modernization
(TM) Program (Box 6).

Box 6. The Thermo-Modernization Program in Poland
The TM Program was launched in 1998 with the aim of (i) improving EE in residential, non-commercial and
public buildings and (ii) promoting the use of RE and co-generation in local heating systems. The program
provides a 20 percent subsidy (“TM Bonus”) on commercial bank loans for eligible projects. TM Bonuses are
financed from the state budget and managed by the state-owned Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego (BGK).
The program operates through 16 participating banks that provide loans for EE projects to HOAs, cooperatives,
individuals, municipalities, local authorities, and commercial companies. Clients submit combined loan and TM
Bonus applications, including an energy audit, to one of the participating banks. After approval and
implementation of the EE measures, TM Bonuses are provided to participating banks and passed on to clients in
the form of reduced outstanding principal of the loan ( “loan forgiveness”).
Since 1998 the TM Program has supported more than 24,000 EE projects, with about 90 percent being
implemented in residential buildings. The total value of EE investments catalyzed by the program is estimated at
US$3 billion, including US$2.3 billion in commercial bank financing. A sample of audits suggests an estimated
annual energy savings of 3,636 GWh and annual emission reductions of 1.4 million tCO2. Since 1998 the state
budget has allocated about Zl 1.42 billion (US$450 million) in subsidies.

Option 3. Credit Guarantees
A credit guarantee (CG) is a risk-sharing mechanism (or “facility”) designed to encourage
commercial banks to finance EE projects for the premises of marginally creditworthy client by
partly covering potential losses from loan defaults. Under the general structure of a CG, a public
or private agency (e.g., a development bank, insurance company, or IFI/donor) signs guarantee
facility agreements (GFAs) with participating commercial banks to issue project- or portfolio-
based loan guarantees that cover a portion of loan losses from defaults. Although the actual
amount or percentage of the covered loss may vary, the typical guarantee is for a 50-50 sharing of
the losses between the bank and the CG facility. 24 Other GFAs are structured as a “first loss”
facility that absorbs 100 percent of the losses up to a specified amount.

Participating banks sign loan agreements with residential customers specifying loan terms and
conditions, and assume the primary responsibility for conducting due diligence and processing
the loans. The CG facility may specify certain project or borrower eligibility criteria, terms and
conditions for the project appraisals, rights to approve specific projects or project portfolios
and/or provisions of TA to commercial banks or other market actors. In case of loan defaults, the
CG facility would cover the specified portion of the loss.
Although such instruments can be an effective way to stimulate commercial bank lending, banks
must have (i) large enough project pipelines to justify such schemes and (ii) enough clients that
would benefit from the moderate credit enhancement that the CG facility would provide. An
example of a CG is IFC’s Commercializing EE Finance (CEEF) Program in Central and Eastern
Europe (Box 7).

Box 7. IFC’s Commercializing EE Finance Program in Central and Eastern Europe
Launched in April 2003 as a joint program of IFC and GEF, the CEEF Program sought to enhance commercial
financing of EE investments in six countries in Eastern and Central Europe (the Czech Republic, Estonia,
Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, and the Slovak Republic). The program offered partial credit guarantees, using a 50
percent pari passu risk-sharing structure, to 14 participating banks for loans to EE projects in buildings,
industrial processes, and other energy end-use applications. In addition, the program also provided TA to
participating banks and ESCO business in order to help preparing bankable project pipelines and to build
capacity in the EE market.
Between 2003 and 2008 CEEF provided US$49.5 million in partial guarantees for more than 800 EE projects
with total investments of more than US$200 million. Around 70 percent of the projects focused on EE
improvements in multi-family residential buildings, and more than 40 project developers and ESCOs were
involved in implementing the program. Overall, the default rate was less than 0.5 percent.

Option 4. Utility EE Programs
A growing set of countries have developed regulations to encourage or oblige their utilities to
implement EE programs, given their technical capacity and their relationship with energy users.
Demand-side management (DSM) programs in the United States showed that utilities could
successfully implement residential EE programs; similar schemes have been implemented in Asia
and Latin America with good results. A variation of utility EE programs are utility EE obligations
(EEOs), primarily used in the EU. Experience with EEOs is expected to increase significantly in
the EU, given that the new EE Directive25 includes provisions on EEOs with a savings target
equal to 1.5 percent of retail energy sales per year from 2014 to 2020. Typically, EEOs are
regulatory requirements on energy suppliers to meet defined EE targets, with financial penalties
for failure to achieve the targets. The costs of the EE investments required to achieve the target
are usually recovered through the tariff mechanisms. EEOs may be combined with a “white
certificate” trading scheme, under which excess savings achieved by one utility may be purchased
by a utility that is in a deficit position relative to the target. 26 Although utilities can be well placed
to undertake such programs, governments must carefully develop regulatory mechanisms to
address potential conflicts with their traditional business of energy sales.
In the EU, EEOs have been implemented in Belgium, Denmark, France, Ireland, Italy, the
Netherlands, and the U.K., where the residential sector has been a major target market. To meet
the obligations, the utilities may (i) directly implement EE measures in residential buildings, (ii)
engage contractors to do the implementation, (iii) purchase energy savings achieved by others, or

(iv) establish a fund that can be utilized for EE measure implementation. Formal measurement,
reporting, and verification of the savings are required. Box 8 presents a case study of the EEO
program in Italy.
Box 8. EE Obligations in Italy
The Italian EEO scheme, initiated by the Legislative Decrees of March 1999 and May 2000, obligates all
electricity and natural gas suppliers to meet specified savings targets. Trading is allowed through a “white
certificate” scheme that establishes incentives for exceeding, and penalties for not meeting, the targets. The
cost recovery is achieved through a common tariff surcharge. The cumulative aggregate targets are as follows:

                   Target
     Year         (Mtoe)*

The results indicate that 80 percent savings have been achieved in the residential sector. There are several
options for measurement and verification (M&V), including deemed savings,** deemed savings with some
measurements, and metering. Most of the installed measures have been simple, such as efficient lighting
(mostly compact fluorescent lamps) and low-flow showerheads, with some heating and residential appliances.

** The deemed savings methodology estimates the energy savings from a project by previously agreed means, usually
based on engineering estimates, instead of requiring actual measurements of savings.

3. Roadmap for Scaling Up EE in Buildings
Accelerating the pace of building renovation programs in the Western Balkans will require a two-
pronged approach: broadening the portfolio of government interventions and deepening
implementation efforts. The first requires government actions in the five key areas noted in
Section 1—enacting legislation, adopting policy and regulatory enhancements, improving market
conditions, expanding finance and implementation, and building local capacity (Figure 7).
Deepening implementation efforts is the subject of this section.
Figure 7. Framework for Successful EE Programs in Buildings

Recent building renovation projects implemented by the World Bank and others donors in the
Western Balkans have demonstrated that substantial energy savings can be achieved with
reasonable paybacks and substantial co-benefits.27 However, these projects, most of which have
been in the public sector, have also shown some limitations of current approaches, such as:
        Limited linkages between ongoing policy enhancements and investment programs;
        Limited replication of pilot and demonstration programs;
        Lack of sustainability of project implementation models and staff (i.e., PIUs);
        Difficulties in scaling up renovation projects beyond about 20–30 buildings per year; and
        Lack of private sector involvement (from ESCOs, for instance) in mobilizing financing
         and assuming technical (or performance) risks.


27
  For example, EE projects in public buildings in FYR Macedonia, Montenegro, and Serbia have demonstrated energy/cost
savings of 30–45 percent per building, with payback periods of 6–8 years. Corollary benefits included improved comfort,
better health (reduced sick days), increased public/student awareness about EE, and urban renewal.

Because the two main tools have been loans and grants, and because loans are restricted to only
the most creditworthy municipalities or households while grants typically go to the poorest ones,
there remains a large unserved “middle market.” Despite a series of government and donor
projects, countries have had limited success moving up the financing ladder and sufficiently
catalyzing the market to sustain itself.
Therefore, the following principles are offered to help foster and accelerate scalable
implementation:
       Require all public funds to revolve, which will oblige public and other beneficiaries to
        repay the investment costs based on the energy cost savings.
       Prioritize leverage of public funds through a variety of strategies —such as requirements
        for borrower co-financing or contributions, pooling of donor funds, commercial co-
        financing, or performance-based contractor payments.
       Offer multiple financing products/instruments to serve both municipal and residential
        markets.
       Introduce explicit mechanisms to develop, test, and replicate successful ESCO models.
       Develop national-level, sustainable implementation and financing models and
        institutional setups that can recover costs, sustain themselves across individual project
        periods, and expand as the market develops and demand increases.
       Foster multiple strategies to increase the pace of retrofits—from bundling of projects to
        benefit from economies of scale, to wholesale models that rely on a variety of
        decentralized delivery mechanisms, to challenges and competitions that help stimulate
        participation.
Adopting these principles will require that the governments advance from donor-driven projects
to country-led programs with a balance of policies, regulations with enforcement, financing and
incentive programs, and information and education. Of course, even the introduction of simple
concepts, like repaying the upfront investment costs for public entities, may involve a set of more
complex changes to the current systems. For instance, (i) public entities must show energy bill
payment discipline and be subject to cost-reflective energy pricing and consumption-based
billing; (ii) the government should allow public entities to retain energy budget savings to allow
them to repay the investments; and (iii) public entities must first meet basic comfort levels before
energy savings can be realized. Further, accelerated efforts are needed to complete the policy and
regulatory packages related to EE in buildings, such as (a) adopting and enforcing building
codes/certificates, material/appliance standards, and appliance labeling and (b) completing
building databases.
The preliminary roadmap presented is based on these principles and follows the findings from the
Assessment Framework and lessons from regional and international experience. The first part
focuses on the public and municipal sectors and the second on the residential or household sector.

A. Roadmap for Scaling Up EE in Public Buildings
As outlined in Section 1 on the Assessment Framework, a number of key regional gaps in the
public sector have made achieving significant energy savings a major challenge (Figure 8). While
the gaps do differ among countries, the gaps presented are common to at least half of the
countries analyzed. Addressing these gaps will require a mix of policy and program instruments
in each of the five key areas. The Roadmap for the Public Sector presented in Figure 9 seeks to (i)
highlight key actions governments and donors can take, (ii) to sequence and prioritize them, and
(iii) to estimate relative timelines for achieving them. It should also be noted that this roadmap is
based on regional characteristics; some countries may already making progress in several areas.

There is a wealth of existing literature on many of the actions contained in the roadmap. The
following section will only briefly elaborate on the roadmap’s initial recommendations, as these
focus more on deepening financing and implementation, which is a key gap noted earlier. It also
complements the important policy and other TA and capacity building being provided by other
donors in the region.

Recommendation 1. Select and Implement Sustainable Public Financing Scheme(s)
Now that a decade or more of primarily donor-driven pilot and demonstration projects have laid
the groundwork, the countries in the Western Balkans need to shift to national-level public
building programs with appropriate, sustainable financing scheme(s) that follow the principles
Final Report                                 Page 31                                  June 2014
                             Western Balkans: Scaling Up Energy Efficiency in Buildings


presented above and options outlined in Section 2. Broad stakeholder consultations are
recommended to ensure that the mechanism(s) selected and designs adopted reflect the needs of
the various market actors, financiers, and target borrowers.

Recommendation 2. Adjust Public Procurement/Regulations, Including ESCO Procurement and
Budget Retention28
Public sector agencies typically have rigid procurement and budgeting rules that they see as
necessary to ensure proper use of public funds and value for money. Unfortunately, sometimes
these rules can encourage the opposite—by favoring lower-cost equipment that has much higher
operating costs over its life-span. Public agencies that try to amortize these higher upfront costs
may be prevented from entering into multiyear contracts or retaining energy cost savings that
may be needed to pay contracts in later years. Therefore, the Western Balkan countries generally
need to adjust public sector regulations in some key areas.
        Multi-year contracting. Without multi-year budgeting, public agencies typically cannot
         enter into multi-year contracts, since they would not be allowed to commit future funding
         that has not yet been appropriated. Borrowing or contracting over multiple years is often
         necessary for EE improvements, as it allows public agencies to amortize the higher
         upfront costs over several years. The introduction of 3–5 year budget planning, such as
         under the medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF),29 can help reconcile multiyear
         obligations within the annual budget envelope, provided that the budget planning process
         is sufficiently robust. Some countries—Germany, South Korea, and the United States
         among them—have also amended budgeting or procurement laws specifically to allow
         public entities to enter into multi-year contracts, including ESPCs.
        Retention of energy costs savings. Without the ability to keep cost savings, most public
         agencies in the Western Balkans lack the incentive to implement EE measures. Such rules
         also constrain the agencies’ ability to repay loans or enter into multi-year ESPCs if the
         payments would be derived from energy cost savings in future years. Municipalities and
         some autonomous entities (e.g., hospitals and schools) receive budgetary allocations
         based on a formula and thus may not experience budgetary reductions if energy costs go
         down. Resolving this often requires amending existing budgeting rules and procedures to
         allow public agencies to retain the energy savings at least for the length of the ESPC or
         EE loan period. (The first column in Figure 10 includes other options for budget retention
         based on international experiences.)
        Exclusion of ESPC/ESA repayments from public debt. Since ESPCs and ESAs are long-
         term contractual obligations, many countries have concluded that these commitments
         should not be treated as public debt.30 Given the limited public debt capacity in the region,
         similar decisions taken by MOFs would encourage public agencies or municipalities to
         undertake EE measures because they would not have to reprioritize their other
         investments.
        Facilitate procurement of ESCOs. There is consensus that ESPCs can greatly facilitate
         EE implementation and help mobilize commercial financing for the public sector.
         Unfortunately, ESPC procurement can be complex, since this type of contract (i) is a
         blend of goods, works, services, and sometimes financing; (ii) uses an output-based rather
         than input-based approach to defining the project scope; (iii) relies on a variety of cost
         factors for evaluation, which therefore necessitates a highest net present value (NPV)

         rather than a lowest-cost assessment; and (iv) requires payments based on performance
         (i.e., energy savings with agreed comfort levels and service quality), which requires
         credible baseline and post-project energy use data. While each of these issues can be
         complex, it is recommended to identify and build off of existing procurement precedents
         in other sectors that can serve as reference points. Recent procurement laws dealing with
         public-private partnerships (PPPs), management services contracts, output-based and
         performance-based infrastructure contracts, cost plus contracts, and so on offer models
         that deal with similar issues. Building on these precedents, efforts should then be
         undertaken to develop tailored bidding documents for simplified ESCO contracts that
         seek to (i) use simplified design and construction contracts; (ii) specify a minimum level
         of energy savings that must be achieved, rather than prescribing the specific EE measures
         to be installed; (iii) base selection on the highest NPV; and (iv) link at least partial
         payments (20–30 percent) to a commissioning test (comparing post-project with promised
         NPV) and one deferred payment (e.g., 6–12 months after commissioning). Lessons from
         international experience reveal a continuum of approaches to allow and promote public
         procurement of ESCOs (Figure 10).31
        Encouraging or requiring purchase of energy-efficient equipment. Five main purchasing
         policies and program models have been used to require or encourage public agencies to
         procure energy-efficient equipment such as lighting products, office equipment, pumps,
         and windows. These are as follows: (i) EE appliance labels (e.g., Australia, China, EU,
         Japan, United States); (ii) development of catalogues of technical specifications related to
         energy performance (e.g., EU, Japan, Mexico, United States); (iii) life-cycle costing or
         “best value” awards, which look at the lowest-cost product over the life-span of a piece of
         equipment (e.g., Australia, EU, United States); (iv) preferences for energy-efficient
         products that exceed minimum standards (e.g. Australia, China, EU, Japan, South Korea,
         United States); and (v) development of lists of qualifying energy-efficient products (e.g.,
         China, EU, South Korea, United States).

Recommendation 3. Use Consumption-Based Billing for Public Buildings
Currently, most public buildings connected to district heating (DH) networks are billed on the
basis of heated floor area, providing no incentive to reduce energy use. Transitioning to
consumption-based billing is thus critical to provide proper price signals to public building
owners/managers and create energy cost savings cash flows from which EE loans can be repaid.
Although in Albania, Kosovo, and Montenegro less than 5 percent of non-residential buildings
are connected to DH systems, connection rates in the remaining three countries range from 12 to
40 percent. (The remaining buildings are heated by decentralized heating systems such as
building-level boilers or electrical or biomass heaters, and are generally subject to fuel costs
based on actual consumption.)
Therefore, while public agencies should be required to transition to consumption-based billing,
particularly if they wish to benefit from a government renovation program, it need not be a
precondition for such programs. Metering should be a required first step, both to measure actual
baseline consumption and to assess expected changes in budgetary provisions resulting from the
change in billing practices. This should be followed by temperature reading and controls, so that
baseline comfort levels are recorded and positive behavior for lowering indoor heating
temperatures is rewarded. Temperature controls can be introduced at either the substation level or
the building level. However, to move to consumption-based billing, installation of temperature
controls at building level (and associated construction of substations) is usually required.32
Recommendation 4. Develop and Pilot Simplified ESCO Contracts
Currently, the ESCO market is underdeveloped in the Western Balkans, with only a handful of
active companies. While the EE markets continue to develop, there is little measureable progress
to foster successful ESCO models and businesses. Part of the challenge rests with the
underdeveloped legal frameworks for ESCOs, which would lay out the rules and requirements for
ESCOs operating in a given market. Equally important is the need to develop appropriate
business models, simplified for the given market conditions, to help create a platform from which
the industry can build and evolve over time. A variety of ESCO business models are currently
being implemented around the world, ranging from full-service/high-risk contracts to low-
service/low-risk contracts (Figure 11), with those deemed most relevant for the Western Balkans
in the near-term in the circle.

International ESCOs, and some local ones, can generally mobilize quickly in a given market if
the market signals are correct. Most assess three conditions that need to be met:
    1. Predictable and stable demand for ESCO services, which the public sector is often best
       placed to provide;
    2. Reliable sources of local financing with creditworthy clients, which strong sustainable
       financing schemes can address; and
    3. Clearly defined rules for how ESCOs are expected to operate in a given market, which the
       public sector can provide within its public tenders—such as guidelines for defining
       baselines, requirements for audits, sources of financing, rules for payments and
       verification, and so on.

Recommended Donor Actions to Support the Scale-Up of EE Programs in Public Buildings
In addition to the roadmap, which sets out a series of actions for the governments to take in order
to scale-up the volume and pace of implementation, IFIs and other donors should also be
encouraged to undertake and agree to the following actions:
       Phase out pilot, grant-funded renovations in public buildings and support creation of
        sustainable schemes including pooling of financing with other donors;
       Help develop simplified ESCO contracts and standardize successful EE project/ESCO
        models to lower transaction costs (e.g., audit templates, ESCO bidding documents, M&V
        protocols, EE calculators);
       Provide support to complete policy and regulatory frameworks, as well as necessary
        amendments to public sector regulations and procedures;
       Enhance systems to share best practices and lessons with public building EE investment
        programs; and
       Implement training and capacity building programs at all levels.

B. Roadmap for Scaling Up EE in Residential Buildings
Because households in the Western Balkans represent about 60-70 percent of energy use in
buildings, scaling up EE in residential buildings will be critical to achieving the national energy
savings targets by 2018. As noted in Section 2, achieving 9 percent of the energy savings
potential in this sector would require mobilizing some €2.7 billion, resulting in savings of €343
million and 6,162 GWh per year. EE improvements can also yield significant corollary benefits,
including enhanced comfort levels, improved building aesthetics (and home values), improved
health, and reduced vulnerability to future tariff increases (Box 9).
However, despite these well-documented opportunities and benefits, a number of specific barriers
continue to hamper implementation of scalable EE programs in residential buildings throughout
the region. Figure 12 provides an overview of these gaps based on the results of the Assessment
Framework presented in Section 1.
Although international experience shows that a variety of tools and instruments are available to
address these barriers, they need to be carefully selected, adapted, and designed to suit local
conditions. To achieve the vast EE potential at a reasonable scale, actions in all five areas noted
above will be required. Further, engagement across a broad range of stakeholders —including
national and local governments, building/home owners, HOAs, building developers, construction
companies, financiers, manufacturers, and energy utilities—is also needed. The Roadmap for the
Residential Sector presented in Figure 13 proposes specific actions for governments to initiate,
with recommended priority, sequencing, and timelines. As with the Roadmap for the Public
Sector (Figure 9), this roadmap is based on regional conditions; some countries may have already
progressed in certain areas.

Box 9. Can Households in the Western Balkans Afford Energy Efficiency?
Residential EE is significantly more complex than other sectors for a variety of reasons: its heterogeneous
nature and the presence of multifamily housing and HOAs, norm-based billing for heating, lower income levels
and creditworthiness, lower levels of comfort (i.e., under-
heating), and individual homeowner behavior. So can they
afford EE? A recently study in Kosovo, the region’s poorest
country, confirmed that in almost all cases, energy savings
could pay for EE investments while allowing households
modest increases in comfort levels to meet heating norms
without increasing their monthly energy expenditure—even
with modest tariff adjustments. This requires credit schemes
to be developed with sufficiently long tenors to cover the
higher payback periods. If this is not possible—due to
excessively high investment costs, low energy pricing, low
comfort levels, and so on—a onetime investment subsidy may
be needed, particularly for low-income households (see graph
at right).
Similarly, a World Bank report on energy subsidy reform in the Europe and Central Asia region concluded that
                                                                            EE incentive programs should
                                                                            be coupled with planned tariff
                                                                            adjustments to help mitigate the
                                                                            impact on households. The

As with the public sector roadmap, there is substantial information available in all of the topics
noted in the residential roadmap. As illustrated, this roadmap does require more parallel actions
to be taken given the more complex nature of the sector. And some countries may have different
policy and political priorities, which may require some adjustments to the sequencing of specific
actions. The following section discusses the roadmap’s key initial recommendations.

Recommendation 1. Implement Financing and Incentive Schemes for Family Homes
While multifamily apartments offer very high EE potential, they are also more difficult to address
given the presence of HOAs and billing based on heated floor area rather than on actual
consumption. The vertical piping schemes commonly used in many buildings also pose technical
challenges. Therefore, it is recommended to start with si mpler programs targeting “family
homes” (1–2 dwellings per building) that have either building-level metering or no access to
district heating (to ensure their bills are based on actual consumption). In the Western Balkans,
such buildings are a relatively high share of the regional building stock (in some countries more
than 50 percent) and represent the largest EE potential (345,500 MWh per year). 33 This would
better allow the programs to develop and refine various financing schemes and implementation
models, begin collecting information on actual energy savings, refine awareness and outreach
campaigns, and begin to develop the EE service industry.
In addition, given the widespread use of traditional woody biomass in the region, the selected
financing/delivery scheme(s) should specifically assess the possibility of including targeted
financing and incentive elements to improve the efficiency of heating stoves in residential
buildings. Currently, the share of households using biomass in urban areas varies from 34 percent
(Albania and Serbia) to almost 90 percent (Kosovo). In rural areas, households relying on

biomass are 51 percent in Albania and 89–98 percent in the other five countries.34 Corollary
benefits from switching to more efficient stoves (or alternative heating options) include reduced
indoor air pollution, improved indoor comfort, and reduced deforestation.35

Recommendation 2. Increase Information Outreach
A key challenge with residential owners is their heterogeneous nature, which affects how they
make purchasing and investment decisions, how they operate appliances and heating systems, and
what levels of comfort they require. Although proper awareness campaigns and public education
cannot easily overcome these issues, they can provide a base level of information from which
more informed decisions can be made. Information programs can involve a range of media, from
utility fliers to public posters to radio/TV spots to websites.
Information outreach can also greatly facilitate positive actions by homeowners that decide to
pursue EE improvements, by showing how to get started. In particular, websites that gather the
relevant information—such as examples of other homes that have undertaken EE, measures that
can be taken based on the building type, EE calculators, lists of certified service providers and
equipment suppliers, contact details for financing and incentive programs, and advice for working
through HOAs—can offer a simple “one-stop shop” and reduce the transaction costs associated
with undertaking EE. Periodic surveys should be done to assess the effectiveness of these
activities along with feedback mechanisms to improve them.

Recommendation 3. Follow a Balanced Approach to Consumption-Based Billing36
Consumption-based billing is critical because it gives homeowners the pricing signals and
incentives they need to reduce their energy use. Without it, EE measures cannot create the energy
cost savings cash flows from which EE loans can be repaid. Fortunately, this is not as significant
an issue as it is in other countries, since the share of residential buildings connected to DH is
relatively low in the region—varying from 0 percent in Montenegro to 48 percent in FYR
Macedonia.37 Still, transitioning to consumption-based billing schemes will be needed before
residential EE programs can be implemented at scale. Given the technical, political, and
institutional challenges associated with this transition, a two-phase approach is recommended:
     1. The first phase would focus on installing devices to allow customers to measure and
        control energy use at the building level. This would require the installation of building-
        level heat meters and temperature controls,38 which in turn would require the installation
        of individual heat substations with heat exchangers. To increase public acceptance of
        consumption-based billing systems, there is a need to demonstrate value for money by
        also improving DH service quality and reducing network losses. In Poland, for example,
        installation of building-level meters was done in parallel with improvements in the DH
        network: the building-level metering rate increased from around 21 percent to 100
        percent, while DH losses were reduced by about 50 percent between 1991 and 2000.39
        Consumers are generally more willing to accept changes in billing if there is a
        corresponding increase in service quality and visible effort to reduce service costs. Billing

   DH coverage in Albania is 2.5 percent; in Kosovo, 5 percent; in Bosnia and Herzegovina, 12 percent; and in Serbia, 27
percent.
38
   Temperature controls can also be installed at the substation level only. However, in this case, heat supply would depend on
the average demand of buildings served by the substation. Transitioning toward consumption-based billing will not be
possible without temperature control at the building level.

            based on actual energy use will also create an incentive for consumers and HOAs to
            improve building-wide EE, since all homeowners would benefit from reductions in
            building energy costs. An ESMAP study in Ukraine estimated that building-level heat
            consumption could be reduced by 15–25 percent by installing building-level metering and
            heat control devices coupled with rehabilitation of the associated distribution network.40
       2. The second phase would focus on installing devices to allow consumers to measure and
          control their energy use at the apartment level. This would require installation of
          thermostatic radiator valves (TRVs), bypass piping (if needed), and heat-cost allocators
          on all radiators in each apartment. In this case, the heating bill is usually allocated to
          individual apartments on the basis of floor area and the reading of the heat-cost allocators
          in each apartment.

Recommendation 4. Create Effective Homeowner Associations
For multifamily apartment buildings, organizations are typically needed to address common
owner issues, collect payment for municipal services (such as heating, water, and solid waste),
and address building-level maintenance and improvements. Although these tasks can be carried
out by facility management or maintenance companies, they are more often done by HOAs.
HOAs do need to have legal status in order to open bank accounts, borrow money for building
improvements, enter into contracts with service providers, and so on. They also need supporting
legislation to clarify how investment decisions can be made (e.g., 51 percent or simple majority
or 100 percent). While simple repairs and maintenance can be done ad hoc by requesting small
contributions from each homeowner, more capital-intensive upgrades, such as those that involve
EE, require that HOAs request large contributions from each homeowner, set up and build
reserve or renovation accounts, or be able to borrow from commercial banks on behalf of owners.
The banks, in turn, need assurances that the owners will repay these loans. HOAs must ensure
that any EE benefits are fairly distributed across all homeowners and that good behavior (for
lower heat consumption) is rewarded. Proper monitoring of energy savings can also help avoid

The Need for a Multi-Pronged Approach
Scaling up EE improvements in residential buildings is complex and requires a multi-pronged,
phased approach combining six elements: metering, customer controls, pricing and billing
reforms, incentives, financing, and information and education (Figure 14).

Ultimately, lessons learned from international experience show that implementing EE programs
in the residential sector at scale is very resource intensive and requires both a long-term
commitment and sector reforms that help to create an enabling environment and proper
incentives. When marketing EE to households, the substantial energy cost savings and corollary
benefits, such as improved comfort, should be highlighted. Supporting regulations to address
HOA governance and borrowing, metering and billing reforms, heating controls, and appliance
labeling and building codes/certificates are critical to help to drive the market. Finally, the
development of accompanying programs to provide accessible and affordable financing, targeted
incentives, information, training, and so forth can help homeowners implement the EE measures.

4. Detailed Guidance Notes
The key findings and results of the project’s first phase, as summarized in this report, were
presented in June 2013 at a regional workshop in Vienna at which stakeholder delegations from
all six Western Balkan countries were represented. This report reflects the discussions and
feedback received at the conference. It was also circulated and shared with the Energy
Community Secretariat, donors, government counterparts, and other stakeholders.
Workshop participants were also invited to vote for specific areas for more in-depth review in the
second phase of the project. The three areas receiving the most interest were (i) establishing and
operationalizing an EE Revolving Fund, (ii) municipal budgeting and financing, and (iii)
residential financing and incentive programs. A second tier of topics included (iv) energy service
business models and market development, (v) transitioning to consumption-based billing, (vi)
utility residential EE programs, and (vii) low-income household EE programs.
The first four areas were selected as topics for detailed guidance notes. These were developed in
the second phase, presented at a May 2014 workshop in Vienna, and subsequently finalized. The
full guidance notes are available from the authors on request; the executive summaries of each are
included in Annex D.

Annex D: Guidance Notes—Executive Summaries
This annex contains the executive summaries from each of the four guidance notes prepared in
Phase 2. The complete guidance notes are available from the authors upon request.

1. Establishing and Operationalizing an Energy Efficiency Revolving Fund
An energy efficiency revolving fund (EERF) is a viable option for scaling up energy efficiency
(EE) financing in the public sector in the Western Balkans. Under a typical EERF targeting the
public sector, loans are provided to public agencies to cover the initial investment costs of EE
projects; some of the resulting savings are then used to repay the EERF until the original
investment is recovered, plus interest and service charges. The repayments can then be used to
finance additional projects, thereby allowing the capital to revolve creating a sustainable
financing mechanism.
Since both the borrower and lender are publicly owned, such funds may often offer lower-cost
financing with longer tenors (repayment periods) and less-stringent security requirements than
typical commercial loans. Because EE projects have positive financial rates of return, capturing
these cost savings and reusing them for new investments creates a more efficient use of public
funds than typical budget- or grant-funded approaches. This can help demonstrate the commercial
viability of EE investments and provide credit histories for public agencies, paving the way for
future commercial financing.
This guidance note is intended for government decision makers interested in establishing such EE
revolving funds.41 It defines the typical structure of such funds, conditions under which they can
be useful and effective, ways they can address some of the financing barriers, and implementation
options. The note also provides examples, case studies, and lessons learned, and a "roadmap" for
establishing such funds.
The typical structure of an EERF is illustrated in Figure D1.
Figure D1. Typical Structure of an EERF




An EERF is generally capitalized from a range of sources, such as concessional loan or grant
funds from donor agencies, government budget allocations, special tariffs or levies on electricity
sales, petroleum taxes, revenue bonds, environmental charges, or other sources. The fund then

   There are many different types of EE funds, some of which provide budget- or donor-supported grants and incentives to
EE projects or specific financial assistance to EE programs. However, this guidance note focuses only on EE revolving funds
that finance EE projects and are repaid from the energy savings to allow the fund to revolve in a sustainable manner.

                       Western Balkans: Scaling Up Energy Efficiency in Buildings

provides financing to public agencies to finance EE investments in public sector buildings and
other facilities, such as street lighting. The agencies can then use the accrued energy cost savings
to repay the principal and interest on the debt. The installation and other services for project
implementation would generally be provided by independent energy service providers (ESPs).
The establishment of an EERF generally requires the development of a legal framework
comprising national legislation as well as supporting secondary legislation or regulations that will
define the structure of the EERF. Options include creating the fund under an existing ministry,
energy agency, or development bank; creating a new legal entity (independent corporation or new
statutory agency); not-for-profit entity; or establishing a public-private partnership (PPP).
The fund structure should also define the management and governance. This includes oversight
arrangements; selection of the fund manager or management team; and monitoring, evaluation,
and reporting procedures.
An EERF should be designed to serve the needs of all public agencies. Therefore, in addition to
debt financing (i.e., loans) for EE projects, the EERF may have other financing options, or
“windows,” that may include energy service agreements, risk guarantees, grants, and budget
capture; this guidance note presents a summary of these options.
The EERF should also provide technical assistance to public agencies and ESPs, and may provide
procurement and implementation services that will transfer some of the implementation risk to
ESPs and facilitate the development of an energy services market. The guidance note summarizes
how an EERF can overcome the barriers to scaling up EE in the public sector and provides a step-
by-step approach to operationalizing such a fund.
The key lessons learned from international experience (including the four case studies presented
in Annexes A–D) are as follows:
       There are six main prerequisite conditions: (i) government commitment to improving EE
        in public facilities; (ii) cost-effective opportunities for improving EE; (iii) an existing
        demand for financing EE projects; (iv) lack of available financing for EE projects; (v)
        existence of a mechanism to repay the fund from the achieved savings; and (vi) energy
        payment discipline with cost-reflective, consumption-based billing among public end
        users.
       An EE revolving fund is best established as an independent organization governed by
        a government-appointed board of governors or board of trustees comprising both
        public sector and private sector members.
       When selecting a fund manager—which may be an individual or an organization but
        is called the “fund manager” in either case—options include an independent, newly
        created organization; an existing non-independent public agency; a national
        development bank; a utility; or another public enterprise.
       To be sustainable, the EERF may require one or more accessible funding sources to
        ensure recapitalization over time.
The major steps involved in establishing an EERF are summarized in Figure D2.

2. Municipal Budgeting and Financing
To support energy efficiency (EE) capital investments in municipal public buildings and services
in the Western Balkans region, this guidance note outlines current regional policies and
procedures for municipal budgeting and financing, identifies shortcomings, and presents a
“roadmap” of recommended options for improvement. These recommendations can help support
capital investments for providing a variety of municipal services, not just those for EE.
In general, municipal budgeting is more centralized in the region than in the rest of the EU, with
local government revenues representing only about 11-25 percent of consolidated public
revenues. Further, the heavy use of “conditional transfers” from national to lo cal budgets further
diminishes municipalities’ authority to allocate funding based on their priorities. In three
countries—Albania, Kosovo, and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia —local
governments receive more than 40 percent of their revenues from conditional or earmarked grants
from their national governments. Despite this, capital investments (and the need for additional
investments) are higher than in the rest of the EU because of chronic underinvestment over the
past two decades. Although the current process of fiscal decentralization is designed to increase
local governments’ budgetary autonomy, progress has been relatively slow.
Municipal budgeting practices and lack of access to finance further restrict municipal efforts to
reduce operating costs through EE. Municipalities’ one-year budgeting, inability to retain energy
cost savings in future years, line item budgeting, and other practices make investing in EE much
more difficult. Similarly, many municipalities in the region face substantial limitations on
borrowing, some do not have sufficiently strong accounting for commercial bank lending, most

assets to collateralize loans; all this makes it increasingly difficult for viable EE projects to secure
appropriate financing.
The guidance note describes these barriers and points to a range of solutions that other
countries—from across the EU and beyond—have used to overcome these same difficulties. The
Western Balkan countries will need to carefully select and adapt these solutions to suit their
individual needs.
Selected main findings and lessons are as follows:
       EE investments in public buildings are usually not a high priority for local government
        officials. The major reason for this is the lack of information and awareness of local
        decision makers regarding the need and economic potential for improving EE in
        municipal public buildings; this is urgently needed.
       Municipal energy planning can be an important means of improving EE in municipal
        public buildings; its application is supported by national EE Laws.
       Implementation of EE measures identified in Municipal Energy Efficiency Action Plans
        (MEEAPs) needs financial support either from the national government or from the
        private sector in the form of energy service companies (ESCOs).
       A legal framework that allows municipalities to establish long-term contracts with
        ESCOs is in place in four of the six countries, with Bosnia and Herzegovina and
        Macedonia being the exceptions. The development and implementation of ESCO projects
        are now impeded by the local municipalities’ lack of relevant capacity. Both
        municipalities and potential ESCOs lack experience and trust in long-term cooperation.
Recommended milestones in the fields of municipal finances and budgeting, which should be
including in a roadmap for the scaling up EE in public buildings in the Western Balkans are as
follows:
    1. Implementation of EE issues as a criterion for allocating national investment funds
       (“conditional subsidies”).
    2. Earmarking of funds provided through national EE funds for municipalities.
    3. Establishment of specific national support programs for EE in municipalities.
    4. Development, implementation, monitoring, and regular updating of local EE action plans
       (MEEAPs and SEAPs).
    5. Introduction of energy accounting in municipal budgeting and finance.
    6. Establishment of national grant programs supporting the development of local energy
       action plans and energy audits in municipal buildings.
    7. Establishment of national support programs for the introduction of energy management
       systems in municipalities.
    8. Establishment of national support programs for the setup and implementation of ESCO
       models in municipal public buildings and services.
    9. Improvement of the ability of municipalities to access credit.
Further development and implementation of this roadmap should be based on a broad consensus
among the six national governments, local authorities and their associations, and the international
donor community. It should be reviewed and updated on an annual or similar basis.

3. Financing Energy Efficiency Measures for Residential Building Stock
Within the Western Balkans region, a secure energy supply is critical to sustaining economic
growth. Currently, the region relies heavily on imported hydrocarbons and maintains high energy
intensity relative to GDP. This places a huge burden on companies, which require affordable and

reliable infrastructure services to be competitive; the public sector, which spends significant
budgetary resources on energy; and households, which have to pay a high portion of their income
for energy services. As energy pricing is further rationalized, a higher burden will be placed on
all sectors, especially poorer households.
The residential sector is a significant energy consumer. Its share of total final energy consumption
ranges from 28 percent to 32 percent (compared with the EU average of 27 percent). Fairly
simple renovations such as insulation, heating system upgrades, and improvements to windows
and lighting could reduce consumption in this sector by some 9 percent, with payback periods
generally under 8 years. Such improvements could help ease the impact of future tariff increases
while helping reduce the region’s projected energy supply/de mand gap.
Unfortunately, there are a number of barriers preventing energy efficiency (EE) measures from
being implemented in Western Balkans countries. Key ones have included:
       Pricing barriers: energy subsidies, absence of consumption-based billing, affordability,
        high cost of commercial financing;
       Technical barriers: lack of access to district heating (DH) or centralized heating in
        apartment buildings, lack of metering where DH/centralized systems exist, poor building
        maintenance, underheating, and lack of controls to adjust temperature levels;
       Legal and regulatory barriers: insufficient building code enforcement, apartment
        privatization and building ownership, and homeowner association (HOA) legislation; and
       Information: lack of awareness of EE and potential benefits, lack of information about
        how to implement EE measures, and limited information on quality/standards for EE
        materials/appliances
Governments have introduced a variety of policies, incentives, and financing/implementation
programs to help remove these barriers. These include:
       Financial mechanisms: EE measures stimulated by subsidies, loans, or price fluctuations;
       Fiscal mechanisms: EE activities financed and/or stimulated by the use of taxes;
       Delivery mechanisms: EE activities stimulated by the availability of specific assistance or
        imposition of certain legal obligations; and
       Institutions: EE activities developed/managed by public institutions.
Lessons learned can be summarized as follows:
       The implementing agency and delivery channels should be structured to maximize the
        chances for widespread deployment of funds.
       The administrative burden placed on fund recipients should be tailored to the segment
        targeted.
       Standardization of supporting tools for smaller projects is a success factor.
       Although the level of incentive must be tailored to local market conditions, it should be
        clearly linked with supporting long-term growth on a commercial basis.
       The types of incentives should be consistent with the goal of supporting integrated
        projects that provide substantial savings.
A roadmap for improving EE is presented below. Taking into account the current situation in the
Western Balkans, experiences from other countries (particularly of the new EU member or EU11
states (EU-MS), and lessons learned from the many EE programs launched in the EU, the
following steps are recommended for improving EE and for supporting achievement of National
Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) targets:

       Step 1: Implement financing incentive schemes for single-family houses including stoves
        (no DH and no building-level meters)
       Step 2: Increase awareness and establish centers
       Step 3: Issue new building codes
       Step 4: Implement building-level DH metering
       Step 5: Improve HOA legislation to allow majority investment decisions financed through
        borrowing
       Step 6: Rehabilitate DH systems to reduce losses including reasonable expansion
       Step 7: Initiate transition to building-level, consumption-based billing
       Step 8: Request building certificates and appliance standards and labeling
       Step 9: Implement financing incentives for apartment buildings
       Step 10: Implement EE incentives to regularize illegal housing
       Step 11: Implement apartment-level heating-cost allocators as well as thermostatic
        radiator valves (TRVs) and consumption-based billing

4. Energy Services Market Development
The development of private sector energy service providers (ESPs), including energy service
companies (ESCOs), that specialize in energy efficiency (EE) project development and
implementation can help overcome some of the important barriers to scaling up implementation
of energy efficiency (EE) projects, particularly in the public sector. ESPs can offer a range of
services spanning the energy services value chain and provide the technical skills and resources
needed to identify and implement EE opportunities, perform services using performance based
contracts (thereby reducing the risks to the energy users), facilitate access to financing from
commercial lenders, and enable the energy users to pay for the services from the cost savings
achieved. However, the development of energy services markets faces a number of challenges
and there are few active ESPs in the Western Balkan countries.
International experience shows that the public sector market can encourage the establishment and
growth of ESPs by providing a stable demand for services, clear procurement rules, and access to
public financing. This guidance note defines a strategy and “roadmap” designed to help
governments in the Western Balkans develop ESPs in their countries.
The business models typically utilized by ESPs are illustrated in Figure D3.
While ESPs can provide many services using these business models, the establishment and
growth of ESPs face a number of challenges. In most developing countries, ESPs are small and
have limited technical and financial capabilities. Their ability to obtain commercial financing is
constrained by (i) their limited assets and weak balance sheets; (ii) their lack of or limited track
record in the market; (iii) the perception of commercial lenders that EE projects are highly risky;
and (iv) the lenders’ unfamiliarity with, and lack of technical due diligence capabilities to
properly appraise, EE projects. These constraints prevent them from accessing financing or
guaranteed savings, as with ESCOs in Western Europe and North America.

Governments can encourage the establishment and growth of ESP industries by undertaking a set
of legislative, regulatory, and policy initiatives targeted at (i) creating a large and stable demand
for energy services projects in the public sector; (ii) removing barriers to public procurement of
EE services and establishing clear regulations, rules, and procedures for public agencies to work
with ESPs; and (iii) facilitating adequate and affordable financing for ESP projects. As these
markets are catalyzed, ESP activity can then extend to private industry and commercial buildings,
this time using its stronger track record to access commercial financing.
This guidance note provides examples of actions taken by governments in many countries (such
as Armenia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, and India) to foster the
energy services market and help establish and grow ESPs in their countries. Experience from
these countries shows that governments need to adopt a three-pronged approach—involving
policy and regulatory initiatives, technical assistance (TA), and financing strategies —to build
ESP and public agency capacity, implement ESP projects in the public sector, and provide the
platform for moving to more complex implementation and financing models in the future. TA or
financing alone does not offer an effective strategy to overcome the multidimensional challenges
of ESP market development; efforts in all three areas are needed.
Key conclusions of this guidance note are that (i) there is no specific formula that can be
prescribed to instruct governments on how to develop energy services markets; and (ii) fostering
the ESP market requires governments to undertake a concerted set of legislative, regulatory,
policy, financing, and awareness/information initiatives. The roadmap in Figure D4 provides
guidance to governments on the various initiatives that may help them develop the energy
services markets in their countries.
