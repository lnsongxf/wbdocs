EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
While time and cost over-runs seem almost endemic in physical infrastructure projects in many countries,
they were perceived to be reaching substantial levels in some roadworks contracts in Sri Lanka. This pilot
study was formulated to identify any common sources of such over-runs and to discern any patterns. The
aim was to assess a sample of recent contracts, to identify typical levels of over-runs and any general patterns,
any common sources of over-runs, any common ‘causes’ that trigger over-runs from such sources, as well as
any potential areas for further investigation.

Data was sampled as planned, from two World Bank funded projects – the ‘Road Sector Assistance Project’
(RSAP) and the Provincial Roads Project (PRP). Apart from comparing with previous studies of related aspects
in other countries and Sri Lanka, the main research methods in this pilot study comprised: (a) document
review & analyses; and (b) interviews of a cross-sectional sample of stakeholders.

An over-run is taken here, to be the percentage increase above the contracted ‘period’ or ‘price excluding
contingencies’ on each contract. While over-runs arising from common causes such as design and contract
document errors, omissions and ambiguities had reduced over time in a few jurisdictions, the general levels
in many countries are still substantial. For example, major over-runs are often attributed to rework and to
variations or change-orders due to scope changes or site conditions, apart from design/documentation
shortcomings. Many other common causes are evident worldwide, including for example, adverse
repercussions from unrealistically low prices in some cases. For example, one recent study in Sri Lanka, on
delays based on a sample of 24 projects funded by WB, ADB and JICA, indicated an average delay of 69%,
while variations/ extra work accounted for 56% of these delays.

The following samples from the current exercise are only indicative, since both the PRP and RSAP projects
are ongoing and many claims, evaluations and settlements even on completed contracts are pending.

    1. Provincial Road Project (PRP)
          1.1 the EOT against time claims evaluated so far over 11 contracts, range from 7.5% to 48.6%
               with an average of 28.8%, the main contributor being EOT related to ‘quantity increases’;
               and.
          1.2 the cost over-runs on quantity increases evaluated so far, average out at only 0.8%,
               apparently due to ‘minuses’ on some contracts compensating for ‘pluses’ on others (the
               lowest being –38.1%). Variations so far averaged 19.5%, the highest on a contract being
               53.0%. ‘Price escalations’ so far averaged out at 12.8%. However, 6 major claims sources are
               still pending.

    2. Road Sector Assistance Project (RSAP)
          2.1 the EOT granted so far on Phase 1, averaged 69.8%, ranging from 7.6% to 180.7% over 12
              contracts;
          2.2 the cost over-runs so far on Phase 1, averaged 86.5%, ranging from 51.5% to 132.4%;
          2.3 in the eastern section of Phase 2 comprising 4 contracts, the EOT varied from 15.0% to 28.6%;

                                                       1
             2.4 in the ‘rural roads pilot’ segment, the average EOT was 47.6% and the average increase in
                 contract prices was 28.3%. One of the general observations was that the evaluated
                 Liquidated Damages for delays appeared to be not always applied in the settlements by the
                 borrower.

A host of ‘common sources’ and possible underlying causes of over-runs was unearthed, based on analyses
of the detailed data obtained and the in-depth interviews with a representative range of the main project
participants. Examples of common sources include:

    1.    inadequate site investigations;
    2.    incomplete and/or delayed and/or inaccurate designs;
    3.    ambiguities within contract documents;
    4.    discrepancies between contract documents;
    5.    sub-standard performance - of contractors and/or consultants;
    6.    delays from overall contract administration;
    7.    excessive rework;
    8.    major variations to meet public/ political needs;
    9.    inadequate dispute avoidance and/or resolution strategies and mechanisms;
    10.   high price adjustment (escalation) assessments
    11.   lack of standard methodologies for evaluating EOT etc.

Possible ‘underlying causes’, meriting further investigation included among others:

    1.    inadequate time and/or budget for design and for design review; and/or
    2.    shortfalls in design team capacities / experience;
    3.    inadequate upfront public engagement;
    4.    misinterpretations and misuse of Quality Assurance/ Control expectations;
    5.    ambiguities and loop-holes in contract documents;
    6.    lack of tangible deterrents to discourage non-compliance e.g. if not submitting realistic programmes
          with resource loadings, method statements, etc.

Improvements could arise from addressing:

    1. all the unveiled possible common causes of over-runs; and
    2. overall project governance with stronger ‘employer’/ client oversight in general.

    Also, examples of specific ‘potential improvement areas’ include

    3. consultant and contractor selection and management, e.g. with higher weightings for potential
       performance predictors, tangible deterrents/credits for non-compliance/good performance e.g. to
       impact future tender opportunities and scores;
    4. demarcation of responsibilities for designs, design reviews, working drawings, approvals etc.;



                                                       2
    5. cost increase thresholds for applying ‘no objections’ on price rises against total ‘contract price less
       contingencies’, as well as on specific critical items - e.g. to revisit and revise current thresholds (to
       remove any contingencies ‘cushion’) and to introduce new ones;
    6. identified contractual ambiguities and shortfalls e.g. in contract clauses on - price adjustments,
       increase in quantities, EOT evaluation – e.g. to improve EOT evaluation capacities and develop
       standard protocols to be trialed and recommended/ required.

All potential improvement areas, in turn merit ‘in-depth investigation’, as indeed do the possible common
causes of over-runs, since identifying and addressing the underlying root causes should be the goal. Such an
in-depth study may also prioritize what needs addressing in: (a) a road map to the desired destination of
‘reduced time and cost over-runs’ with target milestones e.g. on start and finish dates for tasks such as
‘rationalization / upgrades of standard contract clauses linked to over-runs etc.’; and (b) a preliminary but
well structured ‘action plan’ for any urgent upgrades.

Identified system shortcomings will need systemic solutions that address root causes. Pilot study outcomes
indicate needs for revamping both hard and soft systems e.g. with a ‘culture’ shift that embeds imperatives
and evokes commitment for both comprehensive planning and rigorous controls. Excellent change
management will also be needed. However, ‘in-depth investigation’ of some areas are needed before
embarking on such major transformations.

Examples of areas for ‘in-depth investigation’ before launching major transformational improvements are:

    A. on injecting cut-off milestones into a project programme, so that, subject to exceptional
       circumstances and with ‘top level’ approvals, there will be milestones to ‘freeze’ and ‘sign-off’ at high
       levels: (A1) the design brief; (A2) the design; and (A3) the BOQs, specifications and other contract
       documents. To make such requirements more viable and acceptable, it may be considered to
       simultaneously introduce: [i] Value Engineering reviews before freezing designs, and [ii] ‘carrot/stick’
       incentives for the ‘signing off’ teams, e.g. with special recognition including for career advancement,
       when their outputs fare better (trigger less problems downstream) and vice versa.

    B. on improving dispute minimization and dispute resolution protocols and mechanisms e.g. with stock-
       taking of current strengths/ weaknesses and potential of Dispute Adjudication Boards in both
       contractual provisions and practice. A well-structured industry forum involving a cross-section of
       stake-holders, could be a starting point to drill into underlying issues and brainstorm possible ways
       forward.

    C. on examining the feasibility of developing a management aid like a ‘Over-run Hotspots Dashboard’
       (or ‘Over-runs Alert Indicator’) – to help top management to anticipate and hence, better control
       potential ‘over-run hotspots’. While certain techniques may turn out to be similar to some of those
       in risk appraisals, dynamic databases of over-runs on previous similar contracts, could be designed
       and codified to spotlight sources and causes that commonly spark over-runs of higher (1) magnitude,


                                                       3
    (2) frequency and (3) avoidability. Color-codes and relative-ratings could provide a quick-menu
    interface.

    This would necessarily be a dynamic system, since new hotspots would supersede those that have
    been successfully minimized etc., but overall magnitudes and frequencies would hopefully decrease
    with time and effort.

D. on prioritizing the areas for improvement; then selecting higher priority initial recommendations to
   be ‘trialed’ in ‘pilot’ projects or contracts. Indeed, recent experience elsewhere indicates that, if
   reasonably confident of the value and viability of the systems and practices being trialed, publicizing
   these as ‘demonstration’ projects/ contracts and deploying capable and committed teams on these,
   increases the chances of success of such ‘pilot’ exercises, followed by smoother implementation
   thereafter.

1       BACKDROP, AIM, SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY
1.1 BACKDROP
Built infrastructure projects worldwide, are often vulnerable to various performance shortfalls unless
carefully planned and controlled from the outset. Apart from quality, environmental and/or health & safety
shortfalls, roadworks projects seem particularly prone to time and cost over-runs. Such over-runs can be
substantial if not overwhelming, from a base-line of a ‘decision to proceed’ that is based on initial estimates
of cost and time, to final hand-over and accounts (Flyvbjerg et al., 2002). Indeed these over-runs can be
significant, even from a base-line of the signed construction contract i.e. based on agreed contract price and
duration.

The sources of such time and cost over-runs could be diverse, ranging broadly for example, from
inappropriate procurement strategies and protocols, through incomplete and/or unsuitable designs, sub-
optimal tenderer-contractor planning and/or estimating, to poor construction management and/or contract
administration (Kumaraswamy, 1997a; Park and Papadopolou, 2012; Rosenfield, 2014; Love et al., 2014 a).

1.2 AIM
Growing apprehensions of excessive time and cost over-runs in roadworks projects in Sri Lanka, led to
launching this independent pilot study (a) to assess to what extent such concerns are justified in terms of
time and cost over-run levels and any general patterns, based on two sample projects (RSAP and PRP); and
to identify (b) likely common sources of such shortfalls; and (c) focus areas for a more extensive and in-depth
study to identify root causes for specific attention. The findings are also expected to provide pointers to
potential areas for improvement.

It is expected that stakeholders such as the Government of Sri Lanka, the World Bank, other development
partners and implementation agencies, could benefit from the pilot study findings, as well as the envisaged
follow-up exercises, that would spotlight areas needing closer attention to elicit better time and cost
performance levels and thereby enhanced value for money, in the planning and implementation of
roadworks projects in Sri Lanka.

Apart from the above direct benefits, it is also expected that the unearthed sources and possible common
causes may also provide useful pointers to some generic underlying issues, for example arising from similar
contract documents and/or operational protocols that could adversely affect similar projects elsewhere.

1.3 SCOPE
1.3.1 Base-line for ‘Over-runs’
The base-line against which over-runs are assessed for this pilot study is the signed construction contract so
that any increases are against agreed contract price and duration. Setting an earlier base-line e.g. at project
appraisal stage would probably highlight higher over-runs, but it would have blurred the focus by shifting
attention to necessarily less accurate upstream estimates of time and cost. The current starting point, enables
the required focus on the performance of the selected contract teams, including the consultants, contractors
and contract administrators on each package.


                                                      5
1.3.2 Data Sources
Given the time-frame of the study, and the confidentiality of sensitive issues, hence limited access to details
of this type of data in general, as well as the need to assess reasonably similar and recent samples, two recent
World Bank supported roadworks projects, namely: (i) the Road Sector Assistance Project (RSAP) and (ii) the
Provincial Roads Project (PRP) were identified for sampling.

1.3.3 Limitations
This was formulated as a ‘pilot study’, hence the time-frame and data sources were limited, but considered
appropriate. Correspondingly, the findings should be considered in this context and cannot be generalized.
While providing reasonable first order conclusions on common over-run sources in similar projects, and
further pointers as targeted in the above ‘Aim’, the findings, interim conclusions and suggestions, merit
testing and verification against larger samples, more quantitative data, consequential further analysis,
consolidation and validation before they could be developed into definitive conclusions and
recommendations.

1.4 METHODOLOGY
1.4.1 Strategy
This was formulated to discern any common sources and perceived general patterns in terms of frequencies
and relative magnitudes of the time and cost over-runs under different ‘claims/ compensation heads’ (and/or
arising from different sources) in roadworks projects in the RSAP and PRP projects. The data and hence
findings are primarily based on (A) interviews and discussions with relevant parties and (B) available
documents, as received from the Colombo offices of the World Bank, the RDA RSAP project office and the
PRP project office.

1.4.2   Methods Summary

1.4.2.1 Interviews
in two stages - (I) to probe and extract (prior to structuring, consolidating and prioritizing) the relevant
experiential knowledge of at least one representative each of the major stakeholders (relevant World Bank
team, implementing agencies, employers, consultants and contractors) and at least one ‘external’/
independent expert (in this case, DAB members), after the start of the document survey; and (II) to obtain
initial feedback from some of the same major stakeholders on specific relevant aspects of the preliminary
findings and related questions that arose, in terms of perceived general common sources of time and cost
over-runs.

1.4.2.2 Documents Review
of relevant documents as made available for this study from the Colombo offices of the World Bank, the RDA

documents, progress reports and summary statements and breakdowns where available.

2 BACKGROUND TO TIME AND COST OVER-RUNS IN
  ROADWORKS
2.1 GLOBAL SCENARIO - SAMPLES OF SOURCES, CAUSES AND SUGGESTIONS

Time and cost ‘creep’ throughout a project cycle is common in many countries with roadworks projects being
particularly vulnerable, arguably given more variables across more extensive terrains than some other forms
of built infrastructure. This is to some extent understandable before construction contracts are signed, for
instance arising from potentially significant changes in requirements / priorities, hence in finally chosen
options, e.g., on both physical and procurement routes. However, after such fundamental choices and even
after detailed designs, the over-runs from the point after the construction contract is signed, have attracted
attention but often defied initiatives to control them in many jurisdictions.

This has triggered many studies such as the current one, to identify the common sources or causes, so that
these may be addressed more carefully. The following summarizes some relevant examples from a random
sample, in turn derived from a cross-section of some such recent studies, that this consultant has come across
recently.

Love et al. (2014b) cited a number of previous investigations worldwide, including one that had found
excessive increases due to ‘rework’ alone, others finding ‘scope changes’ to be responsible for large over-
runs e.g. one finding ‘change orders’ accounting for 50 % of cost over-runs and 20% of late delivery, while
interestingly, ‘errors and omissions in contract documentation’ were found to range from between 5% to
20% of a project’s contract value. They also cited previous suggestions for mitigating over-runs e.g., enhanced
performance monitoring, reporting and information sharing; enhanced accountability and responsibility for
overruns against benchmarks, enhanced staff capacities, state-of-the art forecasting, as well as increased
completeness and rigor of early plans.

Refreshingly, not all scenarios are consistently negative, e.g. Love et al. (2014a) cited a 2011-published study
of road and bridge projects in Massachusetts, USA where nearly 50% were over–budget and 33% were over-
run. This implies that it had been possible to control the others. They also cited a 2011-published study of
Australian infrastructure projects which found that less than 48% of the sample were delivered on time,
budget and to the required quality. This too indicates that it is not impossible to control time and cost.
However their own survey of 58 transportation projects in Australia revealed mean rework costs of 11.2%,
cost over-runs of 13.3% and schedule over-runs of 8.91%.

Earlier and in the USA again, Bordat et al. (2004) after a detailed analysis of Indiana Department of
Transportation projects between 1996 and 2001, found that cost over-runs averaged 4.5% and were found
in 55% of the projects, while 12% of the projects incurred delays. However, assessing the total quantum of
the cost over-run to represent about 9% of the budget available for contracts, they recommended measures
to reduce this, e.g.; with a ‘Change-Order Management process’ and annual reports reviewing the
performance of consultants, and ‘assigning grades’, also taking into account the value and frequency of
‘preventable change orders attributable’ to them.
                                                     7
A worldwide cross-section would of course include special situations where over-runs may be unsurprisingly
much higher, for example as reported by Enshassi et al. (2009) with related recommendations. Rosenfield
(2014) on the other hand identified 146 potential causes of construction cost over-runs derived from a range
of international literature and local experts, based on which he filtered and ranked 15 ‘independent universal
root causes’. The top three, were (i) premature tender documents, (ii) too many changes in owners’
requirements or definitions and (iii) unrealistically low tender-winning prices (suicide tendering). Of course
these are not universally applicable, e.g. one would think that the third ranked root cause depends on the
‘market’, e.g. is less applicable when there are plenty of contracts available compared to those eligible to bid
for them e.g., as in Sri Lanka now. Apart from the root cause analysis, Rosenfield (2014) provides a useful
recent summary review of the international literature from which he extracted the 146 potential causes.

One set of studies drawn upon in the above paper, was based in Hong Kong. Based on a series of surveys and
project data analyses, Kumaraswamy (1997a) developed a hierarchy, comprising: (a) ‘common categories’ of
claims heads such as ‘ambiguities in contract documents’, (b) ‘common proximate causes’ such as
inappropriate contract forms, derived from the above ‘common categories’, and (c) ‘common root causes’
such as ‘unclear risk allocation’ in turn based on the ‘common proximate causes’. This basic Hong Kong based
hierarchy is in Appendix 1.

While remedies were explored, e.g. in more ‘appropriate appraisal and apportionment of megaproject risks'
(Kumaraswamy, 1997b), more in-depth analyses were conducted e.g. on the use and abuse of claims, while
profiles of both relative magnitudes and frequencies of both time and cost over-runs from the Hong Kong
samples were presented (Kumaraswamy, 1997a,b) as in Appendix 2 which contains two examples.

Parallel research exercises in Hong Kong helped triangulate the findings. These included studies on
'contributors to construction delays' (Kumaraswamy and Chan, 1998) and on ‘contributors to time and cost
performance in building projects’ (Dissanayake and Kumaraswamy, 1999). Drilling deeper below specific
‘hotspots’ that generated disputes arising from divergent interpretations, Kumaraswamy and Yogeswaran
(1999) expanded on principles and practices in ‘evaluating time extension entitlements’; while
Palaneeswaran and Kumaraswamy (2008) developed on this to develop an ‘integrated Decision Support
System for dealing with time extension entitlements’. In addition, from a more holistic and ‘prevention better
than cure’ perspective, Kumaraswamy and Yogeswaran (1998) developed a ‘claims focus indicator’ based on
three chosen dimensions of relative magnitude, relative frequency and ‘avoidability’ to anticipate and
thereby address in advance, the ‘significant sources of construction claims’ in specific contractual regimes.
For example, such prior knowledge could guide top management of employers, funding bodies and
consultants to focus their best efforts and high-end resources e.g. top management time, on minimizing the
more ‘avoidable’, more frequent and/or usually higher value claims.

Recent studies convey insights into examples from other Asian scenarios. For example, Park and Papadopolou
(2012) identified 27 causes of cost over-runs and assessed their severity and frequency based on data from
35 transportation projects completed between 1983 and 2010 across 12 South Asian and East Asian
countries. They concluded that ‘awarding contracts to the lowest bidder’ was the most significant cause of

                                                       8
cost over-run in their sample, while also linking lump sum contracts to the ‘greatest occurrence’ of such over-
runs. Shehu et al. (2014) focusing on Malaysia, examined factors contributing to both time and cost over-run
and concluded that delays there were mostly attributable to contractors, with their financial factors,
specifically ‘cash flow problems’ being the major culprit.

Of course various specific causes (whether ‘proximate’ or ‘root’ cases) may dominate to differing degrees in
different jurisdictions. However, one generic approach to reducing disputes and the consequential waste of
resources and time (which parties may in turn attempt to recover through further claims and counter-claims)
has been to encourage structured co-operation between contracting parties and their agents, including
consultants, sub-contractors etc. Collaborative project delivery modalities such as ‘partnering’ have been
strongly encouraged in high powered industry reports such as in the UK (Latham, 1994, Egan, 1998) and Hong
Kong (CIRC, 2001). Industry, finding merit in these recommendations has developed contractual formats and
practices that have progressed from non-contractual to contractual partnering (e.g. using the New
Engineering Contract of the Institution of Engineers UK, also used outside the UK e.g. in Hong Kong),
alliancing, as in Australia and ‘integrated project delivery’, as in the USA. These practices are based on the
principles of ‘relational contracting’ which makes allowance for ‘incomplete contracts’, i.e. acknowledging
that all eventualities cannot be clearly defined in black and white, hence contracting parties should co-
operate to handle unforeseen risks in the best win-win approach, rather than waste resources ‘passing the
buck’ to each other.

Caveats are of course in order, e.g., on where to ‘draw the line’, so that ‘partnering’ is not abused and/or
does not degenerate into collusion, as well as on relevant legal implications (Kumaraswamy, 2006). On the
other hand, the lack of good relationships could by itself, lead to ‘cost growth’ (Dada, 2014), while the
potential benefits from co-operation across project teams are almost axiomatic and a host of studies and
experiences in different jurisdictions testify to this e.g. (a) in a general comparison of ‘multi-country
perspectives of relational contracting and integrated project teams’ (Rahman and Kumaraswamy, 2012); and
(b) with longer-term ‘Relationally Integrated Value Frameworks’ formulated for ‘supercharging supply chains’
toward increased value for all stakeholders in general (Kumaraswamy et al., 2010), while retaining
competitive elements within networks, targeting ‘co-opetition’ i.e co-operating to form competitive teams
that can achieve much higher overall value for money.

On the other hand, when failures to settle issues at the lowest possible level, escalate into avoidable claims
and disputes involving top management, these tend to snowball with or without the potential personality
clashes, dragging in secondary issues that may have otherwise been amicably dealt with upstream. A recent
survey of the causes of disputes by a leading international project management and consultancy firm (E.H.
Harris/ Arcadis, 2014), revealed the following top five causes of disputes, ranked from 1 (most frequent) to
5: (1) Failure to properly administer the contract; (2) Failure to understand and/or comply with its contractual
obligations by the Employer/ Contractor/ Subcontractor; (3) Incomplete Design Information or Employer
requirements; (4) Failure to make interim awards on extensions of time and compensation; (5) poorly drafted
or incomplete and unsubstantiated claims. It should be noted that the above are based on a sample limited
to disputes that this particular international group has been involved with, but the unveiled causes, whatever
their ranking, would sound familiar in many countries including Sri Lanka, and are thus relevant to the current
study.

2.2 SRI LANKAN BACKDROP – INDUSTRY BACKGROUND: RELEVANT OVERVIEW
Sri Lanka’s rich heritage of infrastructure megaprojects can be traced back well over two millennia, ranging
from well-planned and skillfully designed and built infrastructure megaprojects, including complex irrigation
works, comprising systems of reservoirs, canals and village tanks, religious super-structures etc. In more
recent times from about half a century ago, the construction industry was subjected to stop-go work demand
fluctuations that took a toll on its developed resources and capacities. However, the recent upsurge in
construction activities has stretched the domestic industry again, opening doors to more overseas
contractors, given the limited numbers of local contractors with the expected track records on megaprojects.
On the other hand some local contractors are handling jobs overseas.

Acknowledging that significant top-down improvements are needed, even that the ‘Sri Lankan Construction
Industry needs a resurrection on properly formed policies which are guiding tracks of a Master Plan’, a
‘Roadmap Towards Construction Industry Master Plan’ was recently issued by the Ministry of Construction,
Engineering Services, Housing & Common Amenities (2013).

The above may also reflect a resurgence of concerns that have triggered industry improvement initiatives in
the past too. As in many other countries where reports on their construction industries have from time to
time sought to address certain shortfalls, reinvent their structures, trigger desired ‘culture-shifts’ e.g. towards
collaborative modes, (Latham, 1994; Egan, 1998, CIRC, 2001), and thereby improve their industry
performance levels and industry development trajectories, Sri Lanka has also identified and targeted reforms
at various stages, whether at an industry-wide level or in certain sub-sectors. For example, at a national and
industry-wide level, the Cabinet of Ministers approved a detailed Memorandum on the ‘Development of
Domestic Construction Contractors’ in 1988, which was soon followed by a handbook of implementation
procedures (ICTAD, 1988). An example at a sub-sector level, was the set of Reports submitted in 1992 (ICTAD,
1992) - on the World Bank sponsored Study on the 'Domestic Construction Industry in the Roads Sub-Sector',
prepared by a team assembled by ICTAD and submitted to the Road Development Authority and the World
Bank. The Final Report included an action plan for uplifting the domestic roadworks contractors. Most of the
recommendations were implemented to a large extent, with the outcomes being evident in the increased
participation of domestic contractors in major road projects, even where international competitive bidding
is used.

ICTAD itself was set up by the Government of Sri Lanka in the 1986 to develop the construction industry on
various fronts, after a precursor ‘Construction Industry Training Project’. ICTAD was initially funded by the
World Bank but now relies on Government funding and self-generated income from its training programmes
and other services (ICTAD, 2014). Apart from training at all levels of the industry, including workers,
equipment operators and construction managers, ICTAD has ‘development’ and ‘advisory services’ divisions,
that for example develop standard documents and other useful publications for the industry, including
standard bidding documents, specifications, bulletins of construction statistics, price indices etc.; while also
providing services such as maintaining a system of registered contractors in different grades (ICTAD, 2008).

Another relevant organization, albeit not construction-specific that was established with Word Bank support
was the National Procurement Agency, established in 2005, but closed a few years later. This agency carried
                                                        10
out a comprehensive revision of governmental procurement guidelines; consultancy guidelines and standard
bidding documents for goods; and ICTAD revised the standard bidding documents for the construction
industry to align with these general procurement guidelines.

2.3 SRI LANKAN SCENARIO – EXAMPLES FROM PREVIOUS SAMPLES
The focus of this pilot study on time and cost over-runs in roadworks projects is fully justified, given that
roadworks currently constitute the most extensive and expensive built infrastructure assets being developed
in Sri Lanka. Moreover, road networks merit special attention, since they are being developed and improved
with objectives such as lowering transportation costs, boosting efficiencies and important connectivities and
thereby economic and social development.

A few previous study exercises have examined delays and cost over-runs in Sri Lanka, with a couple focusing
on roadworks too. For example, Wijekoon and Uduweriya (2012) examined a sample of delayed projects in
the Sri Lankan water sub-sector and identified overall delay factors in both the pre-construction phase and
construction phase. While the current study focuses on the latter phase, both sets are indicated here, since
a sub-optimal pre-construction phase would also adversely affect the construction phase. The factors seem
somewhat generic and ranked in order of frequency (starting with 1 being highest frequency) they were:

    A. for the pre-construction phase: (1) Evaluation of Bid documents by Employer, (2) Reviewing and
       approving of Bid documents and Designs by Employer, (3 Acquisition of Land, (4) Errors in Bid
       documents, (5) Delay in decision making by Engineer; and

    B. (B) for the construction phase: (1) Procurement delays in imported materials, (2) Variation orders,
       (3) Shortage of Skilled Labor, (4) Poor planning and scheduling, … and six more factors.

It may be noted that the first factor pertaining to imported materials may not be as important in the roads
sub-sector as in the water sub-sector. Another study by Wijekoon (2011) although focusing on the Sri Lankan
roads sub-sector, sought factors affecting overall project performance including time, cost and quality. 35
factors were identified from this broader perspective.

Focusing specifically on cost over-runs on road construction projects in Sri Lanka, Wijekoon and Attananayake
(2012) identified from their sample and ranked in descending order of importance, the following cost over-
run factors: (1) payment delays, (2) delays in shifting existing utilities, (3) cost escalation, (4) design changes
during construction, (5) issues in land acquisition.

Jeyakanthan and Jayawardane (2012) reported on their analysis of project delays in donor funded road
projects in Sri Lanka, based on data from 24 road projects funded by ADB, JICA and WB, related interviews
and various related documents. They found an overall delay of 69% at the project implementation stage on
average; and also that variation/ extra work had caused 56% of the delays, while 8% of the delays were
attributed to errors in tender drawings. In this context, they cite an ADB report that indicates a requirement
“to prepare detailed engineering designs to enable construction quantities to be calculated with reasonable
accuracy of 5%”. Also, errors and omissions in detail designs, changes in scope and specifications were the
most prevalent sources of quantity increases. Based on such findings, their recommendations included design
                                                        11
constructability reviews, capacity building, a ‘lessons learnt’ document and a more rigorous approach by the
executing agency.

From a broader perspective, if linking sources and causes of over-runs to risks, one could also compare some
findings from a study to enhance risk management in Sri Lankan road construction projects. For this, Perera
et al. (2014) conducted a Delphi survey with 33 Sri Lankan experts. Although one finding identifies ‘delays in
payment by the client’ as the most critical risk factor in the construction stage, one may wonder if this could
depend on the funding sources in the particular experience of the surveyed sample. On the other hand, the
authors highlight ‘design errors by the consultant’ since they note that it ranks high in three of the four
stages into which they divided the project life cycle i.e. (i) conceptual stage, (ii) design stage (2nd most severe
risk identified here), (iii) construction stage (2nd most severe risk identified here too) and (iv) operations stage
(2nd most severe risk identified here as well). Furthermore, ‘delays in client decision-making process’ and
‘errors in estimated cost and construction period’ are collectively concluded by the surveyed experts, to be
severe risks in both design and construction phases. The construction stage is considered the most critical in
terms of severe risks. It may be considered apt that this critical ‘construction stage’ is the focus of the current
study, given that over-runs are considered against the contracted project durations and prices of the
construction contractors. However, as indicated above, risks that are not effectively managed in the
preceding two stages i.e., conceptual and design, could well impact significantly on this already critical
construction stage.

3 EXAMPLES                     OF        OVER-RUNS AND                            DOCUMENTED
  REASONS
3.1 PREAMBLE

This section contains snapshots of common time and cost over-runs with any corresponding documented
reasons, with the objective of providing a perspective of both the scale of the problem and a flavor of the
underlying issues. It draws on extracts from data made available from the RSAP and PRP projects as planned.
Being a pilot study, it does not purport to convey a comprehensive summary nor an accurate quantitative/
statistical overview. Another inherent limitation is in that some contract packages have not yet been finalized,
either being under construction and/or with some major items under review or in dispute. However, the
areas, issues and items highlighted are not random, but attracted attention through an iterative and
interactive process of document reviews and interviews which unveiled specifics to be examined, of which
many merited highlighting as below. The important caveat is therefore that the following is not intended as
a fully representative cross-section, leave alone comprehensive review of the over-runs and documented
reasons.

3.2 PRP - PROVINCIAL ROADS PROJECT

Briefly, the original credit of US 105 million equivalent on IDA Credit CE-4630-LK was to be disbursed over the
project time-line set from the WB Board approval date of 17 Dec. 2009, ‘effectiveness date’ of 02 April 2010
and original project ‘closing date’ of 31 March 2015. Focusing on the roads rehabilitation component in the
three selected provinces only, i.e. excluding the maintenance, implementation support and capacity building:
4 of 6 roads in the Uva province and 4 of 5 in the Eastern province have been physically completed, while 2
of 4 are completed in the Northern Province. The other 2 had to be re-awarded in the Northern Province,
given which it may also be noted that any actual over-runs on the new contracts would not reflect the over-
runs from the dates of award of the precursor contracts. Generalizing such experiences, reminds one of the
need for careful selection of contractors, with extra attention to their potential performance, apart from
tender price. Moreover, from another angle, the Auditor General’s Report dated 30 June 2013 for the year
ended 31 Dec. 2012, included negative comments on the supervising consultant in terms of contracts being
‘poorly managed’ and inadequate ‘capacity’ and ‘lack of professional commitment’. In this case relating to
works in the Northern Province, the team leader was replaced, based on Employer’s recommendation. It may
be noted that similar observations regarding the capacity and/or commitment of some consultant staff, apart
from shortfalls in some contractor capacities, resource levels and attitudes have surfaced during interviews
on both PRP and non-PRP roadworks projects

In terms of time over-runs, a snapshot of the current approximate EOT (Extension of Time) assessment of the
PRP roads is in Table 1. It should be emphasized that some of the ‘EOT’ assessments have not been agreed,
with these disputes under adjudication in some contracts, while one has been ‘noticed’ for arbitration on this
EOT disagreement itself and another has been noticed for arbitration on costs related to an agreed EOT.
Therefore allowing for such future shifts in the current picture, the present profile indicates an average
contract EOT of 28.8 %, with the highest being 48.6 % so far and the lowest being 7.5 % over the 11 projects
                                                      13
where EOT has been claimed and assessed. Breaking this down to main sources, one notes a major source in
‘quantity increase’ related EOT, averaging 19.7 %, with the highest being 39.9 % so far and the lowest 5.5%.
The second major source of EOT, is adverse weather, averaging 4.6 %, with the highest being 12.7% so far
and the lowest being 0 i.e. zero claimed under this particular category (on 2 contracts) so far.

In terms of cost over-runs, Table 2 conveys a consolidated summary, of the current approximate assessments
on the 11 PRP roads assessed so far. Here it should be stressed that many of the claims have not been
assessed, leave alone agreed, so this is only an indicative ‘in advance’ profile. Secondly, there are 6 major
sources of claims, labelled as Cl. 1 to Cl. 6 in Table 2, where substantial claims have been recently submitted
but are still being assessed, so this advance profile is only a ‘part-profile’ in reflecting 3 of 8 potentially
substantial claim sources on this project. However, it may be argued that Cl. 1 termed ‘change of input %’
should be combined with the category above that in the table termed ‘Price escalation’ since it relates to that
same source, the difference being that the ‘Price adjustment’ is computed directly based on the relevant
formula in the contract, whereas the ‘change of input %’ is based on another clause (13.8 in these contracts),
that provides for adjusting input percentages if the weightings have been rendered unreasonable,
unbalanced or inapplicable. Some other claims such as those labelled as Cl. 2 on ‘prolongation’ could be
substantial, while the Cl. 3 on ‘VAT on bitumen’ arose when the Government removed the VAT (Value Added
Tax) on bitumen and simultaneously raised the selling price, so that contractors had to pay the same net
price. Although not able to claim for a price escalation, such claims are based on contractors allegedly losing
the financial benefit of this VAT recovery against their own purchases.

Subject to the above limitations, what is available to date, indicates the following ‘cost over-runs as a %
against original contract price’ (a) on ‘BOQ items’ (representing ‘changes in quantities’ in general) a current
average of 0.77 %, the highest so far being 14.37 % and the lowest being – 38.13 %; (b) on ‘variations’ – a
current average of 19.46 %, the highest so far being 53.00 %; (c) on ‘Price Escalations’ – a current average of
12.77 %, the highest so far being 17.21%; with the potential for substantial increases after evaluating the
above-mentioned Cl. 3 on ‘VAT on bitumen’ and the Cl. 1 on change of input % (both of which relate to ‘Price
Escalations’ i.e. ‘Price Adjustments’ in general).

An interesting facet noted on this PRP project, is that the net cost over-runs could have been much higher, if
not for savings that had set off some of the increases. For example, reduced cross-sectional dimensions,
based on engineer re-design of a drain where the ground conditions were better than those envisaged in the
standard design tendered upon, compensated for the extra length of drain in some contracts. Also, in some
other terrains, one drain side was reportedly designed to ‘double-up’ as a mini- retaining wall on the
embankment side, effecting further savings. Such examples may presumably be linked to vigilance / good
practices of the relevant supervision consultants and employer’s representatives in the central Project Co-
ordination Unit and/or the provincial Project Implementation Unit /designated Road Development
Department. However these ‘pluses and minuses’ may not be directly evident in specific items e.g. the item
(a) above on ‘BOQ items’ (mainly representing ‘changes in quantities’) could reflect the lower length of drain
corresponding to lengths where the cross-section was reduced, but payments for lengths with reduced cross-
sections may have had to be made under ‘variations’ since this was interpreted as a new item meriting a new
rate. A clear example is in the EP05 contract, where an apparent saving in quantities reflected in the 38.13 %

                                                      14
‘saving’ on BOQ items; masks the ground reality of a need to replace a substantial length of drains with cover
slabs of lower design strength, with drains able to sustain the higher loadings in that heavily populated area,
thereby contributing substantially to the overall ‘variation’ of 53.00 %.

3.3 RSAP - ROAD SECTOR ASSISTANCE PROJECT
In summary, the original credit of US 100 million approved on the WB ‘Board date’ of 15 December 2005 on
IDA Credit Cr-4138 effective 16 March 2006, was supplemented by a First Additional Credit Cr-4429 of USD
98.1 million effective 12 December 2008 and a Second Additional Credit Cr-4906 of USD 100 million effective
02 June 2011, with a project ‘closing date’ of 30 September 2014. The total base value of the RSAP is thus
USD 298.1 million, if based on a summation of the relative USD values of the credits as at their respective
effectiveness dates, although the current USD value is correspondingly more.

The focus required in this pilot study is on the roads rehabilitation and improvements construction contracts
only, i.e. in the case of this RSAP project: excluding the road maintenance contracts, Road Maintenance Trust
Fund, Asset Management system development and other institutional strengthening components. 12
contract packages were awarded and completed in the ‘parent project’, which was also supplemented by the
first additional finance due to special conditions. However, all contract accounts have not been finalized by
the GOSL e.g. given an ongoing arbitration on one contract. In addition, 4 contract packages were awarded
and completed under Phase 1 of the second additional finance, while 4 packages are ongoing, following
changes to the planned road sections in Phase 2.

In addition to the ‘maintenance and rehabilitation of national roads’ that involved improvements and
resurfacing in certain provinces, the RSAP includes components for technical assistance, institutional
strengthening, technical audit and some goods and equipment for the above which are all in Part A. Part B
being on the ‘Maintenance and Rehabilitation of Rural Roads Pilot’, includes strengthening of the rural road
management and maintenance system of the local units (Pradeshiya Sabhas) and rehabilitation and
maintenance of specified rural roads, training, technical assistance, institutional strengthening, technical
audit and some goods and equipment as in Part A. Part C is on technical assistance in establishing the Road
Maintenance Trust Fund.

Table 3 presents a status summary of the ‘Approved Costs’, as well as the ‘% Increases’ over and above the
original contracted prices, of the 12 contract packages in RSAP Phase 1, one of 13 original packages having
been deleted from this project at the outset. The ‘approvals’ column on the left extreme, juxtaposes the WB
approvals against those of the GOSL cabinet or the Cabinet appointed Procurement Committee (CAPC) or in
one case he Ministry Procurement Committee (MPC). While no major deviations are evident between the
WB and GOSL approvals on costs, it seems that the WB recommended Liquidated Damages had not been
applied in many cases, at least up to the time of preparation of this summary on 22 May 2013. One may note
that, whether the non-enforcement of Liquidated Damages results from some global settlement or
otherwise, industry awareness of such precedents and possibilities could undermine an important deterrent
against delays.

The bottom-most row of figures in Table 3 projects an overall profile over the 12 contracts so far (noting that
an arbitration is pending), of the cost over-run in term of ‘% rise’ over the base contract price (without
contingency) datum. Given the chosen breakdown ‘heads’, the ‘% rise’ is highest under ‘price adjustment’ at
53.97 %, while variations at 17.21 % are considerable. Although the ‘quantity changes’ may have been
expected to have yielded more than the 3.92 % seen here, it is possible that the quantity increases due to
road width expansion etc. were off-set by some omissions or even variations. For example, the quantity
reduction in one road package accounts for reducing almost a third of the price, whereas the variations adds
back much more than that reduced - over 70 % more in this case. The other drawback in this type of ‘plus-
minus’ scenario is that the rates applied to variations may be higher than the contracted base rates if the
contractor can justify an increase, as had happened in the above example, even when similar works were
removed and then added back at reportedly short notice.

The highlighted column of ‘% Cost Over-run’ in Table 3 projects the ‘Total Increase in project cost’ - ‘Base
Contract Price (without contingency)’ as a % of the ‘Base Contract Price (without contingency)’. The base
figures in Table 3 are those with RDA and WB, the only computations for this Report being the ‘% Cost Over-
run’ column and the bottom row on ‘% Rise on BANK approved costs’. Assuming the base figures have been
computed as indicated in the original column heads, it may be noted that the cost over-runs will not appear
as high against the actual contract prices which do in fact, include physical and price contingencies,
although for the purposes of this report too, it is prudent to follow what was in the base figures as given, in
order to project the true extent of deviations e.g. of quantities, prices etc. Another caveat is that some figures
are pending finalization e.g. with one contract under arbitration, although the WB figures are not expected
to change. The % Cost Over-runs range from 51.49 to 132.41 in this project, with an arithmetic mean of
86.46 representing the average over-run in a contract. This needs to be differentiated from the parallel figure
of 75.58 % in the bottom-most row of figures, since the latter shows the ‘% Rise’ over base contract prices
without contingences for the whole RSAP 1 project.

Revisiting the breakdown of cost increases in the highlighted bottom row, a higher average ‘% rise’ was
expected under ‘claims’, based on a small sample of some of the original claims and EOT granted e.g. on
‘unavailability of points of reference issued by the Engineer’ and ‘unavailability of drawings that required
Engineer to design based on surveys done by the contractor’ and ‘entrusting the contractor to draft these
drawings’. However, the absence of financial compensation for such apparent lapses, may perhaps be
considered alongside the lower than expected liquidated damages in general, given the magnitudes of the
time over-runs.

The significance of any such overall ‘% rise’ in project cost so far of almost 80 % (78.67 %), may in general,
only be alleviated by any justifications of increase in value e.g. with increased road width . However, the fact
that the bulk of the cost over-run appears to arise from price adjustments, underlines the imperatives for
reducing the time over-runs.

The time over-run profile in RSAP Phase 1 contracts is seen in Table 4, ranging from 7.62 % to 180.70 %.
However both these values seem to be ‘outliers’/ extremes, the next highest and lowest being 105.23 and
26.61 respectively, while the arithmetic mean at present is 69.77 % or 70 %. It should be noted that the EOTs

                                                       16
granted (or under dispute) are not shown here, the time over-run being directly based on the completion
date - start date, as compared with the contract period, as obtained from the RSAP office.

Table 5 conveys a snapshot of the EOT granted on the four contract packages in the RSAP Phase 2 – Kantalai-
Trincomalee segment. While generally less significant than many contracts in Phase 1, EOT based on quantity
revisions (EOT category ‘2’ in this table) seem high, ranging from 65 to 82 days, compared to the contract
periods (each being 15 months). Also, one contract incurred additional delays (40 days EOT) due to some
special utility line issues. The lowest and highest overall time over-runs are 15.0 % and 28.6 % respectively.

The other segment of RSAP Phase 2 is ongoing and given the substantial works remaining it is premature to
comment on over-runs, although interviews of consultant personnel and DAB members on these contracts
provided useful ‘live’ pictures of both generic and specific issues. For example, it seems that the original
contract durations may be argued to be unrealistic, give this type of dense urban arteries leading into the
capital city. Other issues such as allegedly inadequate design preparation and review time-frames, substantial
deviations from the tender (base) drawings, shortfalls in contractor planning and resource levels etc. also
decelerate progress, so much so, that the ‘physical progress % (estimated)’ in the four package ‘Lots’ as of
30 April 2014, was 28.50, 17.40, 30.00 and 20.50; against ‘planned progress % (financial)’ of 79.38, 78.55,
87.05 and 83.67 respectively. It may be noted that relatively substantial EOT and financial claims are being
received on this project.

Moving to a completed segment of the RSAP, Table 6 summarizes the EOT granted on the suite of contracts
for the ‘Maintenance and Rehabilitation of Rural Roads Pilot’, the average EOT is 47.6 %. Issues leading to
EOT and extra costs include road width increases, issues with house access provisions, structure
improvements, unplanned retaining walls and box culverts, base improvements and causeways. The
increases in the contract prices, as compiled by relevant project staff (not reproduced here), taken together
e.g. covering variations and changes of quantities, averaged out at 28.32 % of the original contract prices –
again excluding contingencies, hence not appearing so high if compared against overall full contract prices.
There were net ‘minuses’ in some contracts (presumably due to deletion of some work items in some
contracts) that reduced the ‘pluses’ in other contracts. For example, the increase in one contract was 90.2%,
the next highest being 62.9 %, then 48.8 % while the three most negative were – 24.0 %, – 15.1 % and -15.0
%. Indeed there were only four contracts with net contract price ‘minuses’ in this sample. One could assume
that there were such ‘minuses’ and ‘pluses’ within contracts too (i.e. in various work items), as in other
samples which were examined in more detail, being bigger contract packages.

4 INTERVIEWS
4.1 INTERVIEW TARGETS AND FORMATS
4.1.1 Objectives, strategy, structure and formats:
The objectives and associated strategy, as indicated in the ‘Methods Summary’ in 1.4.2.1, were for interviews
to be planned and conducted in two stages - (I) for ‘knowledge-mining’ of relevant experiential knowledge
from a cross-section of the major stakeholders and independent experts (in this case, DAB members) in
parallel with, although starting after the document survey; and (II) to obtain initial feedback from some of
these major stakeholders on specific relevant aspects of the initial findings on apparently typical sources of
time and cost over-runs, information gaps, and related questions.

All interviews were semi-structured, based on a set of general questions as well as a supplementary set of
interviewee-specific questions that targeted the knowledge pool that could potentially be drawn upon from
each interviewee’s special positioning and expected experiences. Interviewees were assured that this is
essentially a 'looking back to collect & consolidate the lessons learned' exercise (including ‘positives’) so as
to plan & implement future projects better. It was also conveyed that the interviewer was interviewing
and/or had already interviewed a few stakeholders who were involved at different stages of both projects,
but that the specific insights and inputs from the current interview would be valuable in filling some gaps and
adding high level overviews. They were also assured that all views and sensitive information conveyed would
be treated as confidential and in any case, neither specific individuals, work packages nor organisations would
be cited on particular matters, but that the consolidated information would be used to derive general findings
and conclusions, while important non-confidential data available may be cited, since it could have been
obtained from one of many sources.

Typical general questions were developed in steps during the stage (1) interviews itself, following the initial
document appraisal and a few interviews that pointed to some useful areas for exploration. Some of the
general questions used were as follows:

    1. (a) Were the initial contract durations reasonable/ realistic? (b) Were the initial contract values
       reasonable/ workable?
    2. (a) To what extent were the Consultants expected to have inputs into the designs and contract
       documents, including special conditions of contract, specifications and drawings etc.? (b) In
       hindsight could this be approached better, in the light of local conditions etc. on similar projects?
    3. (a) Was the demarcation of responsibility clear (to all including contractors), for the designs and
       detailed/ working drawings? (i.e. including centre lines, longitudinal sections, reference points/
       levels, formation levels, structures, drainage)? (b) as in 2(b) above?
    4. Did the compensation for price fluctuations seem reasonable (to both Employer and Contractor)?
    5. Did the Employer/ Client inputs differ from what was expected on such projects? If so, how? Any
       examples?
    6. Did the Funding body inputs differ from what was expected on such projects? If so, how?
    7. Did the Consultants’ inputs differ from what was expected on such projects? If so, how? Any
       examples?
                                                      18
    8. Did the Contractors’ inputs and outputs/ performance in general, differ from what was expected
        on such projects? If so, how? Any examples?
    9. Did the DAB inputs and outputs in general, differ from what was expected on such projects? If so,
        how?
    10. Could the variations have been reduced? If so how?
    11. What were the main issues that led to (a) time over-runs and (b) cost over-runs?
    12. (A) In your personal opinion, what were the root causes of (i) time over-runs and (ii) cost over-
        runs? (B) Of these, which root causes contributed most? (C) Of these, which may be easier
        minimized in future? … by …………………?

In keeping with the interview strategy, a few Phase II interviews were of a few of those interviewed in Phase
I, with the dual objectives of (a) filing in some information gaps and inconsistencies/ ambiguities that
emerged subsequent to the first interview and (b) obtaining feedback on the initial/ interim findings and
potential suggestions.

The basic interviewee profile is as below.

4.2 SAMPLE EXTRACTS FROM EXPERIENTIAL OBSERVATIONS
Each interview yielded valuable findings. The initial interviews were exploratory but as the collective
knowledge base developed iteratively, some overlapping observations served to reinforce certain points and
suggestions, while some unclear areas were clarified when additional perspectives shone light on what could
                                                     19
have happened and why. Rather than list all points gleaned from all interviews, the following are some sample
extracts. Since the following sub-sections are categorized according to groupings such as employers,
consultants, contractors, in order to reduce repetition some points which originated from more than one
group are not duplicated unless essential to complement and complete the picture.

4.2.1   Sample observations from Employers (RDA & PRP) and Funding Agency personnel &
        consultants

The employers conveyed how a few special issues triggered the more substantial time and cost over-runs in
the RSAP and PRP projects. On the RSAP, an ‘across the board’ increase of the design road width from 5.5m
to 6.2m after the contracts were signed, led to major works quantity spikes. These were of course aggravated
in contracts in hilly terrain where substantially increased earthworks, enhanced culvert and drainage
provisions etc. were entailed. Secondly, particular periods of a bitumen shortage, as well as of a bitumen
price hike had significantly impacted time and cost.

In terms of ‘positives’ in ‘good practices’, in one project (as partly described in 4.2 above), net cost over-runs
were reduced by rationalizing the designs of (a) drains and/or (b) road specifications, where (a) the ground
conditions and/or (b) traffic conditions were better than those envisaged in the standard designs tendered
upon. Such savings helped compensate for (some of) the extra costs arising from (a) the extra length of drains
and/or (b) extra roadworks quantities, as well as (c) some area where the pavement design needed
upgrading.

In general, some contract clauses were perceived to be prone to different interpretations if not
misinterpretations e.g. (i) the regular use of the ‘changes in inputs %’ to claim price escalations (adjustments)
on certain inputs like bitumen where prices may have risen relatively more to other inputs, even based on a
small change from the contract quantities, whereas those who formulated this provision at ICTAD had
reportedly envisaged recourse to this only where there was a substantial change; (ii) different approaches to
claiming and evaluating EOT.

Although, employers believed that EOT on adverse climatic conditions was generally well justified with
adequate weather records, this was examined further, given substantial claims on some contracts and it was
found that different justification and quantification methodologies were used in different standard
conditions, suggesting a need for revisiting and standardization. In particular, one apparent omission was
noted in that the World Bank Standard Bidding Documents for Procurement of Small Works (WB.SBD.PSW)
does not provide for EOT based on ‘exceptionally adverse climatic conditions’ (as does the corresponding
World Bank Standard Bidding Documents for Procurement of Works - WB.SBD.PW and other standard
contracts encountered), since it is neither in Clause 26 (on ‘extension of the intended completion date’) nor
in Clause 41 (on compensation events referred to in Clause 26), leading to some allegedly using 41(f) which
is for adverse ground conditions.

Another noteworthy example is that the EOT assessment of a delay analysis expert who was recently
mobilized to assist in a major arbitration is that the EOT that had already been agreed on this contract was
excessive. One may wonder if any more over-assessments may emerge if his assessment technique for EOT
                                                       20
due to increase of road width, is applied to other contracts that received EOT for the same reason. From a
‘lessons learned’ viewpoint, it appears necessary to develop and specify a standard EOT assessment
methodology in contracts, given that different approaches yield diverse answers, but even worse, some
approaches seen in contractors claims seem to lack any reasonable technique/ basis – so a recommended
methodology would assist them and also minimize spurious claims, saving resources for all concerned.

In other general examples: (iii) some obligations of contractors were perceived by some to lack adequate
contractual ‘teeth’ that could deter non-compliance e.g. for not supplying sufficiently detailed and timely
work programmes, method statements, as-built drawings etc.; with even the termination clause being
suggested for strengthening since some felt the reasons for termination need expanding and elaboration ;
(iv) different interpretations of ‘methods of measurement’ on some items was noted, e.g. disputes had arisen
on tolerances and related payments for ‘average’ or otherwise, including when outside the tolerances; and
(v) disputes on approaches to evaluating of overheads in variations or prolongation claims. Disputes had also
arisen on interpretations of (vi) when a contractor can claim on ‘statement of completion’, one view being
that the claim can be deferred to the end of the defects liability period, thereby increasing the uncertainty of
contract price; (vi) the basis on which a contractor can apply for new rates for varied quantities – while there
are four conditions in Clause 12.3 of WB.SBD.PW, it seemed difficult to disprove that the unit cost changed
by over 1% unless a standard methodology was specified for evaluating both the initial and final unit costs.

At a more ‘macro’/ higher level, a concern aired in some quarters in terms of controlling over-runs, is on the
adequacy and clarity of the threshold at which ‘no objections’ must be sought from (a) the funding agency
and (b) the employer’s hierarchy. While some at the implementation ‘coal-face’ may prefer to retain a
flexibility to deal with contingency related over-runs by balancing against potential savings, a case can be
made for submitting for (a) ‘no objections’ review of the funding agency, not just when the contract price
increases by over 15%, but even when any one of some defined critical elements/ items exceeds a certain
margin e.g. whether 20% or 25%; and similarly (b) for employer’s review at an appropriate level too. Secondly,
it seems useful to rationalize the appropriate authorization levels / thresholds in the employers’ hierarchy
when the increase in contract price reaches a certain trigger-point ‘value’ (e.g. LKR 500m) and/or ‘%’ (e.g.
15%) increases,. Although guided by documents such as Supplement 14 to the Procurement Manual of GOSL
and clause 8.13.4 therein, it appears there may be some perceived flexibility in for example, when to refer to
a Provincial Secretary, a Ministry Secretary/ Ministry Procurement Committee or the Cabinet appointed
Tender Board. While established practices may be proving adequate in each organization, tightening this type
of requirement, along with introducing ‘elemental’ /critical item thresholds as recommended for triggering
referral to the funding agency above, may help heighten efforts to ‘nip’ potential over-runs ‘in the bud’.

There was unanimous and emphatic agreement that more realistic time-frames and budgets should be
provided for more comprehensive and/or detailed planning, site investigations and designs, along with the
associated risk assessments, since many design changes and consequential over-runs could be traced to
shortfalls in these areas e.g. with under-estimated quantities, unexpected conditions etc.

Employers (and also consultants) urged a revisiting of the insistence on quality assurance protocols that
correspondingly reduced consultant resources available for quality control. It was felt that many contractors

                                                      21
on these projects (whether ‘international’ or ‘national’) abused the expectations, thereby leading to
excessive rework, consequential disruptions and disputes and delays at the least, if not cost over-runs. On
the other hand, a few employer representatives alleged room for improvements motivation / commitment
of some of the consultant staff they had encountered on previous contracts. Indeed an example is
documented in an Auditor General’s report of 30 June 2013 for the year ended 31 Dec. 2012 on the PRP
project, which faulted the supervising consultant on one segment of a project on poor contract management,
inadequate capacity and lack of professional commitment.

Some employers and consultants felt that the funding agency loan period limit imposed onerous restrictions.
On the other hand, one may take an alternative view that while a realistic period should definitely be set at
the outset, all stakeholders should be impressed with the time imperatives also from the inception, so that
‘work does not expand to fill the time (apparently) available for it’ and then over-run due to contingencies.

Another (apparently positive) perspective was that any ‘additional value’/ benefit that was targeted and
obtained should be ‘factored in’ when viewing time and cost over-runs, e.g. the benefits from additional
road width and/or improved road quality to cater for higher expectations and/or traffic loadings. However,
post-contractual variations almost always cost more than what that work component would have cost if
embedded in the original contract. In any case, the cardinal principle of anticipating and building in such
possibilities/ risks should be a corner-stone in the agendas of planners and designers. That they should also
be given time to do this, reinforces the imperative for the adequacy of upstream time-lines and resources for
detailed planning and site investigations and careful designs.

4.2.2   Sample observations from Consultants

This sub-section also includes observations from a Contracts Adviser to one of the consultants, while it may
be noted that the consultants interviewed were only those on the RSAP.

There were perceptions of unrealistic contract durations having been imposed on some contracts based on
internal/ political targets and allegedly (as a couple of interviewees perceived) to fall within the funding
agency loan period, or even with inadequate technical and practical considerations e.g. without considering
the terrain and urban conditions. So while feasible for some flat non-urban terrains these were not workable
in hilly or urban terrains. Also, road rehabilitation that entailed planned and unplanned utility relocations
were apparently under-estimated in terms of risks, hence the ensuing time and cost over-runs. One positive
suggestion to mitigate one such risk source, was to boost the ‘public engagement’ of the affected community
– by (a) advancing its timing to well before the roadworks reached each area so that for example, temporary
and permanent access / connection issues could be worked out and agreed by an advance team, rather than
disrupting or stalling the work as often happened on some contracts and (b) ‘engaging’ more constructively
and productively, possibly with higher level inputs. Similar suggestions were received on quarries and burrow
pits, since delays in securing these and/or disruptions even after establishing these, had led to substantial
EOT on some contracts.

Some consultants engaged for design review and supervision had been disappointed that the bulk of the
documents arrived closer to the end of design review period. Also, when asked about significant EOT claims
                                                    22
that had been granted in at least one contract, based on ‘unavailability of points of reference issued by the
Engineer’, ‘unavailability of drawings that required Engineer to design based on surveys done by the
contractor’ and ‘entrusting the contractor to draft these drawings’, they attributed this to what was (not)
done prior to their coming on board. It seems from such examples, that the demarcation of responsibilities
for designs (arising from the definition of expected detail ‘design’), working drawings and approvals thereof
is open to divergent interpretations. Any such ambiguity on fundamentals could easily trigger, as it evidently
has, ‘passing the buck’, delays, disputes and over-runs.

There was a useful suggestion for the Engineer’s team to work with the Employer’s designated project team
in a common office. Indeed this happens elsewhere. Specific requirements were recommended to be
stipulated on the production of the ‘Clause 8.3 programme and supporting documentation’ including
resource loadings. Similarly, method statements and monthly progress reports should be upgraded. Penalties
were suggested for non-compliance with above, as well as for not supplying/ deploying the stipulated
resources. The same interviewee suggested that the Engineer be required to submit a monthly ‘cost
management report’.

Some other unsubstantiated observations which may be personality-specific, but arose from more than one
source, were (a) allegations of direct site instructions from some Employer’s representatives, sometimes by-
passing the Consultant and (b) a perception that claims and counter-claims (including Liquidated Damages)
may be settled at a higher level on a global basis. Again (as in sub-section 4.2.1 above), there were comments
about the funding agency loan expiry seeming to ‘drive the construction contract’ also leaving some alleged
loose ends on the disputes resolution and defects liability period. Note: one may consider a somewhat
mitigating perspective on this point where a deterrent of a definitive end date helps focus minds on
completion from the outset (as also described at the bottom of the penultimate paragraph of the sub-section
4.2.1 above). However, these perspectives are worth revisiting together.

4.2.3 Sample observations from Contractors
It should be noted that although the contractors interviewed had worked on both RSAP and PRP projects,
their observations were explicitly based on their broader experience on roadworks contracts funded by other
agencies and GOSL as well. Interestingly, the particular contractors interviewed took a holistic and
professional view of the issues to the extent of listing out to the interviewer, their perceptions of ‘causes of
time and cost over-runs on road projects’ under sources/ categories of General’, ‘Employer’, ‘Engineer’ and
‘Contractor’.:

4.2.3.1 General:
     Relative shortage (compared to current demand) of materials engineers, laboratory staff, quality
       officers, environmental officers, skilled plant operators
     Lack of job security, discouraging youth from joining the construction industry
     Inadequate training and skills development facilities
     Lack of incentive to seek proper training and skills development
     Quality of raw materials lacks control (including bitumen, that is now also imported privately)
     Out-dated environmental regulations/ standards
     Poor communication between parties

4.2.4 Sample observations from DAB members
Some of the points derived from interviews were complemented and/or substantiated by relevant sample
DAB reports obtained separately from the Employers (RDA and PRP). Also, informal discussions were held
with two other DAB members, hence reinforcing and supplementing the following, gleaned mainly from the
three who were formally interviewed.

Significant needs were identified for rationalization of tender and contract documents e.g. (a) for specifying
items where expected in the ‘documents hierarchy’ e.g. in the drawings and (b) more consistency checks for
discrepancies between documents. Examples on item (a) above included some that were also raised by other
                                                       24
parties (employers’ representatives, consultants and contractors) e.g. listing of some specific high value
construction activities in the Environmental Management Plan although not shown in the drawings, leading
contractors to claim that they had not been priced in tenders. Many examples on item (b) above, centered
on changes made in one document in particular conditions or specifications, as well as in drawings or Bills of
Quantities that impacted on others, rendering them incompatible, hence a hotbed of ambiguities and
consequential claims.

Two of the DAB interviewees raised a concern about the status of a payment made on an adjudication award,
given that it can be reversed in arbitration; one saying that FIDIC had recently changed the wording to
ameliorate this, while a bond may be given as security, although another opined that obtaining a bond can
be onerous. Other issues that may be revisited, since emerging in disputes were whether a substantial
quantity increase (‘even 100%) could be considered a ‘scope change’; and the perennial ‘time bar’ issue when
seemingly reasonable claims are submitted ‘too late’ but still often entertained.

Two DAB interviewees drew attention to an ambiguity in the payment clause in terms of foreign vs. local
currency components, when an extra payment has been evaluated on the price adjustment clause. Although
it appears that no price adjustment is payable on the foreign component in most contracts, a loophole in
interpreting the actual payment clause (where all payments must be in that agreed proportion) has led to
DAB decisions upholding the contractor’s interpretation.

DAB members also commented on some general issues leading to over-runs, reinforcing some points raised
by others e.g. on inadequate designs, the shortage of qualified and competent staff at different levels,
including in technical, financial and overall project management

Another macro level issue that emerged in other fora as well as in the above discussions, was the need to
take stock of the DAB system itself, now that it has been in operation for a few years in Sri Lanka, with
objectives of identifying strengths and weaknesses and ways forward in making better use of DABs for their
intended purpose. For example, confidence in the value of DABs varies, so that in some cases they are not
appointed early in the contract as expected; and in some DABs, even if appointed early they are not even
copied claims by contractors, leave alone alerted in advance of brewing claims scenarios that may have been
defused. One example was on a project with the same Engineer and the same DAB overseeing two parallel
sets of contracts, where the contractor on one contract, copied the claims to the DAB, whereas the other did
not. Benefits should accrue from standardizing DAB mobilization and operating procedures and one
suggestion (not from the above interviews) was for a Seminar / Workshop to identify what has been achieved
by DABs, what more can be achieved and how to get there.

  POINTERS TO IMPROVEMENT AREAS
5.1 IDENTIFIED COMMON SOURCES AND POSSIBLE CAUSES OF TIME AND COST-
    OVER-RUNS
5.1.1 Preamble
Previous sections are necessarily descriptive so as to explain and substantiate the basis for the conclusions
reached in this section. The following conclusions are in a more concise format, of listings with bullet points
and brief summaries where useful, so as to enable a quick overview and comparison. Justifications for each
conclusion in 5.1 and suggestions in 5.2 and 5.3 may be revisited if needed, as such back-up data should be
available in previous sections. No attempt is made to prioritize or rank the conclusions on sources and
apparent causes of over-runs, nor on examples of suggested mitigation strategies; not only because it is
outside the scope of this pilot study, but more importantly, since various stakeholders may assign different
ranks, depending on their own experiences and priorities, as well as the practicalities and capacities for
change in specific scenarios.

5.1.2    Principal Common Sources and apparent Causes of Over-runs identified from this pilot
         study
‘Sources’ of over-runs may be taken to be one level below the ‘categories’ (or ‘claims heads’) of claims such
as ‘exceptionally adverse weather’, ‘variations’ or ‘price escalations’, where the over-runs can be linked to
claims. Some over-runs may not be directly linked to claims heads though, particularly where the contractor
is responsible for the over-run. Therefore the following listings will not be constrained by a strict definition
of ‘source’; thus whether or not the source can be linked to a contractually available claim category is
immaterial in this report. Secondly a couple of sources such as ‘Price Escalations’ may seem to overlap with
claim categories themselves, although these are differentiated herein, e.g. as ‘High (and allegedly excessive)
price adjustment computations’.

Thirdly, for this pilot study, no definitive demarcation (based on mutually exclusive definitions) is professed
between sources and ‘causes’ either, since these boundaries are sometimes blurred. In general a ‘cause’ or
‘causes’ are generally expected to contribute to the source, just as some fundamental ‘root causes’ could
later be taken to contribute to the ‘proximate’ (immediately apparent) causes that are identified herein. An
illustrative example based on a wider and deeper previous study in Hong Kong, visualizes the eventually
expected hierarchy and links, as in Appendix 1. However, if delving into more detail, more than one cause
may contribute to one ‘claim category’, while one cause may contribute to more than one ‘claim category’
(as in Appendix 1) e.g. a proximate cause of ‘inadequate brief’ could unleash ‘over-run’ claim categories of
both ‘variations’ and ‘delayed design information’. A more detailed mapping of linkages is thus possible.

Fourthly, some of the identified ‘proximate’ causes may later by found to be fundamental i.e. root causes in
themselves. Also, the ‘causal hierarchy’ envisaged in the current pilot study differs from that developed in
Appendices 1 and 2, since the latter was based on one standard contract (Hong Kong Government standard
conditions for civil engineering works), whereas the current one should cater for a few different standard

                                                      26
conditions as used in roadworks in Sri Lanka, even as come across in the current small sample. Therefore, the
‘starting level’ is with ‘common sources’ rather than ‘claim categories’, although the former feed into the
latter.

Fifthly, it does not seem important to distinguish sources and causes of time over-runs from those of cost
over-runs, given their substantial overlap, as well as the fact that time over-runs often trigger cost over-runs.
The following listing of identified common over-run sources and proximate causes, is neither exhaustive nor
in a specific sequence although the list was compiled along the general time-line of a typical project cycle.

Listing of ‘common over-run sources’ and ‘apparent proximate causes’ of over-runs as extracted from the
pilot sample are indented as under:

 Common over-run Sources                  Apparent Proximate Causes

 1. Inadequate preliminary studies        could be political priorities and/or community /vested interest
    including feasibility studies prior   pressures and/or genuine urgent needs and/or funding time-line
    to project launch                     constraints etc.

 2. Unrealistic contract durations        could be political priorities and/or community pressures and/or
    (and possibly, correspondingly        funding time-line priorities etc.
    unrealistic budgets)

 3. Inadequate site investigations        could be as in above item and/or limited funding etc.
    e.g. including on bore-holes,
    cross-sectional surveys etc.

 4. Incomplete and/or delayed             could be inadequate time and/or budget allocated for design and
    and/or inaccurate designs (with       for design review; and/or shortfalls in experience of design
    errors and omissions)                 team; delays in passing bulk of design documents to review team
                                          i.e. close to the end of their review period etc.

 5. Major changes in contract             could be as in above item, including possible shortfalls in
    Quantities                            experience of relevant teams i.e. on quantities take-off, etc.

 6. New BOQ rates claimed by              could be as in above item, together with lack of clarity in relevant
    contractors due to allegedly          trigger clause, which in turn relates to the absence of a standard
    major deviations in quantities        computation methodology to establish the need for a new rate,
    (even when work scope was not         e.g. based on four conditions, one of which is to prove that the
    changed)                              unit cost of an item increased by over 1%

 7. Ambiguities or lack of clarity        could be as in above item including possible shortfalls in
    within contract-specific              experience of relevant teams and/or inadequate checks for
    documents e.g. incomplete or          compatibilities when changing some standard terminology,
    conflicting information within        contract conditions or technical specifications
    the same document that can
    thus be interpreted differently,
    whether drawings, special
                                                       27

   conditions of contract, particular
   specifications, BOQ etc.

8. Discrepancies between contract-      could be as in above item including possible shortfalls in
   specific documents e.g. between      experience of relevant teams
   drawings and BOQ and/or
   specifications

9. Shortfalls or ambiguities in         such generic ‘loop-holes’ in standard documents are not
   standard contract documents,         unexpected, but need periodic identifying and ‘plugging’ by
   including standard specifications,   review of standard documents. Note – ICTAD is currently
   methods of measurement (e.g.         reviewing its own documents, but the issues identified herein
   on tolerances and related            may not be on their agenda
   payments), standard bidding
   documents (e.g. [i] alleged
   ambiguities or inadequacies in
   definitions and implementation
   protocols, on for example: (a)
   ‘price adjustment (escalation)’
   payments for foreign
   components, or when VAT is
   removed/ reduced (b) increasing
   the unit rate of a BOQ item; and
   [ii] alleged lack of contractual
   teeth – deterrents/ penalties to
   discourage non-compliance in
   submissions e.g. of proper
   programmes with resource
   loadings etc.

10. Sub-standard performance of         could be (a) inadequate attention on weighting of technical
    consultants                         capacities and potential performance in selection criteria and/or
                                        (b) inadequate monitoring & control mechanisms and/or (c)
                                        inadequate monitoring & control implementation etc.

11. Sub-standard performance of         could be as in the item above
    contractors

12. Delays or other issues arising      could arise from any needs to up-date, rationalize or streamline
    from overall contract               approval and/decision making mechanisms etc.; from occasional
    administration                      delays in release of GOSL funds leading to payment delays and
                                        interest costs; over-use of informal channels e.g. between
                                        employers and contractors that could compromise the formal
                                        contractual mechanisms as well as undermine or demoralize
                                        those in the formal channels etc.

Common over-run Sources                Apparent Proximate Causes
13. Excessive Rework (e.g. ‘breaking   could arise from any or all of the above 3 items, as well as from
    and re-making’ defective or        the apparent misinterpretations of misuse of the Quality
    redundant works etc.)              Assurance/ Control expectations; and also from inadequate
                                       controls e.g. on alleged corner-cutting, as well as from opening of
                                       roads (to traffic) earlier than specified, due to alleged pressures
                                       from local authorities/ police

14. Major Variations to suit site      could arise from the 3rd and 4th points in this list, i.e. ‘Inadequate
    conditions                         site investigations’ and ‘Incomplete and/or delayed and/or
                                       inaccurate designs (with errors and omissions), as well as
                                       unforeseen utility interferences etc.

15. Major Variations to meet public/   could arise from inadequate or belated public engagement etc.
    political needs

16. Major Variations from major        could arise from inadequate planning and co-ordination with all
    scope changes                      potential stakeholders etc.

17. Inadequate Dispute Avoidance       could arise from by-passing consultants and/or DABs and lack of
    strategies and mechanisms          co-operation between principal participants

18. Inadequate Dispute Resolution      could arise from incomplete/ ambiguous Dispute Resolution
    strategies and mechanisms          clauses in contracts e.g. lack of confidence in the enforceability
                                       of DAB awards and/or lack of co-operation between principal
                                       participants

19. Absence of standard                Whatever the reasons for leaving it open before, it is worth
    methodologies for evaluating       considering, given costly ‘lessons learned’ in Sri Lanka,
    EOT                                application of protocols in other countries and the waste of time
                                       and expenses of all concerned

20. Delays in approvals for quarries   could arise from inadequate information supplied to tenderers,
    burrow pits etc.                   over-reliance on contractor capacities to engage with and
                                       navigate complex official and local networks e.g. without high
                                       level proactive support mobilized by the employer

21. High (and allegedly excessive)     these could arise from both [i] in overall ‘parent contract’ related
    Price escalation (adjustment)      situations of (a) excessive EOT awards e.g. if not evaluated
    computations                       systematically or settled ‘globally’ and (b) if documentation to
                                       prove purchases in ‘extended’ periods is not checked carefully; as
                                       well as [ii] in ‘clause-specific’ situations, where for example (a)
                                       one view is that there should be a trigger point for claiming
                                       ‘change of input %’; (b) the foreign component of some
                                       payments could be allegedly higher than intended because of an
                                       alleged ambiguity in the payment clause requiring all payments
                                       to be in a specified ratio of foreign : local component after
                                       overall computation, even when no escalation (adjustment) was

                                      expected or computed directly on the foreign component ; (c)
                                      there could be ambiguity in entitlements when VAT is reduced/
                                      removed, but overall prices maintained, hence no escalation

Note 1: Some of the ‘apparent proximate causes’ identified above may indeed ‘grow’ from generic root
causes such as mistrust and lack of communication between principal parties. Indeed these are mutually
reinforcing shortfalls, which also lead to lack of co-operation and a potential vicious cycle of
misunderstandings, personality clashes and snowballing disputes.

Note 2: Not all over-run ‘sources’ and ‘apparent proximate causes’ are listed above. Only what were
perceived as common over-run ‘sources’ based on this short-term pilot study are included in the above
summary listing in this Report.

5.2 POINTERS TO A SAMPLE OF ‘POTENTIAL AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT’
5.2.1 Preamble
This pilot study aimed to identify common sources of over-runs, with the findings only expected to provide
pointers to ‘potential areas for improvement’. Therefore, the following sub-section provide a sample of such
pointers. Indeed, more pointers could be derived from each and every one of the sources and potential causes
in 5.1 above.

In addition, some examples of potential improvements are provided in this sample, to help clarify and
operationalize the needs, as well as to illustrate some possibilities. Needless to say, an in-depth long-term
study - with a wider sample, more detailed data, deeper analysis and some form of validation - is needed,
before well-structured improvement and mitigation strategies and protocols can be proposed, since these
could well impact on long established policies and operational procedures and practices.

Some apparent ‘system shortcomings’ that are surfacing would need ‘systemic solutions’, but careful change
management would be needed. It is suggested that (a) a ‘road map’ plotting an optimal route to the desired
‘destination’ of ‘reduced time and cost’ over-runs, be formulated, along with (b) an ‘action plan’ for
structured implementation over a reasonable time-line that is agreed in advance by all stake-holders.


5.2.2 Sample of ‘Important Issues’ with ‘suggested areas for improvement’
It is stressed that the list below is only an indicative sample. Secondly, each of the ‘sources’ and ‘apparent
proximate causes’ listed in 5.1.2 could be addressed by specific improvement and mitigation actions.
However, this would be wasteful and probably counter-productive, since to ensure consistency and
coherence, while reducing duplication/ overlaps and/or conflicts, such actions should be formulated under a
consolidated mitigation strategy, along with a structured implementation plan. This is why only ‘suggested
areas for improvement’ are given below the examples of ‘Important Issues’ listed below. However, some
operational options are also added to illustrate each possibility.

 Improvement Area        Suggestion             Examples of Operational Options

 A. Issues arising       Revisit and improve    Careful selection of both contractors and consultants, that
    from                 relevant guidelines    looks well beyond the lowest price, to potential
    Procurement          and practices,         performance needs to be complemented by subsequent
    Strategies and       including those on     controls that strongly deter, if not penalize where possible,
    Procedures –         selection of           deviations from stated plans including programmes and
                         Consultants and        the promised quality and quantities of the various
                         Contractor             resources. A ‘carrot and stick’ approach is usually better
                                                e.g. incorporating a well-designed performance
                                                assessment scoring system (as in the Hong Kong Housing
                                                Authority) or even with basic black marks or ‘grey marks’
                                                incurred for bad or ‘poor’ performance, along with
                                                corresponding credits earned for good performance, that
                                                will reflect in future tendering opportunities
                                                (prequalifications), as well as tender evaluations.

                                           core team of experts in EOT evaluation, as well as other
                                           critical contractual and ‘over-run sensitive’ issues (as it is
                                           understood, has been recently started), and (c) meanwhile,
                                           engage a delay analysis specialist – whether on a periodic
                                           or ‘on call’ basis – so that such services may be mobilized
                                           as and when needed. A member of the internal core
                                           ‘expert’ team (and pending their development, the
                                           external consultant) could then provide a swift and timely
                                           2nd opinion on EOT evaluations done by RDA consultants.
                                           Recent experience on one contract that has gone to
                                           arbitration shows that excessive EOT may have been
                                           awarded by the consultant to start with. Although a final
                                           ruling is pending, this is not surprising in general scenarios,
                                           even if the initial EOT evaluation had been diligently done,
                                           given the wide choice of assessment protocols and
                                           techniques that can be applied. Sadly, if extrapolating to
                                           similar scenarios, this could represent the tip of an iceberg
                                           on apparently excessive or questionable EOT awards.

                                           Arising from the above, a parallel suggestion on this critical
                                           issue is to standardize the delay analysis techniques and
                                           protocols to be applied. Previously, Kumaraswamy and
                                           Yogeswaran (1999) demonstrated how different delay
                                           analysis methods could easily yield different answers (on
                                           possible EOT quantums). Subsequently Palaneeswaran and
                                           Kumaraswamy (2008) developed an ‘integrated Decision
                                           Support System for dealing with time extension
                                           entitlements’. However, given recent developments and
                                           the criticality of this issue, a broader and fresh approach is
                                           recommended, hence it is suggested to launch an exercise
                                           to identify the most appropriate EOT evaluation system for
                                           Sri Lanka roadworks. For example, Chong et al. (2014)
                                           revisited the ‘Delay and Disruption protocol’, which was

                                           published by the UK Society of Construction Law in 2002,
                                           with the intention of providing a code of practice and
                                           guidance on evaluating entitlements for delays and
                                           disruptions. While Chong et al. examined the feasibility of
                                           applying it in Malaysia, the suggested exercise could be an
                                           ‘open-minded’ independent exercise to identify what body
                                           of techniques/ protocols is suitable for Sri Lankan
                                           roadworks and also may be more widely acceptable to
                                           international arbitration/ adjudication bodies. If
                                           successfully identified, this may be (a) firstly trialed in
                                           some pilot projects/ contracts and (b) then refined and
                                           incorporated as the recommended/ preferred EOT
                                           evaluation methodology in special conditions of contract.

                                           Specific methods for particular EOT sources, like
                                           ‘exceptionally adverse weather’ may also be examined and
                                           rationalized for consistent application and minimizing
                                           possible abuse.

                    view to improving        i.e. discarding the present cushion of contingencies
                    overall ‘project         that may lull stakeholders into delaying corrective
                    governance’              action until some issues have snowballed beyond

D. Issues from      Examine possibilities of injecting definitive cut-off milestones into project/
   Avoidable        contract programme, that may only be changed / ‘violated’ in exceptional
   Variations       circumstances and with high level and/or multiple approvals. These could
   arising from     translate into ‘freezing’ (a) design brief, (b) design, (c) BOQs and other contract
   tender           documents, at specific points and requiring a senior officer to ‘sign off’ at each of
   documents        these milestones, certifying that this part is complete to the satisfaction of all
                    important stakeholders, hence unlikely to change. While not eliminating
                    variations, this deterrent could help to minimize them. Conversely, project/
                    contract teams that perform better at controlling such variations, may be given
                    due recognition. Since it is not always easy to ‘get it right the first time’, an
                    independent second look may be considered through ‘value engineering’ studies
                    of important elements.

5.3 EXAMPLES OF FOCUS AREAS FOR IN-DEPTH INVESTIGATION
5.3.1 Focus area examples
In general a deeper investigation is suggested of: (a) all sources and possible causes that were unveiled in the
pilot study, especially those listed in sub-section 5.1 above, together with any others that relevant decision
makers may choose from the body of this report or their own collective experiences; as well as (b) examples
of improvement areas in 5.2. Since prioritization would be premature in this pilot study, the following two
sample focus areas are listed as examples only:

   Rework, related over-runs and resource wastages on the Quality Assurance vs. Quality Control issues /
    misinterpretations – these have reportedly led to less supervision (‘control’) resources provided by some
    consultants when Quality Assurance is specified and alleged abuse by some contractors and/or arguably
    excessive demands by consultants from contractors.

   Shortfalls in Dispute Minimization and Dispute Resolution mechanisms – current provisions and
    protocols, starting with relevant contract clauses and practices for DABs can be probed, with stock-taking
    of current strengths/ weaknesses and potential to benefit more from DABs e.g. at an industry forum.

5.3.2    Preliminary suggestions on strategies for In-depth Investigation and follow-up
         Implementation
While some cost-significant and time-significant sources of over-runs have been unveiled in this pilot study
it is important to drill deeper to unearth the cost-significant and/or time-significant root causes – that may
give rise to more than one ‘source’ of over-runs, and also to assess their ‘avoidability’ / ‘addressability’, so
as to classify them for prioritization in an action plan.

For example: (a) identifying sources/ categories/ heads of time and cost over-runs and claims, that are [i] of
higher (relative) magnitude (hence more substantial in impact) and/or [ii] of greater frequency (hence more
likely) - through available statistics/ figures - quantitative), would help identify focus areas for probing in
interviews; (b) conversely experiential knowledge/ perceptions distilled from cross-sectional interviews,
along with common patterns/ potential vulnerabilities gleaned from base documents (qualitative) would help
home in on target areas for drilling deeper into the project databases/ statistics, with a view to unveiling any
discernible potential patterns in frequency and/or relative magnitude (quantitative); while (c) comparisons
of the findings from the above overlapping and often iterative lines of inquiry should enable ‘triangulation’
for cross-checks / reasonable comparisons, so as to consolidate the eventual outcomes with greater
confidence.

Indeed a study-specific ‘mixed methods’ strategy would synergize quantitative with qualitative tools and
enable more reliable findings, that would be compared and verified / validated to whatever extent possible.
Apart from the standard approaches, the investigation strategy could include a ‘longitudinal study’ i.e. over
a reasonable span of time on a few ‘live’ case study contracts. The resulting findings and recommendations.
could be ranked for potential impact and implementability. Then higher priority initial recommendations may
be ‘trialed’ in ‘pilot’ or ‘demonstration’ projects or contracts, where deemed necessary or useful.



                                                      34
A proposal based on the above findings, could be to explore both the feasibility and potential value of
developing an ‘Over-run Hotspots Dashboard’ (or ‘Over-runs Alert Indicator’) that could help management
to focus more attention and deploy resources, on areas particularly vulnerable to over-runs in different types
of roadworks projects. While certain methods could be similar to some of those in risk appraisals, databases
of over-runs on previous similar contracts, could be developed and categorized to highlight sources and
causes triggering over-runs of higher (a) magnitude, (b) frequency and (c) avoidability.

Focusing attention on such hotspots in advance, should help reduce the more avoidable and significant time
and cost over-runs. Apart from the ‘systemic solutions’ suggested in 5.2.1, along with the proposed ‘road
map’ and ‘action plan’, overall over-runs minimization would also need total organizational commitment,
probably including a ‘culture shift’, adequate relevant resources and excellent change management.
