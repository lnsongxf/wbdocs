        BOX 1. WOMEN, MIGRATION, AND ENERGY BILLS IN TAJIKISTAN



        Ethnographic interviews in Tajikistan reveal that the presence of remittance income can
        be a key determinant of whether the family can afford to pay electricity bills and buy
        heating fuels for the winter. It is common for migrants to send money home in the
        summer/fall that is dedicated to purchasing wood or coal for the winter. A household’s
        ability to procure energy sources can change drastically in the event a migrant loses a
        job, returns home, or stops sending remittances.


        “Abandoned wives” and their households in Tajikistan constitute an increasingly vulnera-
        ble group, and one that is also hard to identify and reach with assistance programs. A
        2009 IOM study estimated that up to one-third of labor migrants may settle permanently
        in the host country. The same study also found that families abandoned by migrants
        often live in primitive conditions without much support from family or extended family.


        Overall, female-headed households in Tajikistan are more vulnerable in accessing energy
        sources because of fewer income-generating opportunities, constraints to participating in
        labor migration, and the fact that procuring fuels such as wood, coal, and bottled gas
        is traditionally seen as a male responsibility.
