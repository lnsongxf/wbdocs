         Key Water and Sanitation Sector Challenges
         XXFinancing  the renewal and upgrading of water and sanitation infrastructure. Bulgaria continues
            to face major challenges meeting the national and European water and sanitation services
            requirements, since approximately €5.9 billion will be needed from 2014 to 2020.
         XXEnsuring   the financing and affordability of water tariffs in the future. Due to investment
            forecasts, some issues regarding capital and operating costs recovery will arise in the near future.
            EU funds will be able to finance only around 30% of total needed capital investments. Hence, the
            actual water price will most likely increase, potentially pushing prices beyond the affordability
            threshold of lower-income households. The water supply and sanitation strategy 2014-2023
            underscores the necessity to address the water sector inefficiencies (high nonrevenue water, low
            collection ratio) in order to ensure public acceptance of tariffs.
         XXImproving   water utility staff capacity and training. In addition to financing challenges, education
            and training of staff at all levels of water utilities will be necessary to ensure the sustainable
            development of the water sector.

Economy. Bulgaria, which has been an EU Member State since 2007, is an emerging market economy that has
had negative population growth since the early 1990s. Since 2001, GDP grew at an average 6% per year, driven by
considerable foreign direct investment. As a result of the 2007–2008 financial crisis, Bulgaria’s economy declined in
2009 by 5.5%, but quickly returned to a positive growth rate in 2010, in contrast to other Balkan countries (World Bank
2015). At the same time, there remain significant socioeconomic differences among Bulgarian regions. For example,
the Southwest territorial unit leads the country in key economic development indicators, but the Northwest and North-
central units are in the two last places in the entire EU. The negative growth in population in Bulgaria can be attributed
to a fertility rate among the lowest in the world and a death rate among the highest. According to the 2011 census,
in the last 10 years, the rural population decreased by 11%, and the urban population increased by 5%. Approximately
one-sixth of the total population is concentrated in Sofia. Bulgarians, the main ethnic group, comprise 84.8% of
population. Turkish and Roma minorities comprise 8.8% and 4.9%, respectively.

Governance. Bulgaria is a unitary state with strong administrative regions. The country is divided into 28 regions
(oblasti, singular oblast), including the metropolitan capital Sofia-Grad. Each oblast takes the name of its biggest city.
The regions are further subdivided into 264 municipalities. While municipalities are run by locally elected mayors and
municipal councils, regions are administered by governors directly appointed by the Council of Ministers. Bulgaria is
highly centralized, and the regions and municipalities are heavily dependent on the central government for funding
(NAMRB 2014).

Water resources. According to an analysis of projected water demand, Bulgaria is not a water-stressed country.
Over 60 rivers flow through Bulgaria, and the Danube, at 470 km, is the longest in the country. There are also 6 lakes
and 23 dams. The country is divided into 4 catchments regions: the Danube, Black Sea, Eastern Aegean, and Western
Aegean. Annual river runoff is expected to decrease up to 14% in the next 50 years and to be 20% less at the end of
the century due to current climate trends. An analysis of the projected domestic water consumption and internal
water resource base suggests that Bulgaria is not a water-stressed country. Since 1990, abstractions for both
agricultural and industrial purposes have fallen drastically, contributing to its overall low water stress. Yet, there are
areas of Bulgaria that experience water scarcity and, in particular, seasonal water scarcity in dry summers. The most
vulnerable areas with rainfall below 300 mm are Pavlikeni, Sofia, and Vidin to Lom Montana in the Danube region;

Shabla-Varna in the Black Sea region; Panagyurishte, Pazardzhik, Plovdiv, Sadovo, and Sliven and in the East Aegean
Sea region; and Blagoevgrad, Kyustendil, and Sandanski in the West Aegean Sea region. The Bulgarian government
has adopted the Third Action plan on climate change, which aims to mitigate the impact of climate change. The
action plan covers a wide range of sectors, but water is excluded from the analysis, the scenarios, and the mitigation
measures identified in the plan (MoEW 2014).

Water supply sources. Surface water is the main source for drinking water supply (71%). Surface water provides 52% of
the total raw water abstracted, and groundwater provides the other 48%. Groundwater is of good quality in all river basins
despite nitrate pollution. Seventy-nine percent of groundwater abstracted is used for public water supply; 17% for industry;
2% for agriculture, forestry, and fisheries; 2% for services. The rest is used for irrigation. Surface water is polluted by
domestic water from urban sewerage systems and by untreated industrial wastewater discharged into rivers (MoEW 2014).

Capacity and training. Improving staff capacity is a challenge for most Bulgarian water utilities. In 2009, 18,000
people were employed in water collection, treatment, and supply (Eurostat 2015a). In state-owned companies, the
average number of employees ranges from 300 to 950, whereas in municipal-owned companies it ranges from 30 to
90. The national water association comprises mainly state-owned water and sanitation utilities, but some municipal

water utilities have recently joined. It provides neither training nor capacity-building programs, and as a result, building
institutional capacity for water stakeholders is a challenge. However, the Sofia water utility regularly implements
training programs for its staff (Sofiyska Voda 2014).

Economic regulation. A national agency is responsible for both economic regulation and regulation of the energy
sector. The Regulation of Water and Sanitation Services Act established the Energy and Water Regulatory Commission
(EWRC), an independent specialized state body consisting of 9 members, of which two must have a minimum number of
years’ experience in the field of WSS. The responsibilities of the EWRC include (a) drafting statutory instruments for the
water sector, (b) approving water services business plans, (c) approving prices of water supply and sewerage services in
response to applications by utility companies, (d) overseeing the achievement of target values for service-level indicators
by services, and (e) handling consumer complaints (EWRC 2015). The Regulation of Water and Sanitation Services
Act also establishes the legal framework for ownership and management of waters as a national natural resource, and
ownership of water development systems and facilities (Parliament BG 2011).

Ongoing or planned reforms. Water sector restructuring reforms increased the number of water utility companies.
Until 1989, Bulgaria’s water and sanitation services needs were covered by 28 regional utility companies and 1
municipal company for Sofia. Their territorial scope coincided with the country’s subdivision into 28 administrative

districts. All utility companies were 100% state owned, with the exception of the one in Sofia, which was owned
by the municipality. With the general economic restructuring and decentralization of the 1990s, some of the water
companies were split and reorganized into companies jointly owned by the state and municipalities, whereby the
state transferred 49% of the capital to the municipalities served by the companies. This process led to a substantial
increase in the number of water utility companies and to greater heterogeneity in asset ownership and utility
ownership. Some companies remained 100% state owned, while others (usually the smaller ones, serving one
municipality) were wholly transferred to the municipalities served. Resulting inconsistencies in the ownership of
regional water storage and transmission infrastructure are yet to be resolved (MoEW 2011). Building upon these
findings, the 2014-2023 Water supply and sanitation strategy provides for full transfer of asset ownership, enhanced
autonomy of operators, and consolidation of the water sector (MRRB 2014).

remains low at 74%, and wastewater treatment coverage is even lower at 56%                                              information on most

joined the EU in 2007 has, in fact, caused it to miss an interim deadline under the                                     for water and sanitation

Equity of access to services. Access to sanitation services is a problem for vulnerable populations. The access rate
to piped water for the bottom 40% of the population is high, at 96%, whereas it is low for flush toilets, at 50%. Only 76%
of the poorest share of the population (those living on less than $2.50/day PPP) has access to piped water supply and
only 12% to flush toilets (Authors’ elaboration). Only 5% of the Roma population does not have access to an improved
water source, whereas 41% does not have access to improved sanitation (UNDP/World Bank/EC 2011).

Service infrastructure. The water and sanitation infrastructure requires renovation, renewal, and extension. The
Bulgarian water and sanitation infrastructure was mainly built in the 1960s and 1970s (MRRB 2014). The networks
are mainly made of steel and eternite (fiber cement). There is a high level of corrosion, which poses a risk to water
quality. The infrastructure is quite old in general, and needs to be renovated. Over 20% of the infrastructure is
amortized and needs reconstruction. A segment of the water equipment does not provide the necessary quantity of
water to consumers and needs extension and renewal.

Quality of service. In the last 10 years, there has been considerable improvement in the quality of drinking
water (Figure 4). As a result, today the quality of Bulgaria’s drinking water is generally good, and it is supplied on a
continuous basis. Still, microbiological noncompliance (such as presence of E. coli) exceeds 5% in 5 regions. Deviation
from the norm is characteristic of small water supply systems that do not have treatment facilities and that thus
release water to the population after simple chlorination. Water quality may also be compromised by insufficient
monitoring performed by water supply and sanitation companies. As a temporary measure, the Ministry of Health
may perform monitoring functions ( MoH 2015).

Overall efficiency. Important water losses and low staff productivity prevent Bulgarian water utilities from
improving efficiency. Bulgaria has a higher level of nonrevenue water than most European countries. In 2011, it
amounted to 60% of water produced and 564,375 m³ in absolute losses (NSI 2015b). By some accounts, water losses
in urban areas reach 60 m³ per km per day (GWI 2005). The greater share of nonrevenue water can be attributed
to physical losses, since 90% of the network was built before 1990 (MRRB 2014). Bulgarian water companies also
tend to be overstaffed. In terms of staff per 1,000 connections, Bulgarian companies employ more staff than other
EU countries (EWRC 2015). While this contrast can be moderated to some extent by the fact that Bulgarian water

than the levels of well-operated utilities. The billing collection ratio amounted to 72 in 2012 (Figure 5).

Recent trends. Priority is given to water sector efficiency gains to improve sustainability. The government’s policy
priorities were identified in the 2013 Water Strategy. According to the document, the strategic objectives of the sector
are (a) environmental, technical, and financial sustainability of water services; (b) affordability of water services to
consumers; (c) improved efficiency and service quality of Bulgarian water companies; and (d) compliance with all
regulatory requirements by water stakeholders (MoEW 2014).

Overall sector financing. Tariffs are the main source of funding of water utilities. Revenues collected from water
tariffs represent 57% of the total financing of the sector (Figure 6). Those revenues cover operational costs, and
investments are mostly funded by EU grants and are augmented by subsidies from local taxes through municipal
budgets. Subsidies from the national budget are much less important.

Affordability. Affordability is not currently an issue, but that may change due to significant compliance
investments needs. Current monthly potential water and wastewater expenditure represents 2.7% of average monthly
household income, but in order to finance operation and maintenance improvement costs, water tariffs will need to
increase. The Regulation on Water and Sanitation Services Act states that the price of 2.8 m³ of water per person per
month should not exceed 4% of the average monthly household income at the district level. However, the average
water bill for a household in the bottom 40% of the population connected to public service would potentially represent
4.6% of income, and a household in the poorest decile connected to public service would potentially pay more than
15% (Authors’ elaboration). These values appear above the international threshold of 4 to 5%.




Water Sector Sustainability
and Main Challenges
To evaluate and reflect the sustainability of services in the region, an overall sector sustainability assessment was
done taking into account four main dimensions: access to services, quality of services, efficiency of services, and
financing of services. Each of these dimensions is measured through three simple and objective indicators. For each
indicator, best practice values are established by looking at the best performers in the region, and countries closest to
those best performers are deemed to have a more mature sector. A more complete description of the methodology to
assess the sector sustainability is included in the Annex of the State of the Sector Regional Report from the Danube
Water Program. The outcomes of this assessment for Bulgaria’s water sector are presented in Figure 11, which also
shows average and best practices in the Danube region. The Bulgarian sector sustainability score is 66, which is just
above Danube average sustainability of 64. The assessment shows that, on average, the country performs well in
terms of access to piped water, staffing level, and nonrevenue water. The main deficiencies of Bulgaria’s water sector
identified through the sector sustainability assessment are operating cost coverage, investment level, and customer
satisfaction level (Figure 11).

The main sector challenges are:

XXFinancing the renewal and upgrading of water and sanitation infrastructure. Bulgaria continues to face
  major challenges meeting the national water and sanitation services requirements. Preliminary World
  Bank calculations based on the short-term investment programs of the Regional Master Plans indicated

  that approximately Lev 11.5 billion (€5.9 billion) will be needed over a 10-year period (2014–2023). Lev 7.5
  billion of this amount is considered to be compliance costs, and Lev 4 billion is for urgent rehabilitation and
  replacement projects (MRRB 2014).

X XEnsuring the affordability of water tariffs in the future. Due to investment forecasts, some issues
  regarding capital and operating costs recovery will arise in the near future. EU funds will be able to finance
  only around 30% of the total needed capital investments. Hence, the actual water price will most likely
  increase, potentially pushing prices beyond the affordability threshold of lower-income households (MRRB
  2014). The water supply and sanitation strategy 2014-2023 underscores the necessity of addressing
  the water sector inefficiencies (high nonrevenue water, low collection ratio) in order to ensure public
  acceptance of tariffs. Consolidation of the water sector is also provided for to achieve economies of scale
  and overcome governance issues (MRRB 2014).

XXImproving   water utility staff capacity and training. In addition to financing challenges, education and training
  of staff at all levels of water utilities will be necessary to ensure the sustainable development of the water sector.
  Strengthening the institutional capacity of all water stakeholders is an important challenge to improve water
  sector efficiency and productivity (MRRB 2014).
