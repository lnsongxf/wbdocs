The mid-1990s were a challenging time for low-income Ecuadorians that needed to access
affordable, quality medicines. Because of political turmoil and a severe financial crisis, urban
poverty increased from 35 percent to 65 percent between 1998 and mid-1999 in Ecuador.1 The
lack of universal public insurance meant that private spending on health was almost entirely
out-of-pocket, with an estimated 61 percent on pharmaceuticals.2

ESTABLISHING A PHARMACEUTICAL
RETAIL FOOTPRINT

The Early Years
GPF was founded by Galo Villamar Villafuerte, a pioneer
who helped shape Ecuador’s pharmaceutical retail industry.
In 1930, his father established a small drugstore in the
historical district of Quito, the country’s capital. After
pursuing degrees in civil engineering and economics,
Villamar took over the store in 1948.


Villamar offered competitive prices and more personalized
service than the competition, which underpinned the
company’s growth. By the early 1950s he was able to
acquire his largest competitor in Quito, Botica Pichincha.
Villamar became one of the first in Ecuador to introduce
packaged medicines in his pharmacies in addition to mixing
and dispensing medical compounds, which was standard               Medicinas S.A. FARCOMED in 1985. By then the company had

of top-of-the-line generics, the company partnered with a

Apart from these strategies, the company’s ability to

Ensuring Quality
Quality is a key element of the SanaSana value proposition.
The company procures products from reliable suppliers and
maintains the right temperature and humidity conditions
for storage at the distribution center, during transport, and
at pharmacies. In addition, it trains staff in the storage and
handling of medicines. Products past their expiration dates
are collected and disposed of in accordance with national
regulations.

Talent Management
Offering a consistent, quality experience in SanaSana
pharmacies meant recruiting the right people and investing
in their training. It was easier to attract people to work in
pharmacies in small towns and rural areas where SanaSana
was the employer of choice. In large cities, however, the
company faced typical retail industry difficulties in retaining
staff. Millennials in particular worked for a few years and
moved on to other jobs. Learning to efficiently manage this
personnel turnover became a critical competence for the
company.


In the retail sector, good benefits, training, and career
progression can alleviate retention challenges and these
strategies have helped GPF. To attract and retain youth
who value skill development, GPF offers one of the
strongest benefits packages in the industry along with

Family-owned businesses often grapple with corporate
governance issues, which can be problematic as the
businesses grow and seek investment. To position itself for
growth, GPF took several steps to improve its corporate
governance:


•	 First, the company strengthened its board of directors
  in 2010 by including independent directors along with
  shareholding family members. In addition, it created a
  formal “Family Protocol” to define the roles, rights, and
  obligations of shareholding family members, further
  promoting a meritocratic, results-based culture.


•	 Second, GPF recruited outside talent for key senior
  management positions such as the CEO and CFO, both of
  whom are professionals with ample corporate experience
  and no ties to the family. Independent professionals also
  hold the majority of second tier executive positions.




                                                                11
•	 Third, although it is not required for a private company,
  GPF is committed to increasing transparency by
  publishing an annual sustainability report that adheres to
  international sustainability guidelines set by the Global
  Reporting Initiative.8 It is the only pharmaceutical retail
  company in Ecuador to do so.


LOOKING AHEAD

Today there are more than 6,200 pharmacies in Ecuador
and competition is fierce among pharmacies that serve the
low-income market segment. GPF will need to continue its
tradition of innovation to stay ahead of the competition.
The company sees itself transitioning from a provider of
healthcare products to one that also offers healthcare
solutions. Toward this end, it is developing the concept of
the ‘SanaSana 2.0 store’ to offer even greater convenience
for low-income customers. In 2017, for example, the
company plans to pilot partnerships with physicians to add
walk-in clinics and labs to its stores.
