Box 4: Mental Health Symptoms as Described by Ex-Combatants in the Mutobo Center
Thinking Too Much: Depression and Fear
“I always have a severe headache, also because of the sounds of gunshots that never leave my head. I also have
periodical fear that disturbs my heart as if a bomb had exploded nearby.”
“I fear what may come, how to sustain my family; I don’t know where I come from, have no family, no land, no
education.”
Nightmares and Insomnia
“Even yesterday I dreamed of the killings of my parents and little brother. I never could bury them properly.”
“Many nights I don’t sleep; I have dreams that I see dead people. I cry in my sleep. Most of the men in our dormitory are
awake during the night.”
Hallucinations
“I hear the screaming of my family, before they were killed.”
“I always see the images of my comrades who were killed by Mai Mai by machetes.”
“I hear gunshots; I see things that are not really there. I see people that were killed, they are screaming at me. I see very
often things that are not there and I hear voices that are only in my head.”
Agitation and Anger Outbursts
“It happens to me often that I become very angry with my friends, and my wife and children are afraid of me, for my
anger.”
“I feel lot of anger, I am nervous, I keep the anger inside here. I have to control myself in the center. It makes me
depressed. I isolate myself to control me.”
Flashbacks and Intrusive Thoughts
“For example, one night I took the gun and I nearly killed my wife thinking I was shooting at my enemy, and other times
I kicked my wife when were in bed as I was remembering the kind of physical exercises we were doing during our refresh
courses.”
“I see the death screaming to me; I cannot do anything. I see the many amputated bodies and I feel powerless. I see dead
bodies everywhere, the dead are talking to me, but I cannot help them. I hear them crying.”

                          Psychosocial Support and Gender-Based Violence Prevention
          Community-Based Sociotherapy26
          A community-based group therapy approach was developed in Rwanda as a model for psycho-social support after
          the genocide. Groups of community members, with different histories (e.g. victims and/or perpetrators of the war
          and genocide), share daily problems (e.g. family conflicts, fear, mistrust, gender-based violence, stigma, poverty)
          in a weekly group during 15 weeks. In this process, the group functions as a therapeutic medium and facilitates
          the development of peer support structures. The groups are guided by two trained facilitators who aim to create a
          safe environment, where broken social relations can be restored and problems related to the aftermath of political
          violence can be shared, acknowledged and managed by the group working together.
          Living Peace Groups
          Living Peace Groups aim to help men and their partners in post-conflict settings to heal from their experiences of
          trauma, to restore their social and partner relations and to strengthen and develop positive coping strategies that
          exclude all forms of violence, including self-directed violence and sexual and gender-based violence.
          Since 2012, Promundo, supported by the World Bank’s LOGiCA (Learning on Gender & Conflict in Africa) Program,
          has worked with local partners in Burundi and DRC on the development of Living Peace Groups since 2012. Three
          curricula were developed, implemented and tested in Goma, DRC, in Luvungi, DRC, and in Burundi. These curricula
          were based on group-therapy best practices that have emerged from men and gender transformative group-
          educational programs developed by Promundo, which have been assessed in numerous impact evaluations
          around the world.
          The group-therapy process has been used with survivors of sexual violence, husbands of conflict-related rape
          survivors and witnesses of genocide and other violence. It has been shown to consistently lead to improvements
          in couple relationships and more positive coping strategies. End-line results from the pilot phase confirm that,
          nearly universally, men and women participants report significant, positive changes, including reduced alcohol
          abuse and drinking; controlled frustration and aggression; income-sharing with wife and family; peace at home
          and happier children; and improved health.
          Good Neighbors Model
          The Good Neighbors Model is a community-based approach, developed and implemented since 2004 in
          Mozambique in a suburban area of Maputo, where many ex-combatants and families settled after the end of the
          civil war in Mozambique. A local non-governmental organization, CAPAZ, trained teams of good neighbors (both
          men and women) in communities to help families identify their problems and, if needed, to intervene in cases of
          violence and/or refer the families to public services (e.g. health, psychosocial and legal services).
          These good neighbors, all volunteers, stay in close contact with local authorities and local public services. In
          the communities, they are highly respected for their knowledge; their connections with local authorities, police
          and health personnel; and their assistance to community members. Men, women and children come to the
          good neighbors’ homes, asking for advice on resolving problems. The model shows the importance of shared
     26   responsibility, solidarity and ownership of problem solving in a community to create a safe community. The model
          is a viable and low-cost intervention that provides guidance and psychosocial support to families.

                             IMAGES Questionnaire

     GEM Scale
     Promundo uses the Gender Equitable Men (GEM) Scale as part of the questionnaire to measure ex-combat-
     ants’ gender-related attitudes. The GEM Scale is a collection of attitude questions that has been widely used
     in diverse settings and has consistently shown a high rate of internal reliability in all IMAGES study countries.
     The GEM Scale, originally developed by the Population Council and Promundo, was first used with young
     men, ages 15 to 24 (Pulerwitz & Barker, 2008). The original scale includes 17 attitudinal statements about
     different dimensions of men’s gender attitudes. The scale has since been validated in household research in
     more than 20 countries, with both men and women. For IMAGES, the GEM Scale was slightly adapted with
     additional questions appropriate for adult men and adult women. The GEM scale is adapted to the context of
     the ex-combatants in this study.

     The GEM Scale results are trichotomized by the total score. That is, the range of possible scores for that
     country is divided into equal thirds. Thereafter, the men and women scoring in the lowest third (of the pos-
     sible score, not of the entire pool of responses) were placed in the “low equity” category, those in the middle
     third in the “moderate equity” category and those in the highest third in the “high equity” category. “High
     equity” refers to the group of men and women that supported more equitable views (e.g. the view that men
     and women are equal), whereas “low equity” means the respondent holds more rigid or inequitable views
     about gender norms (i.e. that men should have more privileges than women). As such, the scale provides a
     ranking of individuals in terms of the degree to which they believe in more equitable or less equitable views
     of gender relations.

     Questions on Experiencing and Using Violence
     In addition to the GEM Scale, the IMAGES questionnaire contains a large number of questions that are
     related to an individual’s socialization regarding violence, during childhood and in adult life. In recent years,
     the amount of research on violence against women has increased tremendously, accompanied by the de-
     velopment of more sophisticated research instruments and more appropriate ethical guidelines, which IM-
     AGES has followed. The IMAGES studies follow a methodology in questioning the use of violence similar to
     the methodology used in the World Health Organization (WHO) multi-country study on violence against
     women with household data on women’s reports of numerous forms of violence from male partners and the
     factors associated with that violence (García-Moreno, et al., 2005).

     The items on intimate partner violence (IPV) and sexual violence follow the now-standard WHO practice of
     asking about specific acts carried out or experienced by the respondent, rather than asking more general ques-
     tions about IPV using the word “violence.” Thus, rather than asking men if they ever used violence against
     their partners or children, the questionnaire asks if they have ever slapped, hit or pushed their partners. The
     same approach is used in asking men about their childhood experiences of witnessing or experiencing vio-
     lence.

     The IMAGES survey in the Mutobo Center was only carried out among men, and the questions took into
     account that men may not have lived within partner relationships in the preceding few years. Questions ad-




58
dressed different experiences with violence that took place in family and or peer group environments like
school and community.

Specific items on IPV or sexual violence in the IMAGES questionnaire included:

▶▶   Witnessing physical (non-sexual) IPV by adults in family of origin (e.g. the respondents saw their fathers
     or other men use physical violence against their mothers when they were children);

▶▶   Experiences of physical (non-sexual) IPV, sexual violence, psychological violence ever and in the last
     year (e.g. they were victims of one of these forms of violence);

▶▶   Use of physical (non-sexual) IPV, sexual violence, psychological or economic violence against a current
     or past female intimate partner ever and in the last year;

▶▶   Childhood experiences of sexual violence (e.g. they personally experienced unwanted touching of geni-
     tals, attempted forced sex or actual forced sex);

▶▶   Personally were victims of physical violence from teachers, parents or peers during childhood; and

▶▶   Experiences (as victims and/or perpetrators) with war-related violence including sexual and gender-
     based violence.
