Executive summary

Introduction
     This report provides a review of the Armenian mining sector, and assesses its potential to contribute to
     sustainable economic growth and development. Based on the findings, it provides recommendations
     for initiatives and actions for the future development of the sector.
     The report was produced in the period October 2015 to April 2016. It was commissioned by the World
     Bank with the aim to assist the Armenian government to gain a better understanding of key social and
     environmental challenges and future opportunities for the Armenian Mining Sector; and to support
     the development of a minerals strategy which is line with international good practices and which con-
     tributes to sustainable development.
     The findings are based on: desktop reviews of existing documents; a large number of meetings and
     interviews with affected and interested stakeholders; field work performed in the main mining districts
     of Armenia; stakeholder workshops. Comments, suggestions and corrections on a draft version of this
     report has been provided by representatives of the GoA, and the World Bank. Further, oversight and
     feedback was continuously provided by representatives of the World Bank.
     Armenia is a small (29,743 km2), land locked, lower middle income country with a population of about
     3 million. The country gained its independence in 1991 and it has a democratic system of governance.
     It is situated in a geopolitically complex and volatile region, which in turn means that at present, the
     only significant land based route for trade in and out of the country runs through neighbouring Geor-
     gia in the north and to Iran in south. Armenia is a seismically active and mountainous country. There is
     one major lake, Lake Sevan in the east. Rivers in the west and south drain into the Araks river system
     and further into Iran and Turkey. In the north and northeast, rivers drain northwards into the Kura
     river system and further into Georgia and Azerbaijan. The Armenian climate is continental with hot
     summers and cold winters, and the country is regarded as being especially sensitive to the effects of
     climate change. The topographic and climatic variations have resulted in highly diverse ecosystems.
     The forest cover is less than 10% of the country’s area.
     Armenia’s economy has undergone major structural changes since independence, changing from an
     industry-based economy to increasingly becoming an economy based on agriculture and trade. The
     minerals sector represents one of few industrial sectors that have developed in an economically posi-
     tive way, and it is seen by the GoA as having an important role in further development of the country’s
     economy. During the last 14 years, the mining and quarrying sector has contributed 2.2% to overall
     GDP. The sector has also been able to attract tangible foreign investment, both through the privatisa-
     tion of state owned enterprises, and through new mineral related developments. In the past 5 years,
     inflows from exports from the sector have been in the region of USD 500 million annually, making it
     Armenia’s top sector in terms of export and inflow of foreign exchange. Mining companies are sig-
     nificant job providers, especially as they offer formal jobs in more rural areas. In 2014, 7,057 people
     were employed in the metallic mining sector, which is around 10% of those employed in the industrial
     branch of the economy.

The current state of the mineral sector
         Armenia’s geology is generally prospective for minerals projects. With regards to metals, the main
         metals found include copper and gold, and there are three regions that are especially important,
         namely: (i) the Lori province in the north with copper deposits of different types; (ii) the Kapan area
         in the southeast, which hosts copper and polymetallic deposits; and (iii) the Zangezur mountain range
         in the southwest, where a number of copper and copper-molybdenum deposits are located. Gold is
         sometimes found in the abovementioned type of polymetallic deposits, as well as in a number of other
         locations throughout the country.
         Metal mining has a long history in Armenia. Copper mining began in the Alaverdi area in the Lori prov-
         ince in the 1770s. In the 1840s, copper mining started in Kapan, and in the middle of the 20th century
         the larger Kajaran copper-molybdenum mine started production. At present (end 2015), there are 27
         granted rights for metal mining; 14 of which are for mines in operation and 13 for projects that are still
         at the exploration stage. The sector comprises a number of small to medium sized projects and only
         one large and stably operating mine: ZCMC’s Kajaran copper-molybdenum mine that produces some
         18.5Mt of ore per year, which in turn represents more than 60% of the turnover of the whole mining
         sector. Another copper mine that could become a significant producer is the Teghut mine in Lori prov-
         ince, which commenced operation in the end of 2014. Subject to the efficiency of the operation, its
         copper production could approach half that of Kajaran.
         With regards to gold, the Sotk mine in the east is the main producer, and gold is also of major impor-
         tance at the Shahumyan mine in the south. Reported gold grades at other smaller mines are often
         high to extremely high, which apparently makes some of these small deposits economic. However, as
         the reserves tonnages at these mines are small, they generally have corresponding short mine lives.
         In contrast to the many high grade / low tonnage gold projects, Lydian International’s Amulsar project
         in the south-central area is a low grade / large volume deposit. The project has completed a feasibility
         study and secured most of the financing needed for mine construction. Lydian plan for a gold produc-
         tion of 200,000 oz/yr for a mine life of 10 years. The value of the yearly production, at current metal
         prices, would be on par with the value of the production at Kajaran, i.e. 200 million USD.
         There are about 440 permits for mining or quarrying of industrial minerals, and the vast majority are
         for dimension stone, aggregates, or materials otherwise used for construction purposes. Tuff is quar-
         ried in western and central Armenia. In the past, tuff sourced from Armenia was used widely as a di-
         mension stone across the Soviet Union. Today, export is difficult, due to both economic, infrastructure
         and geopolitical reasons. Aggregate quarrying is strongly focussed to the central parts of the country,
         which is also the primary area of development and urbanization. Basalt and andesite, pumice, and
         volcanic slag quarrying is likewise concentrated to the area around the capital Yerevan.

              Metal mining projects in Armenia.
       Despite the relatively large number of quarries, the total production of dimension stone and aggre-
       gates is comparatively small in relation to the size of the country. This, in turn, suggests that each
       operation is small and/or that production methods are inefficient. The production of other types of
       industrial minerals in Armenia is also overall small and limited to a handful products. In the past, large
       amounts of perlite were produced (some 2,200,000 tons in 1990) and Armenia has also in more recent
       years (since independence) exported perlite to European and neighbouring markets. Today the pro-
       duction of perlite is much smaller but still represents some 2.2% of the world production. Bentonite
       and diatomite were also mined at larger scales in the past while today the production is much smaller.
       There has been little recent greenfield exploration undertaken, and the exploration efforts that exist
       are usually related to deposits known from Soviet era exploration. There are currently (December
       2015) 44 permits for metals exploration. Most of these are located near historic and current mines.
       The majority of the exploration projects are not at an advanced stage and it is concluded that explora-
       tion in Armenia is neither advanced nor very extensive geographically. Considering the fact that Arme-
       nia has prospective geology, the number of exploration permits is comparatively small. Furthermore,
       none of the exploration licenses are held (directly or indirectly) by any of the larger and well known
       international mining and exploration companies, which in turn suggests there to be relatively little
       international interest in investing in exploration in Armenia.
       There are 21 tailings dams in Armenia, of which 13 are active. ZCMC’s Artsvanik dam is by far the
       largest of the active dams, with a current volume that makes up almost 75% of the total volume of
       all tailings in the country. The recently commissioned Teghut dam is also designed for large volumes.
       Other dams are much smaller.
Armenia: Strategic Mineral Sector Sustainability Assessment                                                         ix



         The government is promoting re-processing of tailings, and a specific law has been passed where the
         control of three specific tailings dams has been handed over to the state for the purpose of contracting
         out rights for reprocessing. Ideally, there exist possibilities for retreating some of the tailings, and thus
         addressing both environmental issues and creating economic opportunities However, international
         comparison reveals that projects for retreating copper tailings are exceedingly rare. Additionally, the
         concerns related to the responsibility for the potential environmental impacts need to be resolved.

Regulatory and institutional framework
         The Armenian regulatory system has a strong tendency towards extensive regulation by law, rather
         than by using instruments such as regulation, guidelines or evolved practice. This is an approach that
         entails frequent revision and amendment of the laws. Thus, the RA Mining Code has been amended
         comparatively frequently since independence, and additional (although fairly minor) amendments are
         now before the parliament. Overall in the development of mineral law in Armenia, there appears to
         have been insufficient focus on policy-making and/or development of concept papers, prior to the
         legal development process and actual drafting of laws.
         The RA Mining Code establishes a regime for the allocation of mineral rights. Exploration rights are
         awarded on a first-come-first-served basis, while the security of tenure and entitlement of mining
         rights is less clear. The RA Mining Code applies to all types of hard minerals and rocks, as well as min-
         eral water. All types of mining are regulated in the same way, apart for that landowners are entitled
         to quarry non-metallic minerals on their own land for their own use. The Armenian Mining Code does
         not provide for any type of ineligibility cases, and essentially any legal person can apply for a mineral
         right (although the financial and technical capacity and means of any applicant needs to be approved,
         and if a mining permit held by a legal person has been terminated, a new mining permit will not be
         granted to such a person).
         The RA Mining Code places strong focus on the role of the State in developing ‘State programmes’
         (policy type documents with limited scope), in mineral sector regulation, and in preparing a State
         inventory of mineral reserves. The State does, however, not have a role as an entrepreneur, neither in
         legislation nor in practice. Overall, the Code has similarities with the sub-soil laws of many other transi-
         tion countries, for example as it encourages increased knowledge of minerals reserves and focuses on
         the setting of rules for enterprises to carry out the production of minerals from identified ore deposits.
         Land relations for mining are subject to provisions of the RA Land Code and the RA Civil Code. Land
         belongs to either the State, communities or is private property. The law provides for a clear process to
         assign and access land for mining with negotiations between companies and landowners, and govern-
         mental decisions around expropriation and compensation in cases of mining projects of paramount
         public interest. The process however lacks modern concepts to protect landowners and land users
         rights in relation to compensation and resettlement.
         Environmental and social regulation of the mineral sector is primarily based on the RA Law on Environ-
         mental Impact Assessment and Expert Examination, 2014 and the RA Mining Code, 2012. The former
         is sophisticated and includes most modern concepts to anticipate, prevent and mitigate negative im-
         pacts on the environment and humans, during the life of the mine and including mine closure. There
         is, however, a general lack of secondary legislation and/or guidelines to aid implementation of the law
         (which is partly due to the fact that the EIA Law itself was enacted recently).
         Mine waste management is regulated through the RA Mining Code and the RA Law on Waste (most re-
         cently amended in 2015) while none of these include provisions that are sufficient for adequate man-
         agement and control. There are, for example, a lack of clarity in respect of how to determine whether
         a mining waste is hazardous or not. According to the RA Mining Code, non-operational tailings dams
         with a proven mineral reserve are classified as “man-made mines” rather than mine waste. These de-
x                                                                Armenia: Strategic Mineral Sector Sustainability Assessment



     posits are the exclusive property of RA and may be granted for extraction of minerals.
     The right for the public to participate in environmental decision making and to access data is protect-
     ed in a number of ways by the RA Constitution, the Law of the Republic of Armenia on Freedom of
     Information, the RA EIA law, and the Aarhus Convention ratified by Armenia in 2001. Notwithstanding
     legal guarantees to ensure access to information, the implementation of the law providing for public
     participation and data access faces many obstacles in practice resulting in, for example, that data and
     information are released late or not at all by authorities.
     The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MENR) is responsible for essentially all aspects of min-
     eral sector administration and regulation, and mineral sector policy development. Key departments
     and tasks include: Mining Department – policy and legal development; Mining Granting Agency –
     managing and administrating the mineral permit applications; Mineral Resources Agency – reviewing
     and approval of mineral reserves estimations, required for mining permit applications; State Mining
     Inspectorate – mine inspections against contractual obligation, with focus on production rates and
     reserves; Republican Geological Fund – repository for geological data and information, company re-
     ports, exploration and mining contracts, and reserves data (from which national balance sheets are
     established). There is no institution holding geological survey type functions and it is questionable how
     efficiently the strong focus and significant human resources directed towards reserves verifications
     and inspections help to develop a sustainable mineral sector.
     Within the Ministry for Nature Protection, relevant institutions include: the Environmental Impact
     Expertise Centre - performs expert examination of EIA submitted with exploration and mining applica-
     tions; the State Environmental Inspectorate – controls the environmental performance of all industry,
     and; the Environmental Impact Monitoring Centre - regularly samples water, air and sediment across
     Armenia to assess the state of the environment. Overall, a key issue at the MNP seem to be insufficient
     human and technical capacity. Thus, the implementation of the new EIA Law is likely to be challenging.
     Finally, the Ministry of Emergency Situations (MES) is responsible for the safety expert examination of
     mining permit applications and, as such, they have an important role in assessing the technical and
     safety aspects of tailings dams. It appears, however, as if the required knowledge level with regards to
     tailings dam construction and management does not exist.
     Since 2012 (with the new mining code), the Mining Granting Agency (ref above) functions as what is
     commonly referred to as a “one-stop-shop”, and environmental, reserves and safety expert examina-
     tions are performed by different authorities. Interviewed officers at the MENR commonly perceive
     what they regard as a high number of public hearings to be time consuming and negating an efficient
     process. On the other hand, officers at the MNP perceive the “one-stop-shop” to prevent direct and
     meaningful interaction with the applicants.
     Armenia has committed to implementing the EITI standard, and a candidature application is being
     prepared. From this follows that it is the Government’s strategy to move towards accountability and
     transparency with regards to tax payments, and information on permits, contracts, and production,
     etc. and towards multi stakeholder participation in driving this strategy forward.

Sustainability assessment
     A sustainable minerals sector is one which is in line with all three aspects of sustainability (environ-
     ment, social and economic). Environmental impacts should be well managed, and operations should
     not represent a significant risk to surrounding communities and/or land uses in terms of accidental
     spills or geotechnical failures of waste facilities. In terms of social issues, the operations should enjoy
     overall support by the local populations (a “social license”). Further, the economic performance should
     be strong and reliable to ensure operational continuity, and the economic benefits accrued should be
     equitably shared.

         The Armenian mining sector is an important contributor to the national economy (as a source for ex-
         port incomes, foreign direct investments, and for creating relatively high paid work opportunities out-
         side of urban centres), and it is further shown that it is better at providing tax related incomes to the
         state compared to most other sectors. However, the sector is in terms of production and value created
         dominated by the ZCMC. There are a small number of mines that may be referred to as medium scale,
         and numerous operations in both the metals and non-metals sector which are all small, and rather
         insignificant in terms of their contributions to national welfare. The fact that the Armenian minerals
         sector is dominated by one single operation, makes it vulnerable to possible external chocks and this
         threatens the longer term sustainability of the sector.




 Views of ZCMC’s Kajaran mine and Artsvanik tailings deposit in Syunik, southern Armenia.
         Economic data from the last 5 years made available by the MoF suggest that only two, or three, of the
         existing metal mining operations have been making regular and stable profits (including the dominant
         operator, ZCMC). The less profitable (or loss making) companies include most of the small companies
         that hold mining licenses. Mining operations that commonly make losses, cannot be seen to be sus-
         tainable from an economic point of view. This finding is made even more significant in the light that
         the last 7-8 years represent a period of historically high commodity prices. Further, this poor economic
         performance has been happening at the same time as inadequate resources have been invested in
         pollution prevention, and environmental management (see below).
         The current mining and exploration related activities are to a dominant extent based upon the work
         performed during Soviet times. There has been little in terms of exploration and new finds in the last
         few decades. There has been a lengthy period with no geological research and prospecting activities
         which, in turn, can lead to their eventually being insufficient known resources and reserves to sustain
         the sector. This in itself threatens the economic sustainability of the sector, but also, given the relative
         importance of the sector, the Armenian economy as a whole.
         Forming linkages with other sectors of the local economy is a way of enhancing economic performance
         and sustainability. Although linkages and “local content” exist in Armenia, there could be considerable
         scope for increasing the participation of local and Armenian businesses within the wider mining sector.
         Importantly, the roles that may be assumed by local entrepreneurs can also include more knowledge
         based services, such as technical consulting, and services related to geological exploration.
         None of the existing metal mining operations can be seen to be environmentally sustainable. The main
         problems relate to:
             a.	 The small metal mining companies that are involved in poorly managed “mining/exploration proj-
                 ects”, that were discovered during Soviet times, are creating substantial damage to the environment;
             b.	 there is significant ongoing pollution emanating from existing mines and processing activities, both
                 to air and water;
             c.	 there is an overall lack of adequate plans and funds to enable reclamation and rehabilitation of mine
xii                                                                 Armenia: Strategic Mineral Sector Sustainability Assessment



             sites, and associated waste facilities. What exist in the “Nature and protection and reclamation fund”
             is inadequate for its purpose, and in cases when the operations have had a history of being state
             owned (before privatisation) there has been no formal division of liability between the state and the
             new owner;
         d.	 given the high seismic risk, and overall high risk for land instability, there exist excessive risks for
             waste facility collapses and/or accidents, caused by the inappropriate method of construction (the
             use of “up-stream raise” designs) that is used for tailings impoundment construction;
         e.	 in the non-metal and metal sector alike, mined out areas are commonly left without any significant
             efforts made for rehabilitation and reclamation.
      Environmental laws and regulations that could potentially address most of the above problems exist.
      However, these laws are not properly implemented, and there are also significant problems related to
      legal ambiguity and of laws not being streamlined. There are also concerns that the fines and conse-
      quences for not being in compliance with existing environmental laws are too low and not constituting a
      sufficient deterrent. Further, among many companies, especially the smaller ones, there may be a lack of
      knowledge of laws, as well as a poor understanding of what is required in order to be compliant with laws.
      The existence of a large number of no-longer mined, or no longer used mines and waste facilities rep-
      resent a significant environmental liability. There may exist opportunities for economic re-mining/re-
      processing of some of these sites although experience from other countries suggest that the bulk of
      the liabilities will need to be addressed by government through rehabilitation and mitigating measures.
      Mining operations are providing employment and livelihoods, and they do so in many areas where oth-
      er economic opportunities are scarce. Further, in some mining communities, support for operations
      appears to be relatively strong. At the same time, one cannot say that there exist a widespread “social
      license to operate” for miners in Armenia. The lack of widespread support for mining in Armenia can,
      in turn, be seen to be rooted in real shortcomings on environmental and economic issues. Further, a
      prevailing culture of secrecy that is prevalent in the sector (on part of both companies and authorities),
      hinders both meaningful public participation as well as decision making based on true and factual in-
      formation. Initiatives to make data publicly available for public scrutiny are therefore needed.
      Although there exist a substantial number of qualified mine workers in Armenia, there appears to be a
      lack of more advanced skills. The lack of local management capacity is representing a constraint to the
      social sustainability of the operations. Similarly, women are severely underrepresented in the sector.
      This does not only represent a waste of skills and abilities, but also undoubtedly contributes to less
      well balanced and less well functioning work places, and mine communities.
      In summary, none of the existing metal mining operators in Armenia are in line with all three com-
      ponents of sustainability, and available evidence suggest that the same is likely to be the case for the
      majority of the non-metal mining operations. Further, there are examples of operations that appear
      unviable in terms of all three components of sustainability, and this is appears to be especially prevalent
      among the smaller operators in the metal mining sector. The reasons for the shortcomings are found in
      a mixture of failings, including companies’ irresponsible behaviour, as well as failures by the institutions
      that are charged with supervising and controlling these activities. Some failings in the regulatory frame-
      work are also of importance as a reason for some specific failings, although the overall conclusion in this
      regard is that the main problems relate to a failure of implementation of existing laws.
      It is suggested a significant part of the overall controversy that surrounds mineral related projects in
      Armenia is caused by a lack of knowledge and data, and also a limited knowledge of best practices and
      technology used in modern mining operations. With regards to the former, the ongoing work in pre-
      paring an EITI candidature application, and the work that is entailed in the subsequent implementation
      of the EITI standard will contribute substantially to establishing a better understanding of the sector.
      With regards to technology, there may exist considerable opportunity to introduce more modern, saf-
      er and environmentally more friendly technologies in the sector. A further consideration in this regards
      relate to the suitability of SME involvement in the mining sector. Whereas the exploration field and
Armenia: Strategic Mineral Sector Sustainability Assessment                                                     xiii



         possibly also some forms of quarrying and dimension stone extraction constitutes suitable areas for
         SME involvement and development, actual metal mining and processing may be one of the least suit-
         able sectors for such SME participation. This follows as such activities, if they are to be done properly,
         require longer term management and stewardship, as well as access to considerable resources and
         funds to operate a mine, also in times of lower commodity prices or after accidents and/or mishaps.

Recommendations
         The report shows that whereas mining is important to the Armenian economy, individual operations
         are not generally contributing sufficiently to the longer term sustainable development of the nation.
         This is in spite of a range of past and ongoing initiatives taken by the regulators to reform the sector.
         These initiatives have, however, been taken without reference to a policy or longer term strategy.
         The worlds commodity markets are presently depressed, with generally low prices and low demand.
         However, the mining sector is cyclical and sooner or later, there will be an upswing in the market, and
         new investment will follow. Thus, the present is a fortuitous time for mining policy development, to en-
         sure that when the next wave of development and investments arrives, Armenia will be well prepared
         to manage the various challenges and opportunities that such times entail.
         Thus, this report’s main recommendation is to urgently embark on a process of developing a national
         mining policy. Such a process will take at least one year to complete, and it is strongly recommended
         that the process for developing said policy is coupled with the efforts made in making Armenia an EITI
         compliant country. The main point of having such a policy is that it helps in ensuring that development
         and regulation of the sector holds together, and contributes to the achievement of an overall vision
         for national development. Furthermore, the process of developing a policy is important in itself as
         it provides an opportunity to build consensus and a shared understanding of issues among affected
         stakeholders. Whilst the process of policy development is ongoing, it is recommended that non-urgent
         reforms and legislative developments in the mining sector are put on hold. However, there are some
         priority actions and initiatives that are needed irrespective of the outcomes of policy development,
         and recommendations for these are therefore provided (further below).
         The development of the mining policy should be based on a vision of what the future minerals sector
         should look like. The broad vision could include that the sector should contribute to sustainable and
         equitable economic development; that benefits should be shared at the national level, whilst ensuring
         that communities that are directly impacted by minerals related projects are not adversely affected
         economically or socially, and not either exposed to excessive risks related to possible emergencies
         or accidents. In establishing the vision, it would be helpful to paint a rather concrete picture of what
         the sector could look like. For example, based on the findings and recommendations of this report it
         is suggested that the future situation should be one where there are fewer mines and quarries but
         that these have considerably larger production than today. Further, the operations should be more
         mechanised and modern and performing in an environmentally responsible way, and with adequate
         concerns for health and safety of their workers. In addition, there should exist a number of advanced
         exploration projects, in turn based on the outcomes from an active and innovative exploration sector.
         The sector as a whole should be supported by linkages to local businesses, consultancy companies and
         all of these should to a dominant degree hire well qualified Armenian staff that have had the opportu-
         nity to receive high quality training both locally and internationally.
         Questions that may be addressed in the policy development process include which type of mines can
         meaningfully contribute to sustainable development goals; what economic development related to
         mining shall be promoted; what shall be the roles and responsibilities of the state and the compa-
         nies and their owners. These types of questions be addresses through formulating policy statements,
         which together contribute to achieving the overall vision.
         The development of the policy will, in a similar way to the EITI process, provide an opportunity for
         broader cooperation/interaction between institutions, as well as among civil society and private com-
xiv                                                                  Armenia: Strategic Mineral Sector Sustainability Assessment



      panies. Thus, it is suggested that he process for policy development be coupled to the EITI process, and
      also that it is managed in a similar way. Thus, it is suggested that there could be an implementing group,
      chaired by the Ministry of Finance (or PM), and including the sector ministries and authorities that are
      most concerned (MoENR, MoE, MES). The consultative process should include CSOs, private compa-
      nies, local community representatives from mining districts, as well as central and regional authorities.
      The implementation of the policy should include a number of diagnostic studies, that will fill the knowl-
      edge gaps that exist, and thus ensuring that policy implementation is done whilst having a true and
      reliable understanding of the current situation (the baseline). The diagnostic studies, will also serve to
      identify the means and measures (technical, financial, human resources) necessary for achieving the
      policy. The following diagnostic studies are recommended, most of which may to an extent build upon
      the findings of this present report: (i) Sectoral Environmental and Social Assessment, including practical
      proposals for how any negative issues identified can be addressed, and positive development oppor-
      tunities facilitated, and including considerations for how the environmental liability in operations that
      have previously been state owned should be apportioned. (ii) Geotechnical risk assessment, where the
      risks represented by existing geotechnical structures and methods for design used in Armenia are iden-
      tified and where proposals for regulatory changes to reduce any identified and excessive risks is pro-
      vided; (iii) Economic assessment, where different types of mining projects’ economic viability, including
      those championed by SMEs, are considered, as well as their respective contribution to local, regional
      and national economies; (iv) Technology Assessment, were the technology used at various mining proj-
      ects in Armenia is assessed, and areas were increased mechanisation and/or better management may
      be required are identified; a (v) Health and Safety review, which identifies possible needs and require-
      ments in this regard; and (vi) an Institutional review, where the relevance and effectiveness of current
      institutional tasks and practises are assessed in the light of the common goal of achieving sustainable
      minerals sector development, and recommendations for improvements are provided.
      Recommendations are provided for initiatives which are needed irrespective of the outcome of the
      minerals policy development process. Some of these are concerned with issues that to varying degrees
      are to be addressed by the EITI process which in turn, means that one overall and strong recommen-
      dation is that the ongoing work towards achieving EITI candidate status be continued. The remainder
      of the actions are classified as being: urgent, and in need to be initiated immediately; actions needed
      in the medium (initiated within 24 months); and longer term actions (> 24 months):
      Actions that to varying extent are related to the requirements of the EITI process include to: increase public
      awareness; publish mining and exploration license data; provision of descriptive information on how the sec-
      tor is regulated and managed; collect and make available existing data on the mining sector; and assessment
      of the economic viability of mining projects, and the benefit streams that flow from the sector.
      Immediate actions are proposed to address issues that are either representing urgent risk to people and/
      or the environment, and to issues that are constraining positive developments in the mining sector. These
      include: addressing urgent security risks at both former and present mining operations; development of
      guidelines for the safe design of mine waste facilities; coordinate donors and existing mining sector devel-
      opment related initiatives.
      In the medium term, initiatives that are deemed necessary include: collect and make available geological
      and environmental monitoring data; make a detailed inventory and risk assessment of polluted and or
      abandoned mine sites; encourage private sector led initiatives that help ensure that projects contribute
      to sustainable development (i.e. CSR related activities, as well as the formation of a company organisation
      such as a Chamber of Mines & Minerals that can champion efforts to improve business ethics and be-
      haviours); development of a computerised mining cadastre; and the review and update of mineral related
      legislation, in line with the new mineral policy.
      In the slightly longer term, initiatives that will underpin the further development of the sector are pro-
      posed. These include: efforts to attract responsible, and financially strong investors; address capacity build-
      ing needs at the minerals related public institutions; and to strengthen public awareness and thereby possi-
      ble participation in mining sector decision-making, specifically in areas where mining activities are already
      ongoing.

1.	Introduction
         This report provides a review of the Armenian mining sector, and assesses its potential to contribute
         to sustainable economic growth and development. It further provides recommendations for the initia-
         tives and actions that will be required for such development to take place, and considers the risk and
         opportunities that this may entail.
         The report was produced in the period October 2015 to February 2016. It was commissioned by the
         World Bank with the aim to assist the Armenian government to gain a better understanding of key
         social and environmental challenges and future opportunities for the Armenian Mining Sector, looking
         both at the legacy of previous mining operations, current mining, and potential new projects in order
         to inform and support the development of a strategy that adheres to international good practices and
         contributes to sustainable development.
         The findings of this report are based on desktop reviews of existing documents, on a large number of
         meetings and interviews with affected and interested stakeholders, and on field work performed in the
         southern, central and northern parts of the country. There have also been three thematic workshops
         (two in Yerevan, and one in Kapan), and one final stakeholder workshop (in Yerevan) where the find-
         ings of the work were presented, and where a large body of feedback was received from participants.
         Comments, suggestions and corrections on a draft version of this report has been provided by repre-
         sentatives of the GoA, and the World Bank. Further, oversight and feedback was continuously provided
         by representatives of the World Bank.


1.1.	        Introduction to mining sector development
         Mining is a primary industry which we cannot completely do without. While technologies for recycling
         are increasingly improving, the need for new mining will in all likelihood increase over the next few de-
         cades. The mining sector, globally, may be divided into three main subsectors: coal mining; metals and
         precious minerals mining; and the quarrying for industrial minerals, aggregates and dimension stone.
         In Armenia, coal mining is not of significant importance, whereas underground water (fresh and min-
         eralised) forms an additional mining subsector, which is partly regulated under the RA Mining Code.
         Aggregates mining (mainly quarrying for gravel and sand) is vital for the functioning of any society,
         but the sector’s economic value is usually small. Industrial minerals (limestone, clay, potash etc.) and
         dimension stone mining is similarly vital for society but as the value to bulk ratio of the products is
         small, the potential for export and import is generally limited, and the sector’s economic importance
         is also comparatively small. With regards to aggregates, dimension stone and industrial minerals, these
         types of deposits are not generally rare, and the technology needed for finding and exploiting them
         is straight forward. This in turn means that most countries have developed this sector domestically.
         The metals and precious minerals mining sector produces low bulk, high value products. Although
         access to such commodities is necessary for all countries’ economies to function, it is not necessary
         for all individual countries to have such an industry, as these commodities are readily traded in the
         world market. Further, the possibility of developing such mining domestically relies primarily on the
         existence of prospective geology, on the access to relatively advanced technology both for prospect-
         ing and exploitation, as well as the availability of substantial financial resources. Given that metals
         and precious minerals have high value and that they can bring considerable export incomes, most
         countries that do have prospective geology choose to utilise this advantage to build up a metals and
         precious minerals mining sector. Ideally, this is done in a way so that it links with other sectors of the
         economy, and is used as a way for fostering wider societal gains and economic development.
         The development of a modern metals and precious minerals project, from early exploration to the
2                                                                    Armenia: Strategic Mineral Sector Sustainability Assessment



          start of industrial-scale production usually takes 10-15 years or more (Table 1.1). This time is needed
          to carry out detailed resource estimates, to do the various metallurgical, geotechnical, financial and
          environmental studies necessary for a bankable feasibility study, and to arrange financing and mineral
          and environmental permitting. The management of the sector needs to be characterised by a similarly
          long-term view. Further, post-production, mine closure and rehabilitation usually takes a couple of
          years or more, and this is sometimes followed by a prolonged period of environmental monitoring,
          depending on the type of mine.
          Few exploration projects actually lead to mine development. For example, looking at major metals,
          over a recent 2-year period, 26 out of 710 (3.7%) greenfield discoveries in Canada reached feasibility
          stage1. For Australia, the numbers were 32 out of 570, or 5.6%. Far fewer projects would survive all the
          way to the mine construction stage.

          Modern mining is being conducted at increasingly larger scales. The driving factors behind this devel-
          opment include that: operations are becoming increasingly mechanised and efficient, which means
          that lower grade and larger deposits may be mined; and that more stringent environmental (and so-
          cial) requirements make it more difficult for small operators to achieve the level of performance that
          is required. This development is true both for metal and precious minerals mining, as well as for in-
          dustrial minerals mining. In Sweden, for example, the last century has seen a dramatic decrease in
          the number of metal mines in operation, at the same time as ore production has increased more than
          tenfold (Figure 1.1).

Figure 1.1. Illustration of how (metal) mining operations in Sweden over the last century have become fewer
in numbers, but much larger in terms of the production of each mine. This development has been caused by
increased mechanisation, efficiency and by more stringent regulatory requirements.

         The needs and requirements for establishing a mine are dependent upon which commodity is being
         considered. High bulk commodities such as iron ore and coal are crucially dependent upon the avail-
         ability of infrastructure for transport (railroads, harbours), and other supporting industries and activ-
         ities (often referred to as “linkages”). Conversely, mines for low bulk commodities (e.g. gold) may be
         initiated with a comparatively lesser need for associated linkages and infrastructure.
         Mining is a cyclical business, with commodity prices varying in what is sometimes referred to as “super
         cycles”, which in turn may span over one or several decades. Thus, the decade preceding 2005 (and the
         rise of demand from China) was characterised by low commodity prices, and limited exploration. In
         contrast, the period 2005 -2011 represented a boom in the mining sector, fuelled to a great extent by
         Chinese demand. The years since 2011 has seen a slowing down and decreases in commodity prices,
         and at present we are in a period of comparatively lower investor interest in the minerals sector. The
         management of the sector needs to take these fundamental characteristics into account.
         The mining sector holds substantial prospects for fostering development and economic growth. The
         sector is, however, also seen to be associated with a number of less desirable characteristics such as
         environmental impacts, socio-economic unrest, land-use conflict, financial instability, and due to the
         large amounts of money involved, to be prone to corruption and illicit financial transactions. Measures
         are needed to address these problem areas, such as the development of a suitable regulatory regime
         as well as the building of institutional capacity to implement such a regime.

1.2.	      The Armenian geopolitical setting and political overview
        Armenia is a small country, situated in a region which is both geopolitically complex and volatile. As a
        direct consequence, Armenia’s development is heavily dependent on events that take place in neigh-
        bouring countries, as well as in the region. Since its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991,
        Armenia has maintained strong economic and political relations with Russia, and Armenia is since
        2015 a member of the Eurasian Economic Union. Armenia’s relations with its western and eastern
        neighbours have been less stable. The conflict in Nagorno Karabakh remains unresolved. Armenia has
        no political relations with Turkey. Further, although relations with Iran are cordial, the fact that Iran has
        until recently been under economic sanctions, mean that trade and contacts southwards have been
        constrained. This, in turn, means that the major land based route for trade in and out of Armenia runs
        through Georgia in the north.

         Since independence, the Republic of Armenia has been governed by a Constitution that was approved
         by referendum in 1995 (with amendments in 2005 and reform in 2015). The legislative branch of gov-
         ernment is the National Assembly, whereas the executive branch of government is headed by a Prime
         Minister, appointed by an independently elected President. The President is elected every five years
         and can serve no more than two consecutive terms.
         The highest court of the judicial branch of government is the Constitutional Court, which has the au-
         thority to decide on whether acts of the President, National Assembly, or the Government are in com-
         pliance with the Constitution. The nine members of the Court are appointed by the National Assembly
         (5) and the President (4).
         The party with a current majority in the National Assembly is the Republican Party, a national-conser-
         vative party. The current President, Serzh Sargsyan, is also leader of the Republican Party.
         Armenia is divided into ten Marzes (provinces), plus the City of Yerevan, the nation capital, which is
         an independent jurisdiction. The Marzpets (Marz Governors) implement the national government’s
         regional policy, and coordinate the activities of local branches of the executive authority.


             BOX: How free is Armenia?

             Freedom House, an international NGO, currently rates Armenia at 4.5 on its seven-point
             scale that combines political rights (electoral process, political participation, and func-
             tioning of government) and civil liberties (freedom of expression, associational rights,
             rule of law, personal autonomy), where 1 means most free and 7 signifies least free
             (Freedom of the World, 2016). Compared to other countries in the region, Armenia is
             freer than Azerbaijan (6.5), Russia (6), and Iran (6) but less free than Georgia (3) and
             Turkey (3.5).

2.	        Geology, mining and exploration activities

2.1.	      Regional geology and metallogeny
        The geology of the Caucasus region is a result of geologically recent events related to the convergence
        and collision of the Africa-Arabian continental plate (to the south) and the Eurasian plate (to the north)
        in late Cenozoic times. Thus, the area is still tectonically active with a common occurrence of earth-
        quakes, and volcanic activity occurred as recently as in the Holocene epoch of the Quaternary period
        (<11.7 thousand years ago).
        Armenia lies almost entirely within the Lesser Caucasus, the southern part of the Caucasus region, and
        the geology of Armenia (Figure 2.1) extends into Georgia, Azerbaijan and northern Iran. This follows
        from the direction of the collision between the Africa-Arabian and Eurasian plates (roughly SW-NE),
        which resulted in general NW-SE structural trends throughout the Caucasus.
        Following from its setting in a continental margin, with abundant volcanism (and associated geological
        processes at depth), and the addition of exotic geological terrains to the Eurasian continental margin,
        Armenia has a diverse and prospective geology from a mineralization point of view. Given by the geo-
        logical setting and information on historical mining, Armenia is mostly prospective for copper and gold.
        Molybdenum associated with the copper, and silver associated with gold, as well as additional base
        metals such as zinc and lead, may locally be of additional interest.
        For metallic minerals, the areas with Jurassic to Paleogene geology, intersected by granitoids (Figure
        2.1) are the most prospective. Within these areas, the best deposits discovered and mined so far are
        confined primarily to three regions, including: (i) the Alaverdi region in the north with mainly poly-
        metallic (e.g. Akhtala) and copper (e.g. Alaverdi and Shamlug) VMS type deposits as well as porphyry
        copper deposits (e.g. Teghut); (ii) the Kapan area in the southeast, which has a geology similar to that
        of the Alaverdi area, thus also hosting copper (e.g. Kapan-Central) and polymetallic (e.g. Shahumyan)
        VMS deposits. This type of geology can be traced from Georgia through north-eastern Armenia to the
        Kapan area, and into Iran; (iii) the area of the Zangezur mountain range in the southwest, stretching
        from Meghri for some 50km to the NNW, where a number of copper and copper-molybdenum depos-
        its are located (e.g. Kajaran and Agarak).
        Gold is sometimes found in the abovementioned type of polymetallic deposits. Furthermore, the Amu-
        lsar and other gold projects in Vyots Dzor, the Sotk gold mine east of southern Lake Sevan, and a num-
        ber of gold deposits west of northern Lake Sevan (see Section 2.3) shows that other parts of Armenia
        are prospective for gold.
        Outside Armenia, on the extension of the lesser Caucasus some 25-30km southeast of Armenia in Iran,
        is the Sungun Cu-Mo mine. Sungun has reserves of at least 700Mt at copper grades of 0.6-0.7% (Osan-
        loo and Ataei, 1998; Etminan, 2012), which makes it one of the largest and highest grade porphyry
        copper deposits in the world. Together with the Kajaran deposit, it clearly demonstrates the porphyry
        copper potential of the Zangezur mountain range. There are no other large mines in the area of the
        Lesser Caucasus around Armenia while the small-medium scale Madneuli Cu-Au mine in southern
        Georgia is similar in style and scale to some of the deposits in the Alaverdi area.

          Figure 2.1. Geological map of Armenia


         In “mining countries” globally, deposits that are relatively easy to find, such as large outcropping de-
         posits, have to a large extent already been discovered. Even in a country that has a geological setting
         prospective for metals, such as Armenia, finding additional economic deposits requires high quality
         and long-term exploration work. Bearing in mind that there has been little recent high-quality geo-
         logical exploration undertaken in Armenia, that Soviet-era exploration used what is now outdated
         techniques and was focussed mainly on finding large-scale deposits, and that much of the prospective
         geology is “hidden” under Miocene-Quaternary cover (Figure 2.1), Armenia may still be prospective, in
         particular for copper and gold. The Amulsar project, which plans for the production of reasonably large
         amounts of gold (about 200,000 oz/yr for 10 yrs, see below), lends support to this view.
         The geological structures and rock compositions of Armenia allows for quarrying and production of a
         variety of dimension stone (mainly tuff, gabbroids, basalt/andesite and marble) and aggregates (sand,
         gravel, and crushed rock) to fulfil the domestic demand. In particular, some tuff varieties are also of
8                                                                  Armenia: Strategic Mineral Sector Sustainability Assessment



        quality amenable for export. Concerning other non-metallic minerals, Armenia has deposits with qual-
        ity grades of perlite, bentonite, diatomite and zeolites. There are also some deposits with semi-pre-
        cious stones, such as agate and jasper.


2.2.	      Geological data and information
        In Armenia, there is no public organization performing geological surveys and there has not been any
        regional (or more detailed) geological mapping, mineral exploration work, or assessment of mineral
        deposits undertaken by the State since the onset of the privatization of the minerals sector in the mid-
        1990’s. Thus, while there are some more recent geological maps published (e.g. 1:500,000 national
        geological map from 2005), these are based on mapping work performed in the past.
        Rather extensive exploration work was undertaken during Soviet times. The results are presented in
        around 1,488 extensive reports on mineral deposits, which include appendices with narrative descrip-
        tions and figures. The reports are housed at the Republican Geological Fund, SNCO and they constitute
        a wealth of information that should be of interest for new exploration initiatives.


2.3.	      Mining and mine prospects in Armenia
        Metal mining
        Metal mining has a long history in Armenia and copper mining began in the Alaverdi area in northern
        Armenia in the 1770s. In the 1840s, copper mining started in Kapan, and in the middle of the 20th
        century the larger Kajaran copper-molybdenum mine started production. Over the last fifty years, ad-
        ditional smaller mines have opened, some of which are operational today (e.g. the Agarak copper-mo-
        lybdenum mine and the Shahumyan polymetallic mine). Despite the long history of mining, a sizeable
        and diverse mining sector has never developed but the sector is today characterized by a number of
        small to medium sized projects, many of which appear not to be economically viable, and there is only
        one large and stably operating mine, namely, Kajaran (Table 2.1).
        Thus, there are 27 granted rights for metal mining (Table 2.1; Figure 2.2), 14 of which are for mines
        in operation and 13 for projects that are still at the exploration stage. Of the 14 operational mines, 8
        have been running at an amalgamated loss over the period 2010-2014 (table 2.1; yellow high-light),
        and most of these have been making a loss each individual year (see further Chapter 6 for an eco-
        nomic assessment of the industry). In general, loss-making mining projects do often not operate on a
        continuous basis, and a couple of small mines were also seen not to be operating when visited within
        this project.
        Overall, copper and gold are the principal metals produced in Armenia. Contrary to common belief,
        the contribution from molybdenum to the metal mining turnover is insignificant (less than 1% of the
        mined value). Zinc, lead and silver are also of little importance to the overall output, while they are
        locally important, most notably at Shahumyan.
        The Kajaran copper-molybdenum mine produces some 18.5Mt of ore per year (as compared to the
        permitted 12.5 Mt/yr, table 2.1) at grades of 0.25% Cu and 0.03% Mo. Kajaran’s production makes up
        60% of the turnover of the Armenian mining sector. According to information from MENR, approved
        ore reservesamount to 2,244Mt and it is estimated the mine could operate for another 100-120 years.

         Another porphyry copper mine that could become a significant producer is Vallex Group’s Teghut mine
         in Lori province, which commenced operation in the end of 2014. According to the company’s homep-
         age (accessed on 7 January 2016), the ore reserves amount to more than 454Mt at grades of 0.36% Cu
         and 0.02% Mo. The processing plant is designed for a capacity of 7Mt/yr. Thus, subject to the efficiency
         of the processing plants, the copper production could theoretically be about half that of Kajaran.
         With regards to gold, the Sotk mine is the main producer, and gold is also of major importance at
         Dundee Precious Metals Shahumyan mine. Reported gold grades at several smaller mines are often
         high to extremely high, which apparently makes some small deposits economic (Table 2.1; Mghart,
         Meghradzor, and Meghradzor – Lusajur). However, the reserves tonnages at these mines are so small
         that they would be expected to have a very short mine life.




 Figure 2.2. Metal mining projects in Armenia.

         In contrast to the many high grade / low tonnage gold projects, Lydian International’s (Geoteam CJSC in
         Table 2.1) Amulsar project is a low grade / large volume deposit. The project has completed a feasibil-
         ity study and secured most of the financing estimated to be needed for mine construction. According
         to the company’s homepage (accessed on 7 January 2016) proven reserves (at 0.20 g/t Au cut-off)
         amount to some 67Mt at grades of 0.79 g/t Au and 3,68 g/t silver. Lydian plan for a gold production
         of 200,000 oz/yr (5,700 kg/yr) for a mine life of 10 years. The value of the yearly production over the
         10 years of operation, at current metal prices, would be on par with the value of the production at
         Kajaran, i.e. 200 million USD.

        Tuff is mainly quarried in western Armenia in Aragatsotn, Armavir and Shirak (Figure 2.3a). There is a
        variety of tuff and some qualities are amenable for export. In the past, tuff sourced from Armenia was
        used widely as a dimension stone across the Soviet Union. Today, the geopolitical setting of Armenia
        makes export difficult, while some companies apparently export smaller amounts of dimension stone.
        Quarrying of other types of dimension stone are also to a large confined to specific areas where quality
        grades occur (cf. Figure 2.3a).
        Aggregate quarrying is strongly focussed to the central parts of the country, which is also the primary
        area of development and urbanization. Thus, most of the sand and gravel quarries are located in the
        Ararat and Armavir regions in the west, while a number of quarries are also found in the northern
        parts of the country (Figure 2.3b). Basalt and andesite, pumice, and volcanic slag quarrying is strongly
        concentrated to the area around Yerevan (Figure 2.3b).



    2	 Aggregates refer to coarse particulate material used in construction, commonly including sand, gravel and crushed
stone. In Armenia, basalt, andesite and dolerite often crushed and used as aggregate while it is also used as ornamental and
dimension stone.

     Despite the relatively large number of quarries, the total production of dimension stone and aggre-
     gates in Armenia is small in relation to the size of the country (Figure 2.4). This means that each oper-
     ation is small and/or that production methods are inefficient. To judge from field visits and interviews
     with governmental institutions, the former appears to be largely true. This type of sector with several
     hundred small, and to a large extent poorly run mines, would be challenging to regulate and supervise
     efficiently.




     Figure 2.4. Aggregates and dimension stone production in relation to country size
     and country population. Population densities of the countries range from about
     80-140, left to right. Data sources: MENR (www.minenergy.am); European Commis-
     sion – Eurostat (ec.europa.eu/Eurostat); Minerals UK (www.bgs.ac.uk/mineralsuk/
     statistics).


     The production of other types of industrial minerals in Armenia is also overall small and limited to a
     handful products (Table 2.3). In the past, very large amounts of perlite were produced (some 2,200,000
     tons in 1990), which made Armenia the largest producer among the FSU states and Armenia has also
     in more recent years (since independence) exported perlite to European and neighbouring markets. A
     major part of the perlite was, nevertheless, used as light-weight concrete aggregate while the quality is
     apparently such that other industrial use (e.g. filter powders, glass manufacturing, and heat insulation)
     could be developed. Today the production of perlite is much smaller but still some 2.2% of the world
     production.
     Bentonite and diatomite were also mined at much larger scales in the past while today their share of
     the world production is 0.9% and 0.1%, respectively. Considering past mining, and the fact that there
     seems to have been little development towards production of different qualities (in particular for high-
     end use), there appears to be scope for development of the industrial minerals sector.

2.4.	        Exploration activities
         There has been very little recent greenfield exploration undertaken by the private sector in Armenia,
         and current exploration efforts focus mostly on attempts to develop deposits known from historical
         exploration work.
         There are currently (as of December 2015) 44 permits for metals exploration (Figure 2.5). Most of
         these are for polymetallic +/- gold (19); gold (16), and; copper +/- molybdenum (7), and most are lo-
         cated in the north and south where most of the historical and current mines are also located (Figure
         2.5). There are, nevertheless, some permits in the central parts of Armenia, including one very large
         permit in the area of Lydian’s Amulsar gold project.
         Considering the fact that Armenia has prospective geology, the number of exploration permits is small.
         Furthermore, none of the exploration licenses are held (directly or indirectly) by well-known interna-
         tional mining companies, and there appears to be little international interest in investing into explora-
         tion in Armenia.
         The total area covered by exploration licenses (Figure 2.5) amounts to about 5% of Armenia’s land
         area, which is about twice that figure for Sweden (2.4%), while in some countries with more focussed
         efforts on developing the mineral sector, the exploration license coverage is substantially higher than
         5%. In this respect, Uganda constitutes an interesting example. Over the last 10 years, the Ugandan
         Government has implemented a number of projects aimed at enhancing geological knowledge and
         structuring legal and institutional frameworks. This has resulted in that a few hundred exploration
         licenses today cover some 30-40% of the country, while previously the exploration sector was essen-
         tially dormant.
          From discussions with key informants during this project, the majority of the exploration projects
         seem not to be at an advanced stage, and it is concluded that exploration in Armenia is neither ad-
         vanced nor very extensive geographically, and there is relatively little greenfield exploration being
         undertaken.
         Concerning non-metal minerals and semi-precious stones, there are 21 permits (as per December
         2015) including exploration for opalit, nepheline, diatomite, jasper, limestone, sand, gravel, basalt,
         tuff, sandstone, pumice, travertine, brecchia and clays.

2.5.	      Outlook for the future
        The large reserves at Kajaran would ensure the longer term operation, but this is subject to external
        and unpredictable risks, such as copper price fluctuations and environmental emergencies (e.g. signifi-
        cant failure of tailings dam); the latter which could halt operations for a significant period of time, and
        in a worst case even be too costly to remediate. With regards to metal price fluctuations, over the time
        period 2010-2014, the copper price decreased by 37%, which is likely to be the key reason for ZCMC’s
        decrease in profit by 45% over the same time period.
        While the Teghut copper (and molybdenum) mine, at the initially planned production rate, and the
        planned mining at Amulsar (gold) would together add a mineral value which could be about 1.5 times
        that of Kajaran’s current production, the opening of new mines is always associated with financial and
        technical risks, and it is in many cases only possible to verify that an operation is sustainable after a
        couple of years of mine commissioning. Thus, the longer term performance of the Teghut and Amulsar
        projects remains to be verified.
        Looking some 10-20 years ahead, assuming that the copper price fluctuates around the current value
        and possibly recovers somewhat, and if no other external factors risk materialize, Kajaran could still
Armenia: Strategic Mineral Sector Sustainability Assessment                                                        17



         contribute to the Armenian economy more or less as it does today. Teghut and Amulsar can potentially
         add significant mineral worth. Teghut’s reserves would ensure operation for several decades, but it
         is exposed to the same risks as Kajaran. Amulsar would, according the current plans, operate for 10
         years, after which the mine may or may not close depending on the definition of additional proven
         reserves.
         The possibility to open additional mines, optimally including a more diverse set of minerals, is consid-
         ered necessary for the sector to continue to be a main pillar of the economy in the longer term (+10
         years). The above hinges on the discovery of new high class deposits, which is considered possible
         based on the geological foundation, the historical mining, and the fact that extensive exploration using
         modern methods has not been undertaken in Armenia. However, the opening of new medium-large
         sized mines in the near-medium term future (within some 10 years) is at the same time considered
         unlikely due to the low intensity of quality exploration, and bearing in mind general hit rates and time
         lines for exploration work (cf. Section 1.1).
         Investors are drawn to a large extent by geological prospectivity, as exemplified by the large invest-
         ments being made in countries with what is regarded as unstable and/or comparatively less attractive
         mining regulatory regimes. The best marketing possible are “success stories” that in themselves attract
         interest, and draw investors to the country. Despite Kajaran and Sungun (in Iran) showing the potential
         for large porphyry copper deposits in the Lesser Caucasus, well known international investors have not
         shown interest. This is likely to in part be due to the fact that there is little regional geological data of
         high quality accessible.


2.6.	        Recommendations
         The Government’s aspiration in terms of an overall structure for the mining sector (including for exam-
         ple numbers, size and type of mines) needs to be set at a policy level as a base for the implementation
         of regulatory mechanisms to ensure sustainable development in the desired direction. It is proposed
         that the future situation should be one where there are fewer mines and quarries but that these have
         larger production than today. Furthermore, the operations should be well managed and operate in an
         economically sustainable way with due care for the environment and human health and safety.
         The collection of new geological data, and the subsequent marketing of these data assume vital im-
         portance to attract investment into exploration. The recommendations below are aimed at attracting
         investment into exploration.
             a.	 Collection of airborne geophysical data. This type of data is of fundamental importance to min-
                 eral exploration and the availability of this type of data is of very high interest to investors.
             b.	 Geological mapping at 1:50,000 scale. These types of maps do exist, but could be updated and
                 improved through the use of modern equipment and mapping techniques. In this regard, the
                 collection of airborne geophysical data is a prerequisite to quality geological mapping and more
                 detailed geological maps would facilitate exploration. This could be coupled with geochemical
                 surveys in selected regions.
             c.	 The implementation of an integrated geological data and information management system,
                 housed at the Republican Geological Fund, SNCO. Such a system, based on spatial data, would
                 facilitate the handling of data and information, and be a very useful tool for encouraging invest-
                 ments in exploration. Initially, the establishment of a policy defining data ownership, and rules
                 and ways for disseminating data would need to be considered.
         In parallel with the proposal above, MENR could consider to establish a promotion strategy for the Ar-
         menian mineral sector, in cooperation with the other relevant investment agencies. This may include
18                                                               Armenia: Strategic Mineral Sector Sustainability Assessment



     publishing in international trade journals and generating promotional material for wider circulation;
     planned presence at international mineral sector conferences and events; direct contact with targeted
     investors; production of monthly newsletters, etc. For a holistic strategy to take into account investors’
     positive perceptions, requirement/request for information, concerns etc., the formulation of the strat-
     egy would benefit from an initial survey of investors’ perception of Armenia as a mining destination.
     It would be important to include current investors, past investors that have withdrawn, and potential
     investors. The survey should also include different sized companies, i.e. juniors and majors.
     Concerning industrial minerals, it is recommended that a study is undertaken to establish specifica-
     tions for different qualities of industrial minerals such as perlite, bentonite, diatomite, etc. and to
     assess the market demands for different specifications. This study should also look mineral processing
     requirement as well as the possible development of new down-stream industry. The proposed study
     should build on a concept paper on the processing of non-metallic minerals developed by the State
     Mineral Agency in 2013, which was approved by the Government while it has not yet been given any
     further action.

3.	          Stakeholder review

3.1.	        Government (national/regional and local)
         On the national level the most relevant stakeholders are the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources
         and the Ministry of Nature Protection. Other ministries that are potentially important include: Minis-
         try of Agriculture, Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Territorial Administration and
         Development, Ministry of Emergency Situations, Ministry of Health, and Ministry of Labour and Social
         Affairs.
         The Marzpets (regional governors) are appointed by government decree and are therefore usually
         loyal to the President and the central government. Marzpets and their teams wield significantly more
         power than local self-government structures in the regions.
         Communities are guaranteed self-governance through the Constitution. However, as most of Arme-
         nia’s communities are small and financially non-viable, they are subsidized from the state budged,
         which creates dependency on (and loyalty to) central government. In addition to the state grants pro-
         vided, the communities also receive some funds through: the collection of land and real estate taxes;
         certain types of state fees charged within the communities; state fees paid to local self-government
         bodies; and other revenues which, however, do not provide complete financial independence for the
         communities.
         Though local self-governance bodies have the right to participate in the decision making process, prac-
         tice has shown that local self-government institutional capacity and experience is deficient making
         them vulnerable to external, non-community influence. This, in turn, restricts the possibilities for local
         communities affected by mineral sector projects to participate in the decision making process.


3.2.	        Civil society, NGOs and CSOs
         Civil society in Armenia, to the extent that it existed, was strongly controlled by the state during the
         Soviet Union. Since independence, there has been a rapid development of NGOs. In 2014 there were
         3,981 NGOs registered, although it is unclear how many of these are active. Recent research puts the
         number at 500-800 (Paturyan & Gevorgyan. 2014). The US Agency for International Development has
         a CSO Sustainability Index, according to which Armenian civil society is ‘partially developed’. Freedom
         House’s Nations in Transit reported in 2014 that the Armenian civil society has remained at 3.5-3.75
         on a scale of 1 (fully developed) to 7 (fully undeveloped).
         Another aspect of civil society, independent of NGO activities, is social movements – groups of peo-
         ple united around a common cause, and there are several recent examples of such movements in
         Armenia, including protests during the summer 2015, which were triggered by the announcement of
         electricity price rises (the ‘Electric Yerevan’ movement).
         According to some estimates, about a quarter of NGOs in Armenia claim to have been involved in
         environmental issues although the number of organizations specifically focused on the environment
         is much smaller, around two dozen. Most of them operate from the capital (Paturyan and Gevorgyan
         2014).
         Ecolur an environmental NGO positions itself as an informational NGO and maintains a website with
         wealth of environmentally related information in Armenian, Russian and English.
         Transparency International – Armenia is an example of a non-environmental NGO that plays an im-
         portant role in this area. It has published a number of reports, focusing mostly on the legislative and
20                                                                    Armenia: Strategic Mineral Sector Sustainability Assessment



        decision-making processes in the mining sector.
        Some environmental NGOs are members of larger networks, such as the Environmental Education
        Network (Armenia-focused) or the Caucasus Environmental NGO Network (regional).
        Surveys suggest that public trust in the work of NGOs is rather limited (see box below). The lack of trust
        is a serious issue as it limits the NGO’s ability to act in a way which is beneficial to society overall (e.g.
        as watch dogs, encouraging public participation and deliberation, developing skills and capacities of
        the public and protector of possibly vulnerable communities).

 BOX: NGOs and public trust in Armenia

 In a survey, heads of Armenian NGOs were asked to estimate public trust towards NGOs. The comparison
 with public opinion data suggest that NGOs commonly overestimate the amount of trust that is placed with
 them.




 The left-hand bar in each pair (brown) indicates NGO heads’ perception of whether NGOs are fully distrust-
 ed, somewhat distrusted, etc. by the public. The right-hand bar in each pair (yellow) shows the actual public
 opinion. For example, 43% of heads of NGO believe that NGOs are somewhat trusted by the public, but in
 reality only 15% of the public somewhat trust NGOs.

 Source: (Paturyan and Gevorgyan, 2014)
        The relationship between the NGOs and the Armenian Government may best be characterised as
        cautious andcooperation is sporadic. For example, the Armenian version of the Ministry of Nature
        Protection website contains a section on cooperation with NGOs. That section is a list of names and
        contact information of around 40 environmental NGOs and some prominent human rights of general
        development NGOs. However, no further information on any specific type of cooperation is available.


3.3.	      Environmental movement
        The environmental movement in Armenia has a several decades long story, spanning from the Soviet
        times. In late 1980s, the environmental movement formed and gained strength, by voicing popular
        concerns over pollution resulting from a number of chemical plants, and worries related to the op-
        erating nuclear power plant, as well as irresponsible mining. In the aftermath of a devastating earth-
Armenia: Strategic Mineral Sector Sustainability Assessment                                                        21



         quake in 1988, public fears led to shutting down the nuclear power plant – a move that later proved
         disastrous for the country’s energy. After that, the environmentalists acquired a poor reputation in the
         larger Armenian society. However, after being dormant for almost two decades, the environmental ac-
         tivism has re-emerged relatively recently. One cannot speak of a movement in a classical sense of the
         word; the number of people involved usually ranges between tens, or a few hundred at the most, that
         rally around a specific narrow goal (preserving a natural site, protesting a construction, etc.). These
         mini-movements usually describe themselves as “civic initiatives.” They are loosely organized and rely
         heavily on social media, where online presence and involvement usually outweighs “offline” actions.
         In fact, most of the publicly visible anti-mining sentiment is generated by such non-formal elements of
         the Armenian civil society; so called “civic initiatives” and mini-social movements.
         Probably the most known and most long-lasting activist campaign against a mining project is the “Save
         Teghut” civic initiative (see box below). This initiative claims to have about 8,000 members online.

   Box: Case Study - Save Teghut

   The Save Teghut civic initiative represented the start of civic activism in Armenia. The stated concern of
   the initiative was one of wanting to preserve forest from being cut down to make room for the Vallex
   owned Teghut copper mine. The Teghut mine was permitted already in 2007, but mining did not start un-
   til 2014. Part of the delays were caused by civic action including: traditional picketing and protests; sign-
   ing of petitions to government; organising activities and fairs where alterative livelihood were promoted
   (e.g. locally based honey and natural cosmetics businesses, and eco-tourism); participation in an initia-
   tive to apply to the Aarhus Convention, claiming that Armenia had violated two main principles, namely
   (public participation in decision-making, and access to justice in environmental issues); and organising a
   lawsuit, aiming to annul the government’s decisions. Additionally, in 2011, as the global financial crisis
   caused the Teghut project to be put on hold, Vallex started seeking funding from various sources, includ-
   ing from the Russian Vneshtorgbank (VTB) bank. Activists then started protesting outside banks, and
   particularly at the VTB bank, but also outside the Yerevan office of the EBRD. Social media has also been
   used, and the initiative has more than 8,000 followers on Facebook.

   Save Teghut is now the most long lived civic initiative in Armenia. From the first days of its existence the
   ultimate objective has been to first stop, then close the mine and to have the permission of exploiting
   the forest declared as illegitimate. The initiative also made it clear that the declaration of the decision’s
   illegitimacy should entail relevant consequences, namely the prosecution of those responsible. While
   the Save Teghut civic initiative continues to pursue its ultimate purpose, the closure of the mine, it has
   showed flexibility in its objectives, as it now works to develop alternative, sustainable future livelihoods
   for villagers living near the operating mine.
                                                                                    Source: (Kankanyan 2015)

         The Pan-Armenian Environmental Front was created in 2013. The same year they published a one-
         hour documentary on YouTube, called “Armenia’s Breaking Backbone.” The argument of the film is that
         current environmentally unfriendly exploitation of Armenia’s resources, particularly mining, is detri-
         mental to Armenia’s future: it is an equivalent of breaking the backbone of the country. In December
         2015, the Armenian version has been watched by more than 175,000 people, the one with English
         subtitles was watched about 5,000 times.


3.4.	        Bi- and multilateral agencies
         There are a considerable number of agencies which do, or have done, significant work that include
         mining sector issues, including the following:

3.5.	Academia
        The American University of Armenia has set up a Centre for Responsible Mining (AUA CRM in 2014),
        aimed at promoting global best practices in socially, environmentally, and economically responsible
        mining in Armenia and the region.
        At the Yerevan State University (YSU), the Sustainable Development Centre was set up in 2012, with
        one of the aims being to address mineral exploitation, and to specifically focus on possibilities for safe
        management and possible reuse/reprocessing of waste. The Centre is housed in the important Faculty
        of Geology and Geography at YSU.
        The National Academy of Sciences conducts research and coordinates activities in the fields of science
        and social sciences. This Academy has a Division of Natural Sciences, where research on the environ-
        mental impacts of, for example, mining has been conducted. The Academy also has a Division of Chem-
        istry and Earth Sciences, which includes the Institute of Geological Sciences that performs geological
        and geophysical research activities, geological surveys, as well as seismology studies.
        The National Polytechnic University of Armenia (NPUA) also provide important knowledge and training
        through its Faculty of Mining and Metallurgy.


3.6.	      Diaspora
        The Diaspora is involved in the environmental issues in Armenia. For example, the Armenian Envi-
        ronmental Network was founded in 2007, and its aim is to facilitate information exchange between
        Armenia and the Diaspora (mainly targeting the US Diaspora). Its current biggest project in Armenia
        is on integrated waste management, including issues related to recycling and reuse, public education
        and participation, etc.
        The Diaspora is also often perceived as an important source of investments in various projects.


3.7.	      Mining and exploration companies
        The main part of the production from large and medium sized copper and gold mines globally is owned
        by rather few large and well known international mining companies, that usually operate several mines
Armenia: Strategic Mineral Sector Sustainability Assessment                                                    23



         in a number of countries, none of which are present in Armenia. The most important companies that
         operate metal mines in Armenia include:
             d.	 Cronimet Mining, the majority owner of ZCMC (operating the Kajaran mine), which is part of
                 the larger Cronimet group, and which is a significant or even large international group of com-
                 panies, albeit not involved in mining (apart from the Kajaran mine) but rather in the metal and
                 scrap sector.
             e.	 Dundee Precious Ltd, is an international mining company listed in Canada, which runs the Sha-
                 humyan polymetallic mine, and which has operations in small number of other countries.
             f.	 GeoProMining, which is a Russian group that has one gold mine (Sotk) and one copper-molyb-
                 denum mine (Agarak) in Armenia, and which also operates a gold mine in Russia.
             g.	 The Armenian Vallex group of companies, which own the Teghut mine.
         Armenia’s largest copper mine (Kajaran) is about the 100th largest copper mine in the world, and the
         largest gold mine in Armenia (Sotk) fall outside a list of the 300 largest gold mines in the world.
         Lydian International is not yet an active mining company, but it owns and promotes the Amulsar gold
         project. Lydian is registered in Jersey and listed on the London and Toronto stock exchanges. The re-
         maining metal mining companies are small, and internationally unproven, and active only in Armenia,
         although they may have their company headquarters elsewhere. Connections with the political sphere
         are not uncommon. Further, many of these businesses are not really proper “mining companies”, rath-
         er SME’s that are active in mining and they may therefore have other needs/requirements/wishes
         compared to the larger operators.
         The non metal sector comprises a large number of small and in a few cases, medium scale businesses.
         There is no sector organisation, such as an Armenian Chamber of Mines. There is however an initia-
         tive called Armenian Mining Network that has been set up to provide the opportunity for “mineral
         resource professionals to increase communication and cooperation within the Armenian mineral re-
         source industry.”


3.8.	Media
         Television is the main source of information, but internet is catching up. According to the Caucasus Re-
         search Resources Centres – Armenia (CRRC), 79% of the population named TV as the most important
         source of information on current events and news in 2013. Internet was used by 17% of the population
         in 2013 compared to 6% in 2011. Thus, the figure has more than doubled.
         Newspapers and radio have a marginal role, especially in the regions. Except for a few news outlets like
         Hetq and other online news agencies (CivilNet, Radio Liberty), journalism in Armenia often lacks pro-
         fessionalism. Overall, news reporting is reported to be shallow, data verification is poor, and self-cen-
         sorship is often exercised (IREX, 2015).
         With regards to mining, “Hetq” is the only investigative journalism outlet that is published online, and
         it reports on mining regularly. In 2008, the head of the Armenian Association of Investigative Journal-
         ists, who runs the Hetq, was attacked and severely injured by three unknown assailants. In the latest
         series before the attack this journalist exposed abuse and corruption in the Armenian mining industry.


3.9.	        Transparency
         According to Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index (2015), Armenia ranks 95th out
         of 168 countries for perceived levels of public sector corruption, compared to Georgia’s 48th placing
24                                                                  Armenia: Strategic Mineral Sector Sustainability Assessment



         and Azerbaijan at 119. According to the World Bank Control of Corruption Indicator (2014), Armenia
         has a percentile rank of 40, meaning that it is more corrupt than 60% of countries assessed (a total
         of 215 countries analysed). The measured level of corruption has fluctuated in the past two decades,
         with no clear longer term trend.
         Public opinion surveys in Armenia suggest that corruption is perceived as both a major problem and a
         fact of life, although public intolerance towards corruption is increasing (Paturyan & Jrbashyan, 2012).
         Data recorded in Caucasus Barometer (2013) show that trust towards various government structures
         is low, whereas the Armenian Apostolic Church and the National Army are well trusted.


3.10.	      Recommendations
         The following recommendations are provided, which are all related to the particularities of the stake-
         holders in the Armenian minerals sector:
         a.	 Better opportunities for local community to take a more active part in planning, and to provide
             informed contributions in decision-making for how mines are developed and established should
             be created. Participation of local communities in decision-making is regulated by law (c.f. Chapter
             4.7) and, for example, local communities are consulted during the EIA process and their opinions
             attached to the submitted mining rights application. Nevertheless, it is recommended that the
             capacity of communities is strengthened to facilitate improved participation and that the ability of
             CSO’s to be a constructive party in such processes be encouraged. Probably, special training effort
             aimed at such NGOs may be necessary. This training could be provided in partnership between dif-
             ferent stakeholders; both the mining companies and the State would have a responsibility for, and
             an interest in, strengthening community capacity and relations, and assistance can be sought from
             development partners.
         b.	 The different bi- and multilateral agencies involved in supporting the development of the mining
             sector, in one way or another, need to be internally well coordinated.
         c.	 The mining companies should be encouraged to form a business organisation, like an Armenian
             Chamber of Mines, the establishment of which should be initiated and financed through the min-
             ing companies themselves. As the companies have differing needs and requirements (e.g. since
             there is one big operator, a small number of medium scale, and a whole host of small businesses),
             such an organisation may need to have a special unit for SMEs. A Chamber of Mine would facilitate
             relations with government and discussions among stakeholders, and may also make it possible for
             Armenian mine operators to agree on important guidelines and criteria to improve business ethics
             and behaviour.
         d.	 Efforts should be made to attract established, responsible and well known international mining
             companies to invest in Armenia. Such operators may then bring international best practices with
             them, which can subsequently be spread throughout the sector.

4.	          Policy and legislation

4.1.	        Policy
         The mining sector has received considerable attention from policy makers in recent years. A decade
         or so ago, mining policy issues were most intensely, and almost only, discussed and considered in any
         depth at the World Bank. Today, there are a number of ongoing policy development initiatives, both by
         newly set up institutions as well as by well - established organisations and/or think tanks such as the
         EU, the World Economic Forum, and the African Union who previously gave the mining sector more
         limited interest (see box).

  Box: Policy initiatives for the Mining Sector
  Before the millennium, in depth discussion on how to best develop, manage and control the mining sector
  in developing countries was almost solely discussed at the World Bank. The advice provided was based
  on free market reform, and to ensure that foreign investments were allowed to flow into exploration and
  mining development. With regards to exploration, it was recommended that rights should be issues on a
  “first come, first served” basis.
  In the late 1990s, the World Bank Group had become increasingly concerned with the need to consider
  environmental and social issues in mining sector development. In fact, severe criticism of some World
  Bank projects and a debate over the “resource curse”, led to a review of the bank involvement in projects
  in the “extractive sector”. The “Extractive Industries review”, was completed in 2004 and it concluded
  that the proper development of extractive industries can contribute to poverty reduction and that World
  Bank involvement can positively influence industry standards. Since 2004, the World Bank has developed
  a comprehensive set of tools aimed at assisting in the proper development and control of all the links in
  the “mineral resource chain”. These tools have become tightly coupled with the Extractive Industries’
  Transparency Initiative (EITI).
  The EITI is a global Standard to promote open and accountable management of natural resources, which
  seeks to strengthen government and company systems, inform public debate, and enhance trust. In each
  implementing country, the EITI it is supported by a coalition of government, companies and civil society
  working together. Countries implementing the EITI must annually report information on tax payments,
  licences, contracts, production and other key elements around resource extraction, which allows citizens
  to see how their country’s natural resources are being managed and how much revenue they are generat-
  ing. At the end of 2015, there were 49 countries implementing the EITI, of which 31 had candidate status,
  and18 had compliant status.
  Following the latest commodity price boom, a number of new policy initiatives have been developed. In
  general, these either aim to ensure the future supply of metals (e.g. the EU’s raw materials initiative), or
  attempting to provide advice to resource rich countries of how to better ensure that benefits of the sector
  can be better harnessed. Some of the latter type of advice (e.g. the Natural Resource Charter) is suggesting
  that the mineral sector should be managed more like the oil sector, including public bidding for tenements,
  in contrast to “first come, first served” approach. Other development relates to attempts to formalise, bet-
  ter structure and even stipulate legal requirements for the CSR related activities that often are performed
  by international mining companies that operate in developing countries.
  Most recently, policy initiatives aim to assist states to move from being solely exporter of raw materials to
  also being manufacturer and supplier of knowledge-based services, thus ensuring broad-based develop-
  ment through linkages to other industry. The need to ensure local development and community benefits
  are also highlighted, as are efforts to improve the capacity of nations to negotiate contracts with mining
  companies.
26                                                                  Armenia: Strategic Mineral Sector Sustainability Assessment



        Policy related initiatives have been driven to a large extent by the needs of resource rich developing
        countries (rather than transition economies) and many developing countries have also reached far in
        implementing policy and law in line with advice that has emerged over the years. Whereas transition
        states have moved towards a market-based economy, the specifics of such states’ regulatory systems
        and how they may need to be adapted to facilitate mining sector development have not attracted as
        much interest and policy debate.
        Armenian policy, specific to mineral sector development, sets the agenda broadly, but there are no
        detailed policy goals or actions defined, nor a plan for policy implementation:
           a.	 According to Armenian Development Strategy (ADS) for the period 2014-2025, industry’s con-
               tribution to the economy must continue to increase, and the mining sector with its downstream
               metals production sector are expected to be important contributors to that growth.
           b.	 A similar aspiration is expressed on the website of the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resourc-
               es, which states that: “…the current state of affairs does not enable full use of the economic po-
               tential of the mines. Organization, in closed and complete cycles (from extraction to creation of
               a final product), of processing of metal minerals extracted in Armenia will provide opportunity
               to make high value products, which in its turn will ensure the GDP growth…”
           c.	 The current Government Program for 2012-2017 also strongly emphasises economic develop-
               ment, in part through industrial development including efforts to engage foreign firms and in-
               vestors to introduce new technologies and increased knowledge. It also makes a reference to a
               balanced approach of ensuring environmental protection and specifically mentions strengthen-
               ing environmental oversight of mining activities.
        Nevertheless, some legal provisions and governmental actions provide concrete statements of policy
        directions considered to be important in promoting mineral sector development. Thus, Armenia com-
        mitted to implementing the EITI standard in July 2015 and is now preparing a candidature application.
        From this follows that it is the Government’s strategy to move towards accountability and transpar-
        ency with regards to tax payments, and information on permits, contracts, and production, etc. and
        towards multi stakeholder participation in driving this strategy forward. Also, as described in more
        detail below, the enactment of a modern EIA law (2014) as well as provisions for exploration permits
        to be awarded on a first-come-first-served basis under the current RA Mining Code provide example of
        directions of policy development.


4.2.	      Introduction to the legal framework
        The legal system of the Republic of Armenia emerged, and continues to evolve according to the pattern
        of civil law countries. Similar to the situation in some other transition countries, the Armenian legal
        system bears some influence on the former ideological and institutional rationale, and practices. The
        legal system as currently constructed is therefore a hybrid mix of old laws (some of which no longer
        have practical application) and new laws, which have been passed since independence.
        International agreements become a constitutive part of the Armenian legal system when they are rat-
        ified or adopted by the relevant national authorities. Thus, according to the Constitution: “If a ratified
        international treaty stipulates norms other than those stipulated in the laws, the norms of the treaty
        shall prevail. International treaties contradicting Constitution cannot be ratified.”
        Primary legislation in Armenia usually covers both substantive and procedural aspects. In addition,
        while secondary regulations usually aim at implementing primary legislation, in Armenia they often
        deal with a few substantive issues too. The tendency is then towards extensive regulation by law.
        This appears to be related to a “legal culture” where by entrusting the power to legislate and regu-
Armenia: Strategic Mineral Sector Sustainability Assessment                                                            27



         late mostly to the Legislative Power, it is sought to insulate the regime from frequent changes by the
         Executive Power and ensure the longer term stability of provisions. This approach necessarily entails
         frequent revision and amendment of the law (e.g. even to revise time periods for decision under the
         RA Mining Code), which negates stability of the legal regime.
         Overall in the development of mineral law in Armenia, there appears to be insufficient focus on con-
         ceptual thinking prior to the legal development process, including the drafting of policy-making and
         developing concept papers, before the actual drafting of a law begins. It appears as if the drafting of
         law is in some cases an ad-hoc response to upcoming issues or ideas that require state action. Discus-
         sions at the policy level do not appear to consider various options by which problems can be resolved,
         such as, for instance, specific guidelines or wide public awareness campaigns. In this regard, there
         appears to be need for stronger coordination and cooperation between different ministries in legal
         development.


4.3.	        Mineral regulation
         The RA Mining Code of Armenia has been amended a few times since independence, and additional
         amendments are now before the parliament (table 4.1). The version that came into force on 1 January
         2012 is the main legal instrument currently governing the sector.

                                                      lization of reclamation fund payments.

     The overall purpose of the RA Mining Code includes:
             •	 Establishing the principles for conducting mining in all the territory of the Republic of Armenia;
             •	 Governing relations derived from nature and environmental protection;
             •	 Ensuring safety in works during mining; and
             •	 Ensuring the protection of rights and legitimate interests of the State and individuals for con-
                ducting mining activities.
         The RA Mining Code further defines the main spheres of law and regulation, and the underlying prin-
         ciples to include the following:
             •	 Stating the principle of exclusive ownership of the State on the subsoil;
             •	 Establishing a role for the State in developing ‘State programmes’, and preparing a State inven-
28                                                                Armenia: Strategic Mineral Sector Sustainability Assessment



            tory of mineral reserves, as well as a regulatory role with an explicit focus on conducting ‘State
            expert examinations’ along the procedure for granting permits;
        •	 Setting safety and environmental regulations, and regulations for a ‘reasonable utilization’ of
           mines;
        •	 Setting forth transparency as a principle (defined under Article 9 as ‘dissemination of informa-
           tion regarding activities related to mining’ as establishes under RA laws’); and
     Establishing the principle of ‘charging for the use of minerals’.
     Similar to the subsoil law of some other transition countries, the RA Mining Code bear remnants of
     older legislation, in particular in the area of controlling mineral reserves and in reserves balance mon-
     itoring. Thus, the hard-minerals sections of previous sub-soil law in some transition countries were
     aimed at encouraging increased knowledge of minerals reserves and setting rules for State enterpris-
     es and entering into contracts to carry out the production of minerals from identified ore deposits.
     Rather than considering the minerals sector and the involvement of private actors in it as a catalyst
     for development, their main role was that of supplying the domestic resource-needs and supporting
     the economy in that way. These subsoil laws have later evolved to allow for corporate participation.
     With regards to the role of the State, the RA Mining Code places emphasis on its role in:
        •	 developing and implementing ‘State programmes’ on protection and integrated use of the
           subsoil at a national, regional or local level. State programmes refer to policy type documents
           approved by Government decisions, describing development plans and strategies on specific
           issues;
        •	 preparing a State inventory of mineral reserves and balance calculation, and administration of
           registry system for exploration and mining permits, as well as for mineral deposits;
        •	 setting the basis for State control and State expert examination (examination of accuracy of
           information on reserves being instrumental in the process of granting permits);
        •	 developing State ‘standards’ in the field of mining and subsoil protection (the Code refers to
           standards, norms and regulations);
        •	 establishing the basis for fees for the use of minerals.
     Thus, the role envisaged for the State is as policy developer, while the lack of a comprehensive mineral
     policy is perhaps the most significant hindrance for the organized and stable development of the sec-
     tor (cf. Section 5.1). The role of the State is also as administrator and regulator, with intervention along
     the process of granting permits through State expert examinations of the applicants plans and designs
     related to environmental requirements and technical safety as well as to approve reserves estimations
     and technical operation designs submitted by the applicant. The State, however, does not have a role
     as an entrepreneur, neither in legislation nor in practice.


     Mineral rights regime
     The most important function, and most focus, of a mining code commonly lies in the establishment
     a regime for allocating mineral rights – to set the rules and procedures for acquiring, maintaining,
     transferring and cancelling mineral rights. The RA Mining Code does establish such a regime in Articles
     20-31.
     The main legal aspects of the mineral rights regime are presented below, while the process for the
     application and granting of mineral rights is described in Chapter 6 in conjunction with a presentation
     of the institutions involved in this process.
Armenia: Strategic Mineral Sector Sustainability Assessment                                                    29



         The RA Mining Code applies to metallic and non-metallic minerals, as well as mineral water. It does,
         however, not regulate radioactive minerals or the exploration and extraction of oil and gas, both of
         which according to the Mining Code shall be subject to a separate law. There are no specific provisions
         applicable to industrial minerals in the RA Mining Code, apart for that legal persons and individuals
         are entitled to conduct extraction of non-metallic minerals that are not registered in the state mineral
         reserves balance for non-commercial purposes, up to a depth of 2 meters, without acquiring mineral
         right. Thus, most types of commercial mining (metals, non-metals, and different mine size) are regu-
         lated in the same way, which is in contrast to some mining countries in which for example small-scale
         mining and industrial mining is regulated differently to large scale metal mining in some regards (e.g.
         simplified permitting procedures).
         The RA Mining Code establishes that the subsoil of the Republic of Armenia is the exclusive domain
         of the State and the Code provides for the granting of three types of mineral permits: (i): exploration
         agreement; (ii) exploration permit for the purpose of further extraction; and (iii) exploitation permit.
         The Code does not provide for any type of applicant priority for an ‘exploration permit’, while an ‘ex-
         ploration permit for the purpose of further extraction’ is awarded on a first-come-first-served basis.
         The permit contents (e.g. exploration plan, permit coordinates, etc.) are similar for the two, while the
         explored mineral is specified in the permit form for the latter in contrast to the former. Thus, an ex-
         ploration permit is issued for reconnaissance-type exploration work and, similar to the situation with
         ‘reconnaissance licenses’ in some countries, the Code does not preclude the issuing of more than one
         ‘exploration permit’ over a specific geographical area.
         Mining codes usually define cases of ineligibility of certain persons to hold mining permits. This can
         include for example public officers, and some recent mining codes also exclude people with records
         of conviction for corruption or environmental damage cases. The Armenian Mining Code, however,
         does not provide for any type of ineligibility cases, but any legal person can apply for a mining permit
         (although the financial and technical capacity and means of any applicant needs to be approved by
         the authorities). If a mining permit held by a legal person has been terminated, a new mining permit is
         however not granted to such a person.
         Exploration rights are issued for a time period of up to 3 years, which may be extended three consec-
         utive times, each for a time period not exceeding 2 years. Mineral rights for extraction of minerals
         (mining rights) can be issued for the duration of the mine life, as per the approved technical plan, but
         up to a maximum of 50 years, after which an extension of the mineral right may be applied for.
         The RA Mining Code also includes provisions for the expansion of subsoil allotments, relinquishing
         of rights, and for transition between exploration and exploitation permits. Thus, the Code provides
         for that: ”a person granted with the right of geological exploration for the purpose of mining… has
         a preference for acquiring mining rights on the subsoil allotments on which he collected geological
         information at its own cost’. Although we have been informed that there has not been discretion in
         granting mineral rights to applicants other than the holder of geological exploration rights, it would be
         important to establish a clear entitlement to mineral rights to strengthening security of tenure.

     cessful discovery will display a different set of solutions according to whether they should be automati-
     cally assigned to the discoverer, whether the discoverer should have priority regarding mining rights, or
     whether they should be allocated either to the discoverer or to any other applicant at the government’s
     discretion.

     It has been argued that legal entitlement to extraction rights constitutes a first phase of the concept. In
     a second phase, it involves the certainty of rights obtained and the conditions under which they may be
     revoked or lost in the exploration and mining phase, transferred or mortgaged. Following this broader
     interpretation of security of tenure, it has been stated that a regime of secured tenure ensures that a
     mineral right, once granted, cannot be suspended or revoked except on specified grounds which are
     clearly set out by law, and provides reasonable assurances guaranteeing the continuity of operations
     over the life of the project. An aspect encompassing the continuity of operations is related to the ability
     to transfer the title to eligible third parties, and to mortgage the title to raise finance.” (Bastida, 2001).

         Mineral rights are granted through a mineral permit, a ‘land use permit act’ (a document that defines
         the area of subsoil allotments), and a contract between MENR and the applicant. Contracts are envis-
         aged for all three types of mineral rights and the RA Mining Code defines the contents of these. Fur-
         thermore, there is a Government decision from 22 March 2012, which establishes a mining contract
         model for ‘geological exploration for the purposes of mining’, and for ‘exploitation/mining’ (see box
         below).

 Geological exploration contract
 The Geological Exploration Contract has a similar structure than the mining contract, except for a separate
 clause for the duration of the contract. As to the annexes, the Geological Exploration Contract requires only
 a time schedule for conducting geological exploration and submitting findings for State expert examination.
 The contract is signed between the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources and the Mining Company. In
 certain cases ad-hoc contractual clauses might be added setting special conditions.


4.4.	        Land access and eminent domain
         Land relations for mining are subject to provisions of the RA Land Code and the RA Civil Code. Thus,
         land belongs to either the State, communities or is private property. In the case of State and commu-
         nity lands, relations are regulated through Government and local self-government bodies (community
         administration, regional administration/Marzpetaran) and land for mining are acquired through rent-
         ing, servitude contracts, and purchase agreements. In the case of private property, the company can
         either directly buy, rent, or sign servitude agreements with private property owners (citizens, legal
         entities). The company initiates and runs the negotiations with private property owner without State’s
         intervention.
         The RA Land Code defines land use categories (Table 4.2), and land must be used strictly in accor-
         dance to its land use category. For mining to be allowed, the relevant piece of land must have been
         assigned to the category “Industrial, mining and for other production purposes”. The Government can
         change the category of land into industrial for mining purposes, upon request by a mineral permit
         holder. However, existing regulations provide that in cases where there exists a community master
         plan, changing the land use purpose must be consistent with the master plan. For communities that

       do not have such a master plan, and instead use temporary schemes, land use purpose changes are
       made based on the permission from the RA Government.

                                    ages State land reserves directly or through state authorized bodies.
       According to the Constitution, expropriation of property may be carried out in exceptional cases of par-
       amount public interest only, and prior adequate compensation. The Law on Expropriation of Property
       for the Needs of Society and the State (2006) sets the principles and grounds based on which property
       can be expropriated, mining being explicitly listed among them. The law, furthermore, instructs the
       Government to make decisions on expropriation, and specific decisions are taken on a case-by-case
       basis. Expropriation of property for mining purposes have been grounded on the following ”common”
       justifications:
          •	 The project holds national importance in the field of mining;
          •	 The operation of the project will provide a substantial increase in the volume of industrial out-
             put and exports of Armenia;
          •	 The implementation of the project will significantly contribute to strengthening the economic
             security of the country; and
          •	 The mining project will substantially trigger a region’s socio-economic development.
       Property holders can apply to courts when having disagreements or claims related to the decision of
       expropriation. The property holder has the right to appeal the decision in Courts. Prior compensation
       of the expropriated property is calculated on the basis of a price, which is 15% higher than the market
       value (the determination of the market value of real estate and property rights being set under the
       procedure established by the Law on Real Estate Evaluation Activity). The State Cadastre Committee is
       also involved in assessment of land.
       The law thus provides for a clear process to assign and access land for mining with “straight-forward”
       negotiations between companies and landowners, and governmental decisions around expropriation
       and compensation, when the situation so demands. The process however lacks some of the concepts
Armenia: Strategic Mineral Sector Sustainability Assessment                                                       33



         that today are often considered internationally in cases of compensation and resettlement (see box
         below).
         There are currently court cases held against Armenia at the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR)
         on the grounds of unfair compensation for alienated property (from Teghut and Shnogh communi-
         ties, Lori region): Mashinyan and Ramazyan v. Armenia (Application no. 65124/09), Parsadanyan and
         others v. Armenia (Application no. 5444/10), Osmanyan and Amiraghyan v. Armenia (Application no.
         71306/11). Along with compensation issues, the cases question the ”fair balance” between the de-
         mands of the general interest of society and the requirements of the protection of the individual’s
         fundamental rights. The ECHR has not passed decisions over these cases as yet.

   Box: International trends on compensation for use and expropriation of land
   Mining laws and contracts, as well as codes of conduct of companies, banks and financial corporations,
   are adopting far higher standards than in the past to engage with, and compensate landowners and
   landholders for the use of their land for mining operations. In some cases, guidance for consultation,
   negotiation and compensation are provided through guidelines documents made available online. An
   important point is that these standards are not only applicable to landowners, but also to landholders:
   those living in plots of land but not holding formal titles.
   A good practice reference is the Performance Standards prepared by the International Financial Corpo-
   ration (IFC) for financing projects in which they are involved. While the question of resettlement is very
   controversial, Performance Standard 5 on Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement sets guidelines
   that can be helpful, analogically, when fair compensation criteria is needed (for example, for establishing
   the basis for compensation for “economic displacement” caused by land acquisitions or restrictions on
   land use (regardless whether affected people are physically displaced).
   The IFC Performance Standards require full replacement cost for loss of assets of economically displaced
   persons, and, in case the livelihoods or income levels of those persons are adversely affected, it is estab-
   lished that opportunities to improve, or at least restore, their means of income-earning capacity, produc-
   tion levels, and standards of living, must be provided.


4.5.	        Environmental and social regulations
         Basic features and provisions
         Environmental and social regulation of the mineral sector is primarily based on the RA Law on Environ-
         mental Impact Assessment and Expert Examination, 2014 (EIA Law) and the RA Mining Code, 2012; the
         latter amended in 2014 to be “harmonized” with the former. The inclusion of environmental and social
         provisions in the RA Mining Code is in line with modern mining law development, while it requires
         strict alignment with other legislation, not to add complexity and confusion around requirements and
         implementation responsibilities.
         Overall, the legal framework, and in particular the EIA Law, is sophisticated and includes most, if not
         all, concepts and methods that one may wish to see in that the goal being to anticipate, prevent or
         mitigate potential negative impacts on the environment or human health and well-being. Key princi-
         ples guiding the preparation of assessments and expert examinations are in line with the concepts of
         sustainable development. There is, however, a lack of some important pieces of secondary legislation
         and/or guidelines to aid implementation of the law, for example proper guidelines or methodologies
         for assessing impact on human health and similar methodologies for assessing impact on biodiversity.
         This might partly be due to the fact that the EIA Law itself was enacted recently.
34                                                              Armenia: Strategic Mineral Sector Sustainability Assessment



     General provisions of relevance in the RA Mining Code include that a mining project proponent or
     operator must undertake measures for: protection of the environment, water basins, soil, fauna and
     flora; and respecting the regime of special protected national parks. The mine operator must reclaim
     land, and manage waste adequately and overall observe and abide by the provisions on expert exam-
     ination of the environmental impact assessment. The Code refers to other law, including the EIA Law,
     for further regulation.
     The EIA Law classifies types of planned activities into three categories (A, B and C) based on descend-
     ing scale and impact on the environment and with different assessment procedures for each category.
     All mining projects are classified as Category A. In addition to defining general EIA principles and pro-
     cedures, the EIA Law also introduces the concept of strategic assessment, and defines activities subject
     to strategic assessment (mining is included within the activities subject to strategic assessment). The
     Law defines strategic assessment as the process of evaluating the possible total and cumulative impact
     of the proposed project. Other special assessments include economic assessment of environmental
     damage, assessment of ecosystem services as well as assessment of financial compensation for envi-
     ronmental damage and liability. Methodologies and guidelines for these assessments are however still
     in the process of development.
     The EIA law also has provisions on transboundary impact assessment, including expert examination
     and international cooperation, in accordance with the Convention on Environmental Impact Assess-
     ment in a Transboundary Context which was ratified by Armenia in 1996.
     Inspections to assess compliance with environmental regulations are carried out once per 1-3 years.
     If complaints are made (by nearby communities, NGOs or other organizations), additional inspections
     may be conducted. Mining companies are as yet not obliged to carry-out self-monitoring.

     Social aspects
     Social impact assessment is part of the requirements of the RA Mining Code and EIA law. The require-
     ments are to include provisions to improve the local population’s social conditions, livelihoods and to
     guarantee participation in decisions regarding socio economic development initiatives for the commu-
     nities. To our knowledge, this has so far only been “tested” within the EIA process Lydian Internation-
     al’s Amulsar gold project.
     Mining contracts also should include such local socio-economic development related provisions. In the
     absence of more detailed regulations, mining contracts can have an important role in bridging gaps in
     existing regulations, adopting and aligning with best international environmental and social practice
     and enhancing clarity and coordination of the roles of different government authorities with compe-
     tence in areas relevant to the mining project.
Armenia: Strategic Mineral Sector Sustainability Assessment                                                      35




   Box: Should community development requirement be included in law?
   More than 30 countries have adopted community development requirements into their mining laws.
   This approach to addressing mining’s impact goes beyond mitigating the negative effect of mining on
   local communities (such as through compensation arrangements and environmental laws), to requiring
   firms and/or states to ensure that mining translates into positive social and economic gains for min-
   ing-affected communities, thereby attempting to redress cases of inequitable distribution of mining’s
   costs and benefits.
   Nearly all the countries with these types of legislation in place are developing countries. A notable
   exception being some provinces in Canada, where Community Development Agreements are required
   between companies, and local communities when the projects are impacting upon land used/owned by
   indigenous/first nation communities.
                                                                                           Source: Dupuy, 2014


         Specially protected areas
         Provisions that set lands banned from mining are scattered along the text of the RA Mining Code. Thus,
         mining is not allowed in the areas of cemeteries; natural, historical and cultural sites; sites with fauna
         or flora registered in the Red Book of the RA, or which are migration routes for species.
         Specially protected areas (cf. table 4.2), are divided into several categories: natural reserves; national
         parks; state wilderness areas; and state natural monuments. Each of these categories have a specif-
         ic protection and a management regime, and a list of activities prohibited within their boundaries.
         Geological exploration, mining and ore processing operations are not allowed in nature reserves and
         national parks. It is, however, allowed to conduct mining, without the use of explosives, within defined
         economic zones of national parks.
         Mining is also prohibited in other types of specially protected areas including land for medical/sani-
         tary purposes; for leisure/recreation, and; lands of historical and cultural value, that have significant
         aesthetic, scientific, historical, cultural, recreational, sanitary environmental/nature protection values.
         Each type of such lands is managed through special legal regimes. These type of lands can be fully or
         partially removed from economic or citizen use based on decisions by government, ministries, and lo-
         cal self-governing bodies. The law also prohibits expropriation of nature protection lands for purposes
         that do not correspond to their defined use and operational purpose, while land use categories can be
         changed upon Government decisions (cf. Section 4.1).

         Mine closure
         The application for the mining or extraction right must include a mine closure plan, which should be
         part of the mining contract, and cover the following: dismantling of infrastructure, machinery, equip-
         ment and buildings, land reclamation plan, workforce social mitigation plan, a monitoring plan; final
         closure plan to be approved 2 years before the planned end of operations. With regards to the last
         point, it commendably aims at ensuring a timely design of the mine closure plan, while in best practise
         management, an adequate mine closure plan should exist at any point in time of the operations (cf.
         Section 7.2).
36                                                                    Armenia: Strategic Mineral Sector Sustainability Assessment




     BOX: Mine closure standards
     Comparative mine closure regimes have evolved substantially in the last few decades. The focus is gen-
     erally placed on the need for environmental clean-up and rehabilitation, with increasingly stringent
     standards of financial assurances and relinquishment criteria. Socio-economic aspects are usually not
     reflected in legislation. Water security and climate change are emerging issues likely to influence the
     development of future mine closure regimes. Across jurisdictions, international standards play an im-
     portant role in the development of law and regulation. Overall, best practice for mine closure requires
     early planning, integration of closure plans throughout all phases of mining and through post-closure;
     progressive reclamation provisions; financial assurances.
     A World Bank report that analyses mine closure regulations in Armenia (2014) notes that “even though
     this approach of reviewing the whole “cradle-to- grave” process of mining development is in line with
     all international standards, it leaves a lot of questions and issues that could arise in the practical imple-
     mentation, mostly related to planning of financing mine closure, and the responsibilities and liabilities
     and associated with post-closure monitoring.”

         Environmental fees and guarantees
         The RA Mining Code lists a range of fees, termed mineral fees (or subsoil use fees), which have a bear-
         ing on environmental management, and which are further regulated under other laws. These fees, in
         the wording of the English version of the RA Mining Code, include:
            a.	 environmental fee for implementing environment protection measures,
            b.	 contributions to nature and environmental protection fund (reclamation), for restoration of
                lands damaged by mining activities (note: referred to as Environmental Protection Fund in other
                Armenian legislation),
            c.	 fee for monitoring of the program, ensuring safety and health of people in the areas of mining,
                and disposal and storage of industrial waste,
            d.	 fee for use of minerals, (except metallic), use of minerals deemed as state property,
            e.	 royalty for metallic minerals, use of minerals deemed as state property,
         The ‘environmental fee’ (paragraph 41a), relates to provisions in the RA Law on Environmental and
         Natural Resource Use Fees (in force since 1999), which define three types of ‘environmental payments’
         that apply to both metal and non-metal mining, and include:
            a.	 Payments for emission of hazardous substances into the environment (air and water)
            b.	 Payments for disposal of industrial and consumption wastes into the environment
            c.	 Payments for products causing harm to the environment
         The rates as well as calculation mechanisms for these payments are regulated in accordance with
         the RA Law on Rates of Environmental Payments (2007). Furthermore, the RA Law on Targeted Use
         of Environmental Charges Paid by the Companies (2002) allows for a part of the environmental fees
         paid by the companies to be taken from the state budget and directed into the budgets of the affected
         communities where those companies operate. The list of companies and the amount of the subsidies
         are approved each year in accordance with the RA Law on Budget. The level of payment is based on
         the amount and nature of pollutants generated, and communities can apply for funds for environmen-
         tal projects that they design. The law thus provides for mining companies to finance environmental
         and health protection measures, which are implemented by the communities. This mechanism for
Armenia: Strategic Mineral Sector Sustainability Assessment                                                     37



         environmental management is rather unusual, and there is a risk that it may to some extent lower
         the incitement for the companies to be directly involved and assume their share of the responsibility
         for community health and well-being. Furthermore, centralized decision making may not be the most
         efficient way to administrate and manage the fund, and key informants also mention that most of the
         funds are used for other priorities than environmental and health management.
         Related to the provision referred to in paragraph 41b above, the RA Mining Code also makes specific
         provision for the inclusion of a financial guarantee for the implementation of the mine closure plan.
         This is related to provisions of the RA EIA Law for the assessment of costs for reclamation and mine
         closure and the levels of payments to the Environmental Protection Fund. Payments are regulated
         through Government Decision N 1079 on Calculation of Reclamation Funds. The preliminary payment
         is made after the contract is signed, and the amount should not be less than 15% of the total estimated
         amount. Subsequent annual payments are calculated from the outstanding part of the total estimated
         cost, and the time period for planned reclamation activities. This presents a problem as the system
         does not ensure that there are sufficient funds for complete reclamation and closure at any point in
         time, which is one of the most important aspects of modern mine reclamation and closure policy.
         There are also no provisions accounting for the possibility of changing monetary value over time, e.g.
         through exchange rate fluctuations or inflation.
         At the end of 2015, the Nature Protection and Reclamation Fund represents about USD2 million. There
         is, furthermore, a draft amendment to the Mining Code that provides for the reallocation of funds
         from the Nature Protection and Reclamation Fund towards environmental and reclamation activities
         at abandoned and illegally exploited mines.
         The ‘monitoring fee’ (ref paragraph 41c) is aimed at ensuring safety and health of people in the areas
         of mining, and the areas of disposal and storage of industrial waste. This type of fee is specified in the
         Mining Code as mineral/subsoil use fee. When applying for a mining permit, there is a requirement
         that the applicant/operator should present a detailed monitoring plan for mine closure. The amount of
         the monitoring fee and the calculation procedures are defined by the RA Government. The monitoring
         fee is paid by mining companies to the state, which should later be used by nature protection institu-
         tions to conduct monitoring, after mine closure.
         The ‘mineral use fees’ referred to in paragraphs 41d and 41e above also relate to provisions under the
         RA Law on Environmental and Natural Resource Use Fees. Thus, mineral resource use fees are related
         to mining of hard minerals except for metal minerals, exhausted reserves; extracted reserves of un-
         derground portable and mineral water; and salt (41d), and royalty (41e) is paid for the use of metallic
         minerals. The rates and calculation mechanisms for natural resource use fees for non-metallic minerals
         are defined by the Government. For metallic minerals, the royalty rates and calculation methodologies
         are defined in the Law on Environmental and Natural Resource Use Fees.


4.6.	        Mine waste regulation
         The RA Mining Code includes broad provisions on mine waste management in that it requires the
         operator to “ensure processing, assessing, eliminating and minimizing mine waste”, and that it should
         “adhere to norms and rules on waste collection, transportation, preservation, processing, and bury-
         ing”. For further regulation, it refers to the Law on Waste, which was most recently amended in 2015,
         and which has as the main objective to define the key principles for a State policy on waste man-
         agement (including mining waste) to establish main conditions, requirements and rules for environ-
         mentally safe waste management, to ensure minimal waste disposal and their utilization in economic
         activities, and to minimize the hazardous impact of waste on human health and the environment. As
         mentioned above, the RA Mining Code also requires companies to produce a mine closure plan, and
38                                                                 Armenia: Strategic Mineral Sector Sustainability Assessment



        this plan should include a waste monitoring plan, among other things. In addition, the RA Law on En-
        vironmental Impact Assessment and Expert Examination is of relevance to mine waste management
        (see Section 7.1).
        While the RA Law on Waste and the RA Mining Code were amended in 2015 to include some terminol-
        ogy on mine waste (e.g. definitions of mine waste, tailings and overburden), and thus acknowledging
        that it needs special consideration, both laws referred to above are of general nature, and there are no
        detailed mine waste management regulations. Thus, there are, for example, no specific evaluation cri-
        teria for environmental performance (e.g. seepage quality) and definition of hazardous mining waste,
        nor for factors of safety against dam wall failure and other aspects that help to minimise physical
        stability risks. There is also no specification of minimum technical safety monitoring, inspection and
        auditing requirements specific to mining waste facilities.
        The RA Law on Rates of Environmental Fees (mentioned above) defines rates specifically for the dis-
        posal of industrial waste, with rates being based on the “degree of danger” and the type of waste.
        The law, however, provides for the exclusion of this type of fee for non-hazardous waste produced by
        mine operators and, in reality, such a fee is not paid for mining waste rock or mine tailings. One of the
        reasons for the exclusion of environmental fees on mine waste could be that it can be considered as a
        resource (see next paragraph), subject to later processing, but it is also noticed that applying a fee or
        a tax to mine waste disposal is highly unusual (see further section 8.3).
        The RA Mining Code also introduces the term “man-made mine”, defined as an accumulation of min-
        erals on the earth surface or in rock holes or tailings facilities formed as a result of exploration, ex-
        traction, processing and enrichment of minerals, which in compliance with the established regulations
        have received geological and economical assessment. Thus, according to law, non-operational tailings
        facilities, for which geological and economic studies prove a mineral reserve (ie. they may be econom-
        ically feasible to mine) are classified as mines, rather than mine waste. These man-made mines are
        the exclusive property of RA and may be granted for extraction of minerals. The issue of “man-made
        mines” is discussed in detail in Chapter 8.


4.7.	      Public participation and access to data
        The right for the public to participate in environmental decision making and to access data is protected
        in Armenian law. Thus, the Constitution places duties upon public officials in that these are responsible
        if found to be hiding information on environmental issues, or in denying access to such data. Further-
        more, the Law of the Republic of Armenia on Freedom of Information includes provision to ensure
        public access to information, including procedures for requesting and receiving information and fol-
        low-up steps if access to information is denied.
        The EIA law, furthermore, strengthens the right for public participation substantially. Thus, it states
        that the comments and recommendations of participants of the EIA process should be taken into
        account. Certain provisions to promote public participation and consultation on environmental issues
        have also been incorporated into local legislation to meet international best standards under Aarhus
        Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice
        in Environmental Matters ratified by Armenia in 2001. With regards to early public notification, the
        EIA law ensures involvement of the public already when the developer submits an application to the
        Ministry of Nature Protection. Procedures on public discussions and consultations are established by
        Government decision (N 1325-N, 19 November, 2014). In order to ensure that the final EIA decision is
        publicly available, the law establishes a clear requirement to publish it on the official website of the
        Ministry of Nature Protection of RA within 7 days after the decision is taken. The regime of Specially
        Protected Areas also guarantees public participation in the management of such areas.
Armenia: Strategic Mineral Sector Sustainability Assessment                                                      39



         With regards to access to geological and mining information, the RA Mining Code provides that geo-
         logical exploration rights and mining rights are registered in a centralized register of mineral rights
         administered by the Mining Granting Agency (Chapter 6) and that information from the register will
         be dealt with in accordance with the RA Mining Code and the RA Law of the Republic of Armenia on
         Freedom of Information.
         Based on interviews held within this project, it appears as if general geological information, and infor-
         mation on deposits that are not covered by mineral rights (some 1,488 reports) is open and accessible
         to the public, upon request. Information related to mineral rights, however, appears to be only partly
         accessible. Mineral rights permits, as well as summaries of information on deposits can be accessed in
         the official websites of MNP and MENR. There is, however, no systematic practice on the publication
         of contracts and license information in Armenia, and mining and exploration contracts, operational in-
         formation, and production and reserves information are not published on the grounds of commercial
         information confidentiality. However, this is likely to change in the future with Armenia joining the EITI
         (box below; also cf. section 4.1).
         Notwithstanding legal guarantees to ensure access to information, the implementation of the law
         providing for public participation and data access faces many obstacles in practice, particularly as doc-
         uments involving environmental information are not often provided by the ministries upon request,
         under the argument that they contain commercial secrets. Though the legal and regulatory guaran-
         tees are in place, there are still enforcement issues as it comes to ensuring public participation in the
         environmental decision-making process (cf. socio-economic considerations under section 7.1). Civil
         society should be the driving force in this respect, although it is within state’s responsibility to ensure
         awareness, proper consultation, and involvement of the public in the decision-making process as well
         as addressing claims and violations.

   Box: Trend towards contracts transparency
   The terms of contracts entered between States and companies in the mining and the oil and gas sec-
   tors have traditionally been protected under confidentiality clauses. In recent years, with increased
   emphasis on the role of transparency in better governance and enhanced decision-making processes
   and broader interest from civil society on the environmental, social and economic impacts of projects in
   these sectors, there is a discernible trend towards contracts transparency, with more countries making
   them available on government websites. The EITI Standard (2013) requires that EITI reports describes
   the government stand on contracts disclosure. This trend is part and parcel of a broader move towards
   open processes of decision-making and strengthening accountability.

   ly, the Open Government Partnership http://www.opengovpartnership.org


4.8.	        Recommendations
         It is proposed that a holistic policy for the sustainable development of the mineral sector is drafted.
         The development of the policy would provide a starting point for broader cooperation/interaction
         between institutions, as well as among civil society and private companies. The policy should, in ad-
         dition to identifying what the future mining sector should be like, also identify the means and mea-
         sures (technical, financial, human resources) necessary for achieving this vision. Basic questions that
         should be addressed include which type of mines (commodity, size, ownership, etc.) can meaningfully
         contribute to sustainable development goals; what economic development (national, regional, local)
         related to mining shall be promoted; what shall be the roles and responsibilities of the state and the
40                                                                Armenia: Strategic Mineral Sector Sustainability Assessment



     companies and their owners; and ‘ineligibility’ criteria for holding mineral permits.
     The Mineral Policy development can serve as a starting point for a review and further development of
     the legal framework, where development of secondary legislation is of particular importance. In this
     regard, many jurisdictions use a set of instruments such as guidelines that do not have a legal binding
     status but provide guidance for actors in the preparation of documentation required by regulations
     (e.g. EIAs, mine closure plans, community consultations, tailings management, etc.). These can be
     amended upon further experience in implementation and can ultimately serve as sources for ’tried
     and tested’ regulations at a later stage. This technique could be used in Armenia, with the goal to assist
     in the implementation of laws and regulations and in bringing in a set of ’best practice’ international
     standards both in laws, regulations and in model contracts.
     It will be important to continue activities towards EITI implementation. Thus, to make data available
     will assist to meet stakeholder demand for information and overall be useful for the EITI process. The
     EITI process can do this and that, and it will also contribute to the “increase awareness among the
     public at large”, which needs to be a longer term for policy development.
     On the part of government authorities, the legal system has over-ambitious and descriptive terms for
     decision-making, which makes processes complex and implementation difficult. On the part of inves-
     tors and other stakeholders, the legal framework is difficult to grasp and comprehend, and thus to
     adhere to. The drafting of a mineral policy needs to take this fact into consideration. In line with this,
     the development of a Road Map to guide mineral sector investors should be considered. The road map
     would assist would be investors to understand and abide by relevant legislation, application process-
     es, and institutional set ups. The road map could be developed in a process that involves all relevant
     authorities and agencies as well as private sector, and be performed after the Mineral Policy has been
     established. Not only will this process end up with a useful product, but the process itself would con-
     tribute to a better understanding by all relevant parties of the needs, requirements and challenges
     experienced by the mineral sector.
     It is not uncommon internationally that mineral and environmental legislation provides for different
     requirements for different types of mining (commodities and scale of operation). This is not the case in
     Armenia and should therefore be considered, initially by considering separate regulatory regimes for
     the metals and industrial mineral mining sectors.
     Despite the apparent sophistication of the legal framework, there are significant gaps in rules and reg-
     ulations, a lack of mechanisms for genuine inclusion and benefits for affected communities. The overall
     system should align closer with international standards on good governance in relation to environmen-
     tal and social issues. This can be achieved through expanding and strengthening regulations for the
     preparation of Social Impact Assessments, and through references and incorporation in the legislation
     of model contracts, regulations and guidelines. Community Development Agreements could be con-
     sidered, as a way in which companies and communities agree on issues related to local development,
     although these need to be consistent with an overall policy vision of the mining sector and its role in
     broader-based development.
     With regards to resettlement and associated possibilities for compensating peoples (landowners and
     land users) that are affected by mining projects, there is a need to develop legal provisions in line with
     international best practice. In this work, there is a need to ensure that mineral sector legislation is well
     streamlined with legislation that governs land holding, and expropriation related issues.
     The system for payments financial guarantees into the Nature Protection and Reclamation Fund needs
     to be revised so that mine-specific funds are tied to closure costs at any point in time of the operation
     of the mine, and also to include mechanisms to ensure that the value of the fund does not deflate due
     to factors such as inflation (c.f. section 7.5). It is noted that a draft Governmental Decision aimed at
Armenia: Strategic Mineral Sector Sustainability Assessment                                                    41



         addressing these issues, and in particular issues with the calculation of reclamation funds and fees for
         post-closure monitoring (also considering inflation factors), is being discussed among stakeholders. A
         simplification of the process for reclaiming of funds by operators is also suggested by the draft.
         In order to enhance the role that law, regulations and contracts could play in advancing the contribu-
         tion of the mining sector to sustainable development, the following actions should also be considered:
             a.	 There is a need to strengthening security of tenure (to establish clear legal entitlement for the
                 transferring of geological exploration rights to mining rights).
             b.	 Mining contracts can have an important role in bridging gaps in existing regulations, adopting
                 and aligning with best international environmental and social practice and enhancing clarity
                 and coordination of the roles of different government authorities with competence in areas
                 relevant to the mining project. The Model Mining Contract could further on this role, and set a
                 basis for clarifying and strengthening coordination between MENR and MNP. Contracts should
                 be published (in line with the current Law on Access to Information, the transparency principle
                 set out under the RA Mining Code and international practice, and the pursuance of the EITI
                 application).
             c.	 It is recommended considering introducing main rules, now established under the RA Land
                 Code, in the RA Mining Code, and to complement those by establishing and strengthening com-
                 pensation provisions, including those applicable to landholders, and including best internation-
                 al standards for cases of resettlement.
             d.	 It is proposed that that the interface between lands banned from mining in land legislation and
                 the RA Mining Code is streamlined, to clarify on the territory open to mining.

5.	        Institutions and regulatory processes

5.1.	      Overview of institutions, responsibilities and regulatory work
        The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MENR) is responsible for essentially all aspects of min-
        eral sector administration and regulation, and mineral sector policy development. Most of the offices
        within MENR are generic to governmental ministries, while 5 offices are directly involved with sector
        management, described below.
        The Mining Department is responsible for reviewing and drafting policy and legislation, and other doc-
        uments of strategic importance to the mineral sector.
        The Mining Granting Agency (MGA) was established in 2012 (through the 2012 RA Mining Code) with
        the aim to simplify the permitting process through a single contact and communications point for
        applicants (the “one window system” of the 2012 RA Mining Code). Thus, the MGA administrates
        the entire mineral permitting process and reviews expert examinations undertaken by three different
        authorities (see below: MRA, EEC & MoTAES), and recommends the granting or not of permits to the
        minister. There is no mining cadastre system at the MGA but permit information is kept in MS Excel
        sheets. The MGA has some 15 staff and they receive a total of some 20-30 mining and 20-30 explora-
        tion applications per year. The large majority of these are for non-metallic minerals.
        The Mineral Resources Agency (MRA) is responsible for reviewing and approval of reserves estima-
        tions (reserves expert examination). This function has been with the ministry since 2002, and over
        time, the MRA has become a separate agency attached to the MENR. After the completion of the
        3-year exploration permit period, reserves estimations must be submitted to the MRA even if a mining
        permit is not applied for. The MRA assesses the reserves calculations, including methodological and
        technical aspects of the calculations. Before deposit estimates are provided to the MRA, the license
        holder must subject 5% of the samples on which the reserves estimations are based to control analysis
        at the CJSC Analytical Laboratories. This is to ensure the accuracy of mineral quantities and qualities.
        Once approved, the reserves are registered with the Republican Geological Fund (see below). In ac-
        cordance with the RA Mining Code, companies should update reserves estimates every 5 years and
        submit to MRA.
        Apart from the geological assessment of reserves, an economic “cost-benefit” assessment is also con-
        ducted with a view to ensure that the exploitation will be economically beneficial (metal prices, fiscal
        regime, royalty and other relevant tax rates are taken into consideration when doing cost-benefit anal-
        ysis). Environmental costs (reclamation and mine-closure) are not included in this assessment. Key in-
        formants, however, mean that this assessment is must be looked upon as preliminary as it is not based
        on a full mine plan. A final geological and economic assessment should, however, be submitted to the
        MGA at the time of a mining permit application. There is some 9 staff at MRA, and this is regarded by
        the MRA to be sufficient as they do not get that many applications.
        The State Mining Inspectorate (SMI) controls that exploration and mining is undertaken in line with
        the contracts regarding various operational aspects and data reporting, and much focus appears to be
        placed on production rates and remaining reserves (often referred to as mineral balance). The SMI also
        reports on production rates to the tax authorities for the calculation of the natural resource use fee,
        including royalty on metallic minerals (cf. section 4.5, Environmental Fees and Guarantees).
        The regulatory basis for inspections is the Law on Inspections and there is a Governmental deci-
        sion providing the method for selecting mines for inspection. Thus, based on quarterly and annual
        “self-monitoring reports” submitted by the companies, mines are classified into high, medium and low
        risk for non-compliance based on a comparison of their reported production and reserves and what is
Armenia: Strategic Mineral Sector Sustainability Assessment                                                     43



         stipulated in the contract. About 20% of all mines are inspected each year, which translates into some
         100-120 mines each year, and 70% of these are high risk, 25% medium and 5% low risk.
         Physical on-site inspections are undertaken in accordance with a predesigned questionnaire (separate
         for exploration and mining inspections) and a 5-days notification is given. In the case of non-compli-
         ance, the company is notified, and is given 90 days to implement corrective action, unless they can
         satisfactory justify the non-compliance. A non-compliance fine of USD100-300 can be issued in ac-
         cordance with the Law on Administrative Violations, and the MSI can furthermore request the MENR
         to annul the mining contract if appropriate corrective action is not taken. According to the SMI, over
         the last year, 2-3 non-metal mines contracts have been annulled, a total some USD4,000 were paid in
         fines, and some 17 companies were taken to court. The main types of non-compliances are failure to
         meet the production rates stipulated by the contract, and incomplete reporting.
         Prior to 2009, all inspections were undertaken by an inspectorate under the MNP, which then was split
         into the SMI under MENR and the environmental inspectorate under the MNP. The SMI has a total 38
         staff under four divisions and four regional centres.
         The Republican Geological Fund, SNCO (RGF) is essentially a repository for historical geological data
         and information; exploration and mining company reports; minerals reserves data compilations, and;
         exploration and mining contracts. Geological investigations undertaken during and before the time
         of the Soviet Republic (since the 19th century) has resulted in that significant amounts of data and
         information is now held and managed by the RGF. This information includes regional geological in-
         vestigations and so called mine reports. Mine reports describe individual mineral deposits and can be
         extensive (e.g. several hundred pages, and including maps) and there are some 1,200 such reports.
         All information is today stored in hardcopy. In part due to a lack of a proper storage environment for
         document preservations, steps are taken towards digitization of the materials held by the RGF. The
         USAID provides assistance in this area, and the RGF are currently producing so called mineral deposit
         passports; summary mine reports of at least 12 pages, which have been digitized and posted on the
         MENR homepage.
         The RGF is mainly responsible for storing data and information, and providing access upon request (see
         below). Furthermore, they are charged with amalgamating reserves data (from exploration project re-
         serves, verified by the MRA and annual company reports on production and remaining reserves data)
         to annually produce national mineral reserves balance sheets (see box below).
         There are 14 staff at the RGF, and numbers and staff qualifications are considered to be adequate con-
         sidering that highly qualified staff is not needed for the current tasks of mainly storing of information.
         The environment for storing documents, however, needs to be improved to ensure their longer term
         preservation. Also, capacity building is likely to be needed if/when data and information is digitized,
         and stored and handled electronically.
44                                                                   Armenia: Strategic Mineral Sector Sustainability Assessment




     Box: Why the use of national mineral balances?
     In Armenia, the authorities record deposits’ initial reserves and update these on a yearly basis to keep
     track of the remaining reserve (the balance) after the extraction of a certain amount of ore. This is
     monitored for individual mines, but the data is also amalgamated to produce national mineral balanc-
     es – i.e. data on total production and remaining reserves in Armenia for individual commodities. The
     rationale for this practise is apparently that balance data is necessary for the State to develop short- and
     long-term socio-economic programs and, in general, for the development of economic and industrial
     policies.
     Knowing the amount of reserves for individual deposit is of interest to inform and attract potential
     investors. Furthermore, it may be of interest for the authorities (and not only to the company) to be
     informed about the medium- / long-term outlook for individual operating mines in terms of their level
     and nature of operation, which could have a bearing on economic and socioeconomic development
     programs. However, the usefulness of a national minerals balance for strategic planning is questionable
     for at least four main reasons:
     First and foremost because it fits poorly into a liberalised economy, where the state has no role as a
     mineral producer. In such a liberal economic system, the state’s role is one of regulating the activities
     in question, and in ensuring that the private sector abides by laws, regulations and agreements made.
     Second, because it is questionable that credible data for a national balance can be established at all.
     This in turn follows as true national reserves are always unknown, as exploration is merely scratching
     the surface of the Earth, and also are conducted in a very limited geographical space. Furthermore,
     whether or not reserves are economic and amenable for extraction is subject to a range of factors, and
     thus highly uncertain to predict.
     Third, the reserves that are form part of the national Armenian balance today were to a great extent
     established in the past when methods and evaluation techniques were inferior to the ones that are in
     use today.
     Fourth, and finally, there are no provisions in policy or legislation for how the mineral reserves balances
     information should be used, and there is also no policy document stating the purpose of attempting to
     keep track of the national reserves balance for individual minerals.
     In conclusion, the Armenian state could reconsider its concern with keeping track of mineral reserves.
     This type of work is commonly the concern of the mining companies, whereas the government’s focus
     should be on policy and actions that facilitate the sustainable running of mines, and that stimulate min-
     eral exploration by qualified companies to define new reserves.
     In Armenia, mineral resources and reserves are classified and reported in accordance with the Russian
     system, which in turn is based on the old Soviet system. Conversion between the Russian system and
     international systems such as JORC and NI34-101 is essentially a technicality and a system for alignment
     of the two has been developed together by Russian experts and Committee for Mineral Reserves Inter-
     national Reporting Standards (ref). Companies that calculate resources and reserves using international
     systems are required by the authorities to report these also according to the Russian model.


         Summarising the above, apart from its work in policy development, it is clear that MENR devotes most
         of its resources to keeping track of mineral balances and assessing permit applications and inspecting
         companies to verify reserves and production rates, as well as to the administration of the mineral
         licensing process. In other countries, these functions are quite often performed by one institution,
         usually termed the mineral inspectorate. Overall, it is questionable how efficiently the strong focus

         and significant human resources directed towards reserves verifications and approvals and inspections
         help to develop a sustainable mineral sector.
         The Ministry of Nature Protection (MNP) is responsible for all aspects of policy development and im-
         plementation for environmental protection and rational use of natural resources in Armenia. With
         regards to the environmental regulation and supervision of the mineral sector, three areas of activities
         are of importance: Review of EIA for mineral projects; environmental inspections, and; regional envi-
         ronmental monitoring.
         The Environmental Impact Expertise Centre (EIEC) performs the expert examination of EIA for explo-
         ration and mining projects, which is part of the permit application documents submitted to the MENR
         – MGA (the “one-window” or “one-stop-shop”). The EIEC perceives the “one-stop-shop” to hamper
         their work as much communication with the applicant must go through the MGA, the point of contact
         for the company. The EIEC also claim that collaboration with the MGA is not functioning well as dis-
         agreements are common with lengthy discussions as a result. EIEC’s decision on the EIA expert exam-
         ination can, nevertheless, not be overruled by the MGA.
         There is some 16 staff at the EIEC. While the new 2014 EIA Law requires social aspects to be included in
         the assessment, there is no staff holding social qualifications at the EIEC, and such expertise are invited
         from other institutions, and international organizations for expert advice.
         The State Environmental Inspectorate is responsible for controlling the environmental performance of
         all industry in Armenia. Thus they inspect mining operations for environmental compliance.
         The Environmental Impact Monitoring Centre regularly samples water, air and sediment across Ar-
         menia and analyse the samples in their own laboratories. The sampling site network include several
         locations that are strategically positioned for assessing impacts from mining activities on the natural
         environment. The laboratory houses modern equipment such as an ICP-MS quadrupole, and labora-
         tory proficiency testing shows overall good precision of the analytical results. There are, nevertheless,
         room for much improvement as the premises are so run down that it is not possible to keep a stable
         and clean environment. Furthermore, work procedures are not in accordance with laboratory stan-
         dards as, for example, there is little or no use of laboratory clothing, dust depressors, etc. to reduce
         the possibility for contamination. Finally, the data itself is not organized in a proper database where it
         can be retrieved easily and quickly. Thus, apart from the centre’s own yearly state of the environment
         reports, the data appears to be little used.
         Overall, a key issue at the MNP seem to be a lack of human as well as technical capacity. Thus, the
         implementation of the new EIA Law is likely to be challenging.
         The Ministry of Emergency Situations (MES) is responsible for the safety expert examination of mining
         permit applications and they do, as such, have a very important role in being the authority responsible
         for the assessment of the technical and safety aspects of tailings dams (cf. Chapter 8). Despite good at-
         tempts within this project, it has not been possible to establish knowledge levels, responsibilities, and
         work procedures for the above within this project. From discussions with key informants it appears,
         however, as if the required knowledge level with regards to tailings dams construction and manage-
         ment do not exist among Armenian governmental institutions.


5.2.	        Mineral rights and EIA application process
         With the RA Mining Code 2012, the process for the application for mineral rights was changed so that
         the Mining Granting Agency, as a separate division of the MENR, functions as what is common referred
         to as a “one-stop-shop” (Figure 5.1). Thus, as mentioned above, the MGA receives the applications,
         sends relevant parts to other authorities for expert examinations, reviews the result of these examina-

      tions, and finally recommends the outcome to the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources.
      Applications for mining rights are subject to two expert examinations (environmental and technical
      safety), while the expert examination for approval of established reserves for further extraction is per-
      formed during the last stage of the exploration phase (after the exploration has been completed). In
      the past, exploration applications were not subject to expert examinations, while the recent change in
      EIA Law (2014) incorporated the concept of ”preliminary EIA” for geological exploration.

 Figure 5.1. Mineral permit application process with MENR (essentially MGA) performing the function as the
 “one-stop-shop” and with expert examinations performed by three different offices (note: the MRA expert ex-
 amination of reserves is not part of the mining permit application but is completed prior to that, at the end of
 geological exploration).

      Applications for exploration permits are processed in the following stages:
         •	 Within 10 days after registration of application, MENR delegates the MGA to review the geologi-
            cal exploration work plan and submit the application to the Ministry of Nature Protection (MNP)
            for reviewing of the preliminary EIA and environmental plan;
         •	 Within 15 days after receiving the environmental plan, MNP shall provide their conclusion on
            the assessment to the MGA;
         •	 Within up to 60 days after receiving a positive conclusion, the MGA prepares and submits pack-
            age of relevant documents to MENR for the Minister’s approval.
      For mining permit applications, the following steps apply:
         •	 The Ministry delegates to the MGA to review the application for completeness. Within 10 days
            after the registration of application, the MGA delegates expert examinations to the relevant
            authorities (Figure 6.1), including:

                     reality done at the end (after 3 years) of a company’s exploration permit, while the estimates
                     are included in the mining permit application.
             •	 The EIA examination must be concluded within 100 days, and the technical safety examination
                must be concluded within 60 days;
             •	 In the case assessment results are not provided within those dates, conclusions are considered
                positive and the relevant expert examination institutions are held responsible according to law;
             •	 Within up to 180 days after receiving a positive expert examination conclusion, the MGA re-
                views the conclusions and prepares and submits the package with relevant documents to the
                MENR for the Minister’s approval.
         According to the above timeline, the whole process of assessing a mining permit application can take
         up to 1 year. However, this appears not be too streamlined with some specific requirements of the EIA
         process. Based on interviews at the MNP, the following EIA process is envisaged:
             a.	 Public notice, and public hearing.
             b.	 Company prepares initial technical documentation,
             c.	 Stage 1 (initial) assessment; maximum 30 days during which the MNP prepares the Terms of
                 Reference for the full EIA, including a list of stakeholders to be consulted. A second public hear-
                 ing is held during Stage 1, organized by the MNP.
             d.	 The company prepares the full EIA. Looking at mining projects globally, this may take anything
                 from 1 year and more. A third public hearing is held during the preparation of the EIA, organized
                 by the proponent.
             e.	 Stage 2 (main) assessment; maximum 60 days during which the MNP examines the EIA and pro-
                 vides a conclusion. The main EIA is a complete assessment, including alternatives, justifications
                 and cumulative considerations. A fourth public hearing is held during the Stage 2 assessment,
                 organized by the MNP with participation of territorial administration bodies from target com-
                 munities and the head of community.
         While the effective time for the assessment of a mining permit application would be about 1 year, the
         whole process from the first public hearing to a final permit granting would be substantially longer.
         Our observation is that times for review and approval are normal by international comparison, or even
         short, faced with the complexities of relatively large metal mining project. Non-metal mining project
         applications, on the other hand, are not likely to require the same detail and time for examinations.
         Furthermore, to hold four public hearings is not unusual, and during the time a company prepares an
         EIA, even more public participation than a couple of public hearings should be expected (according to
         international best practise).
         Interviewed officers at the MENR commonly perceive what they regard as a high number of public
         hearings as a problem, and that the EIA process is so time consuming that it negates the basic purpose
         of the “one-stop-shop”, that is to facilitate quick application review and processing. As mentioned
         above, on the other hand, officers at the MNP perceives the “one-stop-shop” as a problem as it to
         some extent prevents the MNP to communicate directly with the applicants, and there are also com-
         monly disagreements between MENR and MNP in the decision-making process.

5.3.	      Recommendations
        It is proposed that the amalgamation of the MGA, MRA and the SMI into one institution is considered.
        While these institutions today are charged with different tasks, their functions overlap and could be
        better coordinated within one institution. For increased efficiency and transparency, it is furthermore
        recommended that a modern computerized mining cadastre system is established within such an in-
        stitution, holding information on permits, production, compliance, etc. This would replace todays sep-
        arate non-computerized systems and also mean that information does not need to be submitted to,
        and housed by RGF.
        Within this new function, the abandoning of tight control of production rates and mineral reserves
        should also be considered to free resources for other purposes and functions.
        Related to the recommendation under chapter 2 on the collection of geological data and information,
        the establishment of a geological survey function should be considered, which apart from collecting
        new data could make use of the abundance of old data and information. Such a function would be
        fundamental to promoting the opportunities for mineral exploration in Armenia.
        The “one-stop-shop” concept has increased in popularity across the globe in the last 10 years. How-
        ever, the effectiveness of the entire system depends on the performance of different offices involved.
        Mechanisms for better collaboration and increasing the understanding between MENR and MNP with
        regards to each other’s importance and purpose of work need to be explored. This could for a start
        emerge through a common development of a mineral policy, as discussed in the preceding chapter.
        Finally, capacity building is recommended, in particular for mining environmental and social manage-
        ment. This includes both technical and human capacity, and with regards to government at both the
        federal and marz levels.

6.	          Economic analysis

6.1.	        Introduction
         Armenia was one of the first post-Soviet countries to achieve positive economic growth after having
         experienced severe economic problems during the early years after independence. In 1991, the GDP
         per capita was around USD600, whereas four years later it had decreased to USD500. After these diffi-
         cult years followed a period of economic growth, which was accompanied by liberalization, as well as
         by substantial official development assistance.
         The late 1990s saw major structural changes in the economy. Industry, which in 1990 accounted for
         45% of GDP, constituted only 28% in 1995. Armenia lost much of its industrial capacity during this
         time, and the economy instead became more heavily based on agriculture and trade. These major
         changes caused corresponding shifts in employment, and also increased unemployment. In the late
         1990s, most of the privatization efforts had been completed. At the turn of the millennium, the GDP
         per capita was USD621.
         As a result of reforms and due to positive world economy dynamics, possibilities for accelerated eco-
         nomic growth emerged in the beginning of the 21st century. Thus, during 2001-2008 Armenia’s real
         GDP grew by more than 11% annually, and the country was referred to as the “Caucasian Tiger”. The
         main driving forces of the economy at this time was the construction sector, which in turn comprised
         government initiated infrastructural projects (involving Diaspora related funds), and private invest-
         ments in real estate development, mainly in Yerevan. Remittances from Armenians working abroad
         were also important, and these comprised as much as 18% of total GDP in 2007, compared to just
         4.5% in 2000. In spite of various structural problems, the standard of life improved considerably and
         in the beginning of the financial crises (2008) GDP per capita in Armenia reached its highest level at
         USD3,858.
         The financial and economic crisis of 2008-2009 affected Armenia severely, and it was among the coun-
         tries with highest GDP decline (14.2% in 2009). The major reason for the deep recession was an ex-
         cessive reliance on construction sector. To overcome negative consequences of the crises, the Govern-
         ment of RA conducted expansionary fiscal policy in order to boost aggregate demand. As a result, the
         economy started its recovery in the years that followed but the implementation of such a policy came
         at a cost of substantial increase in external debt. A longer term result of the crises was a shift in the
         economy, where construction lost a large part of its input in GDP, where the economy became more
         diversified, and where industries input as well as input of other sectors in GDP started to increase.


6.2.	        The mineral sectors importance
         The minerals sector is an important part of the Armenian economy. During the last 14 years, mining
         and quarrying sector has on average contributed 2.2% to overall GDP directly (Figure 6.1). In recent
         years, of the average annual real growth rate of 3.3% over 2013-2015, 0.4 percentage points (or about
         12% of the growth rate) was attributable to the mining sector. Also in terms of productivity, the mining
         sector outperforms other industrial activities; according to 2010-2014 average indicators, the mining
         sector is responsible for 9.2% of the total industry employment, whereas it contributes to more than
         16.7% of industrial output3. The sector has also been able to attract tangible foreign investment, most
         notably in the period 2004-2007 when Cronimet GmbH invested in the acquisition and modernisation

     of ZCMC but also in 2012 when investments were made by Vallex to start the Teghut mine (Figure 6.2).
     Mining and its downstream metal production is the main foreign currency earner for the Armenian
     economy. During 2006-2014, around one third of total merchandise export was attributable either
     to mining and downstream production activities. Annual USD inflows from exports have been in the
     region of USD 500 million during the past 5 years (Figure 6.3).

         Mining companies are also significant job providers, especially so as they can offer comparatively high-
         ly paid jobs outside of Yerevan. In 2014, 7,057 people were employed in the metallic mining sector,
         representing 90% of total employment in overall minerals sector, which in turn equalled around 10%
         of those employed in the industrial branch of the economy. Their average wage in 2014 is reported
         to have been AMD 328,000. On average during 2010-2014, the mean wage in the mining sector was
         about 67% higher than the mean wage in the private sector.

        Non-metal mining companies, are less important for the economy. In this sub-sector the companies
        are smaller and, more numerous but also more widespread across the country. Average number of
        workers in metallic mining companies is 784 (9 companies are reported to have operated in 2014),
        whereas non-metallic mining had on average only 13 employees. The economic value of the total out-
        put of non-metallic mining is less than 5% of the sector’s overall output (Figure 6.4).

6.3.	      Fiscal regime (taxes and royalties)
        The two main types of direct taxes are Corporate Income Tax (Profit tax) and Personal Income Tax (In-
        come tax). The former is levied at 20% on taxable profits, whereas Income tax is applied with progres-
        sive rates, with average rate around 25%4. Value added tax (VAT) is the main indirect tax with rate of
        20%. Table 6.1 summarizes the structure of government tax revenues by types during 2010-2014, and
        there are a few tendencies worth highlighting. The share of indirect taxes has been decreasing, where-
        as among direct taxes, environmental fees (which include also royalties, see below) and personal in-
        come taxes are increasing. Finally, overall tax collection, as measured with tax to GDP ratio has been
        improving, which is thought to be due to higher tax compliance through improved tax administration.
        Apart from a limited number of import duty exemptions related to machinery and equipment, the
        tax rules and regulations for mining companies are the same as applied to other industries. However,
        mining projects pay royalties on production. In Armenia, the royalty percentage has a floor of 4% and
        rises (with no upper ceiling) in relation to the profitability of the operation, according to the following
        formula:
        R = 4 + (P / (S x 8)) x 100, where
        R – royalty percentage rate.
        P – Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT, if negative zero is applied), excluding losses carried for-
        ward from previous years.
        S – revenue from the sale of products net of VAT.


   4	 Personal Income tax marginal rates are: 24.4% for income less than AMD 120,000 (as of December 2015 – around USD
250), 26% for income above AMD 120,000 and 36% for income above AMD 2,000,000.

         The royalty applied is an annual tax with quarterly prepayments based on previous year revenue/
         price pattern5. The base for calculating the fixed part of the royalty is the purchase agreement at the
         time the product is provided (price deductions for moisture or physical impurities are not taken into
         account, and final volumes can be no more than two percent less than initial reported volumes). Im-
         portantly, prices on which royalties are based may not differ by more than 10% from international pric-
         es based on LME data (Article 18, Law on Natural Resource Use and Environmental Protection Fees).
         The system for calculating royalty is, comparing to many mining countries, somewhat complex as it
         includes a profitability component. For example, a simple royalty applied solely as a percentage to rev-
         enues is easier to administrate, whereas royalties with profit based variable component require closer
         scrutiny and can expose tax revenues to risks of profit under-reporting (using transfer pricing or any
         other tax avoidance technique). It is worth noting that a royalty that is at least partly based on value of
         sales (such as in Armenia) means that royalties are payable even when there is zero profits accruing to
         a company, or even when such a company is making a loss (see Figure 6.5).




    5	 In particular, if prices deviate by more than 20% prepayments should be scaled up or down by the same factor as the
price deviation is.

      Mining sector and its downstream and supporting activities are important contributors to public rev-
      enues. Thus, Table 6.2 show how during 2012-2014, the mining sector provided on average 4.8% of
      overall taxes, and 8.2% of direct taxes collected by the government. When accounting for downstream
      and supporting activities these figures are even higher. Thus, for a country where mining sector’s con-
      tribution to GDP is less than 3%, the tax contributions from the sector are comparatively high.

      A comparison with tax rates in with countries having similar mining sector structure shows that Ar-
      menia’s is positioned at an average, medium level (Figure 6.6). This is a result of the fact that whereas
      the corporate profit tax rate in Armenia is comparatively low, this is offset by a higher royalty rate. In
      particular, the 4% fixed part of the royalty rate is higher than in many countries. For example, in South
      Africa where very similarly royalty rate mechanism is applied, fixed element of the royalty rate is 0.5%
      and there is also a ceiling on highest possible rate (5% of refined output and 7% for unrefined one). In
      countries which use only a fixed element of the royalty, it varies from 3 to 6 percent (e.g. Kyrgyzstan,
Armenia: Strategic Mineral Sector Sustainability Assessment                                                                        55



         Kazakhstan, Ghana, Tanzania, Zambia). As Figure 6.5 demonstrates, even moderate profitability rates
         bring Armenian royalty rate to high levels6, and it demonstrates how the relative tax burden increases
         when the profitability drops (this reflects the fact that mining companies still have to pay royalties out
         of revenues even if the profitability of operations is low or even negative).




 Figure 6.6. Tax (royalty + CIT) to turnover ratio for selected countries, estimation based on application of stat-
 utory tax rates; Armenia (2020) is based on a previous proposal for increased royalty rate, see text for further
 explanation). The calculations are made under some specific assumptions on profitability using the maximum
 tax rates for each tax type for the countries considered. The calculations are indicative and they ignore any
 kind of complications associated with adjustments to revenues and profits, which are usually required by law.
 According to these estimations Armenia’s statutory tax burden is close to the mean of the countries considered
 (12.2% of sales/revenues). Assumptions: Profit to revenue ratio = 0.3. Maximum rates are applied for all coun-
 tries apart from Peru, where mean of available rates on royalties is considered. Type of ore: copper. Source:

         It is also important to identify specific features of the taxation system that might create problems for
         the efficient application. Thus, one of the elements of the royalty tax system disputed by the mining
         companies is the rule of maximum 10% deviation of contract (invoice) prices from LME official quota-
         tions. A typical contract applied traditionally within the industry is based on LME price for the concen-
         trate. At the same time, it envisages deductions to acknowledge that to obtain final product the buyer
         still has to incur certain expenditures. Major elements of these expenditures are Treatment charges
         and Refinery charges (TC/RC). Review of international practice suggests that TC/RC are negotiated an-
         nually between miners and smelters. There is very limited publicly available data on TC/RC relationship
         with metal prices. According to estimates of TC/RC share in copper price reported by ”CRU Analysis”, a
         mining sector consulting company, during 2004-2008 the indicator varied from 5 to 20%7. Data on typ-
         ical TC/RC provided by an Armenian mining company suggest that TC/RC can be as high as 16% when
         prices for 24% copper concentrate are USD 5,000, and TC/RC drop to 11% when prices are as high as
         USD 7,500. According to Armenian practice, TC/RC includes also transportation costs which double the

        rates presented in the previous sentence. While we do not find evidence in international experience
        on inclusion of transportation expenses in TC/RC, this issue requires additional scrutiny in Armenian
        legislation and regulatory practice. But even if transportation issue is ignored, it seems that 10% max-
        imum deduction envisaged by the regulation puts the mining companies in difficult situation when
        prices are not very high. Moreover, the current regulations do not make it explicit that 10% deviation is
        meant for consideration of TC/RC in the contracts. There is a concern that mining companies interpret
        this regulation as an allowance threshold for such charges. To put it differently, the issue is not in the
        statutory formulation of the regulations, but in the perceived economic rationale behind such a clause.
        Sometimes countries choose to apply ring-fencing of mining projects. Ring-fencing refers to applica-
        tion of tax rules on a license-by-license basis, such that the costs attributed to one mining project are
        not used to offset the profits from another, as would be allowable where taxes are calculated on a
        consolidated group basis. Ring-fencing prevents companies from reducing or deferring income taxes
        on a profitable mine by offsetting the profits of one mine with the costs of the other. While Armenian
        legislation does not seem to have ring-fencing requirements, a detailed analysis of ownership of gold
        and copper-molybdenum metal mines in Armenia reveals that each mine is operated as a separate le-
        gal entity even if it is a part of a larger group8. Thus, currently, the need for ring fencing is not an urgent
        issue, although the possibility of companies choosing to structure or restructure in such ways that it
        becomes a necessity should be anticipated and planned for.
        Another issue that could potentially decrease tax payments from mining companies is the absence of
        transfer pricing rules. While this is a general issue for any sector, but is specifically important for re-
        source extracting companies, which are more often supplying to their affiliates. The draft of the RA Tax
        Code includes a section on transfer pricing rules, which is meant to limit level of discretion available to
        the companies. According to preliminary statements, it will come into force in January 2018.
        The initial draft RA Tax Code envisaged an increase in the fixed part of the royalty, from 4% to 5% in
        2018, and to 6% in 2020. As figure 6.6 suggests, that would shift Armenia to the group of countries
        with highest tax rates. Such measures could cause significant problems for mining companies. It is
        important to recognize that large mining companies have a systematic role in the Armenian economy
        and financial problems in this sector may contaminate the banking sector, whereas possible laydown
        of employees will cause distress for the areas where the companies are operating. The most recent
        version of the draft RA Tax Code, however, does not suggest any changes to the royalty rate.


6.4.	       Assessment of revenues
        The analysis of the mining sector is based on data on the main mining and downstream companies of
        Armenia (Table 6.4). These companies are all among the 1000 major taxpayers, and data are therefore
        available in the reports published by the Tax Service of the Ministry of Finance.
        On average during 2010-2014, these companies have paid annually USD115 million or 5.2% of total
        tax revenues of the country. Figure 6.7 present the structures of taxes by industry profiles and by type
        of taxes. Thus, it shown that royalty payments have increased since 2012. Further, in spite of negative
        price dynamics in 2013 they continue to increase. Whereas commodity prices in 2014 are roughly at
        the same level as they were in 2010, but both royalties and direct taxes paid are considerably higher
        in 2014. This demonstrates how the change in the tax regime of 2012 has increased public revenues
        from the sector.

     It is noteworthy that Armenia’s mining sector is not just characterized by relatively high taxation rate,
     but the actual tax contributions to the economy are also quite high compared with other countries
     (see Figure 6.8, with data from 2013).




Figure 6.8. Actual tax contributions and contributions to GDP for selected countries in 2013 (if not indicated
otherwise). Although focusing just on one year is somewhat problematic, data constraints prohibits a more
comprehensive cross-country comparison. When solid fill bar (tax contribution of mining sector to overall
taxes collected) is higher than the no fill bar (share of mining sector in GDP) it indicates that tax collected
from mining sector are relatively higher than taxes collected from the overall economy average.

     One major concern regarding the contributions from the mining sector is the great reliance on ZCMC.
     Thus, ZCMC was profitable during this period, and it accounted for about 60% of turnover of all ac-
     tive mining companies during 2010-2014. As for total taxes paid by mining companies, ZCMC’s share
     during the same period was even higher (66%). Generally, company concentration of tax contributions
     depends on two things – size effect and profitability effect. While it is clear that major portion of this
     high tax share stems from the size effect, it is also important to understand whether profit making
     pattern of ZCMC also differs from other companies. This is of particular importance, because current
     royalty rate directly incorporates profitability into its formula.
     A profitability analysis (profit calculated for taxation purposes to revenue ratio) conducted on data pro-
     vided by Ministry of Finance reveals that in fact loss making is a common pattern for the metal mining
     companies. Thus, of the total 14 operational mines, 8 have been running at an amalgamated loss over
     the period 2010-2014, and most of these have been making a loss each individual year. These types of
     mines, in particular after consecutive years of making a loss, need cash in-put to be kept in operation.
     Part of the explanation for this pattern may be that the owners seek to promote the project for selling
     or for investment into further work on extending reserves.
     Some mining companies have voiced concern over the effects of the present royalty regime, claiming
     that it is excessively onerous. We have used available data to assess the effect of the changes made
     (Figure 6.9). Volatility in profits and the short time period that has passed since the new mining code
     was enacted in 2012, makes it somewhat difficult to make empirical analysis of what the change in
Armenia: Strategic Mineral Sector Sustainability Assessment                                                      59



         royalty burden after 2012 has meant. However, Figure 6.9 demonstrates that the effective royalty rate
         (for profitable companies, including ZCMC) was higher in 2013-2014 compared with 2010-2011. And
         this is in spite of decreasing copper and gold prices.




 Figure 6.9. Effective royalty rates (right panel) in 2010-2014. Source: Ministry of Finance and Consultant’s esti-
 mations.


         In order to overcome data inconsistency problem in analysing the royalty burden change in 2012, we
         have applied 2013 production data (actually produced metal structure and actual prices) to different
         profitability rates. Thus, in Figure 6.10 it is shown that largest difference between the two royalty re-
         gimes is observed at 25% profitability. In Figure 6.9, it is shown that the effective royalty rate for the
         mining sector excluding ZCMC was about 7%, which corresponds roughly to 24% of profitability rate.
         Note that under the old regime royalty rate would be just 3.64% (Figure 6.10). In terms of 2013 actual
         data, under the new regime USD28 million would be collected, about double the USD14 million which

6.5.	      Assessment of revenue and job creation potential of new projects
        Predictions of medium-term future developments depend on the successful implementation of Teghut
        mine project (which started in 2015) and the Amulsar Gold mine project. Due to operationalization of
        Teghut mine around 1,400 jobs were created in 2015. According to existing plans, Amulsar mine will
        offer 770 additional jobs.
        These two projects will also generate considerable tax revenues for the government. The Amulsar Gold
        Project is projected to be among the top 5 corporate taxpayers in Armenia, generating annually on
        average approximately USD50 million in taxes. As for Teghut mine, based on profitability assumptions
        presented in the technical documentation for the project after first years of operations and closer to
        full capacity the project will be paying around USD13.4 million profit tax, personal income tax and
        royalties. Though Teghut mine pays annually less taxes, its estimated life of the mine is more than
        20 years, whereas for Amulsar project it is around 10 years. Figure 8.11 summarizes the expected
        additional effect of these projects on current tax contributions and employment level of the metallic
        mining. It is important to emphasize here that these are just direct revenue and employment medi-
        um-term effects of the planned mining projects, but the overall benefits are going to be considerably
        more significant due to indirect and induced effects of the operations. Extent of these effects are fur-
        ther discussed in the next section of the report.

6.6.	        Potential for economic linkages
         The contribution of the mining sector to the economy goes beyond direct or nominal impacts discussed
         in preceding sections. Its impact on the economy is larger through the multiplier effects. Appendix 1
         presents some details of the methodology applied to derive indirect effects of the mining on the GDP,
         employment and other important macroeconomic variables. But the basic idea behind indirect effects
         is the attempt to account for the following main aspects: first, to produce its output, mining sector
         acquires products and services from other sectors of the economy and this creates additional demand
         for those sectors; second, income accruing to employees and in some cases to shareholders of the
         mines is spend on local products and services again creating additional demand for the remaining
         sectors of the economy; and third and finally, income earned by other sectors as a result of providing
         inputs to mining sector is also spent creating additional demand.
         Thus, using an Input-Output model (developed by AVAG Solutions) output, gross value added and em-
         ployment multipliers in other sectors due to increase of output in the mining sector re estimated. For
         the mining sector of Armenia, GDP multiplier is estimated at level of 1.8 and employment multiplier is
         5.3. Though it is important to underline here that the employment multiplier is based only on indirect
         effects and not the induced effects. In other words, it takes into account additional employment due
         to purchases of the mining sector, but not the ones generated by spending of the additional income
         generated in the economy. This imperfection is due to level of details that the social accounting matrix
         of Armenia provides. Note that the mining sector GDP multiplier estimated for Armenia is compara-
         ble to what is observed in other countries (e.g. in Tanzania it is estimated to be between 1 and 2, in
         South Africa it is 2.7, whereas in Australia it is equal to 1.6). By using these multipliers, the overall
         economic contribution of the mining sector to Armenian economy can be evaluated. Results of such
         estimates for 2013 are summarized in Figure 6.12 below. Overall contribution of mining sector to the
         GDP was above 4% and employment generated by the mining sector together with its indirect impact
         was above 42,000. As it can be inferred from the figure, structure of indirect contribution for GDP and
         employment have similar pattern – with industry and construction sectors bearing the largest share of
         indirect positive externalities from the mining sector.

Input-output Model developed by AVAG Solutions. Notes: Agriculture’s employment is over-estimated due to prob-
lems associated with statistics of employment in that sector. In particular, according to current methodology used
by National Statistical Service number of people employed in agriculture is considerably overestimated, which
translates into the Social Accounting matrix used by the Input-Output model.

       The discussion above represents overall linkages and effects within the economy. A number of issues
       requires additional consideration.
       Armenia has educated workforce which calls for comparatively limited involvement of expatriate em-
       ployees and usually at the mine construction and mining inception stages. Thus, for the Amulsar Gold
       mining project, only 5% of workforce are planned to be expatriates and this number is planned to
       decrease considerably after the first years of operations. Large involvement of local workforce creates
       favourable economic environment for the communities as spending occurs within the same area or at
       least within the same country.
       The overwhelming part of business and financial services, as well as services associated with mine op-
       erations are acquired by mining companies locally. The natural limitation is associated with impossibil-
       ity to buy locally produced machinery and equipment for the mines. There doesn’t seem to be a room
       for any production of supplies even in the long-term perspective due to small size of the Armenian
       mining sector compared with world metallic mining output.
Armenia: Strategic Mineral Sector Sustainability Assessment                                                      63



         Possibilities of downstream production development are also limited. Current tendency is that large
         smelters are being used. Thus in China, 62% of copper smelters have capacity of 200 thousand tonnes
         per annum and larger and this is around 3 times bigger than Armenia’s annual copper production9.
         Further, poor connectivity makes Armenia an implausible destination for the smelting of ores from
         other countries.
         By paying relatively high wages, mining creates favourable environment for local SMEs operating in
         trade and services sectors. Recent mining projects (like Teghut and Amulsar) are being implemented
         with considerable liaisons with local community representatives and real input by the companies in
         developing infrastructure in those communities (healthcare, education, more advanced agricultural
         technologies). This creates spill-overs that boost local SMEs.
         Indirect contribution to GDP by the mining sector generates also additional tax revenues. In practice
         this means to take account of taxes collected from additional GDP generated due to activities of mining
         sector. We have applied tax to GDP ratio to indirect GDP increase obtained from input-output model
         to obtain an estimate of taxes generated from indirect economic effects of mining sector. On average
         during 2010-2014 tax revenues flowing from these indirect economic effects of mining are estimated
         to be more than USD40 million annually or almost 2% of total taxes collected (Figure 6.13). Note that
         taxes collected indirectly presented in the figure include contributions by downstream and supporting
         industries.

6.7.	        Financial data and transparency concerns
         In this assignment, we have had the benefit of being able to use data obtained from the Ministry of
         Finance. Comparisons of this data with other data that is available provide examples for the difficulties
         that exist in interpreting financial data related to mining activities. With regards to data profitability,

        taxes and royalties paid, we may compare Ministry data with data drawn from mining companies fi-
        nancial reporting. In Armenia, this is essentially only possible to do for Dundee Precious Metals, as this
        is a publically listed company, which required to supply rather extensive information on their opera-
        tions. In this, they are at the moment in a unique position in Armenia, where it is much more difficult
        to obtain information about other mining companies operating.
        Table 6.5 demonstrates how different can be the information supplied in company reports and official
        data. These difference may arise both due to methodological and definitional differences, that need
        to be understood. In this specific example the difference in 2014 royalties and turnover data reported
        can arise due to different treatment of taxable revenue by the company and by the government. For
        example, according to Armenian regulations the contract price for mining output sold cannot deviate
        from London metal exchange prices by more than 10%, whereas in international practice deductible
        charges can be more than 10%. With profit data it is even more complicated, as profit for tax purposes
        and profit reported in financial statements may differ to the extent of allowable deductions and ex-
        penses. The application of a transparency framework (e.g. EITI) could indirectly lead to convergence of
        various approaches to financial reporting used by both government and companies.

6.8.	      Recommendations
        The mining sector along with its downstream production and supporting services is an important con-
        tributor to public revenues. It is important to maintain enabling business environment and ensure
        stability of the sector under volatile commodity prices. In this regard, fiscal regime of the mining sector
        should be aimed at striking a balance between adequate taxation level of the sector and maintaining
        favourable business environment for current and prospective investment projects. At the same time
        taxation should take into account social costs of mining. Tax provisions should be approached with
        some degree of flexibility in order to account for unfavourable long-term developments in commodity
        markets.
        The mining sector is characterised by a high concentration rate, with only major players having steady
        profitability rates. The development of regulations and tax policies for the sector must be based on an
        awareness of this fact. Tax policy could be calibrated with special consideration for some smaller and
Armenia: Strategic Mineral Sector Sustainability Assessment                                                      65



         medium sized companies (SMEs) bearing in mind, however, that actual metal mining and processing
         is usually not a sector suitable for SME involvement due to the requirement for longer term manage-
         ment and stewardship, and access to considerable resources and funds (c.f. Section 9.5).
         Further increase in the royalty rate as previously planned by the initial draft RA Tax Code could consid-
         erably decrease returns on investment in the mining sector. Such changes would shift Armenia to the
         countries with highest tax rates, at the same time it needs to be acknowledged that Armenia is not
         a country with low production costs. In accordance with the most recent version of the draft RA Tax
         Code, it is recommended that the royalty rate remains unchanged.
         Current regulation of treatment charges and refinement charges (TC/RC) is not clear. In particular, final
         contract (invoice) prices can deviate from LME prices at most by 10%, but the analysis of international
         practice suggest that these charges can vary from 5% to 20% of LME price, with higher share in times
         of low commodity prices. Some limited evidence communicated by Armenian mining companies con-
         firms this observation. At the same time, it seems that Armenian companies include transportation
         costs in TC/RC, which is not internationally accepted practice. These issues require additional investi-
         gation.
         According to Armenia’s development strategy, the mining sector is expected to increase its contribu-
         tion to the GDP. This is going to increase public revenues directly and indirectly – through horizontal
         and vertical linkages and through multiplier effects of spending by mine sector employees. Ensuring
         adequate local business environment is important so that benefits may also reach local communities
         in a fair and equitable manner.
         Further steps should be undertaken to increase transparency and responsibility of the mining compa-
         nies. Negative impressions within the society creates additional impediments for successful promotion
         of mining projects. Armenia’s joining to Extractive industries transparency initiative (EITI) is an import-
         ant step in the direction of more responsible mining.

7.	        Environmental and socioeconomic management

7.1.	      Human and physical geography
        Armenia is a small, land locked, medium income country with a population of about 3 million. It is
        an ethnically and religiously homogenous country with Armenians making up 98% of the population
        (small minorities comprises primarily Yazidis, as well as Kurdish, Russians, Assyrians, Greeks and oth-
        ers). The vast majority of Armenians are Christian, belonging to the Armenian Apostolic Church. The
        country also has a large diaspora population. The table below summarises some further key facts
        about Armenia.
        Most of the population live in the western and north-western parts of the country and sixty-four per-
        cent live in urban areas – Yerevan and a few much smaller cities. The remaining thirty-six percent of
        the population live in villages and in the countryside.
        Armenia’s infrastructure (e.g. road- and railways, energy and power, water supply, telecommunica-
        tions) are fairly well developed, although the needs for repair and renovation are substantial.
        Armenia is mountainous, with the lesser Caucasus mountain range stretching from the northernmost
        parts (Virahayots Mountains) and to the far south (Zangezur Mountains). The continuation of these
        mountains also stretch into the territories of Azerbaijan and Iran. The Armenian Volcanic Plateau is
        situated in the south-western part of the lesser Caucasus mountain range, and thus cover the west and
        central parts of Armenia. Overall, the country is characterized by high altitudes, and large topographic
        variations; about half of Armenia has an elevation of at least 2,000 meters, and only three percent
        of the country lies below 650 meters. The lowest points are in the valleys of the Araks River (Meghri
        Gorge) and the Debed River (with elevations of 380 and 430 meters, respectively). The highest moun-
        tain is Mount Aragats (4,430 meters high), which raises above the Armenian plains in the central part
        of the country. All of Armenia is within an area that is seismically active.
        Armenia has one major lake, Lake Sevan, which is also the largest lake in the southern Caucasus region.
        The lake is situated at an altitude of about out 2,000 meters above sea level.
        The rivers of Armenia belong to the Kur and Araks rivers basins. The Pambak Mountains and the Sevan
        Mountains of Areguni form the divide between the two river systems. Thus, in western and southern
        Armenia rivers flow west- or southwards, and drain into the Araks river system, which stretches into
        Iran and Turkey. In the north and northeast, the Debed river and the Aghstev river systems drain north-
        wards, into the Kura river system in Georgia and Azerbaijan.

               Figure 7.1. Map of Armenia, showing the main river systems.

         The climate is continental with hot summers and cold winters. From variations in topography also fol-
         lows considerable weather variations. Average precipitation ranges from 250 millimetres per year in
         the lower Araks River valley in the south, to 800 millimetres at the highest altitudes. On the Armenian
         Plateau, the mean midwinter temperature is 0° C, and the mean midsummer temperature exceeds
         25° C.
         The topographic and associated climatic variations result in highly diverse ecosystems, flora and fauna.
         The Caucasus has been defined by the WWF as one of the “ecoregions with globally outstanding bio-
         diversity”. The forest cover is less than 8% of the country’s area. At present, the deforestation is largely
         due to illegal logging of forests for obtaining construction and fuel wood, although mining operations
         have also contributed significantly to the felling of forests in some areas.


7.2.	        Potential impacts from ongoing mining
         Mining activities may be associated with negative environmental and social impacts. Internationally,
         such issues are being taken more and more seriously, and it is generally felt that the longer term via-
         bility of the whole mining sector rests in reaching a situation where mining is performed in an envi-
         ronmentally and socially responsible manner. This requires a sound understanding of the present and
         future impacts of mining development on the environment and society (Table 7.1).

 Physical injuries due to accidents

         In addition to the challenges that commonly are met with regards to mining environmental manage-
         ment, the natural environment in Armenia entails peculiarities that makes it a particularly challenging
         place to open and operate mines:
             a.	 The geography and climatic conditions are very varied, and related to this there is rich biodiver-
                 sity. Furthermore, the country is tectonically active, and earthquakes and landslides are com-
                 mon.
             b.	 Being a small, land locked country this means that nearly all prospective areas in terms of min-
                 eral potential are situated in river catchments that cross national borders.
             c.	 Armenia’s climate, and directly associated with this, economy is regarded as being sensitive to
                 the effects of climate change SEI/UNDP (2009).

         Further, many of the mineralization comprise sulphide minerals. Thus, these may have the potential to
         generate Acid Rock Drainage (ARD; see box), can cause extensive environmental damage, and proper
         management of ARD at mining operations is therefore imperative.


     Box: Acid Rock Drainage
     Acid Rock Drainage (ARD) or acid mine drainage refers to the acidic water that is created when sulphide
     minerals are exposed to air and water and, through a natural chemical reaction, produce sulphuric acid.
     ARD has the potential to introduce acidity and dissolved metals into water, which can be harmful to fish
     and aquatic life. The dissolved metals associated with ARD are often more toxic to fish and aquatic or-
     ganisms than is the acidity. Preventing and controlling ARD is a concern at operating mine sites and after
     mine closure.
                                                                                            Source: miningfacts.org


7.3.	        Key environmental considerations
         Whilst exploration licenses may cover extensive areas, mining itself is hardly ever a large user of land.
         Exploration activities are commonly allowed in certain types of nature protection areas while most
         valuable areas, such as national parks, are normally closed for both exploration and mining.
         In Armenia, exploration licenses cover about 5% of the land (Figure 7.2), whereas mining licenses
         cover areas that are a few orders of magnitude less than that, corresponding to a fraction of a percent
         of the total land area. The main concerns in terms of land used for mining are therefore not foremost
         that they are particularly large but rather if such licenses are situated in sensitive areas, and whether
         the mine sites are being well managed so that the land can, after mining has ceased, be used for some
         other purpose. Furthermore, the sites themselves may become a source for contamination and pollu-
         tion that may affect significant areas outside the mine area itself (see below).
Armenia: Strategic Mineral Sector Sustainability Assessment                                                    71

 2015.

         The Armenian metal mines are mainly gold and base metal mines. These types of mines produce large
         amounts of waste rock and tailings material, and the ores are often associated with metals or met-
         alloids that may be toxic to humans and nature. Spillages and/or leakages from waste and processes
         may lead to contamination of downstream waterways. Furthermore, the Alaverdi smelter has been a
         significant source of local and regional air pollution for a long time, and the spreading of contaminants
         through the air commonly also leads to local and regional soil pollution.
         The larger mining companies (Dundee Precious Metals, ZCMC and Vallex Group) conduct voluntary
         self-monitoring but the data are not publically available. The Environmental Impact Monitoring Centre
         does conduct regular regional monitoring of water and air quality and summaries of results are pro-
         vided to the public in their yearly “state of the environment” reporting. The Center does not conduct
         soil monitoring, mainly due to lack of funding. In this assignment, we have been given permission to
         use some of the raw data that underpins this reporting.

     The research that has been done on environmental impacts to date is modest, and does not really al-
     low any overall and conclusive conclusions to be drawn, beyond the fact that mining is indeed causing
     impacts in places. Thus, there is a need for performing a sector wide study of impacts. Such a study
     should also include considerations for how to apportion environmental liabilities related to operations
     that have a history of being state owned (see below; mine legacies).
     Nevertheless, several investigations have found that levels of heavy metals are elevated in areas down-
     stream of mining: for example, in the Voghji and Geghi rivers in the south (Georgyan et al., 2013);
     and in the Debed river, downstream of Alaverdi (Kurkiyan et al, 2004). Mining related pollution is also
     reaching across the national borders, into the international Kura and Araks river systems (Ewing, 2003;
     Kurkiyan et al., 2004). Corroborating results are seen in the data collected from regular water quality
     monitoring which is being performed by the Environmental Impact Monitoring Center, where data
     analysis show that levels of copper in water are in some cases extremely high, and probably in places
     so high as to make in impossible for aquatic fauna to survive (Figure 7.3 and Table 7.2). Part of the
     reasons for the contamination include inadequate environmental management measures being un-
     dertaken at mine sites (Figure 7.4). Further, Acid Rock Drainage occurring in active, or recently active,
     mine sites were observed at several sites during the field visits (Figure 7.4).

         The EIA law, as well as the system for conducting and approving EIAs is new, and no firm conclusions
         can be drawn as to how well it may be working. However, a comparison of the Teghut environmental
         documentation for project approval, which predates the EIA law with the more recent Amulsar project
         suggest that the new system may deliver much better and more comprehensive assessments. The
         Amulsar EIA appears to have been produced in line with international best practice, but the reason
         from it having this higher standard may in also relate more to IFC requirements (as IFC has invested in
         the project), than requirements entailed in the new EIA law.
         The new EIA law contains a range of sophisticated tools, including requirements to consider an analysis
         of ecosystem services. A recent UNEP/UNDP project has attempted to perform a pilot for such an anal-
         ysis of a small gold mining project (Karaberd gold mine; UNEP/UNDP, 2014). The conclusions included
         that data availability was not good enough for a proper analysis to be performed. This is not surprising
         as very few successful examples of such ecosystem studies, or similar attempts to monetise environ-
         mental issues have been performed in an environmental policy, or EIA related setting, rather than
         in a more academic research related environment where several examples do exist. This experience
         exemplifies the conclusion in the legal chapter, which states that whereas the legislation that exists
         in Armenia is rather comprehensive and even sophisticated, the real problems lie in implementation,
         both in terms of practicality and ability.

Mines requires access to land although the areas in question are almost never large compared to other land
uses. Locally, however, mining is an intrusive form of land use (Kajaran left, Artsvanik right).




There are clear examples of poor environmental performances among Armenian mining companies. Tailings

Tailings impoundments may be difficult to vegetate or to control in dry climate, and if managed poorly, this may

         Serious contamination of agricultural soil and of ground in inhabited areas with heavy metals have been
         reported from Kajaran town (Gevorgyan et al, 2013), Alaverdi (Petrosyan (2004), Akhtala (Petrosyan
         et al., 2014) and Agarak (Ghazaryan et al., 2013). Possible sources of these elevated levels include
         dust and waste deriving from mining and processing, as well as from smelting activities. In Akhtala,
         Petrosyan et al. (2014) show that children’s blood lead levels in this mining town are higher than other
         communities.
         Overall, there is much concern over possible human health effects due to mining and processing.
         Alarming statements about lowered fertility among women, increased risks for cancer, and other ail-
         ments in mining affected areas are commonly made. However, with the exception for the studies
         of blood lead levels in children (above) there has been no studies or other investigations that show
         whether such fears and concerns are warranted.
         Dusting from tailings deposits is a possible source of contamination and this was also observed during
         site visits performed in this study (Figure 7.4). The problems appeared to be rather serious in the south
         of the country, which has a more arid climate.
         Pollution deriving from the Alaverdi copper smelter are well visible in monitoring data collected by
         the Environmental Monitoring Centre, where levels of sulphur dioxide well above maximum allowable
         concentrations (MAC) for protecting human health in extensive areas affected by downfall from the
         smelter.

7.4.	      Key socio-economic considerations
        One characteristic of the minerals sector is that it can bring economic development and work oppor-
        tunities to parts of countries that may have few other opportunities. This is the case in Armenia, as
        Syunik, in spite of being a comparatively sparsely populated province, still is the second most signifi-
        cant contributor to national industrial production (after Yerevan). The GDP per capita of Syunik is also
        similar to that of Yerevan, whereas all other provinces are comparatively significantly less well off. The
        main reason for this is the mining and processing operations (mainly ZCMC) that employ about 5,000
        people in Syunik. Lori province is also a fairly sparsely populated region and its economy will have
        grown significantly with the newly opened Teghut mine.
        However, most mines in Armenia are not large and profitable operations that create significant oppor-
        tunities for work. In fact, most mines that are currently operating are small and many of them have
        been running at loss even through times of historically high metal prices. Such mines are unlikely to
        be able to contribute significantly to economic or other development now or in the future. This indi-
        cates that mining permits may have been granted without necessary requirements for the completion
        of appropriate feasibility studies. Further, due to the lack of profitability, these mines are more likely
        to become environmental liabilities as there are commonly not sufficient funds available for adequate
        technical development and environmental management (see below).
        Larger mining companies often engage in Corporate Social Responsibility. This is also the case in Arme-
        nia, where the owners of the three biggest mines (Kapan, Kajaran and Teghut) are all engaged in CSR
        related activities. Importantly, these activities are in no way obligatory in a legal sense, although there
        appears to exist strong expectations that larger mining companies should engage in such activities.
        Dundee Precious Metals reports on its activities in an annual sustainability report, which is written in
        GRI format, and thus provides a rather clear overview of the activities have been undertaken, as well
        as what size funds have been used for these purposes. The ZCMC, and Teghut companies (i.e. Vallex
        Resources) do not produce such reports, but some information is available on the companies’ respec-
        tive web site, and further information has been collected in various meetings during this assignment.
        Thus, in 2014, Dundee Precious Metals reports spending about USD0.5 million on nearby communi-
        ties, and CSR related work. This in turn represented a bit more than 1 percent of the value of sales from
        Kapan. With regards to ZCMC, they report on these types of expenditures in the period 2006-09, when
        they also reached about 1 percent of turnover spent on community projects. The funds allocated (1%
        of sales) are in line with or even a bit higher that what is commonly seen for CSR programs at mines
        internationally. More recent data on ZCMC suggest that during 2013-2014 they spent about USD9 mil-
        lion on socio-economic, charity and community/state development projects.
        Vallex and ZCMC’s CSR related activities are generally performed in accordance with a philanthropic
        tradition, and share a number of characteristics in that both companies are focusing their activities
        locally, but that they also support organisations that are active elsewhere, or even nationwide (e.g
        support to the All Armenian Fund). Locally, support is provided to schools, sports organisations, health
        facilities and to efforts related to improving or protecting the local environment, or to rehabilitating
        buildings, infrastructure and/or cultural heritage.
        Lydian International through its local Geoteam company is also involved in community development
        programs to three village communities in the vicinity of the Amulsar project. The company has until
        recently been in the exploration and project development phase, and during this time, efforts has
        been made to support the strengthening of local businesses so that they, in turn, can become suppliers
        to Lydian and Geoteam. Lydian has also conducted a rather ambitions social baseline study, that can

         ploying local staff, and making purchases locally. Further, if real linkages can be made with the rest of
         the local or national economy, then the benefits brought by mining may be further increased. The fact
         that Dundee Precious runs operations outside Armenia, in Bulgaria, Serbia and Namibia, allows some
         comparison as to what extent local employment and local procurement is happening in Armenia (see
         box). These data suggest that whereas employment of local mine workers is taking place, there seem
         to exist opportunities within Armenia for interventions and / or support aimed at educating more se-
         nior people that may gain employment at a management level, as well as to build up local suppliers of
         goods and services to the mining sector.

         Sentiments of communities affected by mining range from full support to full opposition. In some com-
         munities in the regions, jobs are badly needed and mine developments are therefore welcomed. But
         concerns exist that benefits from mining operations may be modest and finite, while environmental
         damage could be irreversible and long term. Proper, in depth community consultations appear to have
         been rare, and it is reported that the consultations often have taken place in the regional centres, rath-
         er than in the affected communities themselves. This way, villagers may then first hear only rumours
         about future plans, after which come visits from mining representatives where the decision is present-
         ed to the villages as one already made. A typical story reported in the news is one were the community
         says it has not been properly involved in decision-making, although there may have been some sort of
         consultations, and that the impact on the environment has been underestimated by state authorities.
         Such news stories also often portray the community sentiment as that of disenfranchisement where
         they do not believe they can influence any decisions made in any material way.
         There are cases where the community voices its opposition has been both organised and forceful.
         The most known and most long-lasting activist campaign against a mining project is the “Save Teghut”
         civic initiative (c.f. section 3.3). Recently, community opposition to an exploration project in Lori (by
         Vallex, Lori province in 2015) caused the project plans to stall or at least be severely delayed. In this
         specific case, the community does not seem to have felt that exploration in any way was materially
         different from an actual mining project. Similarly, in 2011 an area near the Kajaran village was allocat-
         ed to ZCMC. The area has been reported to include a village graveyard, as well as a church and several
         houses. Apparently, the decision was ostensibly made without prior consultation with the villagers.
         The head of the community then reacted by closing road access using his own car and he did not let
         any machines pass. The process is currently frozen.
         As alluded to in the stakeholder chapter, decision making in Armenia is rather centralised and possi-
         bilities for local participation in decision making are small. For example, it has been suggested that
         with regards to planning and negotiations around resettlement and compensation during mine de-
         velopment, that these are largely agreed upon between developer and authorities, with limited in-
         volvement of community members or other affected peoples. Another example of central control is
         the environmental fees that are paid by mining companies, and which then may be allocated through
         subventions to affected communities, where the communities and the amount are subject to approval
         in the annual state budget.

         The Armenian society may be described as fairly patriarchal, where men are supposed to be the bread-
         winners while women are supposed to be the caretakers of the family. In the Box below, World Values

         Mining is a sector which traditionally has brought opportunities in a disproportional way to males.
         This is still the situation practically everywhere, although attempts are made in some countries to
         improve gender equality. In Sweden, which at times is used as an example of a country where the goal
         of achieving gender equality is taken seriously, the state owned iron ore producer LKAB has only 18%
         females employed, with the percentage being lower among actual mine workers. In Armenia, there
         are no particular laws or regulations that limits women’s involvement in the mining sector in Armenia.
         In fact, recent legislative development (e.g. the Law on Ensuring Equal Possibilities and Rights for Men
         and Women of 2013) suggest a real intention to work towards gender equality in all social aspects,
         including labour. However, the situation in the mining sector of Armenia is similar to elsewhere. For
         example, Dundee Precious Metals reports that their Kapan mine operation has a male/female ratio
         among employees of 83/17. The situation is unlikely to be different at other Armenian mines, confirm-
         ing that work to improve gender equality is needed.

7.5.	        Mining legacy liabilities
         Field visits suggest that many, if not most old and no longer mined sites in Armenia have been left
         without any significant rehabilitation measures having been performed. The problems relate to urgent
         security risks for human health (e.g. open adits, unfenced pits etc.), as well as to longer term environ-
         mental risks. This implies that the areas in are unlikely to be usable for any other future purpose, and
         thus possibly could represent a near permanent loss of land. This appears to be true in both the metal
         and non-metal mining sector (Figure 7.5).
         The Armenian authorities (the MENR) see many of these sites as national assets, as they may be asso-
         ciated with mineral reserves. There is therefore a tendency of wanting to keep them “open”, to pos-
         sibly attract new investors, instead of actively pursuing environmental remediation or rehabilitation.
         Considerable work has been performed, mostly funded by the OSCE, concerning Armenian legacy
         sites. For example, an assessment of legacy sites in the Lori province has been produced, as well as a
         more in depth study of one specific site in Alaverdi (Hickman and Pardini, 2014; National Academy of
         Science – The Center for Ecological-Noosphere Studies, 2010). Much of the work is focused on waste
         materials, and these are treated in depth in Chapter 8 of this report.
         Overall there is a need to make an inventory of legacy sites, to assess their respective risk, and to de-
         velop a prioritised list for rehabilitation and/or remediation. Such programme has been performed in
         numerous countries, but one of the most ambitious, well known and long running example is the US
         CERCLA-Superfund initiative, from which much can be learned (see box). The work could draw upon
         the inventory of abandoned mines performed by the GRA in 2004-2009, with financing provided from
         the RA State budget.

   Box: Rehabilitation of legacy mine sites – the US Superfund

   The Superfund program was initiated in 1980 and it is a US Federal government effort to clean up land
   that has been contaminated by hazardous waste and that has been identified by the US Environmental
   Protection Agency (EPA) as a candidate for clean-up because it poses a risk to human health and/or to
   the environment. Initially a fund of nearly USD2 billion was created using taxes imposed on major oil and
   chemical companies. The fund has subsequently been replenished on a number of occasions.

   The EPA works with various stakeholder and authorities to identify hazardous waste sites, test the con-
   ditions of the sites, formulate clean-up plans, and to decontaminate the sites. Abandoned mine lands
   form a large part of the Superfund sites. It is estimated that there are some 500,000 abandoned mines
   in the USA.

   Many developed countries have established similar hazardous waste remediation programs. Some coun-
   tries pay for site clean-up from general government revenues (taxes, etc.), whereas others rely on special
   taxes on industry (similar to Superfund).

                                                                         Source: www.abandomnedmines.gov


         Most of the now operating metal mines have a history of being state run enterprises. Thus, the envi-
         ronmental liability that is associated with these operations should be shared between the state and
         the current owner. To our knowledge, no such division of liability has been performed (although this
         may be part of the privatisation contracts which, in turn, are confidential). For example, the Kajaran
         mine and associated waste and processing facilities had a more than 50-year history as a state run
         operation, before it was privatised and taken over by ZCMC. A process is needed whereby division of
80                                                                Armenia: Strategic Mineral Sector Sustainability Assessment



     liability is performed, and the results of which should be made public (when state assets are privatised,
     such a process is fair, correct and necessary). The only two major projects where the environmental
     liability lies completely with the current owner is the Teghut mine, and the Amulsar project. The above
     facts regarding apportioning of liability are important to remember when one considers needs and
     responsibilities for environmental rehabilitation, and mine closure (below).
     The present funds deposited in the Nature Protection and Reclamation Fund, and which are meant
     to be used for rehabilitation after closure of now ongoing metal mining operations, represent about
     USD2 million. Whereas the establishment of such a Fund is the right approach to ensure that there
     are no new environmental legacies created, the amount deposited is inadequate for the rehabilitation
     of even one of the more substantial and now operating mines. The problem appears to lie both in the
     rationale of how the fund is constructed, as well as in the amount of money that has been paid into
     it. As a comparison, the corresponding fund in Sweden (with a metal mining sector about 4-5 times
     that of Armenia - 90 million tonnes of ore compared to Armenia’s 20 million tonnes) has a current
     value (end 2015) of USD400 million, that is 200 times larger than the corresponding Armenian fund.
     In Sweden, the funds deposited are directly tied to the estimated cost of closing an operation at the
     present time. In Armenia, the money in the fund is a part payment of the cost to close the mine at a
     time in the future, which is set by the estimated life of mine. This provides inadequate protection for
     the event of early closure.
     The question of what the former state owned mines should be made to pay into the Nature Protection
     and Reclamation Fund is complex. Ideally, the apportioning of environmental liability should have
     been part of the privatisation agreement. In the ZCMC case, the state should then have set aside part
     of the proceed of the sales to ensure that it could cover this liability. This appears even more crucial as
     to date, ZCMC has deposited practically no money at all in the Fund, with one offered rationale being
     that it is a mine with a near perpetual life. Thus, it will not be closed any time soon, and it is not neces-
     sary to deposit any funds for closure. This is a rather naïve preposition, given that although the Kajaran
     is a large and impressive deposit, the mine has already gone through hard times, when it was under
     care and maintenance (in the early 1990s). As a comparison, the considerably larger Aitik copper mine
     is Sweden (also with a substantial life of mine remaining) has deposited more than USD200 million to
     cover for future closure costs.

7.6.	      Recommendations
        Overall, the knowledge and understanding of the nature and causes of the environmental impacts of
        current mining activities is not good enough to be the basis for policy decisions. A comprehensive sec-
        tor wide Sectoral Environmental Impact Study (SEIS) is needed. The SEIS should consider impacts that
        relate to both pollution stocks (legacy sites) and flows (ongoing mining). The SEIS should also provide
        a basis for the apportioning of environmental liability between the state and the current owner mine
        operations that have a history of having been state run.
        There are significant environmental stocks/liabilities left from former mining operations, with at least
        some of these being in urgent need of rehabilitation. The needs in this regard include the following:
           a.	 The current knowledge of where the sites are situated, and what kind of risks and levels of risk
               they represent is inadequate. Thus, there is a need to make an inventory of these sites, to assess
               their respective risk, and to develop a prioritised list for rehabilitation and/or remediation (such
               work is to be well coordinated with efforts addressing mining waste, and that are considered in
               chapter 10, and included in the suggested SEIS above).
           b.	 The reason that some sites are left without remediation may have to do with them being seen
               as state assets, that should be protected to facilitate possible future investments and economic
               development. Decisions need to be taken as whether this type of rational really is adequate and
               suitable, as it is a way of thinking that is uncommon in other mining countries.
        Significant impacts are caused by ongoing mining operations, and it is clear that a key step towards an
        environmentally sustainable mineral sector is for mining companies to simply ”do better”. Initiatives to
        contribute to a better performance may include the following:
            a.	 Encouragement of private sector initiatives, including the establishment of a Chamber of Mines,
                where firms voluntarily commit to certain standards. The performance of smaller mine oper-
                ators may be especially important in this regard, as part of the reason for their overall poor
                performance may be a lack of expertise and knowledge, both of which may be partly addressed
                by membership of a larger professional body.
            b.	 Improve supervision and control, as well as making environmental penalties for noncompliance
                more severe.
            c.	 Strengthening and/or encouraging the role and possibilities for CSO and/or local communities
                to monitor, and report to authorities regarding mining company transgressions.
        Given that there are only a few larger ongoing or planned mining projects (ZCMC, Teghut and Amul-
        sar), there may exist scope for one of these to take on the role of being an “agent for change”. Notably,
        the World Bank has supported one such initiative in the Indian state of Odisha, where a large state con-
        trolled mining company was supported to become a reference and agent for change (see box below).
        However, there are limitations in this possibility as in the Odisha case, the company is state controlled,
        and in Armenia, the companies are privately held and there is little that the government or any other
        body can do to force a company to take on this role of doing “more”. However, there may exists mech-
        anism whereby such a role may at least be encouraged. For example, IFC and EBRD funding could be
        made conditional of becoming, to some extent, such an agent for change.

   Box: Benchmarking Odisha Mining Corporation as a Change Agent
   The World Bank Group has supported the Indian state of Odisha through different programmes for sustain-
   able development of the mining sector. A method used to implement reforms, was to identify Odisha Mining
   Corporation (OMC) as a “change agent”. OMC is major and state controlled company, mainly engaged in
   iron and chrome mining. The World Bank supported a benchmarking and strategic planning exercise for this
   company, with the aim to introduce global good practices into OMC which then, in turn, would raise the bar
   and motivate other companies to follow suit. Five main tasks were included in the benchmarking exercise:
   (i) Operational Benchmarking against a representative set of peer companies. Actions were identified for
   OMC to reach alignment with the peer group in terms of production, cost structure, production control, IT,
   product quality, SHE etc.
   (ii) Mineral Resource Assessments - to ensure a full understanding of OMC’s mineral resource base (existing
   mines and undeveloped mineral resources).
   (iii) Scenario Analysis - different scenarios were defined based on internal and external factors, and longer
   term commodity price trends.
   (iv) Strategic Prioritization for Development which was based on the results of (i), (ii) and (iii), where produc-
   tion projections and investment needs were modelled and developed. The prioritization included investment
   plans, cash flow projections and analyses of NPV for relevant projects.
   (v) Review and Recommendations, which included a number of strategic production and investment plans
   as well as business models.


         The funds available for closure and remediation of mine operations (the Nature Protection and Recla-
         mation Fund) are inadequate, even for the rehabilitation of one of the more substantial of the now op-
         erating mines. There is thus a need to ensure that payments into the fund are substantially increased,
         and that the funds deposited by any one current operator and former owners (including the state) are
         sufficient to cover closure costs at a given mine at the present time. That is, the fund should be tightly
         bound with a requirement by companies to at regular intervals produce costed, and up-to-date closure
         plans.
         In terms of the communities that live nearby mines, challenges remain in ensuring that these have pos-
         sibilities to participate in decision-making and impact assessments that existing laws and regulations
         stipulate. International experiences show that NGOs and CSOs often hold significant environmental
         and socioeconomic knowledge and they can therefore contribute to ensuring a sound development
         of the mineral sector. This role can be performed not only as the traditional “watch dog” role, but also
         with NGOs being a resource for capacity building and training in mining communities. Such building
         of capacity and awareness in communities may facilitate meaningful participation in project planning
         and monitoring, as well as in negotiations with developers around resettlement and compensation,
         and contribute to conflict prevention. Thus, mineral sector development would benefit from fostering
         an environment where civil society is encouraged to participate in the development of policy and laws
         and in the management and control of the sector. The CSOs must, however, first be strengthened in
         terms of their knowledge and understanding of the sector.

8.	        Mine waste management

8.1.	      Introduction
        Mining creates more waste than any other industry, in Armenia as well as globally. Adequate mine
        waste management is therefore often the most important issue with respect to ensuring protection of
        human and environmental health in mining areas.
        The emphasis in this assignment is to consider mine tailings, but it is important to realise that there are
        a few different types of mine waste:
           a.	 Overburden is the barren surface soil or rock that needs to be removed to gain access to the ore
               in open pit operations.
           b.	 Waste rock is the material surrounding the ore body that does not have any economic value but
               that needs to be removed along with the ore body as part of open pit or underground mining
               operations. While waste rock is not mineralised in an economic sense, it may still have a mineral
               content that needs to be considered in environmental management (for example pyrite that
               can give rise to ARD). Overburden and waste rock can be stored in specific waste dumps for later
               use at site restoration.
           c.	 Tailings are the waste product of mineral processing operations and range from sand to clay-
               sized particles produced after crushing and grinding of the ore for the purposes of mineral
               extraction. Tailings are often transported in slurry form and deposited in stand-alone tailings
               storage facilities (TSFs), often referred to as tailings dams.
           d.	 Barren heap leach material is formed of crushed (coarse) or agglomerated (fine) ore that re-
               mains in place after leaching of the ore within a heap leach pad has been completed.
           e.	 Acid Rock Drainage (ARD; see explanatory box in chapter 8) treatment sludge is generally formed
               by the addition of lime to ARD, resulting in a very low density sludge of metal hydroxides. If ARD
               is treated during the operational phase of a mine / mineral processing plant, it will normally
               mixed with tailings and will be stored in a TSF.
        The key risks for mining waste storage facilities, in general, can be categorised into i) those associated
        with environmental performance and ii) those associated with physical instability. Environmental risks
        are mainly related to: the presence of hazardous materials in the mine waste (e.g. cyanide, process
        chemicals, various metals and metalloids); materials with the potential to become hazardous (e.g. oxi-
        dation of sulphides leading to ARD); and the presence of fine particles, mainly in the tailings. Table 9.1
        summarizes hazards, potential environmental impacts and typical mitigations methods used in mine
        waste management.
        The focus on tailings when considering mining waste facilities is often well motivated since tailings
        can be highly mobile under conditions of physical instability. Such physical instability may occur via: (i)
        dam wall failure or (ii) overtopping. There are several triggering mechanisms for dam wall failure, and
        include seismic events, high pond water levels, overtopping events themselves, high rates of rise (RoR;
        where the dam wall is increased at a rate that is too fast) and various design factors (e.g. inappropriate
        wall angles, poor ground investigation of foundation conditions). Recent examples that illustrate the
        risk involved include the catastrophic failures of the Mount Polley TSF in Canada (2014, with environ-
        mental impacts) and the Samarco TSFs in Brazil (2015, with both environmental impacts and loss of
        life).

         The impacts associated with physical hazards (instability) for mining waste storage facilities are com-
         monly discussed both in terms of the potential for loss of life as well as environmental impacts. With
         regards to risk levels associated with physical instability and loss of life, these also depend on the prox-
         imity of the waste storage facility to occupied areas.
         The design of TSFs that are used to store tailings (usually in slurry form) is critical to the risks associated
         with physical stability. Two design examples, upstream raise and downstream raise, are summarised
         in figure 8.1 in order to illustrate this criticality. Upstream raise dams are cheaper to build than down-
         stream raises but are much more likely to fail as a result of seismic activity, poor pond water manage-
         ment and instability induced by a too high RoR.

         In any country where the mineral industry is adequately regulated (i.e. where proper laws exist and are
         implemented), there is a clear business case for implementing best practise mine waste management.
         This follows from the large costs associated with poor environmental performance and in particular
         with catastrophic failure of tailings dams. Environmental remediation and other liabilities can in such
         cases potentially lead to a significant erosion of the company’s market value, and the suspension of
         operations. Thus, the cost of best practise tailings management is generally considered to be worth the
         reduced risk of significant incidents.


8.2.	        Mine waste baseline
         There are 21 tailings dams in Armenia, of which 13 are active and all but two are located in the Syunik
         or Lori regions (Table 8.2). ZCMC’s Artsvanik dam is by far the largest of the active dams, with a current
         actual volume that makes up almost 75% of the volume of all tailings. The recently commissioned
         Teghut dam is also designed for large volumes, corresponding to almost 30% of the designed volume
         for all dams. Other dams are much smaller than these two, and most are in fact very small structures.
         There is one heap leach operation today in Armenia, the GPMs Ararat plant, and a second one would
         be constructed should the Amulsar gold project materialize.
         Within this assignment, 7 of the active dams and 4 of the closed dams have been visited. The overall
         assessment of mining waste storage facilities (both operational and non-operational / abandoned) re-
         vealed that the physical stability risks posed by tailings dams are far greater than those posed by waste
         rock and overburden dumps. This also appears to be true with regards to environmental risks. This
         section therefore focuses on tailings facilities. It should however be noted that the issue of waste rock
         is not insignificant to judge from brief observations made during the field visits. Improperly designed
         and located waste rock dumps with potentially ARD generating material were observed at least at one
         of the visited active mines.

     Tailings dams in operation
     Detailed reviews of 4 of the largest active tailings dams have been produced (the facilities numbered 1,
     5, 14 and 19 in Table 9.2, representing nearly 80% of the total designed volume for Armenia’s existing
     tailings dams, see Appendix 2). The dams reviewed include both old dams constructed during Soviet
     times, and a new dam that was designed and constructed recently (Teghut, no 19).
     None of the dams reviewed (or visited) are in line with international best practice, neither in terms of
     their design nor their management. Importantly, all major tailings dams visited has been construct-
     ed using the upstream raise design. This is a design which according to best international practice is
     considered to be unacceptable in seismically active regions (see box). It is further noted that in some
     cases, the impact and consequences of failure of existing tailings dams could be severe, including the
     loss of life as several dams are located upstream of communities or areas of human activities, such as
     agriculture.

   Box: Why not use upstream raise design in seismically active regions?
   The upstream raise design for tailings impoundments is an often used way of construction tailings im-
   poundments. However, experiences of wide spread failures of dams constructed in such a way during
   earth quakes, for example in Chile during the 1970s, has shown that the design entails a too high prob-
   ability of some form of physical instability issue occurring under seismic loading. Such instability issues
   may also occur due to poor tailings pond water management.
   In some jurisdictions where seismic hazard is high, the adoption of upstream raises is now prohibited
   under law (e.g. Chile, Peru). In general, this TSF disposal method is being regarded as being unfavour-
   able for medium to high hazard TSFs and is not being accepted by some authorities in countries with a
   well-developed mineral sector (e.g. Ghana).



         In relation to the risk for communities, it was also revealed that although some emergency plans exist
         within the companies themselves, such emergency planning which also includes considerations for the
         communities at risk are lacking.
         The majority of the tailings come from copper-molybdenum or base metals mines (copper-lead-zinc
         +/- gold) with sulphide mineralization. Thus, there is a general risk for ARD formation and the spread of
         potentially metals and arsenic to the environment. ARD was noticed at several (but not all) of the loca-
         tions visited during the field visits undertaken within this project (see in figures 7.4 and 7.5). The large
         Artsvanik tailings dam (no. 1), and possibly also the Geghanush dam in Syunik, do not seem to have a
         significant ARD problem. However, investigations are necessary to ascertain whether such issues may
         appear in the longer term.
         The use of the upstream raise method has limitations in cases when tailings with ARD potential is being
         stored. This follows as such a dam needs to be a “leaky dam”, that is water from within the tailings
         must be allowed to escape, so as not create a too high water table within the structure, with associat-
         ed risks for dam collapse. When water is allowed to leak from a dam containing ARD generating waste,
         the seepage must be collected and/or treated. This does not occur at neither of the dams that contain
         ARD generating waste (c.f. reviews for dams no. 14 and 19 in Appendix 2).
         As a result of the dramatic relief of the Armenian mining areas, the tailings dams have often been
         placed in steeply incised valley. This means that the structure needs to seep not only through the walls
         of the dam construction itself, but also through the sidewalls, to avoid instability issues for the tailings
         that abut onto the valley sides. Such seepage through the sidewalls is a potential route for ARD to en-
         ter the environment, and in contrast to the bottom of a TSF, it is not generally possible to apply a liner
         to sidewalls. The Teghut TSF is, for example, a potentially ARD generating facility which situated in a
         steep valley. Although it is lined at the bottom, this may not be sufficient to prevent potential leakage
         of ARD on the sides of the TSF.
         Dusting from tailings dams was observed during field visits, and was also stated as a problem by sev-
         eral informants. Dusting is a rather common environmental issue in mining areas, and one which may
         be difficult to combat. However, reclamation and cover of old tailings would reduce the problem, as
         would ensuring that tailings are moist (which also reduces the potential for ARD formation), and con-
         current rehabilitation of dam surfaces. Some modest attempts to perform concurrent rehabilitation of
         dam surfaces are being pursued.

        Overall, there seem to exist a realisation among the major Armenian mine operators that existing
        tailings dams are problematic. Thus, it was revealed that international experts have been retained
        to review and assess the tailings dams of some of the major operators (ZCMC, Dundee Precious and
        Teghut). Further is also clear that the construction and permitting of TSFs have been done without ad-
        equate risk assessment, and this point at serious gaps both in terms of the technical capacity retained
        by the companies themselves, as well as a regulatory gap. Regarding the regulatory gap, the exact
        process for the approval of dam constructions is not clear. Dam design and risk assessment are part of
        a company EIA, and the Ministry of Territorial Administration and Emergency Situations is responsible
        for regulation and risk assessment in this regard. According to key informants, however, the Ministry
        does not house capacity for this. It was furthermore stated that the former state institution that held
        specific expertise in dam design has been privatised, and now forms part of the Vallex group, where it
        has a minor and seemingly increasingly less important role to play in company affairs.
        Non-operating tailings dams
        With regards to old mine waste, environmental risks are commonly more of an issue for tailings than
        other types of mines waste. This follows as the risk for failures of such facilities decrease when they are
        no longer active. In contrast, the risk of ARD emanating from abandoned waste rock dumps increase
        with time, and this is often the key long term environmental risk for these types of structures.
        Field reviews of tailings dams that are closed or abandoned, revealed that these were constructed
        in what at the time was the most cost effective methods available, following then accepted criteria.
        While there are rather severe limitations to the design and practices used, it should be acknowledged
        that the practices used were similar to international practices at the time. Also, the very fact there
        was a recognition of the need to store the waste rather than simply dispose of it (which was a rather
        common practise in many countries at the time) is positive.
        Similar to the situation for active tailings dams, several of the non-active dams are located upstream
        of settlements and old tailings dams are also used for agriculture and grazing without any prior risk
        assessment having been undertaken to assess potential presence of hazardous substances and expo-
        sure pathways.
        There is no evidence of any ambitious attempts at closure for the old tailings facilities, with one excep-
        tion in Akhtala where EU funds were used to perform some fairly modest rehabilitation measures (see
        8.3 below, and Appendix 2).


8.3.	      Management and rehabilitation of mine waste facilities
        Possibilities for waste minimization
        Short of major developments in the areas of metals recycling and reprocessing of tailings materials,
        mining will continue to produce large amounts of waste, which are costly to manage, and for which
        there is today no significant alternative use. Thus, focus need to be on waste minimization, and the
        high costs for depositing and managing is in itself an incitement for companies to minimize waste.

   Box: Why no environmental tax on mining waste?
   Taxes may be charged to create income to government, or as a means to discourage/encourage certain
   behaviours (or a mix of the two). Environmental taxes are used to address environmental challenges.
   For example: carbon taxes are used to promote a shift away from fossil fuels; tax on waste are used
   to encourage waste minimisation and recycling; and in Sweden, a tax has been used successfully to
   promote the use of crushed rock instead of natural gravel and aggregates, thus helping preserving an
   important natural resource.
   Mining waste (waste rock and tailings) is the dominant waste stream in all countries that have a sub-
   stantial mining sector, yet none of these countries have chosen to introduce a tax on mining waste.
   The reason lie in the fundamental characteristics of how mining and processing is performed. First, the
   product sought (e.g. the metal) is present in small concentrations in the mined ore (from percentages to
   grams per ton), which means that in what ever way the process is run, the vast majority of the treated
   ore will end up as waste. Second, given that the removal of waste rock and processing of ore are costly,
   there are very strong economic reasons for mine operators to reduce the amount of material moved
   and crushed, irrespective of whether there is a tax on waste or not. Third, due to the characteristics of
   the waste produced by a typical mine, the possibilities for secondary uses of the waste are nearly always
   severely constrained (e.g. due to regulations on metal levels in material used as aggregates, or due to
   the very fine grain nature of process tailings).
   The above reasons mean that if a tax on mining waste is introduced, it will essentially only mean that
   the cost of mining will increase, and that fewer project are viable. That is, it is not waste production that
   is discouraged but rather the whole activity of mining. Such a result, if sought, may be achieved by other
   already existing means; for example, through an increase in the royalty paid.



         Environmental regulation may motivate the application of best practise and best available technology
         with the aim to minimize the production of waste. While various tax instruments are also sometimes
         used to regulate industry towards improved environmental management, including waste minimiza-
         tion, countries with a significant mineral sector find no justification for imposing a tax on mine waste
         (see box above). This is also currently the case in Armenia where the Law on Environmental and Nat-
         ural Resource Use Fees and the Law on Rates of Environmental Fees impose tax on industrial waste,
         while of mine waste is excluded from this tax.
         In fact, the law prescribes that a tax or environmental fee should not apply to the disposal of non-haz-
         ardous mining waste (c.f. section 4.6). This could then mean that these types of waste are considered
         to be non-hazardous, while there is actually no existing system in Armenia for the classification of
         (mining) waste into hazardous and non-hazardous. Such a system is needed for companies to assess
         how waste should be treated and stored and for the authorities to be able to regulate the industry.
         Rehabilitation and closure of old TSF
         From the desk-top work and field visits within the current project, it is apparent that all non-active
         tailings structures in Armenia require impact investigation and probably, in most cases, some level of
         risk and impact mitigation works. The fundamental stages in a developing and implementing a robust
         mitigation plan are presented in the table below.
92                                                                 Armenia: Strategic Mineral Sector Sustainability Assessment

      and maintenance       measures. Monitoring scheme normally reduces in frequency with time as effec-
                            tiveness is demonstrated. Ongoing maintenance is required to ensure success of
                            restoration vegetation in first 2 – 5 years after which self-sustainment is normally
                            achieved.
                            Some mitigation measures might require one-off maintenance at longer time
                            frames e.g. refurbishment of acid wetlands at 10 to 20 years, replacement of an-
                            oxic limestone drain material every 5 to 10 years. However, the goal is for supple-
                            mentary mitigation components such as these to be obsolete beyond the short to
                            medium term as the efficiency of the primary mitigation measure(s) (such as a low
                            permeability cover system) should be designed to fully mitigate the issue within
                            this timeframe. For example, there will be a time lag between the placement of
                            a cover system and the significant reduction in ARD seepage since there will be a
                            slow draw-down of the groundwater levels within the TSF after placement of the
                            cover with an associated reduction in ARD seepage rates to acceptable levels that
                            do not require subsequent supplementary treatment.
                            In terms of physical stability, monitoring of groundwater levels and / or dam wall
                            settlement / movement is carried out until target steady state conditions at de-
                            monstrable levels of stability are achieved.

         It is important that any mitigation plan is robust and has a high probability of success. This necessi-
         tates high quality investigation, design and implementation. The rushed implementation of poorly
         conceived and designed plans has a high probability of failure and funds spent are often wasted.
         Such a situation is exemplified by the case of the Akhtala-2 tailings dam (see assessment sheet in
         Appendix 2). The Akhtala-2 tailings dam stopped operating in 1988. We are not aware of any initial re-
         habilitation works at the time of closure, while the dam was covered with soil in 2010 in order to “pre-
         vent dusting and reduce environmental impact” and in 2012, 700 saplings were planted on top of the
         dam through the EU Waste Governance - ENPI East Project with aim of halting erosion and run-off.10 It
         appears as if a proper investigation, resulting in adequate mitigation measures, was never undertaken,
         and at the site visit within this project, no healthy saplings or trees were observed.11
         Typical mitigation measures for abandoned TSF, and associated illustrative costs, are provided in Ap-
         pendix 3. Our estimated costs for the development and implementation of relevant mitigation works
         for Akhtala-2 is provided in Table 8.4.

         concluded at this stage that the ARD and stability risks are high enough to warrant all of the propose
         mitigation works. If the GCL, ALD and stone columns are not required, the total costs would reduce by
         around US$ 260,000 for the contracting costs alone. It is possible that the ARD mitigation measures
         could be eliminated at the preliminary investigation stage (following initial water quality sampling),
         further reducing the overall costs associated with ARD risk assessments.

    11	 A likely reason is that the soil cover is not thick enough and the roots reach the tailings, which tend to have high
sulphate (salt) levels. Salts can also rise into the cover soils as a result of infiltration and subsequent evaporation within the
vadose zone (semi saturated zone). To be successful, one would need to plant appropriate species that can tolerate high salt
levels.

         In any case, the required costs in the case of Akhtala-2 would constitute a significant part of the cur-
         rent funds available in the Nature Protection and Reclamation Fund (about USD2 million), which are
         under consideration for use for the purpose of rehabilitating old tailings dams. Considering the fact
         that Akhtala-2 is the second smallest of the closed dams in Armenia (other dams hold 2-50 times the
         volume of Akhtala-2 (table 8.2), and depending on the actual mitigation works that will be needed for
         other dams, total costs for the restoration of all closed dams will likely amount to several million, and
         possibly some 10s of million USD (cf. Box below with examples from Sweden).
         For the establishment of a national plan for mitigation works and closure of “abandoned” mine waste
         facilities in Armenia, all facilities would need to go through a preliminary investigation (i.e. steps 1-2
         of table 8.3). Looking at some eight “abandoned” tailings facilities, this would alone cost on the order
         of USD 1 million, while actual total costs would only be known after the design of mitigation measures
         (step 4, table 8.3).

     Box: Remediation costs for old mines – examples from Sweden

     The Swedish EPA (SEPA) has since the late 1980s been involved in efforts to rehabilitate old mine waste
     sites. In 1998, SEPA reported to have spent about USD30 million on such work, and it then estimated that
     to address the next 27 priority sites would entail a cost of USD100 – 200 million.

     The Adak Cu/Au/Ag mine was operational 1940-1977 when some 6.3 million tonnes of ore was treated.
     In 1998, Swedish government funded a project to apply a dry cover to the tailings site, including subse-
     quent monitoring. The costs to date have amounted to about USD3 million and the needs for monitoring
     will continue essentially in perpetuity.

     The Gladhammar Fe/Cu/Co mines in southern Sweden were abandoned as early as in the late 1800s.
     Before state funded remediation was undertaken in 2011, the mines caused leakages to a downstream
     lake of 430 kg Cu, 125 kg Co and 60 kg Pb annually. In 2011, one mine adit was closed, and about 70 000
     ton of waste were treated, which almost stopped all the contamination emanating from the site. The cost
     for the project was about USD7 million.

         Active and new TSF – management and rehabilitation
         The poor performance of the four operating tailings dams assessed within this project (including for
         example occurrences of ARD and dusting, and risks for physical instability; see above), shows that
         international best practise for tailings dams construction and management need to be adopted in
         Armenia.
         Thus, new tailings dams’ facilities in Armenia should move away from the upstream raise design. At-
         tention is here drawn to the recent conclusions of the investigation report into the high profile Mount
         Polley TSF failure in Canada in 2014. The Mount Polley expert panel has produced a much stricter set
         of BAT (Best Available Technique) suggestions, which go beyond discussions on different types of dam
         designs (e.g. upstream versus downstream raise), and include the phasing out of hydraulically-placed
         tailings altogether (i.e. slurry tailings).12

    12	 Sometimes, tailings are dewatered to such an extent at the process plant (via vacuum or filter presses) that they
are referred to as ‘dry’. These can be ‘stacked’ in a TSF that is not considered to be a dam. Tailings can also be co-disposed
(mixed) with waste rock in a combined mining waste storage facility and can also be deposited within exhausted open pits.
The coarse fraction of tailings is sometimes separated out and used as backfill in underground mine operations.
Armenia: Strategic Mineral Sector Sustainability Assessment                                                    95



         With regards to currently active tailings dams, constructing new dams for the placement of old tailings
         is often not economically viable, and it would also be associated with environmental risks as large
         amounts of potentially hazardous materials have to be moved. The closing of active upstream raise
         dams and the construction of new adequately designed dams may however be considered, although
         this would also be associated with significant costs. Short of constructing new dams, engineering solu-
         tions to improve current designs are necessary. For example, for the Dundee Precious Metals’ Gegha-
         nush dam, there is a proposal (advice and design by international consultants) to construct a new dam
         wall of rockfill downstream of the current dam wall in order to increase the stability of the overall
         downstream slope. This will apparently change the fundamental TSF design from an upstream raise to
         a centre-line raise, a design with less risk for physical instability.
         To increase the environmental performance of operating dams, environmental issues need to be
         adhered to so as to minimize the occurrences of (or risk for) for discharge of mine waters into the
         surrounding environment (see Chapter 8 for impacts on surface waters from mining), formation and
         impact from ARD, and also dusting. Many of the measures commonly applied for rehabilitation of
         abandoned facilities (Appendix 3) may also be applied in ongoing management of active dams. Mea-
         sures can be relatively costly, for example on the order of USD30,000-80,000 per l/s for measures to
         intercept contaminated seepage, and USD 50,000-200,000 per hectare for seepage treatment systems
         (Appendix 3).
         In cases where companies (or the government, when they carry liability as is the case in Armenia) have
         limited finances, it would be of importance to do a detailed cost-benefit analysis prior to any decisions
         around mitigation measures are taken, rather than trying to solve all problems with measures that are
         not fully adequate. For example, if ARD and mine water seepage pollutes water resources to such an
         extent that people’s health is at risk, addressing this issue would be more important than measures
         aimed at mitigating other issues with less impact.
         Possibilities for reprocessing tailings materials
         The retreatment of tailings is a possible “win-win” scenario, in which potentially problematic tailings
         facilities may be profitably “re-mined”. In the gold mining sector, tailings projects are rather common,
         whereas for other metals, they remain rare. A review of the Raw Material Data (2013) database on the
         world’s copper and gold producers reveal that there was only one such tailing processing operation for
         copper (running at a grade of about 1% Cu), whereas there were at least half a dozen gold producers
         that were reprocessing gold tailings (at production costs varying from USD800 – USD1000 per oz).
         Whilst there can be reductions in environmental and societal risks if poorly-designed mine waste facil-
         ities are re-worked for their mineral content, it should also be noted that old TSF that are not used are
         usually more stable and associated less geotechnical and environmental risk than active TSF.
         There are examples of projects where tailings are reprocessed partly for environmental reasons, rather
         than only for economic gain. A pioneer project in this regard was the Kasese cobalt project in Uganda,
         which in its initial stages of development obtained financial support by the World Bank (see box be-
         low). Similarly, in Canada, a sector has developed where companies are engaged to reprocess tailings
         deposit as a means of achieving an environmental “clean-up” and where the costs of doing so may in
         cases be subsidised by the government.

 Box: Kasese Cobalt - Successful reprocessing of mine waste through bioleaching

 In Uganda, the Kilembe copper mine was in operation from the 1950s up to 1977 with a total production of
 some 16 Mt of ore at grades of about 2% Cu and 0.17% Co. Cobalt was only recovered up to the late 1950s
 and pyrite and cobalt rich concentrate (80% pyrite, 1.4% Co) from the flotation were then stockpiled for
 potential later processing, which however never occurred during the life of the mine. Thus, in this case, the
 material constituted a specific flotation component initially considered as a resource, but which turned into
 abandoned waste over the years.
 The Kasese Cobalt Company Limited (KCCL) started reprocessing of the pyrite tailings in 1999 through using
 an innovative bioleaching process, developed specifically for this project (it is still the only cobalt bioleach-
 ing operation in the world). Investments costs amounted to some USD150-160 million and the operation
 produces high grade (99.9%) cobalt. In 2012, KCCL produced about 600 tons of cobalt, and at full capacity,
 the production rate is about 720 tons per year. The operation also includes a 9.9MW hydropower plant in a
 nearby river, and a limestone quarry with lime being added to the process for pH control and to precipitate
 dissolved iron.
 Prior to the KCCL operation, acidic waters drained from pyrite stockpiles straight into the adjacent Queen
 Elizabeth National Park (right side of road in map below). Through the reprocessing of the tailings and
 treatment of mine water, the tailings are now contained, the potential for ARD mitigated, and the operation
 shows the potential for an economic feasible (and even at times profitable) solution to a serious environ-
 mental liability from past mining.

         As explained elsewhere, the Armenian Mining Code concept of “manmade mines” is used in cases
         where the mineral reserves contained in a waste deposit has been defined. Thus, companies are by
         law obliged to report amounts of tailings and metal concentrations to the authorities, in order for
         such reserves to be determined. This set up does implies an interest on part of the authorities to
         facilitate tailings retreatment projects. However, the whole exercise of defining “manmade mines”,
         and in defining reserves is unnecessary, as the allocation of such deposits need not be different from
         other exploration and mining projects, see above). Internationally, there are many companies that
         specialise in retreatment of tailings. The application for, and allocation of rights to mine such deposits
         is generally made in the same way as are rights to explore and mine. This follows as a tailings project
         is not too different from a mining project. It must, in the same way go through an exploration phase
         (i.e. determining grades and amounts, and the character of the material) before plans can be made for
         actual re-mining/re-processing.
         With regard to tailings with a high content of sulphide, such as those that exist in Armenia, re-process-
         ing can be done through using flotation, followed by bio-leaching with bacteria. Some “back of the
         envelope” calculations on the typical costs (capex and running costs) of reprocessing tailings for either
         gold or copper using this technique are shown in the box below. They reveal that the grades that would
         be necessary for meeting costs of “re-mining” a 1Mt tailings deposit (there are about 10 deposits over
         this size in Armenia) through flotation followed by biox treatment) would need to be well in excess
         of 2% per copper, or 2.5g/ton of gold. These are high grades, which are unlikely to be encountered.
         However, for larger deposits, of which there are some in Armenia, the required grades would be less.

         No detailed studies have yet been undertaken in Armenia to investigate the possibility for the repro-
         cessing of tailings material in Armenia. However, the Centre for Sustainable Development at the Yere-
         van State University (CSD-YSU) has implemented a project to assess the potential for reprocessing of
         tailings, and they have made some calculations that appear promising. As the CSD-YSU have not been
         granted the right to sample tailings materials, these estimates concentrations based on published
         information on metal concentrations in ore and the efficiency of extraction methods used. This is not
98                                                                    Armenia: Strategic Mineral Sector Sustainability Assessment



         sufficient for decision-making around the possibility for reprocessing of tailings, as rather extensive
         drilling and sampling across tailings dams would be required to firmly establish reserves and the eco-
         nomic viability of “re-mining”. In this regard, one informant mentions a company that considered the
         case of the Artsvanik tailings, while they left the idea when rough estimates pointed at a Cu concentra-
         tion of 0.1%, at which level reprocessing would not be economically feasible.
         The Armenian government’s interest in promoting re-processing of tailings has not ended with the
         definition of “manmade mines” in the RA Mining Code. In 2015, a specific law was passed where the
         Artsvanik, Pkhrut and Voghji tailings dam is handed over to the Government for the purpose of con-
         tracting out the rights for the reprocessing of the tailings (RA Law HO-102-N of 23/06/2015). This is
         a unique measure, which has no international comparison, and leaves a number of questions to be
         answered (see box below).
         Overall, even though the term “man-made mine” is defined in law, there is considerable confusion as
         to what the concept of “man-made mines” entails, specifically regarding ownership and assumption of
         environmental responsibilities as the regulatory framework for the ownership and liability (and trans-
         fer thereof) of tailings is not clear. Further, as long as there is lack of knowledge on value contained in
         tailings (ore grades), no projects will go further.

     Box: Reprocessing of Artsvanik, Pkhrut and Voghji tailings – why and how?
     The first project for reprocessing mining tailings in Armenia is provided for by the “Law on an investment
     project to process industrial dumps accumulated and being accumulated in Voghji, Pkhrut, Artsvanik
     tailings as well as industrial dumps produced and being produced by Zangezur Copper Molybdenum
     Combine CJSC (Syunik region)”.

     The purpose of the law is to: establish legal guarantees for the implementation of the project; defining
     and differentiating the scope of liabilities of the State regulatory and local self-government bodies, and
     the rights and obligations of the implementing party related to the investment project; defining owner-
     ship for the tailings. Thus, the law provides for granting the right to the tailings to a “third” implementing
     party through a contract between Government, the Implementing Party and the ZCMC (with the latter
     now holding the rights to the tailings and the associated responsibilities for environmental management).
     According to the law, the implementing party is exempted from all applicable taxes and other manda-
     tory payments related to the transfer of the rights of the tailings. Further, the respective mine tailings
     mentioned in the law are themselves pledged as guarantee for the potential liability caused during the
     implementation of the project.
     The enactment of this law has caused concern among some stakeholders. Questions asked include the
     more fundamental – why the need for a specific law, as well as more detailed concerns regarding the
     economic viability of the project, who will end up taking on the environmental risks and liabilities, and
     whether, there is a large risk for the Government to end up with a significant environmental liability
     which should, rightfully belong to the former owner of the tailings in accordance with the “polluter pays”
     principle.


         Speculation around the potential for reprocessing of mine waste may create expectations that cannot
         be met in the near future, and to consider mine waste as ore (mineralization that is economically
         feasible to extract) is premature. Further, it would be irresponsible by the State to assume ownership
         of TSF that may become large environmental and economic liabilities. In the meantime, it is vital that
         proper TSF management is implemented by companies, including rehabilitation as needed to protect
         the environment and people.

8.4.	        Recommendations and road map for approach to tailings management
         A well run (sustainable) minerals sector is one where adequate management ensures that contam-
         ination from waste sites do not escape beyond site perimeters, and where waste facilities do not
         represent significant risks to surrounding communities and/or land uses in terms of accidental spills or
         geotechnical failures. Furthermore, there must be adequate funds built up to ensure the orderly clo-
         sure of the waste facilities once mining ceases. Where there are legacies from the past, there should
         exist an active government run program of risk assessment and subsequent remediation of prioritised
         pollution stocks. None of the above described circumstances prevail in Armenia today which means
         that strategic interventions are needed. These interventions need to be based on a thorough under-
         standing of the present situation.
         All major tailings dams in Armenia are constructed in accordance with the upstream raise design. This
         is an inappropriate design, and not in line with international good practice in seismically active as they
         are prone to failure during earthquakes. This issue is made more serious by the fact that some large
         tailings impoundments are situated nearby downstream communities. Risk assessments of all major
         dams are therefore needed, and appropriate actions need to be taken (e.g. redesign, or strengthening
         of facilities). Furthermore, there is a need to establish plans of how to manage and mitigate residual
         risks. Such plans should include emergency planning for nearby communities.
         Several of the tailings impoundments in Armenia are potential sources for ARD. The upstream raised
         design entails a need to collect, and treat the seepages. It also implies a need to line tailings, to stop
         seepages to groundwater. This appears not to be done at any of the larger facilities. There are further
         substantial problems and challenges related to the operation, and design of existing tailings dams.
         There appear to be some realisation of this fact, as several of the larger operators have recently re-
         tained international experts to review designs, and to suggest improvements. Closely related to the is-
         sue of ARD, it is proposed that a system for the classification of mine waste into hazardous or non-haz-
         ardous be established in Armenia. This is commonly based on mine waste leaching tests for which
         there exists well developed standards in a number of countries.
         In terms of the regulation and control of dam designs by the authorities, there is little expertise avail-
         able within Armenia, and the process by which designs for tailings facilities are permitted need to
         reviewed, and substantially improved.
         The funds available for closure and remediation of mine operations are inadequate. It will be neces-
         sary to ensure that payments into the fund are substantially increased, and that the rationale of how
         the fund is set up is revised. Furthermore, as many of the now operating mines have a history of be-
         ing state run operations, a part of the liability and responsibility for ensuring that they are safe, may
         accrue on the Armenian government (depending upon the agreements made during privatisation, c.f.
         the findings and recommendations of Chapter 8).
         There may be some possibilities for retreating some of the existing tailings impoundments, and in
         this way addressing both environmental issues and creating economic opportunities However, for this
         occur, proper site investigations need to be performed, and it is suggested that this may be done by
         private operators, in the same way as is the case with exploration and mining. Thus, there is no need
         for special treatment in law, neither in the defining of these deposits as “man-made mines”, nor the
         enactment of special laws for the exploitation of specific sites. Furthermore, it is important to ensure
         that the “polluter pays” principle is followed, and that the state does not unwittingly take on substan-
         tial environmental liabilities, which rightfully belong to private owners and/or operators.
         In terms of old and no longer used mine waste sites, these are creating substantial contamination, and
         may also in some cases represent risk for failures. There have been some initiatives taken to assess,
         and also remediate at least one site. However, there is a need for a government led and funded pro-
100                                                              Armenia: Strategic Mineral Sector Sustainability Assessment



      gramme to be established, which entails risk assessment and subsequent remediation of prioritised
      pollution stocks.
      Overall, there is a dearth of experience and knowledge of how to design and manage tailings im-
      poundments, and this is true both within the mining companies as well as within government. For
      government, capacity building and training is urgently needed, and this must also be associated with
      an effort to close the regulatory gap that now exists in terms of permitting, and controlling tailings
      facilities. Similarly, among the companies there is a need to improve capacity. In this regard, a private
      sector led initiative of how to best design, build and operate tailings impoundments would be useful.
      For such an imitative to become reality requires the establishment of a business interest group, such
      as an Armenian Chamber of Mines.

9.	          Summary sustainability assessment and
             recommendations
         This concluding chapter presents a basis for how the sustainability of the mining sector may be con-
         sidered (9.1), and built on this, makes an overall assessment as to what extent mining in Armenia can
         be seen to be contributing to sustainable development. This is performed by summarising the findings
         of the report, and considering these findings through the concepts of economic, environmental and
         social sustainability (9.2 – 9.5). The summary assessment is followed by recommendations for actions
         to be taken to improve the situation. These recommendations are, in turn, divided into actions to be
         included in a process of establishing a mining policy for Armenia (9.6); and actions that need to be
         taken irrespective of the outcomes or timing of the process of policy development (9.7).


9.1	         Basis for sustainability assessment
         How to best define sustainable development is a contested subject (e.g. Kolk, 2016), and the con-
         cept’s applicability specifically to minerals extraction has been challenged given that such activities
         involve the extraction of non-renewable - although near indestructible - resources (e.g. Whitmore,
         2006). Nevertheless, the three components that commonly is said to underpin sustainability – that is
         environmental, social and economic – form a useful framework in which to assess the performance of
         the Armenian minerals sector (Figure 9.1). This in spite of assertions by some that businesses or other
         activities that reach true sustainability, represented by the area in figure 9.1 where all spheres of sus-
         tainability intersect, are rare in any modern, industrial or post-industrial society.




 Figure 9.1 Illustration of the three spheres of sustainability. A truly sustainable project / initiative will be posi-
 tioned in the area where all (environmental, social and economic) sustainability criteria are met.

         A sustainable minerals sector is one where the environmental impacts caused are well managed, and
         where contamination from operations do not escape beyond site perimeters. The operations must not
102                                                                 Armenia: Strategic Mineral Sector Sustainability Assessment



        represent a significant risk to surrounding communities and/or land uses in terms of accidental spills
        or geotechnical failures of waste facilities. In terms of social issues, operations should enjoy overall
        support by the local populations (a “social license”). The economic performance should be strong
        and reliable to ensure operational continuity, and the economic benefits accrued should be equitably
        shared, so as to create opportunities and development. If it is a large operation, such developments
        should occur over regional or even country wide scale.


9.2.	      Economic sustainability
        The mining sector is shown to be an important contributor to the Armenian national economy, above
        all as a source for export incomes, foreign direct investments, and for creating relatively high paid work
        opportunities outside of urban centres. It is further shown that it is better at providing tax related in-
        comes to the state compared to most other sectors.
        However, the sector is in terms of production and value created dominated by the ZCMC’s Kajaran
        mine, as this is the only “large” operation that exists. There are also a small number of mines that may
        be referred to as medium scale (e.g. Agarak, Kapan-Shahumyan, Teghut, Sotk). In addition, there are
        numerous operations in both the metals (about 10) and non-metals sector (about 500) which are all
        small, and rather insignificant in terms of their contributions to national welfare. The fact that the Ar-
        menian minerals sector is dominated by one single operation, makes it vulnerable to possible external
        shocks (e.g. changes in commodity prices and/or accidents and emergencies) and thus threatens its
        longer term sustainability.
        Economic data from the last 5 years made available by the MoF suggest that only two, or three, of the
        existing metal mining operations have been making regular and stable profits (including the dominant
        operator, ZCMC). The less profitable (or loss making) companies notably include most, if not, all small
        companies that hold mining licenses. Mining operations that commonly make losses, cannot be seen
        to be sustainable from an economic point of view. Thus, it appears that mining permits have been
        granted for unviable projects. This finding is made even more significant in the light that the last 7-8
        years represent a period of historically high commodity prices. Further, this poor economic perfor-
        mance has been happening at the same time as inadequate resources have been invested in pollution
        prevention, and environmental management (c.f. above).
        Armenia’s geology, that is the rocks that underlie the country, are prospective for mining. With regards
        to metals, there exist opportunities for copper and gold mining, and also other metals. With regards
        to industrial minerals, there is a great variety of rocks that can be utilised. However, the mining and
        exploration related activities that take place today are to a dominant extent based upon the work
        performed during Soviet times. There has been very little in terms of new exploration, and new finds
        made in the last few decades. This lengthy period with no geological research and prospecting activ-
        ities can, in turn, lead to their eventually being insufficient known resources and reserves that can
        sustain the sector. This in itself threatens the economic sustainability of the sector, but also, given the
        relative importance of the sector, the Armenian economy as a whole.
        Forming linkages with other sectors of the local economy represents a good way of enhancing eco-
        nomic performance and sustainability. Findings suggest that although linkages and “local content” ex-
        ist, there could be considerable scope for increasing the participation of local and Armenian business-
        es within the wider mining sector. Importantly, the roles that may be assumed by local entrepreneurs
        can also include more knowledge based services, such as technical consulting, and services related to
        geological exploration.

9.3.	        Environmental sustainability
         With regards to metal mining, none of the existing operations can be seen to be environmentally sus-
         tainable. The main problems relate to:
         There are a significant number of small companies involves in poorly managed brown field “explora-
         tion projects” (which appear to often assume the nature of small scale mining projects,) that are con-
         cerned with mineralisation discovered (and corresponding reserves established) during Soviet times,
         and these are creating substantial damage to the environment;
         there is significant ongoing pollution emanating from existing mines and processing activities, both to
         air and water;
         there is an overall lack of adequate plans and funds to enable reclamation and rehabilitation of mine
         sites, and associated waste facilities. What exist in the “Nature and protection and reclamation fund” is
         inadequate for its purpose, and in cases when the operations have had a history of being state owned
         (before privatisation) there has been no formal division of liability between the state and the new
         owner;
         given the high seismic risk, and overall high risk for land instability, there exist excessive risks for waste
         facility collapses and/or accidents, caused by the inappropriate method of construction (the use of
         “upstream raise” designs) that is used for tailings impoundment construction;
         in the non-metal and metal sector alike, mined out areas are commonly left without any significant
         efforts made for rehabilitation and reclamation.
         Environmental laws and regulations that could potentially address most, if not all of the above prob-
         lems exist. However, either these laws are not properly implemented, and there are significant prob-
         lems related to legal ambiguity and of laws not being streamlined. There are also concerns that the
         fines and consequences for not being in compliance with existing environmental laws are, in fact low
         and do not constitute a sufficient deterrent. Further, among many companies, especially the smaller
         ones, there may be a lack of knowledge of laws, as well as a poor understanding of what is required in
         order to be compliant with laws.
         Furthermore, the existence of a large number of no-longer mined, or no longer used mines and waste
         facilities which have no legal owner, represent a very significant environmental liability. Such facil-
         ities are causing significant and ongoing environmental damage. There may exist opportunities for
         economic re-mining/reprocessing of some of these sites although experience from other countries
         suggest that the bulk of the liabilities will need to be addressed by government through rehabilitation
         and mitigating measures. Some legacy sites are left without remediation or rehabilitation, as a result
         of the authorities’ ambition to preserve existing mineral reserves.


9.4	         Social sustainability
         The social component is possibly the most difficult component to assess. This is in part due to the fact
         that the social challenges that exist in the mining sector are inexorably linked with more general chal-
         lenges that exist in the wider Armenian society.
         Mining operations are providing jobs and livelihoods, and they do so in many areas where other eco-
         nomic opportunities are scarce. Further, in some communities, especially in Syunik, support for opera-
         tions among local communities appears to be relatively strong. At the same time, one cannot say that
         there exist a widespread “social license to operate” for miners in Armenia. This lack of widespread
         support can, in turn, be seen to be rooted in real shortcomings on environmental and economic issues
         (see above). A prevailing culture of secrecy that is prevalent in the sector (on part of both companies
104                                                                 Armenia: Strategic Mineral Sector Sustainability Assessment



        and authorities), hinders meaningful public participation as well decision making that is based on true
        and factual information. Initiatives to make such data publicly available for public scrutiny are there-
        fore needed. In a similar vein, initiatives are needed to address the sometime seen cases of conflict of
        interest related set ups where current or former elected politicians engage in mineral project devel-
        opment.
        Although there exist a substantial number of qualified mine workers in Armenia, there appears to be a
        lack of persons with more advanced skills (engineers, geologists, mining economists etc.). The lack of
        local management capacity is representing a constraint to the social sustainability of the operations.
        Similarly, women are severely underrepresented in the sector. This does not only represent a waste
        of skills and abilities, but also undoubtedly contributes to less well balanced and less well functioning
        work places, and mine communities.


9.5.	      Summary assessment
        Overall, none of the existing metal mining operators in Armenia can be said to be in line with all three
        components of sustainability, and available evidence suggest that the same is likely to be the case for
        the majority of the non-metal mining operations in the country. Further, there are examples of opera-
        tions that appear unviable in terms of all three components of sustainability, and this is appears to es-
        pecially prevalent among the smaller operators in the metal mining sector. The reasons for the short-
        comings are found in a mixture of failings, including companies’ irresponsible behaviour, as well as
        failures by the institutions that are charged with supervising and controlling these activities. Some fail-
        ings in the regulatory framework are also of importance as a reason for some specific failings, although
        the overall conclusions is that what exist in terms of laws and regulations is fairly comprehensive and
        ambitious, and although the regulatory system suffers from problems related to ambiguity and lack of
        streamlining between different laws, the main problems relate to a failure of implementation of laws.
        Importantly, it is suggested a significant part of the overall controversy that surrounds mineral related
        projects in Armenia is caused by a lack of understanding and data, and also a lack of knowledge of
        best practice and technology in modern mining activities. With regards to the former, the ongoing
        work in preparing an EITI candidature application, and the work that is entailed in the subsequent im-
        plementation of the EITI standard will contribute substantially to establishing a better understanding
        of the sector. With regards to technology, there may exist considerable opportunity introduce more
        modern, safer and environmentally more friendly technologies in the sector. A further consideration in
        this regards relate to the suitability of SME involvement in the mining sector. Whereas the exploration
        field and possibly also some forms of quarrying and dimension stone extraction constitutes suitable
        areas for SME involvement and development, actual metal mining and processing may be one of the
        least suitable sectors for such SME participation. This follows as such activities, if they are to be done
        properly, require longer term management and stewardship, as well as access to considerable re-
        sources and funds to operate a mine, also in times of lower commodity prices or after accidents and/
        or mishaps.
        In conclusion, data show that mining is important to Armenian society, but it also suggest that individ-
        ual operations are not generally contributing sufficiently to the longer term sustainable development
        of the nation. This is in spite of a range of past and ongoing initiatives taken by the Armenian regula-
        tors to reform the sector. These initiatives have, however, been taken without reference to a policy or
        longer term strategy. Thus, this report’s main recommendation is to urgently embark on a process of
        developing a national mining policy (9.6). Such a process will take at least one year to complete, and it
        is strongly recommended that the process for developing said policy is coupled with the efforts made
        in making Armenia an EITI compliant country. Whilst the process of policy development is ongoing, it is
        recommended that non-urgent reforms and legislative developments aimed for the mining sector are

         put on hold. There are, however, some priority actions and initiatives that are needed irrespective of
         the outcomes of policy development, and recommendations for these are also provided (9.7).


9.6.	        Development of an Armenian mining policy
         The worlds commodity markets are presently depressed, with generally low prices and low demand.
         However, the mining sector is cyclical and sooner or later, there will be an upswing in the market, and
         new investment will follow. Thus, the present is a fortuitous time for mining policy development, to en-
         sure that when the next wave of development and investments arrives, Armenia will be well prepared
         to manage the various challenges and opportunities that such times entail.
         There exist a number of initiatives that assist countries in developing mining policies (e.g. there is a
         wide range of recommendations and policy documents published by the World Bank, and think tanks
         such as IGF, IISD, NRGI etc.), and these can all serve as useful inspiration and references for the de-
         velopment of a policy for Armenia. The main point of having a policy is that it helps in ensuring that
         development and regulation of the sector holds together, and contributes to the achievement of an
         overall vision for national development. Furthermore, the process of developing a policy is important
         in itself as - if it is done well and in a participatory way - it provides an opportunity to build consensus
         and a shared understanding of issues among affected stakeholders.
         It is suggested that the development of the mining policy be based on a vision for the characteristics
         of a future Armenian minerals sector. Bearing in mind the results of the present assignment, and the
         fact that Armenia is committed to becoming an EITI candidate country, the broad vision could include
         that the sector needs to contribute to sustainable and equitable economic development; that benefits
         should be shared at the national level, whilst ensuring that communities that are directly impacted by
         minerals related projects are not adversely affected economically or socially, and not either exposed
         to excessive risks related to possible emergencies or accidents.
         In establishing the vision, it would be helpful to paint a rather concrete picture of what the sector could
         look like. For example, based on the findings and recommendations of this report it is suggested that
         the future situation could be one where there are fewer mines and quarries but that these have con-
         siderably larger production than today. Further, the operations should be more mechanised and mod-
         ern and performing in an environmentally responsible way, and with adequate concerns for health
         and safety of their workers. In addition, there should at any given time exist advanced exploration
         projects, in turn based on the outcomes from an active and innovative exploration sector. The sector
         as a whole need to be supported by linkages to local businesses and consultancy companies and all of
         these should to a dominant degree hire well qualified Armenian staff that have had the opportunity to
         receive high quality training both locally and internationally.
         Basic questions that may be addressed in the process of policy development include which type of
         mines (commodity, size, ownership, etc.) can meaningfully contribute to sustainable development
         goals; what economic development (national, regional, local) related to mining shall be promoted;
         what shall be the roles and responsibilities of the state and the companies and their owners. These
         types of questions can be addresses through the formulation of a small number (no more than about
         10) of policy statements, which together contribute to achieving the overall vision. These statements
         are the commitments by government, and they could address a number of issues, as exemplified in
         Table 9.1.
106                                                                 Armenia: Strategic Mineral Sector Sustainability Assessment

 Value addition, local content and Should there be requirements for utilising locally sourced staff and
 linkages                          equipment?
         The development of the policy will, in a similar way to the EITI process, provide an opportunity for
         broader cooperation/interaction between institutions, as well as among civil society and private com-
         panies. Thus, it is suggested that he process for policy development be coupled to the EITI process,
         and also that it is managed in a similar way. Thus, it is suggested that there could be an implementing
         group, chaired by the Ministry of Finance (or PM), and including the sector ministries and authorities
         that are most concerned (MoENR, MoE, MoNP). The consultative process should include CSOs, private
         companies, local community representatives from mining districts, as well as central and regional au-
         thorities. Although it may be both prudent and useful to coordinate efforts with the EITI process, for
         example through making use of the multi stakeholder group, this must be done whilst being mindful
         of the risk of this causing disruptions and/or delays to the EITI process.
         The implementation of the policy, once completed, should include a number of diagnostic studies,
         that will fill the knowledge gaps that exist, and thus ensuring that policy implementation is done whilst
         having a true and reliable understanding of the current situation (the baseline). The diagnostic studies,
         will also serve to identify the means and measures (technical, financial, human resources) necessary
         for achieving the policy. The following diagnostic studies are recommended, most of which may to an
         extent build upon the findings of this present report:


 Sectoral Environmental and Social Assessment
 Assessment of the main environmental and social issues, and provision of practical proposals for how any
 negative issues identified can be addressed, and positive development opportunities facilitated. In such
 a study, considerations for how to apportion environmental liability in operations that have previously
 been state owned may be addressed.

 Geotechnical risk assessment
 Identification and description of the risks represented by existing geotechnical structures and methods for
 design used in Armenia.
 Proposals for possible regulatory changes to reduce any identified excessive risks, and including assess-
 ment of feasibility.

9.7.	        Priority actions and initiatives
         Recommendations for priority actions and initiatives are provided below. Some of these will be to vary-
         ing degrees be addressed in the EITI process. Thus, one overall and strong recommendation is that the
         ongoing work towards implementing EITI and achieving candidate status is continued. Consequently,
         the priority actions and initiatives below are classified as being addressed (wholly or in part) through
         the EITI, whereas the remainder are classified as being urgent, and in need to be initiated immediately.
         These urgent actions concern areas where there is a high risk to human health and wellbeing, related
         to accidents or emergencies, but also concern the need to coordinate existing efforts and projects that
         support the development Armenian mining sector. The remainder are actions are seen to be needed
         in either the medium (initiated within 24 months), or in the longer term (> 24 months).

 Issues that shall be addressed (whole or in part) by the EITI:

                                                     sector among the public at large. EITI requirement 7 will further en-
                                                     sure that impact and importance of the sector is discussed in a wider
                                                     public debate.

                                                     “road map” for mining investments, and thus may assist in attracting
                                                     new and responsible investors to the sector.
 Collect and make available existing                 EITI requirement 3 includes the disclosure of information related to
 data                                                mining production, exploration and exports. This will contribute to the
                                                     need to collect and make available existing geological data.

                                          be encouraged to form company organisations, such as a Chamber of
                                          Mines & Minerals, that can champion/lead efforts to improve business

Appendix 1: Methodology for input-output analytical
framework
          The first Social-Accounting matrix for Armenia was constructed in 2008 by National Statistical Service
          of Armenia (NSS) to implement tax policy analysis using computable general equilibrium (CGE) models.
          The cornerstone of the social accounting matrix are the input-output coefficients of the economy’s
          main sectors, which describe the structure of output of any given sector in terms of inputs obtained
          from other sectors of the economy.
          To estimate the social economic contribution of the mining sector an input–output model is construct-
          ed from observed data for the year 2012 (the last year for which all the relevant economic data is
          available). The level of sector disaggregation enables us to test the consequences of changes in output
          in the mining sector. Despite the fact that real inter-industry flows are units of goods (1 ton of steel
          from manufacturing to construction or 3 tons of stone flow from mining to manufacturing) all the
          transactions are represented in monetary terms.
          Though conceptually based on 2008 NSS matrix, for current estimation purposes only several in-
          put-output coefficients of the old SAM are applied. To retrieve the coefficients additional steps were
          undertaken, which are described below under supply and demand side groupings.
          Supply Side. The first step in the construction of the table is the disaggregation and distribution of data
          in production account by economic activities. For practical reasons of data availability disaggregation
          of economic activities according to NACE 1 was applied. All the aggregated information for this task is
          contained in the production account of SNA of Armenia.
          Distribution of various types of taxes by economic activities has been implemented using statistical
          survey of top 1000 taxpayers of Armenia. Distribution of exports as well as imports by economic activ-
          ities by special “correspondence table” which has been developed by “AVAG Solutions” LLC. This table
          maps data from the set of commodity nomenclature at 8-digit level into the NACE1. Despite the fact
          that mapping contains some degree of approximation, overall, this approximation cannot distort data
          significantly.
          Demand Side. By assumptions overall demand for any activity X can be represented as a sum of in-
          termediate and final demands. Intermediate demand by itself represents sales of the particular sector
          to all other sectors. Final demands in the model include several distinguished categories represented
          hereafter.
          Final demand of Households
          Final demand of Government
          Final investment Demand
          Total Exports
          Distribution of consumption by household was implemented using “Households Integrated Living Con-
          ditions Survey anonymized micro data”13 which is published by NSS yearly14. Distribution of govern-
          ment expenditures has been completed using state budget data and publication of NSS.




    13	  Database available at: http://armstat.am/en/?nid=271
    14	 Some approximations were required here because distribution of consumption by economic activities
in mentioned survey does not exactly match economic activities that are applied in national accounts.

                                   water via a 3.5 x 3.0m tunnel constructed through the in-situ rock on the
                                   western abutment. The tunnel (Tunnel 3) discharges directly into the River
                                   Okhtar (also referred to as the River Artsvanik). There were previous decant
                                   towers and two earlier tunnels – these have become obsolete as the towers
                                   are now buried (or almost buried) by tailings. The obsolete Tunnel 2 still has
                                   groundwater seepage that enters the tunnel in the dam abutment, and the
                                   collected seepage also enters the River Okhtar/Atrsvanik directly.
                             •	    Runoff water management: At present, surface water runoff from upstream

Issues      •	 No detailed design documentation available for review as part of this current
                     project.
                  •	 The upstream raise method is not advisable for seismically active areas as
                     liquefaction of the tailings during seismic events results in a high probability
                     of instability (catastrophic dam wall failure and flow slide). In mitigation, the
                     upper slope sector has been designed at a very low overall slope inclination
                     and the probability of failure is lower. However, the historic lower slope
                     sector has a higher slope inclination that would have a higher probability of
                     failure during an extreme seismic event, and it lies immediately above the
                     town of Syunik. The results of the review and re-design by the international
                     consultancy engaged by the operator is likely to address these issues.
                  •	 Decant pond water is discharged directly to the environment. In mitigation,
                     it is understood that there are proposals to create a decant water treatment
                     facility such that the decant water meets German water quality standards for
                     industrial discharges.
                  •	 The thin layer of restoration material on the outer dam slopes is prone to
                     erosion and exposure tailings with resultant surface water runoff transport
                     into water courses.
                  •	 There is no clear proposal with regard to the restoration proposals for the
                     upper dam surface at closure. This could be related to the fact that the de-
                     posit is regarded as a ‘man-made-mine’ and presumably could be subject to
                     reworking in the future. While the costs associated with top surface resto-
                     ration might not be considered justifiable in such a case, it results in a poten-
                     tial gap for exposure to dusting issues between the period defined by initial
                     closure and reworking.

 ARTSVANIK TSF (ZCMC CJSC)
 Overall sum- •	 The current TSF design would be considered unacceptable in terms of its
 mary            robustness with respect to physical instability compared with international
                                   standards (upstream raise in a seismic area). However, the slopes of the dam
                                   are not as steep as with other examples within Armenia and the probability
                                   of failure is lower. Notwithstanding this, the lower slope section (at 1V:6H)
                                   that lies immediately above the village of Syunik and warrants a detailed
                                   risk assessment plus implementation of risk mitigation measures. The upper
                                   slope section, at ~1V:10H has a lower probability of failure, but still requires
                                   a detailed risk assessment to ensure that the risk levels are acceptable.
                             •	 The pond water management measures within the design are adequate with
                                respect to the probability of overtopping, provided that the decant system
                                functions as designed.
                             •	 The probability of ARD generation is considered to be low and no specific
                                measures with respect to long term seepage control / treatment are likely to
                                be needed.
                             •	 The operator has indicated that studies and associated mitigation measures
                                in relation to i) stability risks and ii) pond water discharge quality are to be
                                implemented.
                             •	 The downstream restoration cover is inadequate in relation to generally-ac-
                                cepted standards. This is a relatively minor consideration when compared to
                                other issues.

                  •	 The upstream limit of the overall TSF is formed by an earth fill dam struc-
                     ture. This effectively represents a surface water holding structure for sur-
                     face water (clean) runoff that flows down the Geghanush Valley upstream
                     of the TSF. The runoff water is subsequently diverted via a tunnel located
                     in the eastern abutment of the TSF storage basin.

                  •	 Runoff water management: Upstream diversion dam and tunnel. Side
                     slope channels to collect runoff from the side slopes above the tailings
                     storage area. The tailings beaches are relatively steep and the earth fill
                     bunds used for dam raising result in an adequate freeboard – hence it is
                     unlikely that overtopping can occur (provided that good pond water man-
                     agement is applied in the case of adverse conditions, such as the blockage
                     of the decant system).
                  •	 Seepage water from the TSF is collected at a polishing / holding pond just
                     beyond the downstream toe. This pond overtopped and the walls were
                     destroyed in 2011. Now re-built.
                  •	 International consultants have been engaged to review dam design. Seep-
                     age control measures have recently been installed within the dam wall
                     (sand drains) in order to manage the groundwater levels within the wall.
                  •	 There are proposals (advice and design by international consultants) to
                     construct a new dam wall of rock fill downstream of the current dam wall
                     in order to increase the stability of the overall downstream slope. This will
                     apparently change the fundamental TSF design from an upstream raise
                     to a centre-line raise. It will also provide more storage volume. Locals are
                     sceptical about the proposals, viewing them simply as a means of increas-
                     ing the dam storage capacity, and are apparently not taking into account
                     the benefits of increased stability.

 Issues                         •	 No design documentation available for review.
                                •	 The operating company did not respond to requests for a formal site visit.
                                •	 The upstream raise method requires seepage to exit via the permeable toe
                                   structure (starter dam) to ensure that the tailings wall can drain efficiently.
                                   If this does not occur, high groundwater levels within the dam wall can
                                   lead to instability. However, this issue has been partly mitigated already by
                                   the provision of additional seepage control measures within the dam wall
                                   (sand drains). Furthermore, the issue of seepage and groundwater levels
                                   within the dam structure will be addressed comprehensively by the con-

 Overall sum-                   •	 According to the former Dundee employee, the tailings have a very low or

 Issues    •	 The upstream raise method requires seepage to exit via rock fill toe structure to ensure
                              that the tailings wall can drain efficiently. If this does not occur, high groundwater levels
                              within the dam wall can lead to instability. However, this efficient drainage required for
                              dam stability implies that potential ARD seepage will always need to exit via the rock fill
                              toe, hence there will be a long term issue regarding collection and treatment of ARD.
                         •	   The upstream raise method is not advisable for seismically active areas as liquefaction of
                              the tailings during seismic events results in a high probability of instability (catastrophic
                              dam wall failure and flow slide).
                         •	   The Rate of Rise (RoR) for the structure varies during the dam life, but is considered to
                              be extremely high (based upon available information) and is well beyond the maximum
                              recommended RoR for upstream raises. The internationally accepted maximum RoR is
                              ~3m per year (this can be higher in arid areas). The RoR for this structure appears to
                              vary between 42m per year initially and 4.3m per year at the end of the life of the dam.
                              The high RoR can result in static liquefaction of the tailings (as distinct from the dynamic
                              liquefaction of tailings due to seismic shaking).
                         •	   The upstream raise slope is 1V:4.5H which would be fine for a TSF in a non-seismic area
                              and with a reasonable RoR (<3m per year). However, in this case, there is the potential
                              for seismic activity and the RoR is extreme, hence the probability for instability of the
                              dam wall is high.
                         •	   The TSF is located in a steeply incised valley (at least during the early years). This places
                              reliance on the ability of the structure to seep through the sidewalls (as well as the rock
                              fill toe structure) to avoid instability issues for the tailings raise wall that abuts onto the
                              steep valley sides.
                         •	   The change between the concept of the lined ‘base’ of the TSF and the ‘side slopes’ is
                              unclear. The steep valley side slopes will not be conducive to the placement of a clay
                              liner (it is difficult to place liners on slopes steeper than 1V:2.5H). Hence, seepage will
                              occur through the upper (unlined) valley walls. This seepage could be acidic in the medi-
                              um to long term and its control is difficult as it can disperse into the natural groundwater
                              system prior to capture and treatment via specifically-designed mitigation measures.
                         •	   If the side slopes of the valley were to be lined, this would restrict seepage from the tail-
                              ings mass, and all seepage would be required to exit via the rock fill toe structure. This
                              is located in the narrow mouth of the valley and its capacity to draw down the ground-
                              water within the tailings (if the whole tailings basin is lined) might not be sufficient. This
                              illustrates, for an upstream dam design, the conflict between the goals of i) maximising
                              seepage to ensure efficient drainage of the tailings mass and ii) minimising / controlling
                              seepage to ensure protection of the environment.
                         •	   There is no comprehensive groundwater risk assessment associated with the design.
                              The provision of a basal clay liner appears to have been incorporated simply as a generic
                              mitigation measure that can be seen to address contaminated seepage issues for the
                              purposes of regulatory approval. There is not sufficient detail within the design nor in
                              the environmental impact assessment that can demonstrate the effectiveness of the
                              lining system.
                         •	   There has been no risk assessment with regards to dam failure (whether this occurs from
                              seismic activity, excessive rate of rise or poor pond water control that initiates overtop-
                              ping and subsequent dam failure). There is no flow slide assessment or pond water inun-
                              dation assessment. Potential environmental impacts could be broadly estimated, but the

                       and benches.

                  •	   Pond water management: appears to be via a decant tower at the rear
                       (up-valley) end of the TSF. Not clear if water exits via a buried decant culvert
                       or if it is pumped from the tower.
                  •	   Upstream earth fill dam holds a pond of runoff water. It is unclear if water is
                       directed via a surface channel around the perimeter or if this pond water is
                       discharged beneath the tailings deposit via a culvert.
Issues            •	   No design documentation available for review.
                  •	 The operating company did not respond to requests for a formal site visit.
                  •	 The upstream raise method requires seepage to exit via a permeable toe
                     structure (starter dam) to ensure that the tailings wall can drain efficiently. If
                     this does not occur, high groundwater levels within the dam wall can lead to
                     instability. However, this efficient drainage required for dam stability implies
                     that potential ARD seepage will always need to exit via the toe, hence there
                     will be a long term issue regarding collection and treatment of ARD.
                  •	 It appears that ARD is already forming on the lower exposed slopes of the
                     tailings raise.
                  •	 Runoff erosion appears to be occurring down the dam abutments (where
                     the downstream slope abuts the natural ground. However, it is also possible
                     that the erosion is being caused by seepage from the natural ground via
                     fissures within the bedrock – this is a more serious issue as it implies a high
                     groundwater level within the dam wall that implies a lower level of stability
                     when compared to a well-drained structure.
                  •	 The upstream raise method is not advisable for seismically active areas as
                     liquefaction of the tailings during seismic events results in a high probability
                     of instability (catastrophic dam wall failure and flow slide).
                  •	 The TSF is located in a steeply incised valley (at least during the early years).
                     This places reliance on the ability of the structure to seep through the side-
                     walls (as well as the rock fill toe structure) to avoid instability issues for the
                     tailings raise wall that abuts onto the steep valley sides.
                  •	 There appears to be little freeboard, hence the correct management of pond
                     water is critical if overtopping is to be avoided.

                                       part of a restoration effort.

                                    •	 The dam was constructed using the upstream method, with the walls
                                       being formed of coarse tailings.

                                    •	 There are two distinct downstream slope sectors (upper and lower). The
                                       lower is estimated as being 8 to 10m high at ~1V:3H and the upper is
                                       estimated as being 12 to 15m high, also at ~1V:3H. However, no topo-

                                       erosion gullies within the restoration soils, exposing tailings.

                                    •	 There is some evidence of ARD (oxidation of exposed tailings). The
                                       hazard level / magnitude associated with ARD for the dam structure is

NAZIK TSF
Hazard identifi-   •	 Potential ARD production. This would impact groundwater quality and
cation                this could manifest as contaminated seepage into the adjacent River
                      Shamlugh. Surface runoff from exposed tailings could result in ARD con-
                      tamination of runoff. The assumption at this stage (for the purposes of
                      illustrating the mitigation costs) is that the hazard level (probability and
                      magnitude) is sufficient to warrant mitigation. It could transpire that the
                      rate of release of ARD does not justify any mitigation measures at all. As
                      part of a more detailed preliminary assessment, the ARD levels within
                      the River Shamlugh from upstream sources needs to be assessed. Such
                      a study could identify other tailings deposits that should be either i)
                      included as part of a more holistic mitigation plan or ii) prioritised ahead
                      of mitigation for the Nazik TSF.
                   •	 Dusting. Low assessed hazard level given the presence of restoration
                      cover, even though this is of low quality. Future surface water runoff
                      erosion could increase the hazard level as more tailings are exposed in
                      the unmitigated state (i.e. current poor quality cover).
                   •	 Dam wall instability. The downstream dam wall sectors are relatively
                      steep and are seen as being susceptible to liquefaction during seismic
                      events. However, the probability of this occurring cannot be quantified
                      since the groundwater / pore water pressure conditions within TSF and
                      the other geotechnical conditions are unknown. The environmental haz-
                      ard level associated with the primary mechanism of dam failure is as-
                      sessed as being medium. The societal hazard level (potential for loss of
                      life) associated with the primary mechanism of dam failure is assessed
                      as being low since there are no human receptors in the likely flow path
                      (depth / distance) of a tailings slide. However, there is a secondary haz-
                      ard identified in that a slump of the dam wall into the relatively narrow
                      valley of the River Shamlugh at the immediate dam toe could block
                      flows within the river, thereby backing up the flow and the formation of
                      a pond upstream of the blockage. This slumped material, being unsta-
                      ble, could then fail and there would be the potential for a flow slide /
                      water release event that has the potential to impact low-lying dwellings
                      in the downstream area. This scenario has a low probability of occur-
                      ring, but must nonetheless be considered.
                   •	 Overtopping. There is no permanent pond on the top surface of the TSF,
                      but it is located in a valley. Runoff during extreme rainfall events could
                      result in severe erosion of the downstream face, but it is not envisaged
                      that there would be an associated general dam wall failure given the
                      non-operational status of the structure. Overtopping hazard is therefore
                      assessed as being of a negligible to low level.

 Envisaged miti-              •	 ARD hazard mitigation (medium to long term). Primarily via the placement of a low
 gation measures                 permeability geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) on the top surface and downstream slopes
                                 of the TSF. The assumptions made at this stage are that i) the reduction of infiltration
                                 rates into the TSF will reduce production rates of ARD in the medium to long term to
                                 satisfactory levels and ii) the groundwater level within the TSF will deplete to a level
                                 below the base of the TSF in the medium term owing to the lower infiltration rates.
                              •	 ARD mitigation (short term). The placement of the GCL surface liner will reduce in-
                                 filtration rates once it is placed. However, there will be a time delay in the reduction
                                 of seepage rates from the TSF that arise from current infiltration to the steady-state
                                 condition with the low permeability cover. It is therefore assumed that a passive
                                 limestone-filled ARD treatment trench at the overall tone of the TSF will be required
                                 in the short term to mitigate ARD seepage during the groundwater drawdown peri-
                                 od. It should be noted that there might not be complete drawdown of the ground-
                                 water levels within the TSF since natural groundwater seepage into the tailings could
                                 still occur via the in-situ ground forming the tailings storage basin (depends upon
                                 in-situ groundwater levels). For the purposes of this mitigation costing exercise, it
                                 is assumed that the groundwater levels in the surrounding in-situ ground are be-
                                 low the minimum tailings storage level i.e. a simple cover on top of the tailings will
                                 control infiltration and ARD production rates and there will eventually be complete
                                 drawdown of groundwater within the TSF.
                              •	 Dusting mitigation. This would be addressed as part of the ARD mitigation (low per-
                                 meability top cover) since the GCL will need a protective soil cover. In additional to
                                 GCL protection, this soil cover would act as a restoration layer that would support
                                 vegetation which would control surface erosion.
                              •	 Dam wall instability hazard mitigation. There is no available space at the toe of the
                                 dam to provide for physical buttressing to strengthen / stabilise the slope (unless
                                 a culvert were built within the River Shamlugh and fill were placed above the cul-

                                 will eventually reduce to such an extent that there will be no saturated tailings and
                                 therefore the probability of liquefaction during a seismic event would be negligible.
                                 Furthermore, the loss of life risk is assessed to be low for the primary instability
                                 event and the loss of life risk for the secondary event is also low given the low prob-
                                 ability of the river blockage scenario described above. Notwithstanding this, there
                                 would clearly be environmental impacts associated with the primary instability
                                 event, although these would be of limited magnitude and duration. Taking into ac-
                                 count the foregoing considerations, a preliminary cost-benefit assessment suggests
                                 that the do-nothing scenario would represent an appropriate approach. Notwith-
                                 standing this, it has been decided to include the mitigation measure of dam wall
                                 strengthening via stone columns simply to illustrate the potential costs involved.
                              •	 Overtopping. There are no identified significant risks associated with overtopping
                                 and the mitigation measures are limited to ensuring that the GCL / restoration cover
                                 is sustainable. The provision of a simple runoff channel system is required.

                      the GCL, ALD and stone columns are not required, the total costs would reduce
                      by around US$ 260,000 for the contracting costs alone. It is possible that the
                      ARD mitigation measures could be eliminated at the preliminary investigation
                      stage (following initial water quality sampling), further reducing the overall

 Issue           Mitigation          Comments
 ARD             Low permea-         Used to limit infiltration from rainfall hence reduce the production rate of ARD.
                 bility cover        Achieved by placing one (or a combination of) i) compacted clayey soils, ii) low permeability
                                     geomembrane iii) geosynthetic clay liner.
                                     Compacted clay cover: Sometimes difficult to locate a suitable source of material within a
                                     reasonable distance from the site. Minimum thickness normally 0.5m. Requires Construction
                                     Quality Assurance (CQA) for placement. Can desiccate in dry weather periods leading to the
                                     opening up of cracks which will compromise its performance unless adequate topsoil cover
                                     is placed on top. Performance can be affected by root penetration of restoration vegetation.
                                     Low permeability geomembrane: Requires good surface preparation prior to placement,
                                     although preparation of tailings generally does not present a major issue. Requires strict CQA
                                     to ensure that damage does not occur during installation. Topsoil and restoration soils are
                                     placed on top of the geomembrane and this often requires the placement of a geotextile on
                                     top of the membrane to protect it from sharp stones / particles within the overlying soils. Re-
                                     stricts root depth development of plants used for restoration. Placement on slopes requires
                                     careful consideration of the stability of any restoration soils that are placed on top of the
                                     geomembrane.
                                     Geosynthetic clay liner: GCL is a commercially-produced low permeability liner formed of a
                                     thin layer (up to 5mm) of clay material (bentonite) sandwiched between 2 layers of geotextile.
                                     Easy to place, requires minimal surface preparation and CQA. Performance can be affected
                                     by root penetration of restoration vegetation. Placement on slopes requires careful consider-
                                     ation of the stability of any restoration soils that are placed on top of the GCL.
 ARD             Store / release     Infiltration is controlled by a suitable thickness and particle grading of a restoration soil cover.
                 cover               The theory is that rainfall infiltration that does occur is stored within the soil cover and then
                                     subsequently evaporated during dry periods. Normally requires a more substantial thickness
                                     of soil cover to act as storage medium. Not efficient for wet climates. Can result in salts rising
                                     up from the underlying tailings and presenting as efflorescence at the surface.

ARD   Capture / in-   ARD can be captured at identified surface seepage points and / or can be intercepted within
      terception of   the ground at likely sub-surface seepage routes using capture trenches or contaminated
      ARD             groundwater extraction wells. Groundwater seepage can also be intercepted by low per-
                      meability cut-off barriers that limit the movement of the contamination away from the pe-
                      rimeter of the facility. In this case, contaminated seepage is manifested at the surface or
                      near-surface and is more readily captured. Once captured or intercepted, the ARD must be
                      directed to a treatment facility.
                      Surface seepage collection: Normally requires some form of low permeability surface trench
                      / pit to effectively capture the seepage. From the final collection point, seepage can be
                      pumped or drained via gravity in pipework to the treatment facility.
                      Groundwater capture (near-surface): Continuous, relatively shallow interceptor trenches
                      can be dug around the toe perimeter of ARD-producing TSFs to a central sump from where
                      ARD is pumped to the treatment facility. The base and downstream side of the trench is nor-
                      mally lined to prevent seepage from simply passing through into the adjacent ground. The
                      capture of near-surface seepage does not address deeper groundwater contamination but
                      can be justified if modelling indicates that the larger part of the ARD issue can be addressed
                      via this measure.
                      Groundwater capture (intermediate depth): This can be achieved by deeper interceptor
                      trenches that are backfilled with granular material and normally incorporate perforated pipe-
                      work to direct captured seepage efficiently to a central sump for subsequent pumping to the
                      treatment facility.
                      Cut-off barriers: Limits horizontal groundwater seepage below the toe of the facility, but
                      does not completely prevent it. Depth of cut-off curtain needs to be determined from hydro-
                      geological modelling. Generally formed by filling a trench (up to ~5m deep) with low perme-
                      ability material such as compacted clay backfill or bentonite slurry wall (the latter requires
                      simultaneous trench formation and cut-off wall formation using specialised equipment). Rel-
                      atively easy for trenches formed in soils, trenches constructed in rock very expensive. For
                      cut-off barriers that need to be deeper, formation of a low permeability curtain can be under-
                      taken by injection of bentonite via rows of boreholes (within soils and / or rock). Wells often
                      need to be closely spaced to form a continuous curtain.
                      Extraction wells: A series of wells is drilled around the perimeter of the facility. Normally
                      each well requires a small pump or syphon that directs captured seepage to a central collec-
                      tion point. Wells often need to be closely spaced. Requires drilling rig. If pumps are installed
                      there is a need for an electricity supply. Overall system prone to breakdowns, theft and van-
                      dalism.

 ARD             Treatment           Treatment of ARD can be achieved by provision of passive anoxic limestone drains. These
                                     can be limestone-gravel-filled trenches constructed around the perimeter of a facility through
                                     which ARD seepage passes and is treated prior to seepage reaching the external environ-
                                     ment). Alternatively, captured / intercepted seepage can be directed to centrally-located an-
                                     oxic limestone drain that does not necessarily have to formed around the toe perimeter of
                                     the facility. Other measures for captured / intercepted ARD can be achieved actively via lime
                                     addition or passively via wetlands (or a combination of the two) or via more sophisticated
                                     treatment plants. The latter is not normally cost effective and is only undertaken where it can
                                     be justified in cases of very high risk cases.
                                     Anoxic limestone drains: Can be formed in a similar manner to cut-off barriers within
                                     trenches around the toe of the facility, but the concept differs in that the trench is designed to
                                     allow flow through it (with passive treatment of ARD taking place). Where a centrally-located
                                     anoxic limestone drain is adopted (easier maintenance, lower volume of limestone generally
                                     required), it must be ensured that ARD seepage from the toe perimeter of the facility is ef-
                                     fectively captured and directed to the anoxic limestone drain. Needs periodic replacement of
                                     limestone once its buffering capacity has been depleted.
                                     Lime addition: Requires installation of mixing tanks. The sludge produced (hydroxides) are
                                     very low density and must be directed to an appropriate storage facility that would should
                                     ideally be maintained in a flooded condition (to prevent re-mobilisation of metals) and nor-
                                     mally needs to be lined. Over the long term, the storage volume requirements can be very
                                     high. It must be ensured that ARD seepage from the toe perimeter of the facility is effectively
                                     captured and directed to the treatment area.
                                     Wetlands: Used where the level of contamination is not too high. Can require high surface ar-
                                     eas for efficient treatment and sizes are contaminant-concentration and flow-rate dependent.
                                     Require refurbishment after 10 – 20 years of operation. Organic materials (plants / sludge)
                                     need to be disposed of adequately as a result of the refurbishment process.
 Dusting         Soil or granular Requires a source of cover material. Soil covers must be adequately vegetated to prevent
                 covers           erosion. Granular covers are less critical in terms of this, but have limited potential for the
                                  establishment of a vegetative cover.
 Dam wall Buttressing                Adopted where the post closure stability of a TSF is deemed to represent a hazard. Large
 instability                         volumes of fill are normally required.
 Dam wall Stone columns              If there is no space for buttressing at the toe of a TSF, the wall itself can be strengthened by in-
 instability                         stalling large diameter stone columns (similar to civil engineering construction piles) at close
                                     spacing along the toe of the dam wall. The concept is to strengthen the wall in the critical toe
                                     zone through which a slip surface would pass, not over the entire slope.
 Dam wall Control of                 Achieved by reducing the groundwater level (phreatic surface / pore water pressures) within
 instability groundwater             and/or behind the dam wall. Can be as simple as forming a toe trench or providing a small
             levels within           buttress of granular material at the toe of the dam wall (passive measures). In more serious
             / behind the            cases, active groundwater extraction wells can be installed up the dam slope to intercept
             dam wall                and reduce the pore water pressures. If the seepage is ARD contaminated, treatment of the
                                     collected water will be required.
 O v e r t o p - Provision of        Final spillways are readily constructed. However, there is often the need to connect the final

         Mitigation measures – capital costs
         The mitigation measures listed within the following cost estimate table is not definitive. The purpose
         is to provide broad estimates for the primary components of the mitigation measures listed. There will
         be secondary or enabling works that are required to support the primary works that are difficult to cost
         due to site-specific conditions. Examples include re-profiling or re-grading of existing TSF topography
         to achieve runoff control and construction of access routes. Furthermore, general contracting costs

       rates for works tend to reduce for larger projects.
       It is very difficult to provide reasonable generic cost estimates since there are generally great variations
       in site specific conditions, such as overall topography (catchment area and TSF), ARD flow rates, ARD
       geochemistry and other site specific characteristics. It is more reasonable to estimate costs for each
       TSF site on a stand-alone basis once a preliminary investigation and desk study has been carried out.

       Mitigation measures – maintenance costs
       Some mitigation measures do not incur ongoing maintenance costs, or any related costs are so small as
       to not warrant consideration. This is generally true for soil and low permeability covers, surface water
       runoff control channels and dam wall stabilisation measures.
       Revegetation requires maintenance in the early years but this requirement drops off once the vegeta-
       tion cover has been established and is self-sustaining.
       The highest maintenance costs are associated with ongoing ARD seepage treatment. Hence, it can be
       seen that a great benefit can be gained by provision of mitigation measures (such as low permeability
       covers) that are aimed at reducing the production of ARD in the medium to long term.
       As with the estimates presented to capital costs above, the cost for ongoing maintenance are only very
       broad estimates and should be treated as such. It is very difficult to provide reasonable cost estimates
       without a knowledge of ARD flow rates, geochemistry and other site specific conditions.
