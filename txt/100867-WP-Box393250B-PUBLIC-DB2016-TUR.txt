THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

from 1 to 189 by the ease of doing business ranking.           Population: 75,837,020

frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where    DB2015 rank: 51*
0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business
2016: starting a business, dealing with construction
permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in the economy
profile.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2015 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

        BuildCo submits an application to the Cadastral Plan Branch of
        the relevant municipality, along with the lot plan, and obtains the
        Cadastral Plan Document. The cadastral plan states the corner
        coordinations of the plot, the status of adjacent plots, and the
        surface area of the plot.

        The fee schedule based on the land area:

      Obtain construction direction plan (Insaat Istikamet

      BuildCo must apply for a construction direction plan and
      elevation of cross section at the planning and zoning
      department of district municipality which is in charge to provide
      the construction direction plan, as well as the elevation of cross
      section plans. The documents obtained in the previous
      procedures must be submitted at this time. The technicians set
      all the necessary levels -- road, entrance, plot, building corners,
      etc. -- to be the basis for the design process of the works that
      will follow, and issue a construction direction plan and elevation
      of cross section. The construction direction plan includes stated
      directions on the land, distances from neighboring plots, and the

      * Hire an independent building inspector

      The company must select an independent building inspector and
      sign a service contract with this inspector. The inspector must
      check and approve all the project’s plans before they are
      submitted to the municipality. The list of project plans is
      extensive and includes the architectural design of the building
      done by design consultants; the reinforced concrete and
      insulation project plans prepared by a civil engineer; the fire
      safety project plans prepared jointly by an architect and the
      mechanical engineer for utilities; the project plans and               4 days      TRY 16,452

      documents for hot water, and those of central heating facilities
      prepared by a mechanical engineer; the electrical wiring project
      plans prepared by an electrical engineer; the telecommunications
      system project plans prepared by an electrical engineer; and the
      landscape project plans prepared by a landscape engineer.

      Selecting an independent building consultant takes only a day.
      However, practitioners agree that it takes at least 3 days for the
      building inspector to review and approve all the documents

      The municipality must approve the project’s proposed designs.
      The fire safety project should also be submitted to the
      municipality for approval and can be included in this procedure.
      If the municipality asks for changes to be made to the
      architectural designs during the approval process, these changes
      should be reflected in the engineering and landscaping projects
      as well. For final approval, these project plans are submitted to
      the municipal project branch, for static, sanitation facility, heating
      and heat insulation, and landscaping project plans to the Turkish
      Electricity Distribution Corporation (TEDAS), for the electricity
      project plans; and to the telephone company, for the

      statutory time limit for this procedure. Although in some cases
      the approval may be granted within 7 days, practitioners agree
      that most cases require the full 30 days allowed by law.

      The cost estimated for this procedure ranges from TRY 3,000.00
      to TRY 3,500.00. The fees found on one district municipality’s
      Web site show the cost breakdown to include fees for
      examination, approval, and various other taxes (e.g., sign posts,
      trees).

      BuildCo will contact the Istanbul Water Supply and Sewerage
      General Directorate (ISKI) to obtain permission to discharge
      sewage and rainwater. At the same time, BuildCo must pay all
      outstanding debts to ISKI arising from the existing utility
      subscriptions and obtain a clearance letter stating that all
      existing connections/subscriptions are terminated.

      obtained, that shows that complete payment was made.

      Once this clearance is obtained, then BuildCo can move forward
      in laying out all pipes and excavation for sewage. All this work is
      done directly by the plumber of BuildCo; therefore there is no
      need for ISKI to be involved a second time. However, ISKI will
      inspect the work after it has been completed.

      The company must register the staff that will be working at the
      construction site with the Social Security Institution. Under
      Turkish law, the construction site is considered as a “separate
      and independent workplace” where construction workers are

      Obtain building permit

      The company requests a building permit from the licensing
      branch of the municipality. The approved design, engineering
      drawings, and other necessary documents (described in the
      previous procedures) must be attached to this request. The
      company must pay the fees before receiving the building permit
      and starting foundation work.

      The fee schedule is as follows:

      1-25 sq. m.: 3.00 TRY / sq. m
      26-50 sq. m.: 4.50 TRY / sq. m
      51-100 sq. m.: 6.00 TRY / sq. m

      Building permits are usually issued 1 -- 2 months after
      submission of the application. The law provides for a statutory
      time limit of 30 days for the municipality issuing the permit.
      There are frequent complaints from applicants about not
      receiving the building permit within the specified time.

      Following the building permit issuance, the municipal building
      control authority will randomly conduct inspections during the
      construction on site, in addition to private inspection.

      Request and obtain a “no outstanding social security
      premium” clearance upon completion of construction works

      As far as construction works are concerned, once they are
      completed, the site (i.e., the workplace) will be closed. Upon
      completion date, there must not be any outstanding social
      security premium debt arising from the employment of the
      construction workers on site. Therefore, the contractor must
11    obtain a document from the Social Security Institute evidencing         1 day        no charge
      that there is no outstanding social security debt.

      The local Municipality also requires this certificate before issuing
      the occupancy permit.

      • Group 2 buildings: TRY 0.58 per sq. m.
      • Group 3 buildings: TRY 0.95 per sq. m.

      • Group 6 buildings: TRY 5.06 per sq. m.

      According to the 2014 Fire Service Fees Schedule, BuildCo's
      warehouse would now fall into group 5 (factory buildings,
      hospitals, hotels, warehouses). Therefore, the applicable fee
      would be: 1,300.6 X 2.20 = TRY 2,861.32

      The law specifies a statutory time limit of 30 days for the
      municipality to issue an occupancy permit. Practitioners observe
      that this statutory time limit is not frequently observed, and so,
      this process can take on average 2 months.

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

       The buyer conducts a non-encumbrance check on the property

       Although not mandated by law, non-encumbrance check is a must
       Procedure without which buyers do not proceed with the transfer
       process. The buyer almost always checks whether or not the property is
       free of liens and encumbrances. For this, the seller would need to obtain
       the document showing that the property is free of disputes.
       By law, title deeds are open to anyone who legitimizes their interest.
       However, in practice the records are not accessible to the public: the
       buyer can obtain this document only with a power attorney of the seller.
       Therefore, this document is typically obtained by the seller who is often    1 day                no cost

       accompanied by the buyer. For transactions that are undertaken by
       lawyers, this procedure is taken care of by lawyers (who have the power
       of attorney from the seller and have a legal right to search titles). The
       information is computerized; it takes minutes to check and is free of
       charge. If the buyer or seller wish to obtain a copy of the records
       displaying the status of the property, a fee of TL 7.20 per page applies.

      Obtain an earthquake insurance policy, or amend the existing one

      If a “compulsory earthquake insurance policy” had not been issued for
      the building, one must be prepared since in practice, when selling the

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

Table 11.1 Details of data on efficiency of insolvency proceedings in Turkey
 Indicator     Answer                                          Explanation
                                 The most common and practical way for the hotel to proceed is the
                          postponement of bankruptcy procedure. Article 377 of Turkish Commercial Code
                            and Article 179 of the Turkish Enforcement and Bankruptcy Code regulate this
                          procedure. The debtor must propose a rehabilitation plan. The court may decide
                            to grant up to one year for the debtor to attempt rehabilitation based on the
            liquidation      proposed plan. This period can be extended up to 4 years in total. Upon the
              (after an     decision on postponement of bankruptcy, no legal proceeding (including the
Proceedin
            attempt at     proceedings for the collection of the public receivables) can be initiated against
g
          reorganization) the debtor and the pending proceedings will be deferred. If the court agrees to
                              postpone the bankruptcy, it will also appoint an administrator in the same
                          decision. The maximum postponement period is one year, during which time the
                          administrator will supervise the business. In most cases, similar to the case study,
                            the debtor does not achieve the projections of the rehabilitation plan and the
                                            court will commence liquidation proceedings.

                       If the debtor fails to achieve its goals shown in the rehabilitation report, then the
Outcome piecemeal sale court will rule for opening its bankruptcy. Therefore in that case it would not be
                               possible for the debtor to continue operating as a going concern.

                               After several months of procedural matters and hearings, the court will grant a
                                 one-year postponement of bankruptcy period to Mirage. This period can be
                               extended up to four years depending on the achievement of the rehabilitation
                                plan. In the case of Mirage, the postponement period will last 3 years in total.
                                  After the third year, Mirage can request an extension of the postponement
                                   period (another year), however, the court will likely deny this this request,
                                  because Mirage is not likely to comply with the financial projections of the
                               proposed rehabilitation plan. The court will declare Mirage bankrupt and notify

                                   inventory and financials of the company, review creditors' claims, prepare
                                creditors' list, organize creditors' meetings and facilitate the sale of the hotel's
                                              assets. The bankruptcy procedure will last 18 months.
                                   Given the recent restructuring of its commercial courts, pending cases are
                                  experiencing significant delays while case files are being reassigned to new
                               courts. It is however expected that this reform will speed up proceedings in the

                             The largest part of the expenses is government levies (4.55% for bankruptcy) and

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
