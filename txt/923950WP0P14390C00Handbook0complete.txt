                                         empowering disadvantaged Roma communities also contributes to their social inclusion. The participation of
                                         non-Roma communities is also critical to gain their support, avoid the stigmatization of Roma, and to foster                                  that could/should be integrated

                                                               and benefit from the available funding. Often, local authorities and CSOs are eligible to submit proposals and
                                                               apply for funding on behalf of communities; therefore, it is important for not only the local authorities, but also         (d) specific types of communities, or groups within communities, that have special communication needs;
                                                               community members and CSOs to be informed of the CfP. It is especially important for them to know what                      (e) common and specific concerns or questions held by different types of stakeholders about the CfP;
                                                               can be funded, who can apply (the eligibility criteria), how they can apply, the deadline, what are application             (f) potential sources of misperceptions or misinterpretations of the planned CfP;
                                                               requirements, and what support (technical assistance) can be provided by whom in preparing the proposals.
                                                                                                                                                                                           (g) feedback on the funding procedures from previous CfPs, as applicable (to improve the process).
                                                               This information will increase the interest of disadvantaged communities in applying for EU funding, who would

                                                               before the launch of the CfP and hold consultations to seek information, advice, and opinion for designing it.        2. Communication with communities

Effective and sustainable desegregation of Roma requires more than just physically moving                                 two groups.

Spatial segregation of Roma could                                       and empower them to take a more affirmative and active role in social and economic life.

Incorporating these elements requires an integrated approach that combines both hard and soft                                    a segregated neighborhood to a nonsegregated one, Roma families would be required to find new

Some may require a long and expensive                                   sources of income. Often, housing and other living costs are higher in nonsegregated neighborhoods,

The Moving to Opportunity for Fair Housing case study from the U.S. offers empirical evidence                                     and Roma will need to earn more than they did in their old neighborhood, where they likely relied on

For an example of a comprehensive desegregation                                     readily available resources in the neighborhood such as cultivable land, water (from a river or lake),

                                                  require different solutions and approaches. For instance, children in two communities might have trouble

                                                     The same gaps/needs might not be applicable to all four areas (housing, employment, education, and health).
                                                     For example, lack of water might be a major reason for bad health, but not necessarily an impediment for
                                                     employment. In such a case, you can tick water for health, but you do not need to tick water for employment.

                                                     At the end of the exercise, the diagnostic questionnaire will yield an inventory of community gaps and needs.
                                                     The questionnaire is designed to help the project planner identify common needs or impediments that affect
                                                     multiple aspects of the community’s living conditions (housing, employment, education, and health).

                                                     Once the needs and impediments are identified, planners can use the Table of Potential Place-Based Intervention
                                                     Options in this handbook to look for options of potential, place-based interventions that can be applied at the
                                                     community level. While the list is not exhaustive, it could help planners consider and prioritize interventions
                                                     to be included in future projects. A specific need can be fulfilled directly (such as by improving housing) or by
                                                     filling other needs that impede the direct fulfillment of the need (such as improving access to finance/creating
                                                     microcredit programs). It is very important to note that there are often various intervention options available
                                                     to solve the same need; depending on the community’s situation, some options are more feasible, effective, and
                                                     cost-efficient than others.

                                                     The prioritization of gaps/needs, impediments, and interventions need to be made to account for many
                                                     variables, such as their value and significance to the community members, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness—

    Good Practice Notes and Tools for Local Actors




                                                     The impacts or results of a project should not dissipate with its completion or end of national and EU funding.
                                                     Often times, projects are designed without sufficient consideration of the operational arrangements and
                                                     recurrent (operation and maintenance) costs beyond the life of the project, and thus results cannot be sustained.
                                                     Projects need to be designed with a realistic exit strategy and activities that address the root causes of the
                                                     issues. Without an exit strategy, local communities will become dependent on the project (and financing), and
                                                     risk losing the gains achieved once the project ends. In addition, the design of any project must be accompanied
                                                     by the question, “If we build it, will they come?” Addressing root causes means not only improving the quality
                                                     and coverage of infrastructure and services, but also removing demand-side (users’) constraints to accessing
                                                     them. Demand-side bottlenecks, such as those related to users’ awareness, affordability, capacity constraints,
                                                     opportunity costs, social norms, and risks (safety, dignity, reputational, and so on) need to be assessed
                                                     and addressed. Many disadvantaged Roma communities are highly impoverished, and merely providing new
                                                     infrastructure or services will not necessarily result in their utilization. If people are not aware of a service’s
                                                     benefits, or if it is too costly to access, they will not be able to utilize it. Moreover, even when a service itself
                                                     is provided free of charge, people may decide not to access it if the transactions or opportunity costs (e.g.,
                                                     transport, lost time for income generation and family care) are considered too high. Fear of being mistreated
                                                     by service providers or associated exposure to humiliation could also discourage them from accessing a service.

                                                       participatory evaluation.

                                                       Participatory evaluation is most effective when the project design and implementation have also been conducted
                                                       in a participatory manner. Participatory design implies that community members jointly decided the project
                                                       scope and activities and share the same vision regarding the project’s objectives and expected results. This
                                                       ensures that community members have been involved from the beginning in deciding the indicators on which
                                                       the project will be monitored and evaluated. Likewise, when it is time for the evaluation, community members
                                                       should be clear about why and how the evaluation will be conducted.

                                                       Very few projects, however, follow a complete participatory process. While it is possible to conduct a participatory
                                                       evaluation even when project design and implementation have not followed a participatory process, this
                                                       requires more time and must be planned differently. The process starts with a discussion among participating
                                                       community and project staff about designing such an evaluation process. Participatory evaluation is the logical
                                                       culmination of a participatory process. Just as involving communities was critical for designing an appropriate
                                                       project, their involvement is critical for understanding the project’s effectiveness once it ends. This means not
                                                       just involvement in terms of answering questions posed by outside evaluators, but involvement in designing the
                                                       evaluation, including what questions to ask, and of whom.


                                                       Key steps of a participatory evaluation include:

                                                             Good planning is central to the success of a participatory evaluation. The planning process begins with
                                                             discussions among the project partners about when to conduct the participatory evaluation; how to

                                                             analysis will be shared and used by project partners. Among other things, partners need to decide
                                                             whether the indicators selected for the baseline will suffice for conducting the evaluation or whether
                                                             additional indicators are necessary to capture the complete picture.

                                                            Many countries have legal provisions to formalize uninterrupted and uncontested possession. Usually,
                                                            possession can be converted into full ownership rights after a certain period of time, usually five to ten years.

                                                            Leases usually do not confer real property rights. However, if they are granted for a sufficient period of

                                                      measures include registering property rights under the name of both spouses; providing free legal assistance to

                                                      Many Roma settlements are not formally recognized in local land use plans and other planning documents.
                                                      Local governments have a key role to play in the formalization of these settlements because they are generally
                                                      the ones that can decide to include them in the local land use plans and adopt specific land use and subdivision

                                                      rights are registered in the formal land registration system. In practice, settlement formalization is often a

Objectives and Scope
The key objective of the ADRA Project is to improve Roma integration by providing affordable housing, in combination
with creating favorable conditions for Roma children to access education and experience healthy lifestyles to escape
a cycle of poverty and exclusion. To address the situation in Iztok, ADRA adopted an integrated approach consisting
of several activities, including:
     constructing a community medical center with a full-time general practitioner, a part-time visiting gynecologist,
     and a dentist;
     constructing houses (42 families have relocated to new homes);
     training sessions and apprenticeships in construction work;
     home economics training;
     employment skills training;
     life skills training with a specific focus on education for Roma mothers to support their children.

Objectives and Scope
                                                                                                                          to undertake construction/renovation in a format that is suitable to the local context.
The key objective of the “Housing Reward Ladder” Project is to provide municipal social services and housing support
to low-income Roma. While the municipality has not been able to implement the full scheme, it has supported
the improvements of housing conditions of poor people by awarding small grants for upgrading apartments. The
larger (future proposed) component of the project envisions the refurbishment of a municipal-owned building in poor
condition that is currently inhabited by Roma. The building would become a place of temporary housing and support
to enable Roma to transition into permanent, stable housing and sustainable employment. The proposed project
included the following integrated services:
     small grants awarded for housing repairs;
     refurbishment of a municipal-owned social housing complex for transitional living;
     advice and support from social workers;
     vocational training and assistance in finding employment.

Objectives and Scope
The key objectives of the Petit Lacanau Project were to reduce inequality and exclusion of Roma by providing social
housing for 30 Roma families (51 adults and 75 children) and to provide social support for Roma to access social and
economic services, in particular health and education. To meet these objectives, the Blanquefort municipality and
two NGO implementers applied an integrated approach to interconnect their activities, which included the following:
     construction of customized housing units with full utilities and services, and Roma relocation to this housing
     complex;
     registration of Roma in the public health system and healthcare and prevention information;
     education assistance for children and youth;
     professional skills training for youth and adults;
     establishing links between potential employers and Roma job seekers.

Objectives and Scope
The key objectives of the Hameau du Bouvray project are to support migrant Roma families in achieving adequate
levels of autonomy and economic self-sufficiency so they can become active social and economic participants in
French society within 3–5 years. To do so, the municipality and its NGO implementer have adopted an integrated
approach to interconnect their activities, which include:
     constructing housing units with full utilities and services (water, electricity, sewage);
     providing healthcare access, including counseling, healthy lifestyle advice, and pregnancy monitoring;
     legal support to obtain residency permits and to understand the French administrative system;

Design Features and Outcomes
Several key dimensions of the project in the Magdolna neighborhood made it successful. These elements are connected
to the sequencing of activities that created synergies between project activities, starting with: (i) the mobilization of
the target population at an early stage of project implementation, which created a strong sense of local ownership
and involvement; (ii) construction of the community center at an early stage of the project created a communal
meeting point, where an increasing number of soft interventions could take place in forthcoming project phases; (iii)
the selection of houses for refurbishment was done with contextual sensitivity to the state of living conditions in
the houses. In other words, those in worse condition were selected first. In the second round, houses in areas affected
by criminal activity, such as the drug trade and other social tensions, were refurbished. In the later rounds, the general
appearance of streets was taken into consideration when selecting new houses for refurbishment; (iv) investments
in public spaces, such as squares and parks, in combination with developing pedestrian walkways and general public
security awareness, further increased the sense of security among Magdolna’s residents.


Good Practices and Lessons Learned
The Magdolna project applied innovative approaches and activities to urban rehabilitation. The idea to retain the majority
of the population in the regenerated area was novel; it had not been applied in any other inner city regeneration projects,
in which the ultimate goal was generally to gentrify the district/neighborhood.

A major strength of the Magdolna Social Urban Rehabilitation Project has been the combination of an integrated
approach and long-term project approach. The inclusive strategy of involving residents in the project has been essential
to the project’s success, even if it created challenges due to delays of certain project elements. The neighborhood
development council, for example, has given local residents a key role in the decision-making process. The broad approach
of soft project elements, ranging from job trainings to child welfare programs and crime prevention trainings, involved
major parts of the neighborhood and thus created a strong sense of ownership. The sequencing of project activities and
the early construction of the community building later enabled activities to be organized within the community. This was
another important element of the project’s success. The organization running the project (RÉV8 Ltd.) has gathered a
vast amount of experience over the years, and learned from many partners in the process. The involvement of district-
wide institutions, such as family help centers and social workers, has further strengthened the project.

Another best practice was the way in which individual requests regarding housing were taken into consideration when
possible. Single and elderly persons could move to lower floors and families with children could move to larger apartments.
The majority of the tenants returned to their original but upgraded residences. Home upgrading was done in parallel
with an increase in rent levels. Nevertheless, the level of indebtedness of families participating in the program has
decreased slightly regardless of the increase in rental fees. Lastly, participatory input from neighborhood beneficiaries
in the provision of municipal public services has been another good practice. During the recently launched Phase 3, the
municipal transportation company has been involved in project activities, in which Magdolna residents give input on
redesigning the bus transportation route 99, which crosses the neighborhood and has a very bad reputation. The unique

The key objective of the Győr-Újváros Urban Rehabilitation Project was to regenerate the neighborhood by renovating
apartment buildings and commercial premises, along with revitalizing and cleaning the nearby polluted park to
become a safe recreational space for children and adults. To address these multiple challenges, the municipality of
Győr and its implementing partners applied an integrated approach, which included the following activities:
     renovation of 40 apartments to be rented to 120–130 socially disadvantaged tenants. The selected apartments
     need upgrading because of their dilapidated conditions and missing kitchen, bathroom, and toilet;
     refurbishment of 5 commercial premises for new shops, restaurants, and so on;

opposed to a non-Roma body—newly headquartered in the neighborhood in the recently constructed community center.
The Roma Minority Self-Government safeguards the sustainability of the infrastructure works and overall project results.
Having the trust of Roma beneficiaries, it also took the lead in spearheading afterschool tutoring and recreational
activities for children (ages 10–16); and (vi) involvement of NGOs with existing expertise in soft activities, such as
the Vadvirág Alapítvány nonprofit service provider, which has experience in early childhood development programs. The
nonprofit organized a Sure Start program in the target neighborhood to provide information to mothers about how to
care for infants and children.


Good Practices and Lessons Learned
The Kaposvár Urban Rehabilitation Project showcases several good practices of an integrated approach and project
design. Firstly, it based its project design on a survey conducted in the neighborhood by an independent polling company
(SzocioNet). According to survey results, a large percentage of respondents (75 percent) expressed interest in participating
in the project, and 45 percent indicated interest in unpaid voluntary work. This suggested to project managers optimism
regarding the sustainability of expected results.

While housing and infrastructure improvements are relatively quick and easily measurable, changing attitudes and
dispositions take longer. This is an important reason to integrate soft activities with an intercultural dimension into
the project. They are a first step towards reducing discrimination and creating openness between Roma and non-
Roma, helping each other to understand the other’s culture and traditions. These programs, located at the community
center, encourage the intermingling of Roma and non-Roma communities through food and celebrations. After these
occasions, Roma and non-Roma in the neighborhood already start to talk to each other more and show a genuine
interest toward different cultures. They even come back repeatedly for similar programs. These perceived changes are
at first experienced only on a microsocial level, but can over time lead to a decrease in segregation and discrimination.

                                          are widespread. Almost half of the families depend on social benefits for their main source of income. Over a quarter

its own vocational training courses, so it could run employment-related and other soft interventions; and (iv) the project
avoided giving financial assistance directly to Roma families. Targeting Roma with large-scale funding is seldom
without conflict. In Herbolya, there was general acceptance of the problem, however, probably because there were no
individuals as direct (financial) beneficiaries. This prevented resentment and helped maintain cooperation throughout
the project period.


Good Practices and Lessons Learned
The Herbolya Social Rehabilitation Project utilized the good practice of offering a wide diversity of soft elements—
from trainings and tangible social services to events and clubs (10 percent of total project costs were spent on soft
interventions)—which ensured that there was something for everyone and Roma of all ages benefited from the program.
The level of access that Roma and vulnerable groups have to services and activities greatly improved over the course of

Design Features and Outcomes
Key dimensions in implementing the integrated Huszár-telep Social Rehabilitation Project are the way in which it:
(i) engaged NGOs with experience in implementing soft projects and/or working with Roma. The project’s social
components are based on the work of organizations that have been working in the area for a long time (for example,
Human-Net NGO has been running the family help center for ten years); (ii) targeted both potential victims and residents
with known criminal records in its crime prevention activities. This strategy works to break the cycle of crime and
violence in the neighborhood, as it restores public safety. It works to make the settlement a more attractive, safer place
to live and improves its reputation and those of its inhabitants; (iii) education and crime prevention programs are
creative and engaging, using everything from drama pedagogy to audiovisual materials, moderated discussions, and
pamphlets to raise awareness about drug abuse, prostitution, and human trafficking. Women are also targeted with
information about domestic violence. Special attention is given to issues of usury loans, mafia, and petty offenses (like
begging); and (iv) public events celebrated the Roma identity of Huszár-telep, through theatre and holiday celebrations.
These celebrations help to empower Roma to be proud of their self-identity, as well as break down stereotypes about
Roma and the settlement in wider society. On the other hand, the municipality has made little effort to inform the Roma
community about the planned activities, or include the local residents in project-related planning and discussion.


Good Practices and Lessons Learned
The Huszár-telep Social Rehabilitation Project showcases how a project may benefit from the capacity of well embedded
NGOs, which have been working in Huszár-telep for a long time. This enhances the project’s accessibility to the local
population and the beneficiaries most in need. It ultimately contributes to the sustainability of the project results over
time.

Objectives and Scope
The key objective of the Grazia Deledda Project is to provide migrant Roma families temporary housing as a
way to increase their autonomy and social and economic inclusion in Italy. Beneficiaries stay in Grazia Deledda
accommodations for a period of six months with the possibility to renew for another six months, during which time
Roma take part in mandatory social assistance project activities. The activities are meant to help Roma find work
and housing, so that after twelve months they can integrate into private market housing and social life. To accomplish
these goals, the municipality and its NGO implementers have adopted an integrated approach to interconnect their
activities, which include:
     constructing transitional (temporary) housing units out of former elementary school for rent-free 6+6 month stays;
     providing healthcare access and monitoring;
     providing education enrollment assistance;
     educational activities for children and adults, including on issues of legal entitlements, criminality, and violence
     prevention;
     employment skill-building;
     literacy programs for Roma and other minorities in the local community.

                                others need considerable renovation.




Objectives and Scope
The key objectives of the Bălţeşti “A House, A Future” Project were to improve the living conditions of 24 Roma families
and to provide vocational training for 15 adults to help their sustainable employment. To do so, the implementing
agencies integrated housing and employment activities, such as:
     constructing 24 brand new or renovated homes;
     assistance in obtaining affordable mortgages (through labor contributions and deductions);
     vocational training and apprenticeship programs in construction for 15 adults;
     facilitated access to water, sewage, electricity, and other municipal services.


Design Features and Outcomes
Key dimensions of the Bălţeşti “A House, A Future” Project include: (i) beneficiary ownership over the project that
stemmed from beneficiaries participating in building their own homes. This was after receiving vocational training in
construction. Beneficiary labor contributions earned them deductions in their monthly mortgage payments for new
homes. For beneficiaries not involved in volunteer work, they could still pay an affordable mortgage for their home, although
they were expected to reimburse up to 50 percent of the building costs; (ii) municipal and community cooperation
with NGO implementers ensured support from local authorities for all project activities, from accessing paperwork for

Objectives and Scope
The key project objective is the development of an integrated model of social and professional inclusion of Roma
and disabled persons. Specifically, the main goals are to provide access to information, counseling, and job training
for 900 Roma and disabled persons, while informing public and private sector leaders of the difficulties faced by
vulnerable groups entering the labor market. The overall expectation of the project is that improving access to the
labor market will improve living conditions for Roma and the disabled. To accomplish these aims, the municipality’s
implementing agency adopted a combination of activities, which include:
	    acquiring a building for counseling support;
     vocational training;
     job search counseling and information;
     information campaign on the challenges vulnerable groups face in accessing employment;
     subsidized job placements at local businesses for Roma and disabled persons;
     literacy programs for Roma and other minorities in the local community.

Objectives and Scope
The key objective of the Brazil Housing Project was to improve the living conditions of ten families from the “Brazil”
Roma community in Nuşfalău village. The project was part of a larger program that included extending electricity
to the community, encouraging the production and sale of bricks—a traditional occupation of this Roma group—as
well as civil society capacity building and education and health awareness activities. To accomplish these goals, the
SPOLU Foundation implementing the project adopted an integrated approach to interconnect housing and social
inclusion and empowerment activities, which included:
     construction of 10 new private homes for 10 Roma families;13
     interethnic trust-building and Roma empowerment exercises,
     job creation (100 new jobs) by resurrecting traditional Roma brick-making enterprise in the area;
     apprenticeship program matching job seekers to employers;
     vocational training and apprenticeship programs;
     afterschool education activities for children.


 13 The selection of beneficiaries was based on a needs assessment and criteria such as willingness to engage in the project, contribute to
   voluntary work, and assist other people (such as the elderly or disabled), as well as considerations such as a large family.

The key objective of the Institute for Relocation and Social Inclusion’s (IRIS) Subsidized Rental Housing Project
in Madrid is to eradicate poverty and social exclusion among Roma, especially those living in illegal settlements,             Another key feature of the IRIS program is its “spatial integration” component. Families that are rehoused are distributed
through opportunities for rehousing, relocation, and social integration. In particular, the project aims to allocate rental    in neighborhoods all around the wider region of Madrid. This avoids the creation of slums and encourages Roma inclusion
housing to needy Roma families evenly across the city in order to discourage segregation. Meanwhile, social support is         in Madrid’s social and economic life. In these ways, the project explicitly seeks to overcome segregation in an ongoing
provided to Roma beneficiaries in order to adjust to their new homes, neighborhoods, and livelihoods. The assumption           manner.
is that normalized housing is a vehicle for social integration and growth. This is even if housing alone cannot ensure
social inclusion and poverty reduction, and so social services are integrated into the project. For its activities, IRIS has
traditionally worked with excluded Spanish Roma communities living in substandard housing, although lately IRIS is
increasingly working with Roma communities from Romania and Bulgaria. To address the social and material needs
of these communities, IRIS has adopted an integrated approach to interconnect activities:
	    provide residential public apartments with subsidized rent. Rent is approximately €64 to €198 per month,
     according to apartment size and location. IRIS buys the flats on the private market or from the municipal/
     regional social housing agency and rents them out at subsidized costs to marginalized families;

times below the minimum wage (or having no income) or already being registered in a government social assistance
program within the region of Navarra. The project is based on the principle that a lack of proper housing and a
segregated life, with no or difficult access to social services, is one of the main impediments to overcoming poverty
and marginalization. To address these challenges, the project implementers utilized an integrated approach of hard
and soft activities:
     allocation of public and private housing units, including some with subsidized rent. The region of Navarra either
     allocates apartments it already owns or finds apartments on the private market to rent. The rental contracts
     are between the beneficiary and the region;
     oversight in compliance with a rental contract to ensure regular payment of rent and utilities, home maintenance,
     and so on;

Objectives and Scope
The main objectives of the Kent County Coldharbour Site Project are to create appropriate accommodation and
support systems in the caravan site so that Romanichals and Travellers can flourish and prosper. The expected
outcome is tenure security for caravan dwellers in an authorized encampment that is connected to service provisions
and wider society. To achieve this, the project implementers utilized an integrated approach that involved the following
activities:
     refurbishing the site with 26 new pitches for caravans. Separate family pitches include a hard surface for parking
     the caravan, a fixed structure amenity, wooden fencing, drainage lines, a rubble drive area, and space for a garden.
     The entire site is enclosed for privacy from the nearby highway and police station;
     infrastructure upgrading and extension of the site;
     constructing pedestrian sidewalks to nearby shops and schools;
     building a large playground within visible distance from adult caregivers on the caravan pitches;
     educational support and promoting attendance among children from sites;
     empowering adults to educate wider society about Romanichals and Travellers, as well as to encourage their
     participation in their children’s education. Together these activities help to generate awareness and acceptance
     of their culture;
