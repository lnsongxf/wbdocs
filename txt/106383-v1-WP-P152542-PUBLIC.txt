This report relates the second part of the first component of the assignment, which aims to provide
support to MIS for the operationalization of the National Plan on Next Generation Access and Network
Infrastructure (NGA&NGN) through the provision of recommendations for improving the legal and
regulatory framework and through analysis of the socio-economic and communication market conditions
for selecting areas for broadband and NGN investment interventions. To this end, this report proposes a
typology of the communities that need improved broadband services and the various economic models
that the client may want to apply when appraising the efficiency, the sustainability, and the financing

        Introduction
This report is the second deliverable of the first component of the World Bank Technical
Assistance to support the Ministry of Information Society (MIS) for the operationalization of the
NGA&NGN strategy.
Analyzing the legal, regulatory, institutional and competitive framework for Electronic
Communications, NGN Development Plan in Romania commands the characterization of an
Analytical Mapping Framework which, once confronted to the local market structure and national
project initiatives, can be turned into a powerful Geographical Mapping Exercise capable of
setting genuine intervention models to help the Government to meet the goals Digital Agenda for
Romania 2020.
The general methodology adopts in this first component is to used the Analytical Mapping
Framework to propose first a Coverage Gap Analysis addressed in the first report and secondly to
translate it into a Geographical Mapping Exercise which has the general purpose to address
coverage gaps in clustering the territory, identify selected communities and associate the most
appropriate business and investment models to guide and to frame public intervention.
Pursuant to recommendation 3 on implementation of a mapping tool issued in the report 1 this
second rapport carries out a Geographical Mapping Exercise and proposes a set of project
clusters and communities associated with relevant associated intervention models.
In addition, this mapping exercise is necessary for providing the information needed to decide on
the four strategic choices identified in the European Commission Guide to High-Speed Broadband
Investment namely the Choice of the infrastructure type, of the investment model, of the
business model and eventually of the financing tools.
This mapping exercise describes the policy context as well as the current situation and the
investment need in broadband. Thus, in order to identify where and how to intervene, the
mapping should answer questions such as: (i) What are the needs for services based on high
speed broadband among the socio-economic actors?; (ii) What are the problems to overcome for
the rapid deployment and for facilitating usage of high speed broadband?; (iii) Which benefits will
broadband create for various groups of residents and for society at large in terms of economic
growth, business development, employment, tourism, education etc.?; (iv) How strong is
competition for broadband services in the selected areas?; (v) What role can local communities
play in aggregating demand and contributing to investment? Also, the mapping should identify
the main stakeholders from the targeted communities as well as the possibilities to aggregate or
'federate' the targeted small communities into networks with integrated broadband
infrastructure.
This paper presents such a mapping for Romania, carried out in August-September 2015.

       1. The Mapping exercise


               A. Why a Mapping Exercise?
The 2020 targets of the Digital Agenda for Europe1 are 100% coverage of 30Mbps Internet and
50% penetration of 100Mbps service in the European Union member states. The bulk of the
investment needed to meet these targets is expected to be undertaken by private operators, but
public funding is vital for areas affected by market failure. So, it has become critical that public
authorities define their role at each step of the way to full high speed broadband coverage, as an
integral part of their policy responsibility towards their citizens and the territory they administer,
especially in relation to the 'white'2 areas3.
The role of public authority and public funding in investments in new broadband infrastructure in
'white' areas is very important specifically because of: (a) high risk investment; (b) long payback
periods; (c) insufficient size of promoters; (d) open wholesale access (which may be imposed by
ex-ante regulation); and (e) lack of evidence substantiating the viability of the business model.
For planning the intervention, public authority needs to define a broadband plan that should
clarify the strategic choices on four different levels: infrastructure type, investment model,
business model and financing tools. The four strategic choices represent the backbone of the
investment option most appropriate for the intervention to have best effect.

                             Box 1. Four Strategic Choices of a Broadband Plan
    (1) Choice of the infrastructure type
    Do the public administration aim at deploying a new future-proof broadband infrastructure or would it
    be sufficient to upgrade the existing infrastructure, considering the pros and cons of the two choices?
    (2) Choice of the investment model
    What role does the public authority want to play with respect to the implementation, operation,
    ownership and management of the infrastructure?
    (3) Choice of the business model
    Should the public authority opt for a vertically integrated or an open-access network model? Which one
    is the most likely to maximize the financial sustainability of the project, broadband coverage and
    penetration (also beyond an individual project), promote competition and, most importantly, the socio-
    economic development of the affected community?
    (4) Choice of the financing tools
    How can the public authority ensure an adequate financial coverage for building and operating the new
    infrastructure and what can it contribute in terms of capital, expenditure and assets?

                B. What Type of Mapping?
For an effective broadband plan, reliable and valid data on existing broadband infrastructure and
services already offered is fundamental. The broadband mapping is necessary to identify gaps in
the broadband coverage and penetration, to identify suitable areas of investment, and to cut
investment costs. Additionally, it helps to avoid duplication of financing as subsidies can be
allocated to areas affected by market failure.
Four types of public national broadband mapping are currently carried out in the 28 member
states of the European Union, as shown by a recent study (SMART 2012/0022) realized in 2013 by
TÜV Rheinland and WIK-Consult for the European Commission4. Within this study, Romania
reported no existing public national initiative, but an infrastructure mapping in the planning
phase.

                     Box 2. Four Types of Broadband Mapping in the European Union

    (1) Infrastructure mapping
    The detailed, geo-referenced and structured gathering, processing and visualization of data of relevant
    infrastructure (e.g. ducts/fiber/nodes suitable for the provision of electronic communications services
    but also other relevant infrastructure serving energy or water supply). The aim of infrastructure mapping
    is to reduce costs of broadband deployment and to coordinate broadband deployment measures.
    (2) Broadband service mapping
    Systems for gathering, analyzing and presenting information on the supply side of broadband service
    provision including the available bandwidths (speed), technologies, operators/service providers and
    quality of service in a specific area. The aim of service mapping is to create an insight into the current
    state of broadband availability.
    (3) Demand mapping
    A structured process of gathering information on dimensions characterizing the demand for broadband
    services, including broadband speeds required by citizens, expectations regarding service quality and
    willingness to pay by different user groups. The aim of demand mapping is to create insight into the
    actual demand for broadband services, which is likely to be useful in the funding and deploying of
    broadband networks.
    (4) Investment and funding mapping
    The structured gathering, consolidation, processing and visualization of information related to financing
    sources and instruments for broadband project funding.
    Source: European Commission (Arnold et al), Study on Broadband and Infrastructure Mapping, 2014: 12-
    13; 21-22.

Ideally, only a broadband mapping comprising all four dimensions - infrastructure, services,
demand and investment - would offer a complete picture to all stakeholders for any purpose. In
practice, however, the abovementioned review of existing broadband mapping initiatives showed
that the four types of mapping rarely all exist side by side in any one country. The most common
type of mapping initiative is service mapping (operational in 20 EU Member States). Although one
of the key elements of any business case for infrastructure deployment is consumer and business
demand, the demand and investment mapping play only a minor role in the plans of Member
States.

Within this RAS, the Romanian MIS provided the list of 'white' and 'grey' areas, at the national
level, and asked support from the World Bank with identification on where and how to intervene
in the 2015-2020 period. Given the four types of broadband mapping, we consider that a demand
mapping in correlation with public funding opportunities is the most appropriate for determining
a typology of undersupplied areas and the suitable models of intervention in Romania. Thus, this
paper presents such a demand mapping at the national level based on socio-economic and
demographic characteristics, which provides a first picture of the potential demand for services in
the 'white' and 'grey' areas.


       2. Mapping Methodology


                A. Objectives and Approach
The demand mapping presented in this paper has two objectives:
                  (1) Identification of a typology of 'white' and 'grey' areas from Romania based on
                      socio-economic and demographic indicators used as a proxy for the potential
                      demand for broadband services;
                  (2) Identification of suitable models of publicly-funded intervention for the prevalent
                      types of 'white' and 'grey' areas from Romania.

                                             Box 3. Demand Mapping

    The current Broadband State Aid Guidelines do not require demand mapping in particular to be
    undertaken in order to demonstrate market failure in a given area. However, the Guidelines also do not
    exclude any kind of method of identifying market failure, which would need to be done in addition to the
    existing method of submission of market operators’ plans for the next three years. In this context, once
    demand mapping produces actual results, there could be scope for mapping of demand according to
    definition (1) to be combined with the state aid guidelines, which would represent one element of
    justifying state aid measures. In particular, demand mapping could provide a clearer view of: a) the types
    of areas (white, grey or black) under examination for state aid (level of demand, range of price to be paid
    by willing consumers and required technical characteristics); b) the identification of market failure; and
    c) the identification of changes required (e.g. whether indeed there is demand in white areas or whether
    there is unsatisfied demand in grey/black areas).

According to the EU study on the mapping of broadband,5 demand mapping has to be divided
into two mapping approaches: (1) the mapping of demand in terms of need for broadband
services based on undersupply or future needs and (2) the mapping of quality of service such as
delivered bandwidth.
The study presented in this paper focuses on the 'white' and 'grey' areas from Romania, hence is
based on the first approach, with the aim to create insight into the actual demand for broadband
services in the undersupplied communities. Thus, our study will inform the planning process for

broadband deployment so that to facilitate state aid distribution and to avoid misdirected
investment.
The EU Guide6 points out that mapping of demand (need for services) can best be obtained
through the direct involvement of the local population and businesses. In fact only three
European countries (Austria, Finland and Sweden) focus on demand in terms of need for
broadband in unserved or underserved areas and they use different methods for mapping. 7
Austria conducts country-wide demand mapping based on qualitative data and statements
received from inhabitants (inquiries/complaints submitted in a web-based form made available
on the website of BMVIT).8 Finland has done several consumer surveys to collect information
about user experience, demand and the main problems. In Sweden, the Swedish Post and
Telecom Authority (PTS) collects demand data for broadband in areas where there is no
availability of broadband of a minimum 1 Mbit/s. The user can submit a demand on the PTS
website.
An alternative is to obtain a picture of the potential demand based on socio-economic and
demographic characteristics of the territory (ageing structure, education, employment, ICT usage,
poverty etc.). This indirect approach, based on proxy variables for the potential demand for
broadband services, has been applied in the study on Romania presented in this paper.
             B. Literature and Data Sources
With respect to the selection of the mapping type and the intervention models, this report draws
heavily on two recent studies of the European Commission, namely:
                 Study on Broadband and Infrastructure Mapping (2014) and
                 Guide to High-Speed Broadband Investment, Release 1.1 (2014).
In order to decide the most relevant socio-economic and demographic indicators used as a proxy
for the potential demand for broadband services, which are needed to develop the typology of
'white' and 'grey' areas from Romania, we will draw on the following World Bank studies carried
out in 2014-2015 under various RAS projects:
                 Competitive cities. Reshaping economic geography of Romania (2014)
                 Atlas of Urban Marginalized Areas in Romania (2014)
                 Inputs for the Preparation of a Draft National Strategy and Action Plan on Social
                  Inclusion and Poverty Reduction 2015-2020 (2015) and
                 Atlas of Rural Marginalized Areas in Romania (2015).

            C. Method
As most other mapping studies, the one presented in the next sections is not only linked to geo-
referential visualization, but comprises also the entire process of data collection and processing.
Identification of data sources and data preparation for analysis was done by a team of individual
consultants coordinated by Manuela Sofia Stănculescu, during August 2015.
This demand mapping is based on a secondary analysis of data collected by various institutions,
including NIS, MF, MARD and MIS. The selected socio-economic and demographic indicators are
collected at various levels, namely:
               population (individuals and households),
               villages/neighborhoods (SIRUTA units), and
               administrative units, which in Romania are clusters of villages/neighborhoods
                (communes, in rural areas, and cities, in urban areas – SIRSUP units).
The individual data (regarding individuals and households) were aggregated at the village/
neighborhood (SIRUTA) level. In the same time, data about territorial-administrative units were
assigned to all incorporated villages. The analysis was done at the village/neighborhood (SIRUTA)
level that represents the same degree of granularity at which the 'white' and 'grey' areas are
measured by the MIS.
Data refer to all villages/neighborhoods (SIRUTA units) in the country. Data are not weighted.


    3. Main Findings of the Mapping


This report aims to aggregate and to analyze demand, as well as potentially make a business case
for broadband infrastructure deployment in areas where there are white or grey spots in
Romania. Usually, the absence of broadband infrastructure/service is sufficient to document
market failure. Nevertheless, by considering demand for broadband service in the identified
white or grey areas (by the MIS), this study improves the assessment of market failure in Romania.
Furthermore, it proposes a typology of areas where there are white or grey spots in order to
identify the suitable models of publicly-funded intervention for the next years. By providing an
overview about objective evidence in case of undersupply of broadband services in Romania, this
mapping study could also be seen as a planning tool for assignment of financial means, subsidies
and, in particular, state aid.
This chapter of the report is organized in five sections. The first section makes the opening by
presenting the policy context of villages/neighborhoods from Romania. The second section
introduces the areas where there are white or grey spots in Romania, according to the definition
used by the MIS. The third section presents a short geospatial analysis of the distribution of these
areas across the country. The fourth section provides a typology of these areas, based on socio-
economic and demographic indicators used as a proxy for the potential demand for broadband
services. In the end, the sixth section discusses the most suitable models of publicly-funded
intervention in these areas. Policy recommendations are laid out in the next chapter.

               A. Socio-Economic Picture of Villages from Rural and Urban Areas in Romania
This section draws heavily on the analysis done by the World Bank (2015) within the RAS project
on Inputs for the Preparation of a Draft National Strategy and Action Plan on Social Inclusion and
Poverty Reduction 2015-2020.9
In Romania, the territorial units are divided into:
               -    villages/neighborhoods (SIRUTA units), and
               -    administrative units, which are clusters of villages/neighborhoods and are named
                    communes, in rural areas, and cities, in urban areas (SIRSUP units).
In the Nomenclature of Territorial-Administrative Units (NIS), in January 2015, 13,755 villages
(SIRUTA units) were reported nationwide, which were forming 3,181 administrative units.
However, 12910 villages have been 'fictive' (have zero inhabitants) and have no corresponding
data in the 2011 Population and Housing Census. As most of the analysis presented in this section
is based on 2011 census data, we will refer only to those villages that are 'valid', 13,626 SIRUTA
units, of which 12,373 in rural areas and 1,253 in urban areas.
                          i. Urban-rural gap
Romania has constantly been characterized by considerable regional disparities. The Northeast
and South regions of the country are fare worse than other areas on nearly all socio-economic
indicators, especially in rural areas. As a general rule in Romania, the larger the proportion of the
rural population, the more severe the poverty is in that region or county. So, inter-regional
disparities are mainly the result of the large discrepancies between urban and rural areas.
Actually, a recent study by the European Commission clearly showed that the rural-urban gap has
been more marked in Romania than in the Western European countries (Bertolini et al, 2008).11
After 1989, as structural changes began to be made in Romania, the urban–rural gap widened,
with rural areas being clearly at a growing disadvantage. Income poverty is much higher in rural
areas than in urban areas.12 Infant and under-5 mortality rates have always been considerably
higher among children in rural areas than those in urban areas.13 Access to upper secondary
education, healthcare, and social services has been much more limited in rural areas. Rural
households are located, on average, much further from a high school or a major hospital than
urban residents. There has always been less infrastructure available in rural areas and of lower
quality. Rural areas lag significantly behind urban areas in terms of the availability of basic utilities

Strategy for Social Inclusion and Poverty Reduction for 2015-2020.

12 For example, in 2012, income poverty was three times more likely in rural areas compared with urban areas; while

only 11 percent of people living in densely or intermediate populated areas were at risk of poverty, 38 percent of those
living in thinly populated areas faced such a risk (World Bank calculations using data from 2012 EU-SILC).
13 For example, in 2013, the infant mortality rate was 10.4 live births to 1,000 inhabitants in rural areas compared with

6.8 in urban areas (National Institute of Statistics, Tempo Online, https://statistici.insse.ro/shop/).

such as water supply, the sewerage network, and natural gas, with the notable exception of
electricity, which is available to virtually all rural dwellers.14
                         ii. Rural areas
Nearly half of the population lives in rural administrative areas (46% according to the 2011
census). Both the aging of the rural population and the migration of many rural dwellers –
notably of young people and women – in search of work abroad are deepening the general
impoverishment of rural areas.
Rural areas are highly heterogeneous. Rural areas in Romania are organized into 2,861
communes (territorial-administrative units) that include 12,373 villages. Villages are categorized
by geography (plain, hill, mountain), population size, distance to a city, and administrative type
(central or peripheral). Some 88% of communes have one central village and between 1 and 40
peripheral villages. The other 12% of communes include only one (central) village. Central villages
tend to concentrate the administrative and institutional resources of the commune (the
mayoralty, health unit, school, library, post office, and police station). Public infrastructure, which
is in need of modernization in most rural areas, is significantly poorer in peripheral villages. The
most affluent villages are those located close to a city and/or to a European road (Sandu, 2000
and Stănculescu, 2004). In fact, many of these developed villages are part of suburban or peri -
urban localities.

The large majority of the Romanian villages have between 100 and 2,000 inhabitants (Table 1). In
2011, the average size of a village was 749 persons (smaller than the average size of 810 persons
recorded at the 2002 Census). Thus, in the Romanian rural context, three categories of villages
according to their population size can be considered, namely:
                    small (1-500 inhabitants),


14In 2013, only 72% (2,050) of rural municipalities were connected to a public drinking water supply, in contrast with
99% of cities. Only 23% (672) of rural localities were connected to a public sewerage network, compared with 97% of
urban districts. In addition, only 23% (657) communes could tap into the natural gas supply, as opposed to 95% of
urban dwellings (National Institute of Statistics, Tempo Online, https://statistici.insse.ro/shop/).

                   medium (501-2,000 inhabitants) and
                   large (2,001-over 20,200 inhabitants).
Small and especially very small villages are the most disadvantaged, particularly those with an
elderly population and/or those that are located in remote areas. The 2011 census counted a
total of 3,172 very small villages with fewer than 200 inhabitants, of which villages with fewer
than 100 inhabitants represent about a half. About 3.4 percent of the total rural population
(nearly 312,000 people) lives in very small villages. Most of the small and very small villages are
peripheral within their communes (sometimes situated many kilometers away from the central
village) and have elderly populations.15 Small and very small villages are spread all over the
country but appear to be concentrated in the West and Center regions. Also, villages with an
elderly population are more likely to be found in the Western regions of the country (North-West,
West, and South-West). In terms of basic infrastructure, small and very small villages have similar
development needs as the larger communities.16 However, due to their population composition,
small and very small villages have specific needs mainly related to the development of social
services, specifically assistance in carrying out daily tasks (home help) for the elderly and better
access to quality education (particularly early childhood education and primary school for
younger children) as in many of these villages schools have been closed down or are severely
underfinanced because of the small number of pupils.
Among rural municipalities, the small communes with fewer than 2,000 inhabitants are the most
disadvantaged in terms of human and social development. Table 3 shows that in Romania, the
size of the commune populations varies widely from a low of 119 to a high of almost 23,000
inhabitants.17 The small communes (those with fewer than 2,000 inhabitants) represent 26% of
all communes (or 751) and are inhabited by over 1.1 million people. These communes are spread
throughout the country but tend to be concentrated in the West, Center, and South-West regions,
a pattern rather similar to that of the small villages and the villages with a high proportion of
elderly inhabitants.
With regard to the availability, affordability, and quality of basic infrastructure, small communes
have a similar proportion of dwellings connected to utilities and of households that report
difficulties and delays in paying their utility bills (such as heating, electricity, and gas) as other
communes. However, the Local Human Development Index (LHDI) 18 indicates that small

15 Over 41% of the population of villages with fewer than 200 inhabitants and 45% of the population of villages with
fewer than 100 inhabitants are aged 55 or older. In the same time, children aged 0 to 17 years old represent only 18%,
and 16% respectively of the total population. For comparison, in villages over 200 inhabitants, on average, children
represent 22%, while people aged 55 or older constitute 31% of the total population.
16 The villages with a high proportion of elderly inhabitants appear to have lower percentages of dwellings connected

to utilities such as cooking gas, piped water, or the sewerage network, but usually the demand for these services is also
lower (some elderly are too poor to afford gas and water tariffs, while others have no desire to invest in such facilities
as they are used to getting their drinking water from wells or fountains).
17 Brebu Nou (Weidenthal) is the smallest commune in the country (119 inhabitants according to the 2011 census). It is

a former Saxon commune that includes two villages and is located in the Semenic Mountains in Caraş-Severin County in
western Romania. The largest commune is Floresti, which is a peri-urban suburb of Cluj-Napoca city in Cluj County in
the Centre region.
18 The Local Human Development Index (LHDI) was devised to measure the overall level of development of each locality

within the country (World Bank, 2014). The LHDI measures the total capital of rural and urban administrative units in
Romania on four dimensions: (i) human capital; (ii) health capital, (iii) vital capital, and (iv) material capital. Human
capital is measured by the indicator of education stock at the local level (for the population aged 10 years old and
over). Health capital is measured as life expectancy at birth at the local level. Vital capital is measured by the mean age
of the adult population (those aged 18 years old and over). Finally, material capital is assessed as a factor score of three

communes were and still are significantly less developed than the larger communes, even the
remote ones (Table 2).
In fact, Table 2 shows that, on the one hand, the remote communes (those that have little
connection to any city) are likely to be disadvantaged only when they are small (in other words,
when they have fewer than 2,000 inhabitants) and, on the other hand, the small communes are
generally less connected to their nearest cities than larger communes (in other words, they are
more likely to be remote). Although the small communes have had a positive evolution in terms
of infrastructure development between 2002 and 2011 and attracted a larger volume of
European Funds per inhabitant than the larger communes between 2009 and 2012, they have
not succeeded in closing the development gap.
At the same time, the local budget indicators from Table 2 show that small communes are also
disadvantaged in terms of economic development. The extent to which local communities
depend on support from the state budget is a relevant indicator of the potential for local
economic growth. If a locality’s budget contains few central budget transfers in conjunction with
a high proportion of self-generated revenues19 (from local tax collection), then this is a sign that it
is experiencing healthy economic development and that it has a large base of taxpayers (citizens
and firms). Ministry of Finance data from the end of 2012 show that the average share of self-
generated revenues (or independence from state budget transfers) of Romanian localities was
only 24%. Within this average, rates differed significantly between urban areas (42%), communes
(22%), and small communes (19%). Only a small number of localities managed to achieve an
independence threshold of over 50% in 2012, namely 84 cities (or 26% of all cities apart from
Bucharest) and 135 communes (of which 109 are neither small nor remote). Consequently,
capital investments are low and have even decreased in recent years in all localities.

The four measures of the dimensions of community capital are aggregated by calculating another factor score.
19 Self-generated revenues reflect the municipality’s fiscal autonomy and local economic potential. They do not include

the portions deducted from PIT (personal income tax) for equalization purposes in order to analyze the category of
revenues upon which the municipality holds a greater degree of control. The formula per capita enables vertical
comparisons (localities of different sizes or status – urban/rural) and horizontal comparisons (localities of the same
status, but in different counties). They are computed as an annual average for the period 2009-2012 on local budget
execution data. Revenues are computed in 2009 constant value; index of inflation from the National Institute of
Statistics.

Census.
Notes: IURCON provides an estimation of urban connectivity based on a set of distances between a commune and its
neighboring small, medium, large, and very large cities. The higher the IURCON value, the better connected to cities is
that commune. Remote communes are those localities in the lowest quintile of IURCON.

All the above indicate that policymakers should explore the possibility of reforming the local
government administrative structure as a realistic and efficient way to enable rural development.
At the moment, it is too expensive for most localities to invest in the development of any basic
infrastructure or service. Therefore, policymakers need to devise adequate legislation to enable
rural communes to merge and create fewer but larger communities that are better connected to
urban areas (especially to the growth poles). This will help to reduce the existing inequalities
between rural and urban areas as well as within rural communities.
                         iii. Urban areas
Urban areas are substantially more developed compared with rural ones, but considerable
discrepancies exist among different types of urban areas according to the population size. The
2013 Regional Yearbook20 (Eurostat) shows that the at-risk-of-poverty or social exclusion rate
(AROPE) has a strong geographical dimension, in other words, a location effect, in the entire
Europe. However, function of degree of urbanization, the widest gap has been recorded in
Bulgaria and Romania. Thus, Romania recorded the second widest range between at-risk-of-
poverty or social exclusion rates for three different degrees of urbanization: a difference of 19
percentage points between thinly and densely populated areas. Furthermore, the income poverty
rate (AROP)21 - one of the highest among the European Member States - varies widely from about
7% in densely populated areas to 19% in intermediate density (small urban) areas and over 31%
in thinly populated (rural) areas. Therefore, the differences (by degree of urbanization) suggest
that the at-risk-of-poverty rate does not exclusively depend on personal characteristics such as

2013.pdf.
21 The at-risk-of-poverty rate is not adjusted for differences in the cost of living between the different types of area,

and therefore the gap between different areas may be overestimated.

times as high as that of in densely populated areas (medium and large cities).

Note: Only 9 cities have more than 200,000 inhabitants (including the capital Bucharest with over 1.88 million people).

Most urban centers in Romania are small towns with fewer than 20,000 inhabitants that is 225
out of a total of 320 cities (Figure 1). However, as shown in Table 3, most of the urban population
(43.1% of the 10,859 million inhabitants) lives in medium-sized cities, 37.6% in large cities and
only 19.3% in these small towns.

The category of small towns is highly heterogeneous, representing a mix of agricultural cities,
former (mono)industrial cities, and tourism areas. Some small towns have a long history and
tradition (especially in Transylvania - Center region), others were formed during the communist
regime, as part of the industrialization process (particularly around a former large enterprise in
heavy industry), while others still were administratively declared cities in recent years (as result of


                                                                                                                      13

pressure to increase the proportion of urban population within the country). Out of the 225 small
towns (with fewer than 20,000 inhabitants), 79 have a long history, being formed before 1950, 90
were developed during the communist era (1950-1989), 5 were officially included among urban
settlements between 1990 and 2000, while 51 were declared cities22 in recent years (2002-2006).
These recent small towns total about 385,000 people and have an average population size of
approximately 7,500 people. Thus, the typical city in Romania is small, incorporates villages, has
or used to have an industrial aspect,23 has no tourism or historical aspects,24 and is somewhat
socially underdeveloped.
Among small towns, the 51 recently-declared ones are the most disadvantaged. In fact, these are
rural settlements with severely underdeveloped urban infrastructure, facilities, functionality and
appearance. The Local Human Development Index (LHDI) 25 shows that they were and have
remained considerably less developed than other urban areas. Furthermore, 57% of these recent
small towns are among the least developed urban areas in Romania (the lowest quintile of
LHDI2011). Along with those, a large number (41%) of the very small cities (fewer than 7,500
inhabitants) are among the least developed urban areas in the country.
In Romania, only 81 cities (out of 320) do not include villages (compact settlements of houses
with a rural aspect usually located a few kilometers away from the city nucleus).26 By contrast,
88% of recent small towns (declared in 2002-2006), 80% of other small towns and 62% of
medium-sized cities include between 01 and 21 villages, as shown in Figure 2. There are, for
example, small towns that cover a mountain area, where villages are spread at distances of more
than 10 km from the city center. Investment in the infrastructure of villages incorporated within
cities is needed in order to improve the quality of life of the population in small towns and to
close the gap between disadvantaged small cities and other urban areas.

23 The dominant economic profile of small towns, based on a knowledge-typology developed within a previous World

Bank study, indicates that about 180 small towns (out of 225 in total) used to have an industrial dimension. The
number, size and economic sector of local enterprises have varied, but in most small towns the former enterprises
were closed down after 1990 and only small businesses were developed mainly in commerce and service sectors.

Knowledge Economy Project.
24 The historical dimension refers to the existence within the city of a historical centre or area, which before the

communist era was inhabited by Jews (in the Eastern regions) or by Germans (in the Central and Western regions of
the country). Later, the houses in these areas were nationalized. After 1990, some were reinstated to their former
owners, while others remained under the municipality that had used them as social housing. At present, in many cases,
these areas accommodate poor, marginalized groups of population. However, as a rule, these areas are well-located
within cities and have a high value on the real-estate market. Tourism is not necessarily associated with the historical
aspect. Most often, tourism is associated with the existence of cultural, sports, leisure or historical sites within the city.
In terms of housing, houses predominate in the touristic small towns, and due to their tourism-related uses, they are
larger, modernized, better maintained and thus more expensive than in other small towns.

Note: No villages refers to cities including only urban center with no incorporated villages.

In fact, many small towns are thinly-populated areas and appear on the map as clusters of distant
settlements with poor road linkage. Unlike, the medium or large cities are densely-populated
areas and their growth is mainly linked to a suburbanization process. Some medium or large cities
have expanded and reached the limits of some villages and have thus naturally incorporated
those within their boundaries. Therefore, among small towns the presence of villages reflects
mainly an effort to meet the administrative population threshold for obtaining the status of
urban administrative unit, whereas among medium or large cities the presence of villages is
linked more with the enlargement of their functional area.
The number of village-neighborhoods is significantly correlated27 with the city's local level of
human development: the larger the number of villages included within a city, the higher its
probability of being underdeveloped (measured against LHDI).28 Since the recent small towns
(declared between 2002 and 2006) and very small towns with fewer than 7,500 inhabitants have,
on average, a larger number of villages (more than five), they have a much more accentuated
rural character and are more likely to be underdeveloped compared with other urban areas.
Therefore, the 51 recently-declared small towns (below 20,000 inhabitants) and the older29 61
very small cities (fewer than 7,500 inhabitants) must receive more support and assistance in their
catching up efforts for developing faster than other urban areas.

the segment of next generation access, but also aims at the development of the already existing
transport (backbone) and distribution (backhaul) networks. The backbone and backhaul networks
in Romania are at a development level that can be used and/or extended for ultra-fast NGA
connections. Nonetheless, in the rural areas, significant additional deployments of the backhaul
networks are necessary in order to cover the 'white' areas.
For identifying the market failure in relation to the development of the NGN infrastructure, the
National Authority for Administration and Regulation in Communications (ANCOM) carried out in
2015 a mapping of the electronic communication networks. This ANCOM.v1 study32 identified the
areas that, as at end of December 2014, lacked a local loop and/or a backhaul network with
speed of 30 Mbps or over and were not involved in publicly-funded broadband projects (by
MARD, under Measure 322, or MIS, under Ro-NET project). The list of these areas was submitted
to public consultations and has been handed to the World Bank team for analysis under this RAS
project.
According to the ANCOM.v1 survey (2015), at 31 December 2014, in Romania, out of the total
13,755 villages/neighborhoods (SIRUTA units)33 in rural and urban areas, were recorded:
                  6,457 villages (47%) without local loop networks 34 for broadband
                   communications with speed of 30 Mbps or over and that are not involved in
                   publicly-funded broadband projects;
                  6,610 villages (48%) without backhaul connections 35 for broadband
                   communications with speed of 30 Mbps or over and that are not involved in
                   publicly-funded broadband projects.
By intersecting these two variables related to fixed broadband connections, we determined the
broadband areas shown in Table 4. These areas are analyzed in the next sections of this report.

which was approved in April 2015.
32 National survey on operators and network providers, including 1,006 respondents. The results were corrected in

June 2015, after our analysis was finalized. Corrections affect the status of 52 'valid' villages. However, corrections
affect only marginally the typologies presented in this paper.
33 This number includes both 'fictive' villages (129) with zero inhabitants and 'valid' villages (13,626).

34 These are fixed and mobile local networks, which connect the end user to a point in the backhaul or backbone area.

Services provided by local loop operators can include: telephony, Internet, VPN, IPTV services etc.
35 Backhaul operators represent an intermediate link between backbone and local loop. Their networks extend the

services provided by backbone operators to areas that are not covered, but present interest for the local loop
operators.

By definition, in this study, 'NGN-white' areas refer to villages (SIRUTA units), from rural and
urban environment of Romania, that have neither local loop networks nor backhaul connections
for broadband communications with 30 Mbps or over speed download, and that are not involved
in ongoing publicly-funded broadband projects (either by MARD or by MIS).36
'NGN-grey' areas include two categories, namely:
                 AnotD or Access-not-Distribution areas are villages (SIRUTA units), from rural and
                  urban environment of Romania, that have only local loop networks for
                  broadband communications with 30 Mbps or over speed download, and that are
                  not involved in ongoing publicly-funded broadband projects (either by MARD or
                  by MIS); and
                 DnotA or Distribution-not-Access areas are villages (SIRUTA units), from rural and
                  urban environment of Romania, that have only backhaul connections for
                  broadband communications with 30 Mbps or over speed download, and that are
                  not involved in ongoing publicly-funded broadband projects (either by MARD or
                  by MIS).
Finally, we consider 'NGN-black' areas all villages (SIRUTA units), from rural and urban
environment of Romania, that are neither NGN-white nor NGN-grey areas. Thus, 'NGN-black'
areas include also the villages involved in the ongoing publicly-funded broadband projects, be it
MARD projects, under Measure 322, or the Ro-NET project implemented by MIS. So, these areas
have or will have in near future (due to participation in projects) local loop networks and/or
backhaul connections for broadband communications with speed of 30 Mbps or over. While
MARD projects support both backhaul and local loop deployment, the Ro-NET project finances
only the backhaul with an agreement that a local loop will be developed by private investors in
the near future.
Before showing the results of the empirical analysis, few remarks are necessary. We called 'NGN-
white' the areas targeted by this study on two grounds. First, NGN-white areas relate to the 2020
target of 80% of households coverage with broadband of speed 30 Mbps or over set up by the
National Plan for Development of the NGN Infrastructure. The second reason is to attract
attention on the difference between the NGN-white areas and the 'white' zones with regard to
basic broadband infrastructure. As defined by the European Commission, the typical 'white' areas
refer to zones where broadband infrastructure does not exist and it is unlikely to be deployed in
the near future. By contrast, in some 'NGN-white' zones is quite likely to exist some infrastructure,
but of lower quality than that required for achieving the Digital Agenda for Europe 2020


36In this paper, ‘ongoing publicly-funded broadband projects’ or ‘ongoing projects’ refer to all MARD or Ro-NET
projects, irrespective in which phase of implementation they are.

development objectives. In fact, the data reported by MIS in 201437 show that the number of
localities (SIRUTA units) in which there are no broadband communication service providers is
much smaller than the number of 'NGN-white' spots (3,666 compared with 6,358). Also, in 210
localities there are private operators willing to deploy broadband networks in the next three
years.38 So, most likely, the 'NGN-white' spots are a mix of 'white' and 'grey' areas in terms of
basic broadband infrastructure.
The distinction between 'NGN-white', 'NGN-grey' and 'NGN-black' areas is relevant for evaluating
the compatibility of the state subsidy for NGN networks. 'NGN-white' areas are eligible for state
support if the compatibility conditions39 are fulfilled. The 'NGN-grey' areas may also receive
conditional state support. In order to ensure that a public intervention in one of these NGN
undersupplied areas does not impede private investments, the fact that no private investors are
interested in developing additional NGN infrastructure in the next three years needs to be
assessed. In this sense, a summary of the planned aid measures needs to be published and the
stakeholders should be invited to present their observations. In addition, legislative and
regulatory measures to reduce the barriers for the deployment of NGN networks should be
considered. Finally, in 'NGN-black' areas, state intervention is not necessary.
The third remark refers to the number of broadband areas shown in Table 5. ANCOM 2015 data
indicate that in Romania are 6,358 NGN-white spots. A part of these (123 spots), however, are an
effect of the way in which the ANCOM.v1 list was done, based on the inventory of territorial units
that includes the 'fictive' villages, which have been depopulated or even disappeared. Hence,
after cleaning the data, the number decreases to 6,235 'valid' NGN-white areas (or 45.8% of all
'valid' villages in the country). The large majority of these areas (5,785 or 93%) are located in rural
areas. With regard to NGN-grey areas (AnotD and DnotA), there are 351 spots, of which 93% (or
325) are from the rural environment.

The fourth remark introduces the issue of villages covered by mobile broadband networks
3G+(HSPA)/LTE/LTE Advanced.40 The ANCOM 2015 survey was focused on fixed broadband
connections, but collected also coverage information of the mobile broadband networks,
although MIS has considered that those do not meet some performance requirements, especially
with regard to prices for access/package services. Nevertheless, for planning the future
interventions in broadband infrastructure and services, we consider useful to use the coverage
with mobile broadband networks as an additional criterion in distinguishing between various
types of broadband areas. The results of using this criterion are shown below.

Almost a third (31% or 1,948) of the NGN-white areas (as defined above) are covered by mobile
broadband networks 3G+(HSPA)/LTE/LTE Advanced, either access networks or access and
distribution networks (Table 6). Also, 36% of AnotD zones, 37% of DnotA areas and over a half
(53%) of NGN-black points are in a similar situation. Therefore, for the purpose of this study, we
combine the NGN-types with the presence/absence of a 3G+ network, as Figure 4 illustrates.
The last remark relate to the target of 100% of total population covered by fixed broadband, set
up in the National Strategy on Digital Agenda for Romania 2020 . In order to refer to this target
we have to introduce two additional subcategories of NGN-white areas, which to reflect the lack
of fixed broadband connections (even lower than 30 Mbps). To this end, we use the MARD data
(December 31, 2014) on the number of electronic communication networks and service providers
(official or unofficial) per village. Consequently, in this report, we define 'white' spots as the NGN-
white villages in which there is no provider of fixed broadband connection (regardless a mobile
3G+ network is present or not). Figure 3 illustrates the four subcategories of NGN-white villages

and Map 7 shows their distribution across the country. A number of 2,473 villages are broadband
'white' (no operator and no connection), of which 662 are covered by a mobile broadband 3G+
network. In this way the number of NGN-white villages decreases from 6,235 to a total of 3,762
white villages, of which 1,326 are also covered by mobile broadband 3G+ networks.

In conclusion, twelve types of broadband areas are included in the study, which are shown in
Figure 4. The next sections present the results of the empirical analysis that compares these
different broadband areas, considering only the 'valid' villages, on various dimensions related to
geographical, institutional and socio-economic indicators.

                  C. Geospatial Analysis of the NGN-White and NGN-Grey Areas from Romania
Based on information about the location and territory characteristics of undersupplied areas,
appropriate measures can be undertaken by competent authorities or private actors aiming to
supply these areas with broadband. This section provides such geographical data.
                              i. Distribution by region and county
                                              White and NGN-white villages
Map1 shows that NGN-white villages are spread in all counties and all regions (see Maps 1-3 and
Tables A.1-A.8 in Annex). On the one hand, out of all NGN-white villages, 21% are from the region
with the lowest urbanization level in the country, namely North-East (especially from counties
Vaslui and Bacau). Other 18% are from the Centre region (8% come from only one county, Alba),
while 15% are from North-West. In the North-East region predominate NGN-white villages (no
3G+), whereas NGN-white with 3G+ networks are very numerous in Centre. On the other hand,
the proportion of NGN-white spots in all 'valid' villages has a national average of 46%, but varies
widely from about 6% in Bucharest-Ilfov to 30-35% in South and South-West, 47-49% in South-
East and North-West, reaching over 52% in North-East, West and Centre regions.
Seven counties could be considered priority for intervention, namely Alba and Cluj (Centre),
Hunedoara (West), Vaslui, Bacau and Iasi (North-East), and Buzau (South-East). Overall, these
counties contribute with 36% of all NGN-white villages in the country (38% of those without 3G+
networks and 33% of those with 3G+ networks), as well as 42% of the white spots (no connection
and no operator). In the same time, in these counties, the process of broadband development
seems to be the slowest in the country, since the NGN-white spots account for over 60% of all
villages, in each.41 Other counties which lag behind in broadband development, but with a smaller
contribution due to a smaller overall number of villages, include: Mehedinti (South-West), Salaj
and Bistrita-Nasaud (North-West), as well as Constanta (South-East).
                                                      NGN-grey villages
The NGN-grey areas are fewer and tend to be highly territorially concentrated (see Maps 4 and 5
and, in Annex, Tables A.1-A.8):
                      Over two thirds (65%) of all AnotD (Access-not-Distribution) villages are located
                       in nine counties: Iasi, Vaslui and Bacau (both from North-East), Buzau (South-
                       East), Prahova, Calarasi and Dambovita (South-Muntenia), Caras-Severin and
                       Timis (West). Villages AnotD with 3G+ networks are more numerous in one
                       county only, that is Prahova. At the regional level, 70% of all AnotD villages (no
                       3G+) are situated in North-East, South-East and South-Muntenia regions,
                       whereas almost three quarters of the AnotD villages with 3G+ networks belong
                       to South-Muntenia, North-East and West regions.
                      Almost a half of all DnotA (Distribution-not-Access) villages (46%)42 are situated
                       in only three counties, namely: Prahova (South-Muntenia), Salaj (North-West)
                       and Suceava (North-East). The most intense development of DnotA networks has
                       taken place in the South-Muntenia region.
                                                     NGN-black villages

41   Only in Buzau the proportion of NGN-white villages in all 'valid' villages is lower, 52%.
42   The proportion is 40% of DnotA no 3G+ and 54% of DnotA with 3G+ networks.



                                                                                                      26
                                     “Mapping the Broadband Areas in Romania”


NGN-black villages are spread in all counties and all regions (see Maps 6 and 7 and, in Annex,
Tables A.1-A.8). However, seven counties accumulate 37% of all NGN-black villages in Romania
(both without and with 3G+ networks). These counties are: Arges and Dambovita (South-
Muntenia), Valcea and Gorj (South-West), Bihor (North-West), Mures (Centre) and Suceava
(North-East). The same counties are the most advanced in developing broadband services since
the proportion of NGN-black villages represent over 60% of all 'valid' villages, in each. 43 Other
counties with a high proportion of NGN-black villages are:
(i) Botosani (North-East), Maramures (North-East) and Galati (South-East), with respect to NGN-
black no 3G+ villages (with values of 34-42% as compared to the national average of 20% in all
'valid' villages);
(ii) Bucharest, Ilfov (Bucharest-Ilfov) as well as Brasov and Covasna (Centre) with regard to NGN-
black villages with 3G+ networks (proportions of 100%, 90%, 46% and 39% respectively, as
compared with 25% of all 'valid' villages at the national level).
At regional level, the most intense development of the fixed high speed broadband in the country
has taken place in three regions: South-Muntenia and Bucharest-Ilfov, particularly for NGN-black
villages with 3G+ networks, and South-West, with regard to NGN-black villages without 3G+
networks. At the other extreme, the weakest development has been recorded in the West,
North-East, Centre and South-East regions.
Extremely small proportions of NGN-black spots in all 'valid' villages (between 6% and 21% as
compared to 45% national average) are found in four counties: Vaslui (North-East), Alba (Centre),
Tulcea (South-East) and Hunedoara (West). In addition, out of the 96 villages included in the
Danube Delta micro-region,44 only 23 are NGN-black (12 without and 11 with 3G+ networks).
                                                      Ongoing projects
A total number of 970 villages were recorded as being involved in ongoing projects as at
December 31, 2014 (ANCOM.v1, 2015). Most of them (783) have participated in the Ro-NET
project, implemented by MIS, and only 187 have been part of a MARD projects (see Maps 8 and 9
and, in Annex, Tables A.1-A.8).
These villages are dispersed in all counties, with the exception of Maramures (and the capital
Bucharest). Nonetheless, the number of villages per county ranges between 1 and 53, with a peak
of 101 in Vaslui county (North-East).
Table 7 illustrates a matching exercise between the number of projects per county and the profile
of county in terms of mix of NGN-areas (white, grey or black). The exercise includes only the
extreme cases on at least one of the four dimensions considered (columns in table). The main
finding of this exercise is that, at present, the public broadband projects are poorly correlated
with the NGN-types.




43   Only in Mures the proportion of NGN-black villages in all 'valid' villages is lower, 52%.
44   These villages belong to Tulcea and Constanta counties.

Considering the county as comparison level, it becomes apparent that public broadband projects
tend to give the same response to situations that are very different. Let us take as an example the
counties with the highest number of interventions. The strongest response is targeted to the
most problematic cases (such as Vaslui, Alba and Hunedoara), as would have been expected.
Nonetheless, a response of comparable intensity is addressed to some medium situations (such
as Vrancea and Dolj) and even to good situations (such as Valcea, Bihor or Olt). Furthermore, the
same number of projects is financed from public funds in counties with very different number of
villages. For example, about 50 villages are targeted by projects both in counties with a relatively
small number of villages (Teleorman, 236) and in medium-size counties (Olt with 388 villages
overall), as well as in counties with a large number of villages (Valcea with a total of 608 villages).
In a similar manner, a medium intensity response is given to problematic situations (Bacau and
Iasi), but also to some rather weak (Constanta or Salaj), medium (Timis), good (Arges, Mures or
Suceava), as well as very good, such as in Dambovita.
This mismatch, most likely, has a multitude of causes among which:
- lack of a mapping/ data at national level, wherefrom the lack of any consideration regarding the
county profile of NGN-types when villages are selected for intervention;
- different and uncoordinated approaches of the two public projects: (i) MIS has provided support
only backhaul conditioned by the interest expressed by a private operator to build up the local
loop, while MARD has financed both backhaul and local loop; (ii) villages for intervention in Ro-
NET were selected by MIS based on a study, whereas for MARD funding the operators applied on
a competitive basis. However, the existence of an interested operator was a prerequisite for both
projects. It is a well documented fact that the presence of operators as well as the propensity to
document/apply for projects is considerably higher in more developed communities, with high
social capital, as compared with poor/deprived areas, unless an extended campaign and
facilitation is rolled out before the project onset. No such campaign was implemented, which led
to a part of the mismatch. For example, among counties with the largest number of MARD
projects are found Olt and Valcea. Nonetheless, in other counties with a comparable profile
(rather advanced in terms of broadband infrastructure development), the MARD projects have
played an insignificant role or not at all, such as in the cases of Suceava and Mures.
However, the analysis at village level provides only a partial picture that needs to be completed
with data on population and households.
                          ii. Distribution according to the size of population
This section turns from village to population. The analysis is focused on size of the population in
the ten types of NGN areas included in the analysis, at the levels of population (individuals),
household, village and administrative unit (commune or city).

Over 84% of Romania's population lives in NGN-black areas, which means they have access to
high speed Internet (Table 8 and, in Annex, Table A.9). This coverage rate of population varies
between 69% in rural areas and 97% in urban ones. Furthermore, in urban areas, 95% of
population lives in cities covered by fixed broadband with high speed download (30+ Mbps) and
mobile broadband networks 3G+(HSPA)/LTE/LTE Advanced. By contrast, in rural settlements, only
39% of residents have access to services similar to those from urban areas, while 26% have
access only to fixed connections (NGN-black no 3G+ networks).
Overall, in the all NGN-white villages (6,235) reside only almost 14% of general population (Table
8 and, in Annex, Table A.9). Out of them, in the white villages not covered by fixed broadband live
about 2% of total country population that represent about 4% of rural population (Table A.9,
Annex). The Digital Agenda target of 100% coverage of population with fixed broadband was
achieved for urban population.

                   Coverage-related 2020 target already achieved at country level
About 85% of households in Romania have access to high speed Internet as residents of a NGN-
black areas (Table 8 and, in Annex, Table A.10). The coverage of households varies considerably
between 68% in rural communities and 98% in cities. The Digital Agenda target of 80% coverage
of households with broadband above 30 Mbps was achieved at the country level.

In conclusion, the coverage-related targets of the Digital Agenda for Romania 2020 have already
been achieved in 2015. Yet, investments are still necessary for closing the significant urban-rural
gap, particularly in relation to high speed Internet (30+ Mbps) and keeping in mind that rural

areas concentrate most disadvantaged population. In addition, these data send a clear signal that
much more attention and efforts should be channeled on stimulating penetration, demand and
usage of Internet, especially through developing the supply of services such as e-commerce, e-
health, e-learning and foremost e-government. Only increasing the supply of services, the usage
may increase sufficiently to reach the other Digital Agenda targets.

Very high/low values either in absolute numbers or in proportion in total households; Zero in N-grey villages columns
shows that in the respective county there are zero DnotA or AnotD villages; Minus in N-grey villages columns indicate a
very small overall number of households in DnotA or AnotD villages; Colors code: Dark green - very good situation or

As for the existing interventions, the public broadband projects are poorly correlated with the
profile of county in terms of mix of NGN-areas (white, grey or black). Table 9 shows the results of
a matching exercise between the number of projects per county and the county broadband
profile, when the number of households is taken into consideration. This exercise confirms the
results of the analysis based on the number of villages shown in Table 7. Inconsistencies between
intervention and the treated problem remain, regardless if the number of villages or that of
households is taken as reference. A response of comparable intensity has been given to very
different or even opposed situations, from very problematic to good situations.
                                         Size of population at village level
Section A.ii3.A.ii has already shown that in Romania, most villages have between 100 and 2,000
inhabitants. At one extreme, the small villages (below 500 inhabitants) and, especially very small
villages (less than 200 inhabitants), are the most disadvantaged, particularly those with an elderly
population and/or those that are located in remote areas. At the other extreme, large villages
(above 2,000 inhabitants) tend to be the most developed. Thus, the size of village population is a
strong determinant for its general level of development or potential.
The size of village population is a strong correlate of NGN broadband areas, which indicates this
indicator as a good proxy for market potential (see Table A.11 in Annex). Over three quarters of
the white villages (no operator and no connection) are very small with less than 200 inhabitants.
In fact, 310 white villages have below 20 inhabitants (306 in rural and 4 in urban areas). In the
same time, the proportion of white villages from rural areas decreases from 90% of villages 1-20
inhabitants to 73% of villages 21-100 inhabitants and 39% respectively in villages of 101-200
inhabitants. Once a rural community reaches the threshold of 200 inhabitants, it starts to have
increased chances to be covered by some fixed broadband connections, be it high speed or not.
At the threshold of 500 inhabitants, rural communities have 61% chances to have fixed
broadband connections at speeds above 30 Mbps (mostly accompanied by mobile 3G+ networks).
The odds to have access to high speed Internet increases with village population size, reaching
87% of villages with over 3,000 inhabitants. A similar correlation is registered in urban areas, with
the difference that hamlets of 1-20 residents from cities have a probability of 71% to be NGN-
white villages, hence they have access to Internet but of at a speed below 30 Mbps.

Development of broadband infrastructure is still needed predominantly in small and very small
villages (<500 inhabitants), but also in 1,798 medium or large villages, of which only 146 are in
urban areas (Figure 5). Given the rather high market potential of medium and large villages,
especially the urban ones, the state intervention should be directed towards the small white or
NGN-white areas from rural environment. Among these, however, priority should be given to
viable communities with growth potential. A relevant measure of community viability is
population growth. With this purpose, the study measured the evolution of village population
between 2002 and 2011 (the last censuses). Based on this indicator the small white and NGN-
white areas (<500 inhabitants) can be divided into 'small viable' communities and 'small-declining'
communities, as shown in Table 10.

Notes: Small declining villages are SIRUTA units (urban and rural) with 500 inhabitants at most that at 2011 census had
a resident population smaller than 95% of the level registered at 2002 census. Small viable are SIRUTA units (urban and
rural) with 500 inhabitants at most that at 2011 census had a resident population >95% of the level registered at 2002
census.

Only about one in every five small rural white communities and small urban white and NGN-white
hamlets is viable. The other four in every five of these villages are declining. The share of viable
communities slightly increases to 29% among small rural NGN-white villages.
In total, in the small villages (<500 inhabitants) that are white or NGN-white spots live almost 818
thousand persons. Out of them 93% are in rural areas (7% in urban), 64% in NGN-areas (36% in
white spots), 72% in declining communities and only 28% in viable ones (see Table A.12 in Annex).
These people belong to around 315 thousand households, of which 93% are in rural areas (7% in
urban), 63% in NGN-areas (37% in white spots), 74% in declining communities and only 26% in
viable ones (see Table A.13 in Annex).
                         Size of population at administrative unit level (commune/city)
Sections 3.A.ii and Error! Reference source not found. have already discussed the main
characteristics of administrative units from Romania, both communes and cities. We saw that:
                     Among rural municipalities, the small communes with fewer than 2,000
                      inhabitants are the most disadvantaged in terms of economic, human and social
                      development. Even the remote communes (those that have little connection to
                      any city) are likely to be disadvantaged only when they are small. In the same
                      time, the small communes are generally less connected to their nearest cities
                      than larger communes (in other words, they are more likely to be remote).
                     Among small towns, the (51) recent small towns (declared between 2002 and
                      2006) and (61)45 very small towns with fewer than 7,500 inhabitants have, on
                      average, a larger number of villages (more than five), they have a much more
                      accentuated rural character and are more likely to be underdeveloped 46
                      compared with other urban areas.
Therefore, an analysis of the administrative units (SIRSUP level) in which the NGN broadband
areas (identified at village - SIRUTA level) are grouped is highly relevant. Even more so given that
local authority (mayoralty) is an important stakeholder in any public intervention, since it
represents and is responsible for all incorporated villages.
Table A.14 (Annex) shows the distribution of villages (SIRUTA units) according to the NGN-type
and size of population in the administrative units (SIRSUP units) to which they belong. A pattern is
evident. In the rural environment, white points belong more frequently to small rural
municipalities (<2,000 inhabitants), whereas AnotD, DnotA and NGN-black areas tend to
concentrate in communes over 3,000 inhabitants. In urban areas, white spots are found only in
small cities with less than 20 thousand inhabitants, especially in those very small of less than
7,500 people. NGN-grey (AnotD and DnotA) are frequently located in small towns (7,500-20 thou
persons), while medium and large cities predominantly incorporate NGN-black villages.

ongoing projects (Ro-NET or MARD).

In Romania, most administrative units, be it rural or urban, incorporate village-neighborhoods
(section Error! Reference source not found.).47 Thus, any commune or city is a mix of NGN
broadband areas of 1-to-5 types of villages, including white, NGN-white, AnotD, DnotA, NGN-
black, and villages that participate in ongoing projects (Ro-NET or MARD). Table 11 shows that
only 39% of communes and 47% of cities incorporate villages of only one NGN-type. At the other
extreme, three communes have the most complex mix of (five) NGN-types villages. For example,
commune Stoilesti,48 from Valcea county, includes a total of 15 villages, out of which: 4 white
communities, 1 NGN-white, 6 AnotD settlements, no DnotA, 1 NGN-black village, and 3 ongoing
Ro-NET projects.
                      Lessons for public interventions and priority administrative units
Given the current development level of broadband infrastructure seen at the administrative unit
level (Table A.15, Annex), few lessons could be drawn:
(1) In the light of the NGN National Plan, the option to change the design of state intervention
from village to administrative unit is recommended to be considered. Until now, both Ro-NET and
MARD projects targeted villages regardless the broadband profile of the administrative unit.
Partly this was the result of the technical parameters required by the project, partly was caused
by lack of data, and partly was given by the different definition used for targets ('white' areas). At
present, the entire landscape has changed and a new approach may prove beneficial, both in
effectiveness and efficiency terms. Even more so taking into account that in most communes, the
geography does not obstructs viable technical solutions for covering the entire territory, hence all
included villages.
(2) The coverage targets of the Digital Agenda for Romania 2020 have already been achieved.
Therefore, there is a need to prioritize interventions towards the communities most in need
(characterized by the most accentuated market failure). For the villages that belong to
administrative units in which there are operators of electronic communication networks at


47 The 320 cities from Romania include a total of 1,253 village neighborhoods. Only 81 cities do not include villages
(compact settlements of houses with a rural aspect usually located a few kilometres away from the city nucleus). As a
general rule, the larger the number of villages included within a locality, the higher its probability of being
underdeveloped (measured against LHDI as defined in footnote 19).
48 The other two communes with a mix of five NGN-types are Feliceni (Harghita) and Ileana (Calarasi).




                                                                                                                  35

speeds above 30 Mbps, an option is to let the market to develop, while focusing the public effort
on developing the supply of services and on stimulating demand.
(3) A public intervention at administrative unit level may also consider the change of business
model. Until now, the local authorities had a rather low profile in the public interventions, mainly
due to the requirement to work with an operator willing to develop the infrastructure (backhaul
and/or local loop). In the future, the role of public authorities could increase, especially if
intervention at administrative unit level is considered. Consequently, mechanisms and tools to
increase the local capacity to deal with local networks and operating companies would become
crucial.
(4) Simply zooming up the map of broadband areas it becomes obvious that many undersupplied
municipality are neighboring other undersupplied municipalities. An example is presented in Map
10 regarding Vaslui county. So, besides the municipality level, the intervention may take place at
the level of clusters of localities such as the partnerships of administrative units (Local Action
Groups - LAG) under LEADER (MARD) or CLLD (OPHC and ROP) programs financed from European
funds. This issue is treated in section 3.D.i Here we keep analyzing the interventions at the
commune/city level, which are highly relevant for rural and urban municipalities that are not part
of any LAG.

             people in 7,572 households (see list in Table A.16, Annex). Among these villages, 94
             are small declining, 26 are small viable and only 7 have over 500 inhabitants.

             247 communes and one small town (Insuratei, Braila) with a total of about 614
             thousand inhabitants and over 220 thousand households. These settlements
             incorporate 613 villages (4 in urban), of which 399 are medium or large (>500
             inhabitants) and other 41 are small viable communities. They are scattered in 38
             counties, with a concentration in six counties, namely Buzau, Galati, Iasi, Ialomita, Olt

             and Teleorman.
              (C) Communes that have only white or NGN-white villages
             158 communes almost evenly distributed in 37 counties. They have about 374
             thousand inhabitants in 136 thousand households, which are grouped in 822 villages,
             out of which 251 are medium or large (>500 inhabitants) and 134 are small viable
             communities.
By investing in infrastructure development in 423 communes and one small town (Insuratei,
Braila), which are the most affected by market failure (priority 1), over a million persons (in 364
thousand households and 1,562 villages) may be reached. Such an approach would address 487
white villages and 1,075 NGN-white spots,50 increasing the coverage with over 5% of population
and 4.9% of households at national level. Map 11 shows the distribution of these settlements in
the territory.
                       iii. Distribution according to distance, position and territory
                                   Distance and territory at village level
The village accessibility, measured by geographic distance51 to the nearest city, is a highly
relevant indicator from the social and economic point of view. Large distance combined with
poor quality of roads determines little profitability of transportation service. Low profitability
leads to serious reduction of transportation means. Consequently, the large distance becomes
remoteness especially during rainy seasons. Neither a doctor nor a teacher, based outside
commune, accepts to work in remote villages primarily due to extremely difficult commuting.
Therefore, geographical isolation comes together with institutional marginalization. In addition,
low villagers’ opportunity to reach urban peasant market for selling their food products deepens
the economic weakness of individuals and community.
Distance to the nearest city is highly correlated with existence of a railway or a bus station. It
represents a proxy for the distance to the nearest high school and university, as well as to the
nearest urban peasant market. It is correlated with the development of village infrastructure: the
smaller the distance to a city, the larger the number of kilometers of modernized road, the larger
the share of houses endowed with running water, and the larger the share of households with
telephone. In addition, the lower the distance to the nearest city, the larger and more
sophisticated the cultural consumption of the population: the higher the number of newspapers
subscriptions, the higher the education stock (Sandu, coord., 2000),52 and the higher the ability to
use a foreign languages (Voicu and Voicu, 2004).53
The distance to the nearest city varies in Romania between 0.5 and 82 km (excepting the villages
with access on water from Danube Delta), with an average of 21 km and a standard variation of
11 km. Thus, in Romania, a village is close to city if it is located to less than 10 km from it, 10-32
km represents a moderate distance, while a village is remote if there are 32 km or more to the
nearest urban area.



50 These values represent 20% of all white spots and 29% of all NGN-white villages in the country.
51 We use the distances determined by a team of geographers from the Institute for Geography.

In rural areas, the geographic distance to the nearest city is also a strong correlate of the NGN-
type. Small villages tend to be remote or far from cities, large villages concentrate in the cities
neighborhood, and medium size villages are predominantly at moderate distances to cities. Table
A17 (Annex) shows that the share of white and NGN-white villages in all SIRUTA units increases
incrementally from 34% of the villages at 0.5-10 km from a city to 43% among villages found at
>10-21 km, 53% in the case of villages at >21-32 km, and reaches a high 61% for remote villages
located at over 32 km from the nearest city.54 So, the larger the number of remote villages
incorporated by a commune, the higher its chances to be among the white or NGN-white
communes (priority 1).
Landform of territory makes also a difference with regard to the village NGN-type. In rural
Romania, plain and hilly-plain villages are predominantly white or NGN-white areas, whereas
hilly-mountain and mountain villages tend to be NGN-black points (Table 12).

                           Administrative position of the village within commune/city
As section Error! Reference source not found. explained, 88% of communes are constituted of at
least two villages, one central and one or more peripheral villages. 55 The share of peripheral
villages is about 75% in all SIRUTA units, both in rural and urban areas. Nonetheless, the
proportion of population living in peripheral villages (neighborhoods) represents 48% of total
rural population and mere 6% of urban population. With the majority of population, central
villages (neighborhoods) concentrate the administrative and institutional resources of the
commune/city. The central village/town is the locus for the municipality, postal unit, health unit,
church, coordinating school, police, House for Culture and so on. In contrast, in most peripheral
villages there are only two institutions, a church and a school. Furthermore, the public
infrastructure is significantly poorer in peripheral villages (dirt roads, lack of running water, lack of
communications, etc.).




54   The share of white and NGN-white villages in all SIRUTA units is 46% at the country level.
55   The other 12% of communes comprise only a central village.

The administrative position of village is another strong correlate of the level of development of
broadband infrastructure (Table 13). The share of NGN-black villages in all SIRUTA units increases
incrementally from 35% of peripheral rural settlements to 46% among urban peripheral
villages/neighborhood, 68% in the case of central villages, and peaks 99% for central units of
cities.56 Therefore, integrated intervention at administrative unit level, which to find the most
suitable technical solution for all incorporated villages (central and peripheral) would be
beneficial in relation to the cohesion policy.
                 Distance and geographical position within county at administrative unit level
At the village level, the distance to the nearest city is a strong correlate for the type of broadband
area. For communes, as clusters of villages, this correlation is much attenuated (Table 14).
Counter-intuitively, among the remote communes (measured based on IURCON), the share of
those without any NGN-black village is smaller and not larger than in the communes well
connected to the urban network. Nonetheless, the proportion of communes comprising only
white or NGN-white villages is also smaller. So, regarding broadband, the remote communes tend
to be a combination of white, grey and black villages. A much better indicator is the existence
within the commune of one or more remote villages (at >32 km from the nearest city).
Position at county boundaries is also relevant for the communes identified as intervention
priority. Not only that slightly more communes at county boundaries would qualify for priority
interventions, but also more of them are located at over 75 minutes trip from the county capital
city (from where many documents and approvals should be obtained for infrastructure
deployment).




56   The share of NGN-black villages in all SIRUTA units is 44.5% at the country level.

               D. Socio-Economic Analysis of the NGN broadband areas from Romania
This chapter of the broadband mapping aims to identify the areas indeed uncovered (most
undersupplied) through a comparative analysis between the NGN-white (including white), NGN-
grey (AnotD and DnotA) and NGN-black areas (including ongoing projects). The analysis is based
on socio-economic and broadband indicators grouped on three dimensions: market potential,
demand potential, and economic power of population and community. The analysis will unfold at
two levels: village (SIRUTA units) and administrative unit (SIRSUP units). Such an analysis
constitutes a baseline study useful for developing the future investment monitoring, which is
necessary in order to determine resulting effects if an authority allocates state aid or funds for
broadband deployment.
Identifying the areas indeed uncovered is important in order to inform the possible spatial
allocation of state aid, which represents a potential means to provide incentive to broadband
deployment in undersupplied areas. However, state aid is an instrument that is intended to be
used only as a complementary measure to private investment, hence for areas indeed uncovered,
and that state aid does not lead to significant market distortions.

In this study, areas of distinctive potential for development are delimited by combining data on
broadband availability with additional data on various ecological characteristics. Identification of
market potential of each village from Romania is based on a procedure in three steps. Figure 6
describes this procedure and the empirical results at 'valid' village level.

The first step refers to the ecological dimension. Previous sections have brought evidence that
the ecological dimension is highly relevant for the level of development of broadband
infrastructure in the country. Villages small (<500 inhabitants), peripheral and remote (32+ km to
the nearest city) have disproportionately low chances to be covered by broadband, whereas
those large (>1,000 inhabitants), central and close-to-city (< 10km to the nearest city) have
disproportionately high chances, as compared with the other (medium) villages. Correspondingly,
all 'valid' villages were divided in three groups that have a market potential low, medium and high,
given by their ecological characteristics. Thus, out of all SIRUTA units in Romania, 10% have low
market potential, 6% have a high level, and 84% are medium.
The second step shifts the focus towards the existing broadband market. This is measured based
on the number of electronic communications networks and services providers that operate
within the village, which can be official or unofficial and can deliver broadband at a speed of 30
Mbps or lower. 57 The three ecologically-based groups of villages were further divided according
to the number of existing operators, which led to five different categories of villages. SIRUTA
units without any operating company were found only among villages with low or medium
potential given by their ecological traits. In fact, the proportion of villages not covered by any
operator decreases sharply from 47% of those small, peripheral and remote (655 out of 1,380) to
16% of medium ones (1,818 out of 11,436) and 0%, respectively, among villages large, central, in

 The ANCOM survey 2015 includes also data on electronic communications networks and services providers as per
MARD study at December 31, 2014.



                                                                                                                                            43

the vicinity to a city. Accordingly, the share of villages with low market potential has halved to 5%
of all 'valid' villages, while the share of those with high market potential has remained the same.
The third step looks toward the near future and not at the current market situation. The ANCOM
2015 survey does not include data on operators that expressed some interest in broadband
deployment for the next three years (near future). Therefore, another indicator is used as a proxy,
namely the number of operators within the commune to which the given village belongs. The
rationale behind this indicator refers to the fact, that once a local provider develops, there are
higher chances for this business to expand to the neighboring communities (even small and
peripheral), in the near future. On the one hand, the advantage of such a proxy variable is that it
is both realistic and available. For example, the fact that over a half of the small, peripheral,
remote villages is covered by a network is most likely the result of such an expansion process of a
local operator from the neighboring villages. On the other hand, this proxy has as major limit in
the fact that, in some communes, peripheral villages may be quite far one from another and data
about vicinity and distances between the uncovered village and the villages with a provider are
still missing.
Following the 3-step procedure, five types of villages becomes apparent, which correspond to
five degrees of market potential (Map 12 shows their distribution in territory):
               market failure or villages indeed uncovered (and with very low chances to be
                covered in the near future) refer to only 26 SIRUTA units in the country (or 0.2%
                of total)
               101 (0.7%) villages have low market potential which is given only by their
                favorable ecological characteristics
               1,354 (9.8%) villages have medium market potential, as broadband market has
                already developed or have some chances to developed in the near future, in
                spite of their unfavorable ecological characteristics
               11,335 (82.4%) villages have medium-high market potential both due to their
                favorable ecological characteristics and to the market situation
               810 (5.9%) villages with high potential which are already covered by broadband
                networks and service providers, mostly at a speed of 30+ Mbps.
Villages marked by market failure and those with low market potential (a total of 127 SIRUTA
units) are all in rural areas and, to a very large extent, are small, declining (between 2002 and
2011) and peripheral (see Table A.18, Annex). By definition, the first category is also remote,
while low potential villages are closer to a city (>10-32 km). In addition, both categories neither
have broadband networks, nor have realistic chances to be covered in the near future.
Accordingly, they make part of the white villages (100%). Hence, they belong to the communes
identified as being first intervention priority, in the previous section 3.C.ii. Therefore, state
intervention in priority 1 communes would target all villages mostly affected by market failure in
the entire country together with 14% of all communities with medium chances for development,
12% of the medium-high ones, as well as 7% of the developed areas (NGN-black points). Such a
mix of villages requires the development of an integrated approach for public intervention at
commune level, in which local authorities and local operators and service providers should hold a
significant role.

Out of all villages with medium chances of broadband market development (1,354), 98% are from
the rural areas and only 2% from cities (Table A.18, Annex). They are small, declining, peripheral
and remote. However, 53% of them are covered by 1-to-5 broadband networks, but only about
19% have access to high download speeds of 30+ Mbps. Furthermore, all these medium villages
belong to communes with 1-to-43 networks, of which about half (52%) have only basic
infrastructure (<30 Mbps) and half (48%) have access to broadband at speeds above 30 Mbps.
Hence, about 14% are part of priority 1 communes (see section 3.C.ii). In urban areas,
villages/neighborhoods with medium chances are located in only nine very small towns (Table 15).

Villages with medium-high potential of broadband development (a total of 11,335 villages) are
92% from rural areas (Table A.18, Annex). They include a mix of small, medium and large
communities, declining and viable, peripheral and central, remote or close to city, in proportions
comparable to those recorded at the level of all villages nationwide. Thus, the typical village from
rural Romania has medium-high broadband market potential. Correspondingly, 84% of them are
covered by 1-to-30 networks, almost equally divided between <30 Mbps and 30+ Mbps speeds
download. A number of 1,703 such villages are uncovered, of which 1,220 belong to priority 1
communes. However, all of them are part of communes covered by 1-58 networks, of which over
67% offer broadband at 30+ Mbps.
Villages/neighborhoods with medium-high potential of broadband development from urban
areas (958 SIRUTA units) are distributed in 245 towns from all counties (Table A.18, Annex).
About a half of these villages (47%) are small (<500 inhabitants), mostly declining and peripheral.
Only 1.5% of them are uncovered and all those are located in three small towns, namely Budesti
(Calarasi), Pogoanele (Buzau), and Insuratei (Braila). The majority of 98.5% is covered by 1-to-30
networks, but only 53% are NGN-black spots (including ongoing projects). Nonetheless, high
speed broadband (30+ Mbps) is available in nearly all cities of belonging.
Villages with high market potential (810) are both from rural and urban areas: 33% and 67%,
respectively (Table A.18, Annex). These are large and central communities from cities or from
communes nearby cities. The large majority of them are NGN-black points, 85% of rural ones and
99% of urban. Most of those that are NGN-white (have broadband at speeds <30 Mbps) are
included in the administrative units identified in section 3.C.ii as being intervention priorities. In
urban areas, such zones can be found only in three small towns: Budesti (Calarasi), Pogoanele
(Buzau), and Insuratei (Braila).

                           Refining the typology from the intervention perspective
The typology of villages may now be refined from the intervention perspective by combining the
degree of market potential with quality of the existing broadband infrastructure. Table 16 shows
that various types of villages have different development needs and opportunities related to
broadband infrastructure:
 Need to be covered by fixed broadband not necessary able to ensure >=30Mbps:58 White
  villages and those with low market potential from white communes (127 units), which are
  indeed uncovered. However, given their dominant profile (small, declining, remote,
  peripheral) and the coverage-related targets of the Digital Agenda for Romania, they need to
  be covered by fixed broadband not necessary able to ensure >=30Mbps.
 Need for support/stimulation for high speed broadband (30+ Mbps) deployment at least in one
  village per administrative unit:59 White and NGN-white villages with medium-to-high market
  potential (1,435) from NGN-white communes/cities (only providers <30 Mbps) need
  support/stimulation for high speed broadband (30+ Mbps) deployment. The rationale for
  deployment in at least one village per administrative relates to the medium-to-high market
  potential of these villages, which indicate that once the market-seed is planted they have
  some potential to expand locally, without additional state intervention. These types of villages
  are also found in the communes with ongoing projects. Nonetheless, by the end of the
  ongoing projects, the high speed broadband (30+ Mbps) deployment in at least one village per
  administrative unit is expected to be achieved. For this reason, only administrative units
  without MARD or Ro-NET projects are considered in relation to this development need.
 Need for support for the extension of the existing infrastructure within the commune to cover
  the white and NGN-white villages:60 This development need characterizes many undersupplied
  areas. Nonetheless, for state intervention, only white or NGN-white villages, with medium or
  medium-high market potential, should be considered. Thus, a total of 1,061 villages from
  communes with some broadband networks and service providers >=30Mbps need support for
  the extension of the existing infrastructure from neighboring villages within the commune.
  This situation occurs both in communes with ongoing projects (MARD or Ro-NET), and in
  communes without such projects (582 and 479 villages, respectively).
All the other villages (SIRUTA units) either are part of ongoing projects (970) or have a medium-
to-high market potential and are located in communes/cities with a favorable broadband market
landscape (10,033), which does not seem to require state support.
The distribution of development needs regarding broadband infrastructure in the territory is
shown is Map 13.

                                                than 15 inhabitants, nowadays.


If in the next period, interventions is decided to be continued at village level
The approach based on market potential and the quality of existing infrastructure addresses 61%
of all white spots as well as 29% of all NGN-white areas in Romania, which are the least likely to
develop in the absence of state support (Table A.19, Annex). Overall, 2,623 villages would be
involved (19% of all SIRUTA units), in which live almost 1.16 million persons (5.8% of total country
population) and over 423 thousand households (5.7% of total households nationwide).62 Such a
programme would cover all counties (see also Map 13).

If in the next period, interventions at administrative unit level are introduced
The same approach applied at the level of administrative unit would involve 824 communes and
6 small towns (see also Map 14). These include besides the 2.623 beneficiary villages another
1,754 villages of all types (NGN-white, NGN-grey or NGN-black), as shown in Table A.20 (Annex).
However, an intervention at administrative unit would require the identification of the most
suitable technical solutions to maximize access with minimal costs for all incorporated villages,
which in the same time would be complementary to existing private investments and would not
lead to significant market distortion at local level.
                        ii. Demand potential for broadband in undersupplied areas
The insight into the actual demand for broadband services is useful in the funding and deploying
of broadband networks. Proof of existing undersupply and/or demand for (higher) bandwidths
commonly initiate the planning process for broadband deployment. Actual deployment still
depends on the economic potential of the specific area, but this issue is discussed in the next
section 3.D.iii.
This section is focused on actual and potential demand for broadband Internet services at village
(SIRUTA unit) level. The actual demand is measured based on two categories of indicators:
penetration rates63 (ANCOM, 2015) and usage of Internet (2011 census). Potential demand is
estimated based on the share in total population aged 6 years and over of those groups with high
propensity to use Internet (children and youth, employees and employers, commuters, migrants
abroad and their families), determined based on 2011 census. There is a lag in data between
2011 and 2014, but more updated data at SIRUTA unit level are not available.
Actual and potential demand for broadband is strongly associated with the NGN broadband areas
determined in section 3.C.i, as shown in Figures 8-to-11.
                  - White areas have zero penetration rates (at the end of 2014), but an average of
                   7-12% of population 6+ years that, since 2011, were declaring to use the Internet
                   (census). Most of the white spots have a potential demand considerably smaller
                   than in the other NGN-types of villages. Most of them are also very small, with
                   less than 200 inhabitants. Nonetheless, in the white spots from rural areas, an
                   average of 80 persons per village represents a rough estimate of the potential
                   target population.
                  - NGN-white areas have low penetration rates, with values of about 20 per 100
                   households and 7-8 per 100 inhabitants. The use of Internet is, however, rather
                   close to the national average in rural areas. For example, the proportion of
                   population aged 6+ years that declared use of the Internet was 14% in rural NGN-
                   white areas as compared with 15% at the level of all villages (Figure 10).



63Penetration rates determined as sum of fixed connections >=256kbps at NGN-type level (for legal and natural
persons), multiplied by 100 and divided by total number of inhabitants/households at NGN-type level. Technologies
that were considered in ANCOM (2015): optical fibre, coaxial cable, (including DOCSIS) XDSL, UTP/FTP cable, radio
(using frequency bands based on a license to use radio frequencies or radio frequency bands of which use is free, for
example, point to multipoint connections with fixed access - FWA, Wi-Fi connections based on IEE 802.11 b,g,n
standards, WiMax connections based on IEEE 802.16 standards). Data on population and households at SIRUTA level
from 2011 census, which partly differs from the data used by ANCOM.

Source: World Bank calculations using ANCOM.v1 (2015) and 2011 Population and Housing Census. Note: Penetration
rate determined as sum of fixed connections >=256kbps at NGN-type level (for legal and natural persons), multiplied by
100 and divided by total number of inhabitants at NGN-type level. Both legal and natural persons may hold more than
one fixed connection. Therefore, penetration rates may exceed 100%, especially in small communities but also in
touristic sites (with many hotels and restaurants).

By contrast, in the NGN-white areas from the urban environment the usage of Internet is
comparable with that from rural areas and far smaller than in other urban settlements. The
potential demand is also close to the national average in the NGN-white villages from rural areas,
but rather small in urban areas. In terms of potential clients, the NGN-white points from rural
areas include about 400 persons, and around 300 persons in urban areas.
- NGN-grey villages (AnotD and DnotA) from rural areas have penetration rates comparable with
the national average. By contrast, the NGN-grey SIRUTA units from urban areas have penetration
rates comparable with the rural ones, far lower than the urban national average. For example,
AnotD points register in urban areas a rate of 8.3 per 100 inhabitants and 26.1 per 100
households, as compared with 27.4 and 70.7 respectively for the entire urban environment
(Figures 8 and 9).
Regarding the use of Internet, the presence of mobile 3G+ networks makes a big difference. In
rural areas, the NGN-grey villages which also are covered by mobile 3G+ networks appear to have
quite high shares of population using the Internet as compared with the areas without 3G+
networks (Figure 10). In urban areas, the small number of NGN-grey SIRUTA units do not allow
solid conclusions. Nonetheless, the existence of 3G+ networks increases the proportion of
population (6+ years) using Internet from 11% to over 28%, in AnotD areas (of which sufficient
cases are available). With regard to market demand, a pattern is highly visible. In NGN-grey
villages, both from rural and urban areas, the higher the potential demand, more likely is that
village to be also covered by mobile 3G+ networks. The number of potential clients in NGN-grey
areas is about 700 persons, in rural, and approximately 500 persons, in urban.
- NGN-black villages, especially those with 3G+ networks, are in the most favorable situation in all
regards, penetration, use of Internet and potential demand.
The previous analysis points out some important lessons related to the mobile technologies
3G+.64 These mobile technologies, although not considered relevant with regard to broadband
deployment, appear to play an important role in increasing the use of Internet. On the one hand,
mobile 3G+ networks are linked to higher potential demand, which could have been expected in
the current market conditions in which operators are inclined to invest in economically viable
areas only. So, the areas with higher potential demand have already attracted more private
investments and benefit now of more opportunities. On the other hand, once the mobile
technologies become available, they seem to contribute significantly both to penetration and the
use of Internet. The added value related to penetration is highly visible mainly for NGN-black
villages, both from rural and urban. Figure 8 shows that for NGN-black villages the penetration
rate per 100 households increases from 30.2% in areas without 3G+ to 42.2% in those covered by
3G+ networks, in rural, and from 45.9% to 72.5%, in urban. The added value related to usage of
the Internet can be observed in all NGN-types of areas, starting with the white spots and
increasing incrementally to the NGN-black areas (Figure 9). So, taking measures65 for stimulating
the operators to extend the coverage of mobile networks, particularly those that comply with the
NGN standards (deploying 4G networks), 66 could bring considerable benefits related to
penetration and use of Internet, besides those in terms of coverage.

The typology of villages (SIRUTA units) according to demand (actual and potential) is determined
based on an index of demand potential (IDP). The index of demand potential is determined at
SIRUTA unit level as factor score of the following three indicators: (i) penetration rate per 100
inhabitants, (ii) share of population aged 6 years or over using Internet and (iii) proportion of
categories with high propensity to use Internet in total population.67 In the next step, three
distinctive degrees of potential demand at village (SIRUTA unit) level are determined as follows
(see also Map 15):
                  low demand potential - IDP deciles 1-to-3 (the lowest 30% values in the country);
                  medium demand potential - IDP deciles 4-to-7 (the average values nationwide);
                   and
                  high demand potential - IDP deciles 8-to-10 (the highest 30% values in Romania).

extracted that explains 63.49% of total variance. The factor loading for each variable is: .876 for share of population
aged 6 years or over using Internet; .824 for proportion of categories with high propensity to use Internet in total
population; and .677 for penetration rate per 100 inhabitants. So, the index reflects more closely the potential demand
than the actual demand (penetration).

The index of demand potential is significantly associated with the ecological indicators. 68
Expectedly, it is considerable higher in urban compared with rural areas. Small, declining
(between 2002 and 2011), remote and peripheral villages are the most likely to have a very low
potential demand. At the other extreme, the highest demand potential is found in villages that
are large, viable, central and close to a city.
The intersection between the typology on market potential (section 3.D.i) and the one on
demand potential is shown in Table 17. About 68% of villages from rural areas and 90% in urban
areas have both market potential and demand potential medium-to-high. The other SIRUTA units
in the country have a low demand (actual and potential) hence they require demand-stimulation
measures in order to achieve the Digital Agenda targets.

Noteworthy, 131 SIRUTA units from urban areas have a low demand potential. A part of them (13
units) are depopulated areas with less than 15 inhabitants.69 The others 118 units, nearly all
belong to very small or small towns (52 towns with less than 20,000 inhabitants). However, nine
units are part of five medium cities, which is surprising considering the general statistics on
medium-large urban areas. In all these cases, the low demand is rather an effect of the
underdeveloped service supply. Although the cities they belong to are well endowed with high
speed broadband networks and services, these nine villages are far from the city centre and have
access at basic broadband at best. For example, five of these nine villages belong to Cugir city and
are touristic sites from Apuseni Mountains, with a large number of guesthouses and hotels.70 The




68 The Pearson correlation coefficients between the index of potential demand and village population (number of
inhabitants) is .199 (Sig. = .000); with population viability between 2002 and 2011 (0=declining, 1=viable) is .321 (Sig. =
.000); with distance to the nearest city (number of km) is -.396 (Sig. = .000); and with administrative type (0=peripheral,
1=central) is .323 (Sig. = .000).

other four cases are villages poorly linked to city, which lack all kind of infrastructure not only the
broadband-related one, but also modernized roads, piped water or sewage.71
For distinguishing further the type of intervention needed per village, the demand potential index
should be seen in combination with the refined typology on development needs regarding
infrastructure (Table 18). Besides the villages that are part of an ongoing project (MARD or Ro-
NET) - 7% of all SIRUTA units in the country - additional 34% need an intervention: 8% related to
broadband infrastructure only; 15% interventions aiming only stimulation of demand; and 11%
interventions in both fields. More than 97% of villages that need interventions (4,535 of total
4,665 villages) are from rural areas (Table A.21 in Annex).

Unlike the need for infrastructure development, which is concentrated in white and NGN-white
villages, the need for demand-stimulation measures is spread across all types of areas: white,
NGN-white, NGN-grey (AnotD and DnotA), NGN-black, and especially in villages involved in
ongoing projects (more than half of them). Data are shown in Table A.22 (Annex). This fact
indicates that the current interventions, focused strictly on subsidizing the distribution and/or
access networks could be more effective if a demand-stimulating component is added.
In addition, the fact that even in one in every ten NGN-black areas has a low demand potential
indicate that demand for broadband Internet services could not increase unless availability of e-
government services, e-health, e-learning, e-commerce, mobile banking and other services
relevant for daily-life will significantly increase.

                         iii. Economic power of population and communities in undersupplied areas
Previous sections provided insights both into market potential and demand for broadband
services. As we have already mentioned, proof of existing undersupply and/or demand for
(higher) bandwidths commonly initiate the planning process for broadband deployment.
Nevertheless, actual deployment depends on the economic potential of the specific area. If
economic potential is lacking in an area where there is undersupply or demand for a better
connection, there could be scope for state aid funding schemes to offer support. Specifically in
this sense, this demand mapping could be seen as a tool to facilitate state aid distribution and to
avoid misdirected investment.
Consequently, the last dimension included in the analysis of NGN broadband areas refers to the
economic potential. The typology of villages (SIRUTA units) according to economic potential is
determined based on an index (IEP) which is computed as a factor score72 of the following three
indicators: (i) share of self-generated revenues in total revenues in the local budget, (ii) share of
population in relative poverty (AROP indicator) and (iii) proportion of population living in
marginalized areas in total village population. In the next step, four distinctive degrees of
economic potential at village (SIRUTA unit) level are determined as follows:
                   very poor village - quintile 1 of IEP (the lowest 20% values in the country);
                   poor village - quintile 2 of IEP;
                   medium economic potential - quintiles 3-4 of IEP;
                   high economic potential - quintile 5 of IEP (the highest 20% values in the
                    country).
Self-generated revenues73 reflect the municipality’s fiscal autonomy and local economic potential.
Share of self-generated revenues in total revenues in the local budget is a measure of the
independence from state budget transfers. If a locality’s budget contains few central budget
transfers in conjunction with a high proportion of self-generated revenues (from local tax
collection), then this is a sign that it is experiencing healthy economic development and that it
has a large base of taxpayers (citizens and firms). This indicator is calculated at administrative unit
level and the value is attributed to all incorporated villages (SIRUTA units).74
The risk of relative poverty after receiving social transfers (AROP indicator) refers to the share of
people whose disposable income is lower than 60% of the median income as expressed per adult
equivalent.75 Data used in this study were determined based on 2012 EU-SILC, within the World


72 Factor analysis, principal components extraction, KMO = .525, Approx. Chi-Square = 6027.445 (p=.000), one factor
extracted that explains 54.38% of total variance. The factor loading for each variable is: .858 for share of population in
relative poverty (AROP); -.765 share of self-generated revenues in total revenues in the local budget; and .556 for
proportion of population living in marginalized areas in total village population.
73 Self-generated revenues do not include the portions deducted from PIT (personal income tax) for equalization

purposes in order to analyze the category of revenues upon which the municipality holds a greater degree of control.
The formula per capita enables vertical comparisons (localities of different sizes or status – urban/rural) and horizontal
comparisons (localities of the same status, but in different counties). They are computed based on Ministry of Finance
2012 data on local budgets execution.
74 Ministry of Finance data from the end of 2012 show that the average share of self-generated revenues localities

from Romania was only 24%, with a significant urban-rural gap: urban areas (42%), communes (22%), and small
communes (19%).
75 The indicator is computed according to a national methodology (Decision no. 488/2005 on the national system of

social inclusion indicators) and to Eurostat methodology. Disposable income is the sum of all revenues (including social
protection transfers) minus the amount of taxes (income or property-based) and social insurance paid.

The marginalized areas are compact territories within localities (neighborhoods, parts of villages,
hamlets etc.) in which live extremely poor people, such as ghettos or slums. Thus, the proportion
of population living in marginalized areas provides an estimate of the extreme 'unacceptable'
multidimensional poverty, which tends to become chronic and to be transmitted from a
generation to another. At national level, 6.2% of the rural population, 5.3% of households and
5.2% of dwellings are located in rural marginalized areas.77 In addition, 3.2% of the population,
2.6% of households, and 2.5% of dwellings are located in urban marginalized areas.78 Data used in
this study were determined based on 2011 Population and Housing Census, within two previous
World Bank studies (2014 and 2015). The number of people living in marginalized areas (urban or
rural) is determined at census sector level. These values are then aggregated at village (SIRUTA
unit) level and proportion in total village population is computed.
The distribution of villages according to the index of economic potential across the country is
shown in Map 16.




76 EU-SILC data show that the relative poverty rate was 22.5% in Romania in 2012. The differences that characterize the
urban/rural divide can be identified in the very large difference between the values of the AROP indicator for the two
areas: 11% in urban as compared with 38% in rural.
77 These rural areas are severely deprived census sectors which cumulate people who completed lower secondary

education at most, make a living in the informal sector (especially agriculture), and live in precarious housing conditions
even for the rural context that generally has a low access to basic infrastructure and utilities (living in overcrowded
houses and/or without access to water or electricity). These marginalized areas are reckoned as being 'problematic'
specifically due to the combination of a concentration of low-income households, low levels of education and skills
relevant to the labor market, a preponderance of single mothers, large numbers of children, and a high rate of petty
crime. Even more than the other rural communities, the marginalized areas have poor physical accessibility, by dirt
streets, have bad housing, are exposed to environmental hazard (floods, land slides etc.), and have low-quality or
absent public services. Source: World Bank (2015) Inputs for the Preparation of a Draft National Strategy and Action
Plan on Social Inclusion and Poverty Reduction 2015-2020 (section 3.2.1).
78 These are severely deprived areas that combine low human capital (little education, poor health, and/or a high

number of children) with low formal employment and inadequate housing conditions. These marginalized areas are
deemed to be 'problematic' as a result of a combination of bad housing, dirty and decrepit streets, a concentration of
low-income households, low levels of education and skills relevant to the labor market, overall poor health, a
preponderance of single mothers, large numbers of children, poor quality and/or segregated schools, and a high rate of
petty crime. In addition, such areas are physically inaccessible and are exposed to environmental degradation, with
only low-quality or no public services. Thus, the market value of the land and dwellings in these areas is much lower
than in other areas of the same city.
The methodology for identifying urban marginalized areas was developed in a World Bank study using 2011 census
data. It identifies three broad criteria: (i) human capital; (ii) formal employment; and (iii) housing conditions. The
analysis was done at the level of the census sectors. Marginalized areas (or census sectors) were defined as those that
were disadvantaged in all three respects. In addition, the study identified three other types of urban areas that were
disadvantaged on terms of one or two of the three criteria. The majority of the total urban population (67.8%) lives in
non-disadvantaged areas, while 11.7% live in areas disadvantaged in terms of human capital, 9.9% live in areas affected
by unemployment, 5.2% live in areas disadvantaged in terms of housing, and 2.3% live in other urban areas. Source:

The index of economic potential is significantly associated with the ecological indicators. 79
Expectedly, it is considerable higher in urban compared with rural areas. The small and remote
villages are the most likely to have a very low economic potential, while the highest economic
potential is found in large villages close to a city.
Economic potential is also strongly associated with market potential and demand potential (Table
A.23, Annex). Thus, the share of very poor or poor villages decreases from 77% of villages
characterized by market failure to 64% of those with medium market potential, 39% of medium-
high ones, and 16% of units with high market potential. Also, the proportion of villages with high
economic potential is zero among undersupplied areas and reaches 49% of those with a high
market potential. In the same time, the higher is the economic potential, the higher the demand
potential. 80


79 The Pearson correlation coefficients between the index of economic potential and village population (number of
inhabitants) is .15 (Sig. = .000); with distance to the nearest city (number of km) is -.39 (Sig. = .000). Correlations with
variables on population viability between 2002 and 2011 (0=declining, 1=viable) and village administrative type
(0=peripheral, 1=central) are also significant but weaker.
80 The Pearson correlation coefficient between index of economic potential and index of demand potential is .47 (Sig. =

.000).

A significant divide in economic potential is visible among the NGN broadband areas (Figure 12).
The white and NGN-white spots are more likely located in very poor or poor villages, while NGN-
black spots are more likely villages with medium or high economic potential. In the same time,
within each type of NGN broadband areas, the mobile networks 3G+ has been selectively
developed in the areas with a higher economic potential.

priorities 1B and 2B are not included in the graph due to the small number of contained SIRUTA units, 4 and 13
respectively. See also Table A.24 in Annex.

The analysis at administrative unit level shows a considerable gap between those selected as
intervention priorities and the others, with respect to the proportion of very poor SIRUTA units in
all incorporated units (Figure 13). In rural areas, as compared with communes that are neither
intervention priorities nor with ongoing projects, the share of very poor villages is almost four

times larger in communes priorities 1B, 1C and 2B, and two times higher in communes priorities
2A and 1A. Out of all very poor and poor villages in Romania, almost two thirds81 belong to
communes selected as intervention priorities and the other 38% are located in communes and
cities that are not selected as intervention priority. A similar analysis82 based on the index of
economic potential computed at administrative unit level displays a comparable pattern (Table
A.25, Annex).
                        iv. Typology for prioritization of investments in broadband in Romania
According to the Implementation Programme for the National Plan for Development of the NGN
Infrastructure: 'Investments, more precisely public intervention (for instance: incentive for
investments, grant, state aid, etc.) will be focused on the development of a next generation
infrastructure in the areas affected by market failure – areas with limited potential/no potential
for private investments, the so-called white areas' (MIS, 2015: 35). This study addresses precisely
this objective, by putting forward a typology of villages (SIRUTA units) and administrative units
(SIRSUP level) useful for prioritization of investments.
As we have already mentioned, actual broadband deployment depends on the economic
potential of the specific area. If economic potential is lacking in an area where there is
undersupply or demand for a better connection, there could be scope for state aid funding
schemes to offer support. Specifically in this sense, this demand mapping could be seen as a tool
to facilitate state aid distribution and to avoid misdirected investment.
This is the last step of the analysis which results in the final typology. For easy understanding, a
short summary of the research approach is shown in Scheme 1. Thus, after exploring market
potential at village level and considering the quality of existing infrastructure, a refined typology
of development needs regarding broadband infrastructure was introduced (Table 16 and Map 13).
In the next step, demand potential was analyzed and combined with the refined typology, which
led to a sharper typology of development needs regarding both infrastructure and demand
stimulation (Table 18). Finally, the economic potential of villages and administrative units was
investigated. In this section, the final typology for prioritization of investments in broadband in
Romania is determined by dividing the typology of development needs according to economic
potential of villages (SIRUTA units). Table 19 and Map 17 show the empirical results.
Out of all villages (SIRUTA units) in Romania, 12% have various broadband infrastructure-related
needs and are eligible for state support (being very poor or poor villages), 9% have also such
development needs but are not eligible (as villages with medium-to-high economic potential),
while almost a third (30%) need measures of stimulation of demand for broadband services.




81 19% are part of communes priority 2B, 14% belong to communes with ongoing projects (MARD or Ro-NET), 11% are
incorporated in communes priority 2A, 9% are contained by white or NGN-white communes (priority 1C), 7% are in
communes priority 1B (NGN-white communes), and less than 2% are in white communes (priority 1A).
82 At administrative unit level, factor analysis, principal components extraction, KMO = .544, Approx. Chi-Square =

2032.813 (p=.000), one factor extracted that explains 61.66% of total variance. The factor loading for each variable is:
.891 for share of population in relative poverty (AROP); -.727 share of self-generated revenues in total revenues in the
local budget; and .726 for proportion of population living in marginalized areas in total village population. So, the
higher values of IEP indicate higher commune/city poverty, while lower values show economic potential or
development. For easy reading, IEP values were reversed to reflect economic potential.

Needs for public interventions to support only development of broadband infrastructure are
observed in 1,111 SIRUTA units (of which only 4 in urban areas),83 but only 55% (611) of them are
very poor or poor communities from rural areas that are eligible for state support.
Needs for public interventions to support development of broadband infrastructure together
with needs for demand stimulation are found in 1,512 SIRUTA units (of which only 5 in urban
areas).84 Out of these villages, the white villages belonging to white communes (127) have
medium economic potential at most, hence are considered all eligible for state support. Other
907 poor or very poor villages are also eligible for state support. In addition, all the other 478
villages not eligible for support in broadband deployment can benefit of demand-stimulation
measures.
Measures to stimulate demand for broadband services are needed in 4,102 villages (131 urban),
of which about 40% have medium-to-high economic potential (Table A.26, Annex). However,

regarding demand-side programs intended to stimulate broadband adoption, economic potential
is only useful information (for design) and not an eligibility criterion. Given the multiplicity of
barriers to broadband adoption, the demand stimulation measures are part of the larger digital
literacy effort and they work when they make non-users want to connect, make the Internet
cheaper and easier to use, and adjust to users’ preferences.
Overall, a number of 1,645 white or NGN-white villages need and are eligible for investments in
broadband infrastructure, whereas 4,102 villages and small towns' neighborhoods do need and
would benefit from demand-stimulation programs. These two categories are not exclusive, as
shown above.
The villages resulted as priority for state intervention are distributed in all counties (see Table
A.27, Annex). All SIRUTA units identified as eligible for state aid for broadband deployment are
from rural areas, but demand-side programs should also cover some small towns (see Table A.28,
Annex). Most investments in broadband infrastructure should be directed to small, peripheral
and declining villages, which tend to accumulate low market potential with low demand for
broadband services and community poverty. To a large extent, they also are part of small
communes positioned at county boundaries. By contrast, the demand stimulation measures
should also address the population from medium and large communes, some close to a city.
While investments in infrastructure target only white and NGN-white villages from priority
communes, demand-stimulus measures aim all types of NGN broadband areas.

Dividing the villages (SIRUTA units) according to economic potential led to a decrease in the
number of targeted villages, from the units in need to the eligible ones. Consequently, the
number of targeted communes has also reduced at those which contain the eligible villages.
Table 20 shows the distribution of the eligible administrative units by categories of priorities. The
following Map 18 presents their territorial distribution.

All 1,645 white or NGN-white villages (SIRUTA units) eligible for public investments in broadband
infrastructure belong to 502 communes. The number of eligible villages per commune varies
widely from one unit (for 34% of communes) to a maximum of 38 villages. 85 So, in more than two
thirds of these communes there are at least two villages that need and are eligible for state

and 6-to-38 in the other 15% of communes.

intervention. This is additional evidence that intervention at administrative unit (commune) level
could be more efficient than the intervention village by village. Even more so if the investment
model is changed so that to ensure that in each commune at least a village has access to high
speed broadband accompanied by extensive demand-supply measures at local level. Preferably,
the village 'nucleus' for broadband development is determined based on geographic parameters
that would reduce at minimum the costs of extension to the other villages within the commune.
In addition, operating companies can be identified and directly contacted regarding an evaluation
of possibilities for broadband deployment in the respective area.
In villages eligible for public investments in broadband infrastructure live around 711 thousand
persons, in almost 257 thousand households.
Regarding the 4,102 SIRUTA units with low demand for broadband services, they are part of
1,453 communes and 63 small towns. In more than 80% of small towns, only one peripheral
community needs such a program. By contrast, in communes, the number of villages ranges
between one and 33, with an overrepresentation of those with 1-3 villages.
The top demand-side barriers to broadband adoption refer to lack of affordability, lack of
usability, lack of relevance, and lack of availability (Horrigan, 2009). 86 Affordability relates to the
cost of broadband installation and ongoing service fees, as well as to the cost of computers.
Usability pertains to the difficulty (cognitively or physically) to use the Internet. Relevance refers
to reasons for not adopting broadband due to lack of interest in going online or in switching from
dial-up to broadband (sometimes regardless of price) or to beliefs such as use of the Internet is a
waste of time.
Thus, an effective demand stimulation program must tackle many goals, especially the price
of broadband service,87 lack of computer ownership, lack of digital literacy, and the lack of
perceived value of broadband. Local and national approaches to stimulating broadband
adoption may both be considered (Hauge and Prieger, 2009).88 One the one hand, when local
public authorities or community organizations are involved, they typically begin with a more
complete knowledge of what the barriers to adoption are in the community. Local
organizations may also be more effective at ensuring that programs are actually utilized by
the intended recipients. On the other hand, nationally coordinated efforts may have more
capability to set up programs that can be evaluated effectively and to collect and analyze
data. So, a national program offering financial support and assistance (centre of resources) to
local stakeholders (public authorities, public or private organizations, community
organization), and ensuring national monitoring and evaluation, could be an effective policy
response to the severe need for demand stimulation in the identified 1,453 communes and
63 small towns, in which live a total of over 1.32 million people in around 522 thousand
households.89

               E. Access to funding broadband investments of the undersupplied areas
Romania is receiving funding from various European Union funds to enhance access to, and use
and quality of, ICT technologies. These funds are the European Regional Development Fund
(ERDF) and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD). The government is
expected to allocate about €0.53 billion (ERDF) of these funds to meet this EU’s Thematic
Objective 2 (TO2). 90 These funds will finance other ICT infrastructure through the
Competitiveness OP. Access to small-scale ICT infrastructure in rural areas (as well as basic
infrastructure and services) can be improved through the LEADER91 approach (EAFRD/NRDP92). In
addition, various ICT projects can be financed through the Operational Program for Fisheries (EFF
- European Fisheries Fund).93 Support is granted to Local Action Groups (LAGs)94 or Fisheries Local
Action Groups (FLAG) operating in rural areas and small towns.95
For making the best use of EU funds in enhancing access to, and use and quality of, ICT
technologies in rural areas, more assistance should be provided to local authorities and local
stakeholders in micro-regions (clusters of communes) or rural communities. The capacity of local
authorities to integrate funding priorities and develop ICT-related projects needs to be increased
with respect to: (i) Assessing the need for ICT infrastructure and services; (ii) Training and
facilitation for the LEADER program and the use of the LAG framework; (iii) Improving the usage
of the ICT infrastructure in community-based services, including new technologies that would
support the needs of rural residents.
The development of partnerships by local authorities is key to attracting investment from
European funds. These funds are open to applications from two main types of partnerships ‒
referred to in the operational programs: intercommunity development associations (IDAs) and
local action groups (LAGs/FLAGs) ‒ as well as partnerships between local authorities and other
eligible partners. Both of these (IDAs and LAGs/FLAGs) were devised as ways to enhance
administrative capacity (NRDP, 2012).96

93 Both rural and urban (under 100,000 inhabitants) areas are eligible as members of a local partnership (Fisheries Local

(MARD, 2014: 86).
94 Local Action Groups (LAGs) are made up of public and private partners from the rural territory (including towns

under 20,000 inhabitants), and must include representatives from different socio-economic sectors. The LAG
membership is open to everyone living within the LAG boundaries. Both private persons and local public/private
organizations can become members. The number of members is a good indicator on how widely the LAG is known and
recognized on its territory. Source: http://enrd.ec.europa.eu/enrd-static/leader/leader/leader-tool-kit/the-local-action-

Partnerships increase a rural municipality’s chances of EU funds absorption (Marin, 2014). 97 A
partner with either well-developed administrative capacity (including specialized human
resources) or high fiscal capacity (for covering the expenditures on consultancy firms or feasibility
studies) can help all members of the partnership to attract extra-budgetary revenues from
European funds. As a rule, the number of inhabitants is a strong predictor of the administrative
unit’s fiscal capacity, which is in turn important for ensuring co-financing from European funds or
bank loans, which is often necessary for ensuring the flow of funds to the project. Increasing the
size of the population through a partnership can satisfy the fund’s cost-efficiency conditions for
large-scale investments.

                Box 4. Local Action Groups (LAGs), LEADER Axis, Romania, end of 2013

 The 2013 Progress Report on the National Rural Development Programme reported data on the
 authorized Local Action Groups (LAGs), approved for financing under the LEADER Axis. At the end of
 2013, there were 163 LAGs with Local Development Plans selected for financing 98, which:
  covered a total surface of 142,267 km2 , which represent 78.3% of the provisioned target;
  covered a total population of over 6.77 million inhabitants (as compared to the target of 9.36
   million);
  included as partners 1,781 communes and 77 small towns;
  included over 6,942 members, out of which 5,103 private partners and NGOs;
  have received financial assistance to implement local development plans, by awarding grants to local
   projects; a total number of 2,040 local projects were contracted (as compared to the target of
   9,502). Most projects, and the largest grants, went to LAGs from three regions: North-East (518
   projects granted nearly 16 MEURO), South (354 projects, over 15.1 MEURO), and Center (301
   projects, more than 12.1 MEURO).
 Source: Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, 2014: 105-109.

At the same time, the IDAs/LAGs/FLAGs between rural and urban municipalities have the
potential to further the integrated development of both urban and rural areas in partnership with
other private stakeholders. Even those local public authorities that are not explicitly declared to
be eligible for particular European funds can also build partnerships with other (eligible)
beneficiaries to apply to those funds. Furthermore, another type of partnership with potential
benefits for a large number of communes and small towns consists of associations of local
authorities such as the Romanian Association of Communes and the Romanian Association of
Cities. Both of these have carried out large-scale European funded projects99 that have had an
impact in numerous localities.
Small towns appear to have fewer sources of extra-budgetary funds than communes, and their
access to European funding strongly depends on their capacity to build and participate in
partnerships. For small towns, partnerships are a prerequisite for accessing most of the available
European programs, particularly IDAs or LAGs.
The Map 19 shows that localities members in LAGs are spread all over the country, but are much
better represented in the North-East and Center regions. Thus, the proportion of localities
participating in LAGs declines among small towns (urban) from 35% in North-East region and 32%
in Center to 18-26% in the other regions; the rate of participation in LAGs among communes
(rural) diminishes from nearly 80% in Center to 69% in North-East, 62-65% in West and North-
West, 57-60% in South-East and South, and less than 48% in South-West, respectively 13% in
Bucharest-Ilfov.
Communes of all types participate in LAGs. However, it appears that communes with the smallest
self-generated revenues at local budget and more extended poverty have relatively higher
propensity to be partners in LAGs. In the same time, the small and remote communes (with fewer
than 2,000 inhabitants) have difficulties to take part in local partnerships. Thus, the rate of
participation is 54% among the small and remote communes as compared to 63% of the small

                       Priorities for investments in broadband and LEADER (MARD)
For the period 2014-2020, rural and small urban municipalities have access to funding small-scale
ICT infrastructure through the LEADER approach (MARD), if they are members of a Local Action
Group (LAG) or a Fisheries Local Action Group (FLAG). For this reason, it is relevant to distinguish
among the villages/ administrative units identified as priorities for intervention in section 3.D.iv
between municipalities that are part of a LAG/FLAG and those that do not.100 The villages/
administrative units with no access to EAFRD/EFF funds should be supported by the MIS, through
the Ro-NET program.
About two thirds of all villages (SIRUTA units) and administrative units with broadband-related
development needs, which are eligible for state support (as very poor or poor units), are part of a
local partnership, either a LAG or a FLAG. Therefore, the number of localities representing
priorities for intervention that must be supported by MIS through Ro-NET or other national
programme drops sharply with respect to investments in infrastructure to a number of 552
villages, included in 163 communes (Table 21).
Regarding demand stimulation measures, a national programme that work both with LAGs/FLAGs
(for instance offering assistance, monitoring and evaluation) and with communes and small cities
not participating in a partnership may prove more effective in enhancing demand and use of the
Internet.
The candidates for state support, through the Ministry of Information Society, distribute unevenly
across counties (Table A.29, Annex). While in 18 counties their number is less than ten
communes/small towns, few counties concentrate between 34 and 43 municipalities each.
Noteworthy, among the counties with a large number of candidates for state intervention are
found Valcea, Teleorman, Dolj or Olt. Therefore, the profiles of counties seen from the
perspective of investments prioritization combined with available funding opportunities (Table
21) differs considerably from the one obtained based on the mix of NGN broadband areas (as
discussed in Tables 7 and 9).101 Although the counties' profiles change considerably in some cases,
the mismatching between the problems severity and the policy response given through the
ongoing projects (MARD and Ro-NET) persists.




100 For this assignment we use the most updated list of LAGs approved for financing under LEADER, available at:

ontact_GAL_la_data_de_03.11.2011_.pdf. Nonetheless, at the workshop organized within the project in September
2015, we learned from the MARD representative that LAGs are currently under a revision process. The analysis
presented in this section must be revised when the new list of LAGs will become available.
101 We refer to the matching exercise between targets of public broadband projects and county profile in terms of mix

of NGN broadband areas.

The sub-chapter 3.C.ii (in section Lessons for public interventions and priority administrative units)
showed that many undersupplied municipalities are neighboring other undersupplied
municipalities. Illustration is provided in Map 10 (cases of Vaslui and Alba counties). The
distribution of such clusters of undersupplied villages that cover a compact territory (with a
diameter less than 80 km) is presented in Map 20. Existence of such undersupplied clusters that
may cover a number of communes represent another possible level of state intervention, besides
village and administrative unit/municipality. Nonetheless, given the difficulties in forming
partnerships between municipalities as well as due to the various legislative and administrative
barriers for action on such territories (e.g. for construction work or official approval and
documents), this approach is not realistic for now. LAGs/FLAGs represent the sole partnerships,
built on a bottom-up approach, which could apply a broadband project on such undersupplied
clusters. Therefore, the identification of undersupplied clusters must be revisited once the final
list of LAGs (for 2015-2020 financial envelop) becomes available.

                Methodology used for creating the broadband investment clusters
The process of determining the broadband clusters, eligible for investments, began with a
selection of all the settlements which have the status of a whitezone or greyzone village and
which are contained in a LAG entity. The localities selected this way were subsequently used in a
spatial analysis operation with the aim of creating spatial clusters that will simultaneously meet a
number of defined criteria. Practically, every cluster generated was subject to certain rules, as
follows: to be composed of at least three localities, the distance between localities to not be
more than 5km and the cluster limits need to be inside the LAG entity boundaries.
According to the analysis of data based on those rules, have been identified a number of 315
clusters eligible for broadband investment, comprising a total of 2,723 localities, included in the
territories of 163 LAG entities. The average number of population included in the nationally
generated clusters is approx. 3,300 inhabitants. The smallest cluster in terms of underserved
population reaches 101 inhabitants, when the largest cluster, serves more than 22,000
inhabitants.
                  Test analysis - Broadband Clusters within Development Regions
For better interpretation and representation of the results, analysis was performed in the context
of development regions. Further, the analysis results will be presented within each Development
Region in Romania.

    A. “North-West” Development Region

In the studied area, have been identified a number of 52 clusters eligible for broadband
investments which are contained within the territories of 24 LAG entities out of a total of 27
entities, which occur in the North-West Development Region.
The highest density of clusters is found in the center of the region, specifically on the territory of
Salaj County. Across the entire region, in terms of population served, the smallest cluster includes
approx. 255 inhabitants while the largest cluster serves a total of over 8,000 inhabitants. The
average number of inhabitants served by a cluster in this region is approx. 2,700 inhabitants.
Across the region there are a total of 1,883 villages, totaling a population just over 2.584 million
inhabitants. From these localities, 924 settlements, representing 49% of the total are in
whitezone and have a population of approx. 378,637 inhabitants, representing 14.65% of the
entire region. Besides these, 27 localities, representing 1.43% of the total, are in greyzone and
summarize a population of over 28,000 inhabitants, representing 1.10%.

               F. Qualitative research study: 15 case studies

                          i. Objective of the qualitative research
The Digital Agenda for Europe (DAE), one of the flagship initiatives of Europe 2020, includes a set
of specific broadband coverage targets, as follows: (i) universal broadband coverage by 2013; (ii)
universal broadband coverage of speeds at least 30 Mbps by 2020 and (iii) 50% penetration of
100Mbps service in the European Union member states. The objective of the research is related
to the first two DAE policy priorities, in relation to the standard fixed and NGA broadband
coverage.
The qualitative research aims to provide a meaningful picture of the current status of broadband
coverage both at the level of public institutions as well as households’ level.
                         ii. Methodology of the qualitative research
The qualitative research covered 15 communes from the following five counties: Hunedoara,
Mehedinți, Neamț, Timiș and Vaslui, with a total number of 58 villages. 102 The selection of the
villages is based on the typology identified in the previous chapters. It covers nine different types
of NGN broadband areas, with most of the villages being NGN white spots or white villages no
fixed no 3G+ networks.

The data collection method was phone interviews with representatives of the municipalities –
mayors, secretaries, social workers or former managers of PAPI (Public Access Points to
Information). The interviews have been conducted in the period of September 27 – October 5,
2015, by a team of experienced researchers: Bogdan Corad, Cătălina Iamandi Cioinaru, Monica
Marin, Georgiana Neculau and Andreea Trocea.


The interview guide (see Annex) covered the following key issues:

       be disaggregated at village level.

                    iii. Main results of the qualitative research
The information presented in this section is based on the views, opinions and knowledge of the
institutional representatives, therefore cannot be regarded as an ‘objective’ evaluation of the
adequacy of proposed interventions. However, it provides a useful insight on the perceived
obstacles, needs and solutions for development of broadband infrastructure in rural Romania. It
draws attention especially on the need of better planning of state interventions, based on an in-
depth assessment of lessons learned from previous projects implemented at national level.
                             Broadband coverage at population level
The typology of NGN broadband areas has been generally confirmed by the qualitative research
especially in what concerns the households' fixed coverage, the market potential, the demand
potential and the economic potential of villages. The research also confirms the importance of
the size of the population, of demographic composition or of geographical barriers in relation to
broadband coverage.
The size of village population is a strong correlate of NGN broadband areas. The research
included small and very small villages in which there are few chances for broadband
infrastructure to be deployed by private investment in the near future. Combined with a rather




                                                                                                 78
                           “Mapping the Broadband Areas in Romania”


old-age population with no digital skills, this makes the 'perfect candidate' for very low market
potential for developing the broadband infrastructure.
In addition to this, geographical barriers such as mountain areas, forests, railways, bridges or no
road infrastructure have been confirmed by the municipality representatives as obstacles in
development of broadband network. There are cases of villages with differences of altitude in
excess of 500 m. Furthermore, the physical barriers also depend on the season. In winter,
because of the weather conditions, the Internet connection breaks generally four or five times in
the case of remote villages.
The demand for broadband coverage comes mainly from youth and parents with children at
school. However, both groups have access to Internet other than the standard broadband
coverage at household level: the youth also have smart phones with mobile coverage and
children also have access to Internet through the school lab. Yet, connectivity of school depends
on the connectivity of the village.
The coverage with mobile broadband networks is a good substitute for lack of fixed broadband
infrastructure. Further questions arise in relation to the quality of the coverage, as there is no
uniform standard speed provided. However, mobile broadband connections are also used by
public employees in their daily work (if the municipality does not have a broadband connection).
The subscriptions to mobile connections are used for communications with migrants. As the
subscriptions have become more affordable, ‘when calling their relatives abroad, some young
people come and stand in front of the town hall to get connected to the wireless’ (Mayor, Vaslui
county).
The demand for new services that require much faster Internet access, with speeds of at least
30Mbps, is poorly understood at population level. The needs are rather defined in relation to
having Internet access or not, and also in relation to the affordability of the subscription ‘If it
would it be free, the population would agree to have high speed internet’ (Secretary, Mehedinți
county).
                          Broadband coverage at public institutions’ level
There are two main issues to be discussed in relation to the connectivity of public institutions: (i)
the level of the analysis - the institutions represented at commune level (municipality, police,
library, dispensary, pharmacy) and the ones most likely to be represented at village level - schools
and/ or churches and (ii) the sustainability of previous project interventions addressing
connectivity of public institutions (or public access to Internet through public institutions).
Generally the institutions represented at commune level are connected to Internet. Some of
them have been connected through previous projects such as the Knowledge Economy Project,
with the standard broadband speed for public institutions of 4 Mbps. Similar to the level of the
population, the representatives of the institutions have not identified a clear need for upgrading
the speed of the Internet connections for carrying out their professional duties. However,
especially for public institutions this must be viewed in relation to the general very low level of
development of e-government services and must be put in the context of other initiatives related
to implementation of the Digital Agenda strategy in Romania - universal access to the
telemedicine services for the rural population in Romania by 2020. As a consequence, as new
public e-services will be developed at national level, the demand for faster Internet access from
public institutions might also grow.

The municipality and the library represent the key institutions for broadband coverage of public
institutions at commune level. In our sample, they are connected to Internet either by their own
efforts or as a result of two large projects: Knowledge Economy Project (KEP) and Biblionet. In
some cases, the County Council has developed the broadband infrastructure through public-
private partnerships at county level. This is the case of mayoralties from Mehedinti county, part
of the EuDiS (European District System) project, which connects the town halls throughout the
county and other public institutions, with a knot within the Mehedinți County Council. However,
the sustainability of project interventions in terms of providing public access points to
information (PAPI) is a challenge.103 The computers provided in the project are rather old and
have been moved from PAPI to the municipality or school. In this way, the population no longer
has access to publicly available computers with Internet connection. Some of the solutions come
from Biblionet which is a large scale project providing access to Internet through public
computers at library level.
The institutions represented at village level, such as schools, generally depend on the level of
development of broadband infrastructure at the village level. The research has also identified
innovative solutions used by local authorities in order to make feasible financial investments –
related especially to the high costs of investing in optical fiber networks. A school in an NGN
white spot village from Vaslui county has used a wireless antenna with signal from a relay located
in another commune (at a distance of 20 km). The same relay also connects the school from
another village (which is also included in the RoNet project). Yet, the quality of the connection is
not uniform, as the Internet routers are switched off during weekend time and therefore the
provider can no longer monitor service provision. As a result, the connection is not properly
working all the time.
In what concerns the capacity for collaboration, almost all of the communes included in the
research are part of the Local Action Groups (LAGs). However, they have not included in their
strategic development directions the need for improving the communications infrastructure.
Therefore, this comes as a challenge in terms of stimulating the demand for the European Funds
allocated with the National Rural Development Plan for development of broadband infrastructure
in the rural area.
In addition to this, the priority level of access to Internet comes after the roads and social
infrastructure: ‘the commune lacks many other things, ahead of the internet’ (Mayor, Vaslui
county) or ‘we have other priorities for this moment. These are the roads, schools and
kindergartens. After we resolve these, we can think about the Internet’ (Social Worker, Vaslui
county).
Priorities at national level such as the ones related to voting might substantially contribute to
providing connection at school level. ‘The plan is to connect the school from the other village too,
because it will be polling station and it will need internet connection’ (Secretary of the commune,
Vaslui county).
Last but not the least, the general connectivity of public institutions must be assessed first of all
in relation to the delivery of service. The Internet connection of library or of dispensary cannot
replace the lack of human resources needed for the service to be delivered to the beneficiaries.

103The research has also identified cases of villages in which the RoNet project has started the implementation process,
but has not ended with the expected results -‘due to a history about which I don’t want to comment on, the project
has been closed and the computers have been moved to the municipality and school. In these villages the quality of the
3G coverage is quite poor’ (Social Worker, Vaslui county).



                                                                                                                    80

For instance, the research has identified in a NGN white commune (Vaslui county) the case of a
library connected to Internet but without a librarian, therefore not working. In another white
commune from Hunedoara county the dispensary has Internet connection but it is not functional,
as there is no medical doctor. Therefore, an accurate indicator for the Internet connection as a
key enabler for delivering public services would be the number of functional public institutions
with Internet connection or in the case of library, the number of users of publicly available
computers with Internet connection.
                                       Concluding remarks
The qualitative research has generally confirmed the typology of NGN broadband areas,
especially in what concerns the households' fixed coverage, the market potential, the demand
potential and the economic potential of villages. Less clear results are on the typology of
investments.
Firstly, access to Internet varies a lot between local public institutions and between local public
institutions and population. The research has identified cases of white communes with public
institutions connected to Internet and also cases of NGN white spots with population connected
to Internet through mobile 3G+ networks. Therefore, the current set of statistical data needs to
be completed with field visits for a comprehensive picture of the connectivity of the
village/commune.
Secondly, multiple projects on development of broadband infrastructure have been developed in
a ‘silo’ approach without a coordination mechanism at central level. Their results should also be
considered when designing the needed investments in each village/ commune.
Thirdly, the qualitative research has highlighted the importance of access to 3G+ mobile networks,
a factor that should be considered especially when considering the market potential for
developing the broadband infrastructure. The current affordable subscriptions for mobile
communications result in a challenge for stimulating the demand for fixed broadband coverage,
even at higher transfer speeds.
In conclusion, the research showed a clear need for a better planning process of investments in
broadband infrastructure, based on more detailed information collected through field visits. The
qualitative research has also showed that the typology of NGN broadband areas is a useful, but
not sufficient instrument for designing the necessary investments.

NGN profile of the commune
In the ‘white’ commune of Corlățel almost all public institutions are connected to Internet, some of them
also with access to 3G+ networks. The economic potential of the investment in broadband infrastructure
is severely undermined by extensive usage of mobile phones within the general population.

In both Corlățel and Valea Anilor villages the population is aged. The authorities estimate that about 70%
of the inhabitants are old people. Corlățel village has about 200 children. The young population migrates
abroad.
The children use the internet, but the general population uses extensively the mobile phones, both for
national and for international calls. “Would it be free”, the villagers would agree to have high speed
internet.

Until now, no private company which distributes high speed internet showed interest, in time, to operate
in the commune, but the local authorities too, didn’t try to dr aw such investments. The secretary of the
commune knows that in the neighboring town, Vânju Mare, located 7 km away, there is a high speed
Internet provider, AKTA, which might develop broad band infrastructure in Corlățel commune. However,
the secretary says that it would not be sustainable to make investments in high speed internet
infrastructure because the population would not pay the subscriptions. Furthermore, the “trend is moving
now towards mobile phones and phone internet”.

Leleșe commune has a population of about 400, but this summer it reached about 1000 people, becau se
the people working in Hunedoara or in other places come here for the holidays. The commune is rather
aged – over 60% of the villagers are old people. The commune has about 50 children. The commune is
affiliated to the GAL ‘Ținutul Pădurenilor Țara Hațeg’, and the development strategy relies on previous
projects.
Although the population is rather old, it has rather good digital competencies. There are old people aged
70+ who have computers connected to the internet and who communicate with their kin abroad.
Cerișor village, being closer to the village centre of the commune, also has internet connection.

The library center has old computers and it is open to public only on Saturdays and Sundays, because the
library is closed these days.
The villages from Leleșe commune are isolated and the access to them i s difficult because of the
mountains, valleys and forests. There are differences of altitude in excess of 500 m, where the mayor’s
office pumps water to be distributed in the villages. In winter, because of the weather conditions, the
Internet connection breaks generally four or five times. When this happens, they have no internet
connection, and n phone connection either – because the fixed phone connection is done through the
internet cable too, and the mobile phones have very weak signal, if any.
The town hall authorized and made available a plot of land for the erection of a Vodafone pillar, to have
signal for the mobile phones – they are currently waiting for the investment to materialize.

NGN profile of the commune
The ‘white’ commune of Poroina Mare seems to be indeed ‘white’ in regard to broadband coverage both
at public institutions and population levels. None of the previous or current broadband projects has
included investments in this area. The market and economic potential of the investments represent a
challenge at population level.

Municipality: The town hall is part of the EuDiS (European District System) project implemented by
CG&GC IT SA Company and by the Mehedinți County Council, through a public -private partnership. This
project created an information system which connects the town halls throughout the county and other
public institutions, with a knot within the Mehedinți County Council.
Police: It is not connected to the Internet.
Schools: The commune has two elementary schools with grades I-IV, one in Stignița village and one in

All villages are covered with Internet from Orange, through modem or mobile internet. There also are
some Telekom subscribers, but the signal is not very good.
The villages are aged; according to the evaluation of the local authorities, about 80% of the villagers are
old people. In Poroina Mare village there are about 30 children in the elementary school, and throughout
the entire commune there are 50 children in the elementary school, grades I-IV and 16 children in grades
V-VIII.
The digital competencies of the population are rather poor; only the young people are interested by the
Internet. The willingness of the population to pay subscription for the Internet is rather low. Most
villagers use phones to communicate: fixed phones with Telekom subscription, or mobile phones with
Orange subscription.

The Biblionet center has four computers located in the library, with free Internet access, both for the
children and for the adult people. The local authorities consider that the development of broad band
infrastructure is not a necessity for the commune, which is why no action has been taken so far in this
respect. The commune secretary says that a public access point to the Internet might be established in
the town hall, where the public meetings are held.

NGN profile of the commune
The commune of Secas, Timiș is completely ‘white’ broadband spot both at public institutions and
population levels. The greatest challenge for investments at households’ coverage is the very low number
of inhabitans (both at village as well as commune levels).

Given the low number of inhabitants, Romtelecom is not interested in developing modern infrastructure
for Internet connection as their financial estimation of costs is of 20,000-25,000 euro. At the neighbouring
community, Paniova has won a project to develop optical fiber infrastructure that hopefully might
contribute to the broadband coverage also in Secaș.

The Internet connection provided through KEP project at schools has not resulted in broadband coverage
of the households. Romtelecom has not agreed in developing the necessary infrastructure for households
coverage. Still, the population is connected to fixed and mobile telephone communications, with
Vodafone coverage, also providing Internet connection.

PAPI is no longer functional, the headquarters of the project is no longer working and the computers have
been transferred to the municipality. The commune is part of the Local Action Group Stefan cel Mare
Dragomiresti but there is no development direction regarding the broadband infrastructure, the
municipality doesn’t see it as a priority as the people are conn ected through mobile Internet connection.

perceive the need for NGN infrastructure. Instead, they want a connection ‘that works properly and is
affordable’.

The population is connected to Internet through modems from Orange but the quality of the coverage is
poor, does not work all the time. The ones ‘knocking at municipality’s door asking for Internet connection
are the parents of the children in school’. The population does not necessarily want a higher speed
Internet connection, but a connection that works properly. There have been initiatives for connections
from private providers (as Telekom) but there have given up as the commune is small, recently divided
from the commune of Todiresti, which is ‘larger and at the asphalt’.

NGN profile of the commune
In the white commune of Cozmești, Vaslui the municipality has identified innovative and more cost-
efficient solutions for broadband infrastructure for public institutions. For the general population, the
challenge is related rather to the quality of service rather than to access to Internet.

Schools: The commune has four schools, one in each village. As of 2014, the school from Băleș ti has
wireless internet connection (aerial mounted by TelePlus company), which receives signal from a relay
located in Zăpodeni commune, about 20 km away from Bălești commune. This wireless aerial sends
wireless internet to the school from Fâstâci village. This was the variant chosen by the local authorities,
since connection through optic fibre would have been too costly. Because the routers are unplugged from
the power source during the weekends, they can no longer be monitored by the internet provider, and
thus, many times the connection is no longer functional in the schools.
Kindergarten: The commune has two kindergartens, which are not connected to the Internet.
Library: It is connected to the Internet.
Dispensary (Medical practice): The dispensary has mobile Internet.
Pharmacy: The commune has no pharmacy because the Local Council doesn’t want one.
House of Culture: The commune has no house of culture because the Local Council doesn’t want one.
Church(es): The church has mobile Internet.
Agricultural associations (or of producers’): The commune has two agricultural or producers’ associations,
but they don’t have Internet connection.

Hordilești village is small, with 6-7 households, located far away from the road. It is not sustainable to
develop there broad band infrastructure. Those who have smartphones, also have mobile Internet. In
Bălești and Cozmești there is cable Internet from Telekom, but with low speed. In Fâstâci there is mobile
Internet. There is optical fibre going to the neighbouring village, Delești, located 8 km away. The young
people and the children account for more than half of the population; very many people migrated abroad.
Most of the adult people have Internet sticks from the suppliers of mobile phones and communicate thus
with the people working abroad. The mobile phones are used mostly to communicate with the people
abroad. ‘Some young people come and stand in front of the town hall to get connected to the wirel ess.’
Being the largest village, with the highest number of children, one can notice here the highest interest of
the population for the Internet. However, the mayor considers that their willingness to pay for the
subscription is rather low, that they would rather “want it for free”.

A RoNet project will be implemented in Fâstâci village, which is on the list of the villages where broad
band infrastructure is to be developed.

Until now, no private company which distributes high speed internet showed interest to operate in the
commune because the former leaders didn’t d isplay any interest. The optical fibre connection is rather
costly and likely not sustainable because the population has rather low incomes and most of the villagers
could not pay the subscription. Nevertheless, the development solution proposed by the mayor is the
connection to the optical fibre network from the neighbouring commune Delești, located 8 km away, but
“the commune lacks many other things, ahead of the internet”. A public point for internet access could be
implemented in the house of culture to be built, or in the new school that will soon be finished. The
villages of Bălești and Cozmești could develop the Telekom Internet network.

Population from Chițoc, Corbu and Lipovăț villages is connected to Inter net through mobile connections
(Orange) and the quality of the 3G coverage is quite good. The RoNet project has been implemented in
Căpușneni and Fundu Văii villages but ‘due to a history about which I don’t want to comment on’ the
project has been closed and the computers have been moved to the municipality and school. In these
villages the quality of the 3G coverage is quite poor.

One problem identified by the local authority representatives was the signal for mobile phones and 3G
mobile internet. The solution proposed: Telekom provider should install more relays for optical fibre and
to amplify the signal for the mobile phones; replacement of the switchboard from Băceşti (whose current
capacity is of 190-200 subscribers), with one of higher capacity and with better performance.

NGN profile of the commune
In the commune of Laza the Internet provider for both public i nstitutions and households’ levels is a local
company which provides more affordable and higher speed subscriptions. This results in a clear
confirmation of the investment-related typology.

Municipality: It is connected to the Internet through cable (optical fibre). The provider is a company from
Vaslui (TelePlus), which provides Internet services since 2013, for all the institutions from the commune,
as well as for the population. The speed is 100 Mbps, which actually means about 60-70 Mbps.
Police: It is connected to the Internet through cable, but doesn’t know whether it is intranet or another
type.

Schools: There are three schools in the commune, located in the villages of Laza (middle school), Săuca
and Râșnița (elementary schools, grades I-IV). Two of the schools have Internet connection, the school
from Laza and the school from Săuca. The plan is to connect the school from Râșnița village too, because
it will be polling station and it will need internet connection.
Kindergarten: There are three kindergartens, located in the villages where the schools are; just like the
schools, only two kindergartens have internet connection.
Library: It is connected to the Internet through BiblioNet project. There are six computers with public
access to the Internet.
Dispensary (Medical practice): It is connected to the Internet through TelePlus.
Pharmacy: Doesn’t know whether it is connected to the Internet.
House of Culture: There is no house of culture in the commune.
Church(es): The church is not connected to the Internet.

headquarters is at the domicile of the founding members, and they have Internet connection.
Other institutions: The veterinary dispensary is connected to the Internet.

Bejenești village is very small, with aged population; there are just two young families in the village. Most
young people have mobile phones, and the younger ones have mobile internet. The village is located 5 km
from the village which is the commune centre, but it is not connected to the cable Internet because there
is no demand, and it is not sustainable for the provider. Since the time when TelePlus started to provide
Internet connection in the commune, most villagers (about 30% of the population) connected to the
internet via this provider and gave up Telekom services whose internet speed was lower (<10 Mbps).
Besides the higher internet speed, the local people selected this provider because of the lower fees
(about 50 RON Internet plus cable TV, compared to 80 RON, the price demanded by Telekom). Most
Internet users are young people.

At the beginning of the project, many people went to the library for the Internet, but now, when they
have Internet at home, the number of people coming to the library decreased.
