Program at a Glance: The GAVI Alliance
Start date            January 2000. GAVI was formally launched at the World Economic
                      Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
Purpose               GAVI’s mission is to save children’s lives and protect people’s health
                      by increasing access to immunization in poor countries. GAVI’s
                      support contributes to the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of
                      reducing the under-five child mortality rate by two-thirds.
Major activities      As a public-private partnership, GAVI pools donor resources to fund
                      vaccine introduction, encourage development of new and underused
                      vaccines, and improve vaccine delivery by strengthening health
                      systems. GAVI offers the following types of support to eligible
                      countries:
                           New and underused vaccines (10 different types of vaccines)
                           Health system strengthening
                           Immunization services to improve immunization
                             performance
                           Civil society organizations (CSOs)
                      GAVI is also involved in shaping vaccine market conditions to lower
                      vaccine prices and ensure sufficient supply of vaccines for vaccine
                      program sustainability in developing countries.
World Bank Group      The World Bank is a voting member of the GAVI Alliance Board and
roles                 three Board committees, is the Treasury Manager for International
                      Finance Facility for Immunisation (IFFIm), provides the financial
                      platform for the Advanced Market Commitment (AMC), and is a
                      development partner at the global and country levels. The Bank
                      contributed financial resources to GAVI during its early years, and
                      GAVI set up a trust fund (now closed) for Bank activities in health
                      system strengthening and immunization.
Donor contributions   GAVI is funded by direct contributions and innovative financing
                      mechanisms. As of 2013, 32 public- and private-sector donors have
                      contributed United States (US) $8.3 billion to GAVI since its
                      inception. IFFIm currently has nine donor countries pledging US$6.3
                      billion over 23 years, and IFFIm has raised US$4.5 billion from
                      investors. The Matching Fund has 12 partners and has raised more
                      than US$162 million as of April 2014. The six largest donors (United
                      Kingdom, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Norway, United States,
                      France, and Italy) contribute more than two-thirds of these resources.
Location              The GAVI Secretariat offices are located in Geneva, Switzerland and
                      Washington, DC, USA.

Governance and    GAVI is an independent legal entity incorporated as a foundation
management        under Swiss law.
                  GAVI is governed by the GAVI Alliance Board comprised of 28 seats,
                  which includes 18 representatives of donor and recipient
                  governments, the private sector (including philanthropists), the
                  vaccine industry (from developed and developing countries),
                  research and technical institutes, CSOs, and key multilateral
                  organizations, in addition to nine independent or “unaffiliated”
                  individuals and one non-voting seat for GAVI’s CEO. Permanent
                  seats are held by the Gates Foundation, World Health Organization
                  (WHO), United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), and the World
                  Bank. Aside from the four permanent members, Board
                  representatives serve on a time-limited basis. The GAVI Alliance
                  Board is supported by committees that oversee specific activities and
                  the development of key policies.
                  The GAVI Secretariat, with offices in Geneva and Washington, D.C.,
                  is led by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and is responsible for
                  day-to-day operations, including mobilizing resources, coordinating
                  program approvals and disbursements, developing policy,
                  implementing strategic initiatives, monitoring and evaluation, legal
                  and financial management, and administration for the GAVI Alliance
                  Board and Committees.
                  IFFIm is a registered charity in the United Kingdom (UK) and
                  independent from the GAVI Alliance. IFFIm is governed by the
                  IFFIm Board comprised of five independent directors.

Overview
Highlights
GAVI is the third largest multilateral in the health sector. It has a single-purpose mandate,
to increase access to immunization in poor countries. The World Bank is a founding partner
to GAVI and remains a major partner, particularly at a financial level by supporting
operations of two major innovative financial mechanisms on its behalf. By design, GAVI
itself does not have a presence at the country level and relies heavily on its partners, WHO
and UNICEF, for planning and implementing country activities. While the Bank’s financial
engagement on behalf of GAVI has been transformative, this review identifies opportunities
for stronger Bank engagement in immunization activities at the country level, in GAVI’s
governance, and in broader immunization policy discussions.


Financial engagement. The Bank’s most significant contribution is a key role in the
establishment and management of two innovative financing mechanisms (IFFIm and AMC)
that have contributed one-third of GAVI’s financial resources from 2000 to 2010. In both
cases the Bank worked with partners to translate a conceptual innovation into a viable
financial pilot mechanism. Operationalizing these instruments required the Bank to assume
financial risk, develop new systems, and make a long-term commitment. The Bank assumed
a direct balance sheet risk on behalf of AMC and used its excellent credit rating to place
IFFIm “vaccine” bonds. The Bank’s financial relationship with GAVI and IFFIm has been
highly competent and professional. It deserves widespread appreciation and recognition.
Engagement at country level. The relationship with GAVI has been collegial and
constructive in countries where there is engagement, but in many countries the Bank is not
substantially involved in immunization. This review concludes that the status quo leaves
organizational synergies untapped, and that stronger Bank involvement, drawing on its
strengths in sustainable funding for immunization, addressing inequities in access to
immunization, investments in health systems strengthening, and donor coordination in
health could help achieve greater development results.
Governance. The mandates and priorities of the Bank and GAVI were mutually relevant
and compatible at GAVI’s inception but the engagement diminished during a period from
around 2008 until recently. This disengagement by the Bank can be traced to differences in
alignment between the Bank’s broader development objectives and GAVI’s focused
approach on accelerating introduction of new and sometimes costly vaccines in low-income
countries, and the changing influence of the founding partners and growing autonomy of
the GAVI Secretariat after GAVI’s 2008 governance reform.

                                               OVERVIEW


A fifth lesson is that clearer definition of
roles and responsibilities at country and
global level could enhance the impact of the
Bank, GAVI, and other organizations’
support for immunization. It would be
helpful for the Bank and GAVI to agree on
priority countries, modes of engagement,
and division of labor. The division of labor
should be documented yet flexible so as to
avoid excessively restrictive contractual
approaches and permit the Bank to pursue
its comparative advantages in policy
dialogue and analytical work tailored to
country contexts.

Sixth, the Bank-GAVI experience is not
unique: there are often missed opportunities
for stronger results in the Bank’s
engagements in partnership programs.
IEG’s synthesis report of global program
reviews in 2011 found strong operational
linkages to the Bank’s country-level work in
only four of 17 global programs reviewed
(IEG 2011a). To remedy this, IEG has
recommended a more explicit definition of
roles and accountabilities in partnership
programs. IEG has also recommended that
the Bank put in place stronger coordination
mechanisms between partnership programs
and the relevant sectors and practices and
empower its representatives on program
boards to work for the Bank’s corporate
interests (the Bank has yet to implement a
proposal that staff serving on partnership
boards be guided by terms of reference that
set out Bank-wide institutional positions).
These steps could help fulfill the World
Bank Group strategy objective of closer
alignment between global engagements and
Bank Group goals.

GAVI Alliance Management Response to
World Bank Global Program Review of the
World Bank–GAVI Relationship

The World Bank is a founding partner and important member of the GAVI
Alliance. We therefore welcome the opportunity to comment on this review,
recognising that it is an evaluation of the World Bank’s partnership with the GAVI
Alliance, rather than a report on the Alliance itself.

We strongly endorse the report’s overall conclusion that the GAVI Alliance has
much to gain from deeper World Bank engagement and we look forward to
working together to achieve this. The proposed areas for increased engagement –
fiscal space analysis to ensure financial sustainability and health systems
strengthening – represent key priorities for the GAVI Alliance in the coming years
(and are the focus of our 2016-20 strategy) and are areas in which the Bank’s
unique capabilities, resources, and networks will play a crucial role.

In this context, we welcome recent signals from World Bank leadership that they
wish to strengthen their engagement in the Alliance, and particularly recent
collaboration on results-based funding as well as support for immunisation in
Pakistan. We look forward to a broader and deeper partnership to help ensure
every child in the world’s poorest countries benefits from the power of
immunisation.

We would, however, like to clarify a number of important issues and also note that
we identified a number of errors of fact and queried a number of findings in the
draft report, some of which remained unchanged in the final version.


Distinction between the GAVI Alliance and GAVI Secretariat
The report is vague in its distinction between the GAVI Alliance and the GAVI
Secretariat. The GAVI Alliance – by its very design – is an alliance between
partners, donors, countries and industry, of which the World Bank is a founding
partner and Board member. The GAVI Secretariat supports the Alliance but
implementation is largely performed by partners and countries. It would be
helpful to clarify where the report is referring to the GAVI Secretariat and where it
refers to the Alliance, in order to understand its conclusions.




                                                                                    xxv
GAVI ALLIANCE MANAGEMENT RESPONSE


For example, the report states that “GAVI itself does not have a presence at the
country level and relies heavily on its partners, WHO and UNICEF, for planning
and implementing country activities.” It later suggests this is a reason why the
Bank has found it difficult to engage with “GAVI” at country level. By design, the
GAVI Secretariat does not have a country presence and this is a core part of the
GAVI Alliance model which the World Bank as a founding partner helped to
create. However, the GAVI Alliance has a strong presence at country level where it
is represented primarily by UNICEF and WHO, both of whom are Alliance
partners and many of whose immunisation staff are funded by GAVI. In this
example, we are unclear if the report’s finding is that the World Bank will always
face challenges engaging with “GAVI” at country level given our Alliance model.


GAVI Alliance Strategy
The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) report paints a shift in the GAVI
Alliance’s strategy from focusing broadly on access to immunisation at its
inception towards a focus on accelerating introduction of new vaccines and
technologies after 2008. It cites this as one reason why the Bank decided to
disengage from the Alliance.

In fact, a major rationale for the creation of the GAVI Alliance was to accelerate
introduction of new vaccines and this has always accounted for the majority of
GAVI financial support. It was only in 2007, with the first disbursements of health
system strengthening grants, that the Alliance began to work more
comprehensively on broadening immunisation coverage and access across all
GAVI countries.

With the development of the Alliance’s 2016-2020 strategy, in which the World
Bank has been an active partner, coverage and equity will become even greater
priorities. As the report suggests, this should hopefully further reinforce strategic
alignment between the GAVI Alliance and the World Bank.


Causes of World Bank Disengagement from GAVI
The report traces the Bank’s disengagement to 2008, linking it primarily to GAVI’s
governance reform and disagreements over whether to prioritise new vaccine
introduction or financial sustainability. Many of the tensions described in the
report, however, existed long before GAVI’s governance reform. Indeed the
greatest tensions were over introduction of pentavalent vaccine, which GAVI has
supported since its early years and which Bank staff felt was too expensive to be
sustainable. We note that 72 of 73 GAVI-eligible countries have now introduced
pentavalent vaccine (with the final country planning to introduce this year) and
that there has been a two-thirds reduction in the lowest price available thanks

                                               GAVI ALLIANCE MANAGEMENT RESPONSE


largely to the Alliance’s market shaping efforts which are central to our strategy for
sustainability.

Moreover, the Bank remained actively engaged with the GAVI Alliance until 2010.
For example, it chaired the Immunisation Financing and Sustainability Task Team
until 2010, chaired the working group that developed GAVI’s eligibility policy in
2010 and chaired the working group on performance-based financing that was
presented to the Board in December 2010. From our perspective, the Bank’s
greatest disengagement followed its decision not to participate in GAVI’s 2011-15
business plan because the GAVI Board required that all funded partners be held
accountable for specific deliverables in return for receiving funding.

While sustainability has always been core to the GAVI model (which includes
features such as long-term financial commitments to countries and requiring co-
financing from countries based on their ability to pay), it will be an even greater
priority during our next strategy period as a number of countries “graduate” from
GAVI Alliance support. We look forward to deeper World Bank engagement on
this issue, where the Bank’s unique capabilities within the Alliance and strong
relationships with Ministries of Finance will be critical.


Looking Forward
Again, we strongly share the IEG’s finding that the World Bank and GAVI share
common goals and would mutually benefit from increased engagement. We are
committed to strengthening the relationship and feel that we have good
momentum with the current leadership team. The ongoing dialogue on the 2016-
2020 GAVI Alliance strategy and operating model will facilitate additional
definition around the roles and responsibilities of the GAVI Secretariat, the World
Bank, and other GAVI Alliance partners at both the country and global levels. We
look forward to the Bank’s continued involvement in this process.

As part of these discussions, we particularly hope to secure the Bank’s increased
engagement at country level to ensure sustainability of immunisation programs.
The Bank’s deep relationship with Ministries of Finance in GAVI countries,
combined with its expertise (e.g., in fiscal space analysis), will be crucial to the
success of the Alliance as a whole in this area. As noted in the report, this is an
“area of Bank comparative advantage that other partners do not systematically
cover” – precisely the type of partnership at the core of the GAVI Alliance model.
Similarly, collaboration between the Bank and GAVI on health systems
strengthening represents a clear opportunity for collaboration. We would also note
that both the Bank and the GAVI Alliance have prioritised strengthening data, and
that this is another potential opportunity for further joint work.




                                                                                   xxvii
GAVI ALLIANCE MANAGEMENT RESPONSE


As the report notes, the World Bank has made critical contributions to the GAVI
Alliance in our first 14 years. We look forward to working with colleagues at the
Bank to further deepen our engagement going forward. We fundamentally believe
that by working more closely together, we can ensure more of the world’s children
have access to the power of immunisation.

World Bank Group Management Response
Management broadly supports the findings of the Independent Evaluation Group’s
(IEG) Global Program Review of the Bank’s performance as a development partner
of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI). The Review is
timely, as the GAVI Alliance is finalizing a new strategy for 2016 to 2020 and the
next GAVI replenishment is just around the corner in 2015. The Review also has the
potential to inform an expanded partnership and renewed engagement between the
Bank’s new Global Health Practice and GAVI which is currently underway. In that,
the Bank and GAVI agreed to deepen and expand collaboration to integrate vaccine
financing and delivery into health systems and to co-finance selected operations in
countries, including through Results-Based-Financing (RBF). Further, the
international health community in a recent meeting of their leaders, re-committed to
the principles of the International Health Partnership (IHP+ for which both the Bank
and GAVI are co-signatories), requiring donors to adhere to Paris/Accra principles
of aid effectiveness.


Management concurs with IEG in their assessment that GAVI has evolved as a
successful, well-funded, and highly effective public-private partnership which has
succeeded in accelerating the introduction of new vaccines for poor countries at a
large scale, hence saving millions of lives. We particularly welcome IEG’s
assessment regarding the constructive role the Bank was able to play in partnering
with GAVI to come up with two of the most innovative and promising financing
instruments for development: the International Financing Facility for Immunisation
(IFFIm) has become an important funding source for GAVI and allows for additional
funding flexibility, and the pilot Advanced Market Commitment (AMC) for
pneumococcal vaccines, which received just recently a very positive evaluation, has
resulted in an over 90 percent unit price reduction for pneumococcal vaccines
tailored to the needs of the poorest countries.

As GAVI has grown over the last decade from an informal alliance of partners into a
robust Swiss foundation of several hundred staff with more formal governance
arrangements and a multi-billion dollar budget, it is clear that the relationship with
the Bank also has changed and evolved during that time. Management notes that
IEG found that the Bank’s vaccine portfolio, both in terms of operations and specific
analytical work on immunization, has been on a downward trend. This, however,
might be both a reflection of a natural division of labor as the GAVI Secretariat has
become larger and technically highly competent to carry out and commission
analytical work themselves, and the result of rational choices of countries to
substitute concessional credits with available grant funding for vaccines. But we


                                                                                  xxix
WORLD BANK GROUP MANAGEMENT RESPONSE


agree with IEG that there is a need for the Bank to engage with GAVI along the
entire value chain of vaccines, ranging from making the investment case for a
vaccine introduction, to assuring cost-effectiveness of vaccine programs and long-
term sustainability of investments within a country’s budget and fiscal space.
Management also agrees with IEG’s assessment that the Bank has an important role
to play in assuring that the vaccine sector is firmly embedded within an equitable
and effective health system in low and middle income countries and that such
systems effectively contribute to further the Bank’s dual objectives of ending
poverty and boosting shared prosperity.

Management would like to re-affirm that the Bank always was, and will remain, in
the future a valued and productive partner within the GAVI Alliance. This is
reflected not only in the successful collaboration and impressive results featured in
the IEG review, but also as regards to the important role the Bank is playing in
GAVI governance. The Human Development Network and the Concessional
Finance and Global Partnerships Vice Presidency have collaborated very effectively
over the years in sharing this responsibility, and such technical, fiduciary and
strategic input through our work in Committees and the Board is highly valued by
the GAVI Secretariat and the partners of the Alliance. Management concurs with
IEG and notes that during the first decade of the existence of the GAVI Alliance
many impressive quick wins have been made at an ever increasing scale. As the
Alliance partnership matures, the challenges for GAVI will build. The Bank will
have to play an important role as a key GAVI partner in assuring GAVI’s relevance
in serving the most hard-to-reach populations, both in low- and middle-income
countries with modern vaccines. At the same time, GAVI partners, including the
Bank, need to focus on the financial and technical sustainability of an ever more
expensive and complex immunization sector within countries’ health systems.
Management concurs with the IEG Review that this will require innovative
financing mechanisms, effective and seamless in-country collaboration within the
IHP+ principles of aid harmonization, institutional leadership, and good
governance. The Bank is fully prepared to meet this challenge as a member in good
standing of the GAVI Alliance and considers the IEG report a useful tool for
reflection and discussion to meet this goal.

Chairperson’s Summary:
Sub-Committee of the Committee on
Development Effectiveness

The Sub-Committee of the Committee on Development Effectiveness (CODE)
considered the Independent Evaluation Group’s (IEG) Global Program Review –
The World Bank’s Partnership with the GAVI Alliance and the draft Management
Comments.

The Committee welcomed IEG’s timely Global Program Review and observed that
its scope was in line with the Approach Paper endorsed in October 2012. Members
broadly supported the report’s findings and lessons learned. Members recognized
the Bank-GAVI partnership as an overall success story. They commended the World
Bank Group’s key role as one of the founding partners of GAVI, and noted that
through this public-private partnership, the World Bank Group helped address a
systematic shortfall in the global health architecture related to vaccination. Members
acknowledged GAVI’s transformative accomplishments in accelerating coverage of
children’s immunization globally, as well as the World Bank Group’s track record in
pioneering two of the most innovative financing mechanisms through the GAVI
Alliance: the International Financing Facility on Immunization and the Advanced
Market Commitment, both of which have been essential for scaling up the
immunization enterprise and for giving signals to the private sector that have
helped to overcome market failures.

Members recognized the changing dynamics in the World Bank Group-GAVI
partnership as a result of GAVI’s evolution from an informal alliance to a formal,
independent organization, and the consequential governance adjustments. Most
members agreed, however, that the Bank can and should have an important role in
anchoring the vaccine sector in an equitable and effective health system that
contributes to the World Bank Group’s new corporate goals. To that end, members
underscored the importance for the Bank Group to enhance its engagement with
GAVI along the entire value chain of vaccines, particularly at the country level, in
order to assure GAVI’s relevance in delivering modern vaccines to underserved
populations.

In response to a query on whether IEG’s review captured all the relevant programs
and components that have contributed to immunization but may not have been
labeled as such in the World Bank Group’s portfolio, the committee was informed
by management that the World Bank Group may have done more in strengthening

delivery systems for immunizations. Management added that the downward trend
in the World Bank Group’s vaccine portfolio could be a reflection of division of
responsibilities and informed choices by beneficiary countries of grant funding over
concessional credits. Members encouraged management to strategize the World
Bank Group’s continued catalytic role in GAVI, in particular vis-à-vis innovative
and sustainable financing, governance and decision-making, and coordination with
other donors.

1. The World Bank-GAVI Partnership and the
Purpose of the Review
1.1   The new World Bank Group strategy makes a strong case for an expanded
World Bank Group role in global and regional dialogue and collective action (World
Bank 2013). It argues that addressing complex development challenges requires
partnering with private, public, multilateral, and civil society actors. Global
partnerships such as GAVI complement the Bank’s country-led business model by
addressing critical global issues and helping countries achieve specific Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs).

1.2    GAVI’s mission is to increase access to immunization in poor countries. The
Bank is a founding member and has made several substantial contributions to GAVI.
GAVI is one of the Bank’s largest partnership programs in financial terms, and
possibly its most complex. The Bank has three major roles in GAVI: development
partner, as another donor active in health and immunization; financial partner,
helping to establish and manage two major innovative financial vehicles on behalf of
GAVI; and corporate governance partner, as voting member on the GAVI Alliance
Board.

Evolution of GAVI
1.3    GAVI was launched in 2000 as a partnership of public and private
organizations with a mission “to save children’s lives and protect people’s health by
increasing access to immunization in poor countries.”(Cambridge Economic Policy
Associates (2010). GAVI pools donor resources to fund vaccine introduction
programs, supports the development of new and underused vaccines, and improves
vaccine delivery by strengthening health systems. GAVI’s current strategy
emphasizes rapid introduction of new vaccines and has renewed its focus on vaccine
market shaping (reducing vaccine costs).

1.4    GAVI’s founding structure was designed as an informal alliance of partners
with a shared mission, a dual governance structure with GAVI on the programmatic
side and the Vaccine Fund (later called the GAVI Fund) on the financial side, and a
small secretariat based at the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) office in
Geneva. The World Bank, the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, and


                                                                                    1
CHAPTER 1
THE WORLD BANK GAVI PARTNERSHIP AND THE PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW

Gates Foundation are founding members of GAVI and still hold permanent seats on
the GAVI Alliance Board.

1.5    Over time, GAVI has become more formal with a single governance structure
and a more independent secretariat in response to its increased programs, resources,
and responsibilities. As discussed in chapter 4, GAVI was restructured in 2008 and
transformed from an informal partnership hosted by UNICEF and operating under
international law into an independent foundation anchored under Swiss national
law (but with a headquarters agreement with the Swiss government that affords it
certain privileges and immunities) and located in Geneva. Administrative services
were subsequently moved from UNICEF to a new GAVI corporate secretariat.

Funding and Results
1.6     GAVI receives funds from both direct contributions from donor governments,
the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and other private donors, and from
innovative financing mechanisms, namely the International Finance Facility for
Immunisation (IFFIm) and the pilot Advance Market Commitment (AMC) for
pneumococcal vaccines (see glossary) (Figure 1). The Bank has made substantial
contributions to these two mechanisms, as discussed in Chapter 2. GAVI also has a
Matching Fund that matches corporate donations.

                                   THE WORLD BANK GAVI PARTNERSHIP AND THE PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW


1.7     Since its inception, GAVI has committed US$8.4 billion for vaccine support
and immunization-related, health-sector development and disbursed over US$6
billion to 76 countries, making GAVI the third largest multilateral funder in health,
after the Global Fund and the World Bank.1 From a country perspective, GAVI is
considered a donor with a categorical (single-purpose) mandate, without strong
field presence, instead relying heavily on partners, such as UNICEF and WHO, to
support country activities. Most support is for the vaccines themselves, with some
funding also going to health systems strengthening, immunization services, and
other programs (Figure 2). Annual commitments by GAVI have increased from
US$26 million in 2001 to US$700 million in 2011. To be GAVI-eligible, countries
must have per-capita Gross National Income (GNI) below US$1,570 (adjusted
annually for inflation); as of April 2014, 53 countries were eligible for GAVI
support.2 These countries can apply for any of GAVI’s support programs.

1.8    GAVI’s funding and capacity building have been credited with contributing
to substantial increases in vaccination rates in low-income countries. Over the 2000-
2013 period, GAVI support has contributed to the immunization of an estimated
additional 440 million children and the global immunization coverage rates have
increased from 70 to 83 percent, which has been essential in the continuous decline
in the global under-five mortality rate.3 External evaluations in 2007 and 2010 of
GAVI highlight that, in addition to improving access to vaccines, GAVI has

CHAPTER 1
THE WORLD BANK GAVI PARTNERSHIP AND THE PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW

contributed to strengthening health systems, improving vaccine storage and
delivery, getting immunization onto national and international health agendas, and
stimulating vaccine research and development.4

1.9     External evaluations conclude that GAVI’s rising profile and advocacy have
raised the issue of immunization at the international level. The Decade of Vaccines
(2011-2020) envisions “a world in which all individuals and communities enjoy lives
free from vaccine-preventable diseases” by extending “the full benefit of
immunization to all people, regardless of where they are born, who they are, or
where they live.”5 In May 2012, the Sixty-fifth World Health Assembly adopted the
Global Vaccine Action Plan which calls on stakeholders, including the World Bank,
to take actions in order to achieve the vision for the Decade of Vaccines. The Global
Vaccine Action Plan proposes six strategic immunization objectives:

       all countries commit to immunization as a priority;
       individuals and communities understand the value of vaccines and demand
        immunization as their right and responsibility;
       the benefits of immunization are equitably extended to all people;
       strong immunization systems are an integral part of a well-functioning health
        system;
       immunization programs have sustainable access to predictable funding,
        quality supply, and innovative technologies; and
       country, regional, and global research and development innovations
        maximize the benefits of immunization.

1.10 Actions called upon to which the World Bank could contribute include:
coordinate synergies between immunization and other health services; promote
sustainable national funding; pursue innovative financing and procurement
mechanisms; improve technical assistance to strengthen immunization and health
systems; and promote equity and affordability for low- and middle-income
countries.6

1.11 Thus, the international development community has called upon the World
Bank to contribute its expertise toward shared immunization goals. Doing so would
appear to be in line with the World Bank Group strategy and its emphasis on
partnership and would build on the Bank’s first-rate contribution to set up
innovative finance for immunization. Yet this review finds that the reality is rather
the opposite: the Bank has diminished its activities in immunization, at least for
some time.

1.12 Several external evaluations and assessments have reviewed GAVI’s
performance. The latest full evaluation, the Second Evaluation Report completed in

2010, focuses primarily on GAVI’s strategic period from 2006 to 2009. The evaluation
praises GAVI for: attracting increased funding for immunization, the development
of innovative financial instruments, the accelerated introduction of vaccines in low-
income countries, and the country ownership approach. GAVI’s support is
described as cost-effective and life-saving. The evaluation also discusses weaknesses
of GAVI’s strategy and performance framework, particularly how GAVI’s activities
have been insufficiently aligned with its strategy.7 The report notes the need for
better prioritization of secretariat and partner resources, GAVI’s failure to prioritize
monitoring and evaluation (M&E), and the poor accountability between GAVI and
its implementing partners. The report also highlights GAVI’s weak performances in
reducing vaccine prices and its issues with the Health Systems Strengthening (HSS)
delivery model. Furthermore, the report notes that GAVI’s choice of vaccines and
basic funding model has adverse implications for country financial sustainability.8

1.13 In recent years, some development partners have assessed GAVI in terms of
value added, aid effectiveness, and alignment and relevance to their development
objectives. The United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID)
Multilateral Aid Review 2011 assessed 43 organizations on relative value for money
spent. GAVI is rated as “very good value for money” for delivering cost-effective
health interventions, being innovative and transparent, and taking a country-led
approach. The review also notes that GAVI needs to focus on further reducing
vaccine prices. Sweden’s 2011 assessment rates GAVI as highly relevant to Swedish
development assistance policy, stating that it has a very high level of internal and
external effectiveness with an efficient and responsive secretariat. Australia’s
Multilateral Assessment of GAVI from 2012 rates GAVI highly on delivering results,
transparency and accountability, partnership behavior, cost and value
consciousness, strategic management and performance, contribution to the
multilateral system, and alignment with Australia’s interest.

Purpose of the Review
1.14 The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) undertook this review because
global partnerships are strategically important to the World Bank Group, and the
GAVI Alliance is one of the largest global partnership programs in which the Bank is
involved. GAVI is a major player in global health; it is one of a growing number of
large partnerships that finance country-level investments to help countries achieve
specific MDGs that have inclusive governance structures, and that subscribe to the
2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness (other such programs include the Global
Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; the Climate Investment Funds; and
the Global Program for Education).

THE WORLD BANK GAVI PARTNERSHIP AND THE PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW

1.15 This review focuses on the Bank-GAVI relationship and assesses the
performance of the Bank in the three major roles that the Bank plays in GAVI:

   Financial partner: what has been the Bank’s performance in financing GAVI,
    chiefly in helping to establish and manage the treasury and other functions of its
    innovative financial vehicles, the International Finance Facility for Immunisation
    (IFFIm) and the pilot Advanced Market Commitment (AMC) for vaccines?

   Development partner at global and country levels: what is the relevance of the
    World Bank to GAVI and of GAVI to the Bank? How has the Bank engaged with
    GAVI at the country level? What has been the experience of the Bank and GAVI
    in relation to the changing international aid architecture for health?

   Corporate governance partner and founding member of the GAVI Alliance: how
    has the Bank fulfilled its roles as a founding member and full voting board
    member of GAVI since inception, and how has it managed the potential conflicts
    of interest among the Bank’s multiple roles in the Alliance? What has been the
    impact of GAVI’s 2008 governance reform on its partnership with the Bank?

1.16 The review aims to provide strategic inputs into the Bank’s partnership with
GAVI, draw broad lessons for the Bank’s involvement with other global health
partnerships, and, along with IEG’s other work on partnership programs, inform the
Bank as to how well its regional and global engagements align with the World Bank
Group twin goals. Such alignment is a key component of the new Bank Group
strategy, which notes that “global engagements represent an important opportunity
for the World Bank Group to make an impact on development, but this rapidly
growing role also places additional demands on the Bank Group that it must ensure
are aligned with the goals.”9 Improved alignment and stronger engagement between
the Bank and GAVI was also emphasized in the Bank’s 2007 Health-Sector
Strategy.10 This review also seeks to add value to the World Bank and GAVI beyond
what is contained in the two evaluations of GAVI (neither of which specifically
address the Bank’s role and performance), and the evaluation of IFFIm. The review
builds on IEG’s experience in reviewing the Bank’s involvement with a growing
number of Partnership Programs.11 The review does not assess the effectiveness of
GAVI, its financing mechanisms, and its corporate governance.

1.17 This review is structured as follows: Chapter 2 reviews the Bank’s
performance in financing GAVI. Chapter 3 assesses the Bank’s role as global and
country-level development partner. Chapter 4 discusses how the Bank has
contributed to GAVI’s corporate governance. Chapter 5 draws conclusions and
lessons. Annexes contain supportive evidence.

Data, Methodology, and Timeframe
1.18 The review covers the period from 2000 to mid-2013, but with a focus more
on the recent phases from GAVI’s Phase II (2007) to the present Phase III.
Developments in the relationship between the World Bank and GAVI since mid-
2013 are also noted in this review.

1.19 The review applies IEG’s standard global program review methodologies
which IEG developed over several years and applied in its reviews of 23 global
partnership programs with World Bank participation. Following the evaluation
framework outlined in the Approach Paper, the following primary data and
information were gathered, analyzed, and triangulated using IEG best practice
evaluation methodologies:

      Document review of the GAVI and World Bank strategies and operations in
       the health sector, including the role of the health sector in the Bank’s country
       assistance strategies;
      Portfolio review of the Bank’s immunization-related, health-sector operations;
      Document review of GAVI, IFFIm, and AMC Evaluation reports;
      Electronic survey of Bank staff managing immunization activities;
      Structured interviews, mostly face-to-face and using a common question
       outline, of key staff and management in GAVI, World Bank, UNICEF, WHO,
       and other partners. In the Bank and GAVI, these interviews covered nearly all
       of the managers and key staff responsible for or involved in the relationship
       (see list of interviewees in Annex G);
      Interviews with select GAVI board members;
      Missions to Ethiopia, Indonesia, Nepal, and Tajikistan; discussions in Ghana.
       Interviews with staff from the Bank, and partner agencies, and countries’
       Ministries of Health and Finance;
      Review of the academic literature on the AMC; Review of the Bank’s
       immunization portfolio.

2. The World Bank as a Financial Partner to
GAVI
2.1   This chapter assesses the World Bank’s contributions to GAVI’s finances. The
Bank’s most significant contribution to GAVI is helping to establish and manage two
innovative financing mechanisms, the International Finance Facility for
Immunisation (IFFIm) and the Advanced Market Commitment (AMC) for
pneumococcal vaccines. They have contributed one-third of GAVI’s financial
resources from 2000 to 2010 and both represent pilot models of globally innovative
development finance.

2.2    The Bank’s financial relationship with GAVI and IFFIm has been highly
competent and professional and deserves widespread recognition. Operationalizing
the IFFIm and AMC instruments required the Bank to assume financial risk, develop
new systems, and make a long-term commitment. The Bank assumed a direct
balance sheet risk on behalf of AMC and used its excellent credit rating to place
IFFIm bonds. The Bank reviewed these commitments at the Board level and worked
consistently to launch and implement two complex and somewhat risky innovative
financial vehicles. The Bank subsidized the system development costs of IFFIm.

2.3    The key lesson of this chapter is that the Bank has a unique capability to assist
the international development community with setting up and running innovative
finance for development, even if the two specific GAVI-related pilots are unlikely to
be replicated.

Setting up an International Finance Facility for Immunisation
ORIGIN AND ESTABLISHMENT OF IFFIM
2.4    The United Kingdom (UK) and Goldman Sachs proposed the concept of an
International Finance Facility (IFF) as a new vehicle for development finance, and
the Bank was critical in translating and implementing this concept. Health spending
was seen as needing to be scaled up, and the IFF concept was conceived as an
innovative way to cover the funding gap required to meet the MDGs. The basic
concept—that aid pledges can be used to issue bonds that raise funds for
development—was initially proposed for piloting by Gordon Brown, then UK
Chancellor of the Exchequer, in 2001 and further developed with input from
Goldman Sachs and set out in a UK Treasury paper in 2003.

2.5   An IFF for Immunisation (IFFIm) was raised at the World Health Assembly in
2004 and discussed at the Group of Eight Highly-industrialized Nations (G8)
meeting in 2005. The World Bank became involved in the detailed design work on
IFFIm at the end of 2005. IFFIm was launched in 2006 to pilot the innovative


                                                                                       9

financing mechanism with GAVI as the implementing partner and the World Bank
as the Treasury Manager.1 IFFIm was incorporated as a UK charitable company in
June 2006.

2.6     IFFIm is thus a pilot application of a general conceptual innovation in which
aid pledges by sovereign donors can be used to leverage private capital.
Immunization was chosen to test the IFF concepts because it has features consistent
with the requirements of the IFF concept: it is a cost-effective intervention that offers
positive externalities and contributes to economic and social development. IFFIm
raises funds on international capital markets by issuing bonds, colloquially referred
to as “vaccine bonds.” IFFIm’s assets against which it issues bonds are long-term,
legally binding grant agreements from sovereign donors. IFFIm uses these grant
payments to pay the principal and interest on its bonds.

2.7   IFFIm addresses not only the constraints of high vaccine prices and irregular
supplies by frontloading resources, it also provides predictable resource flows that it
hopes will increase market volumes, attract new investment in vaccine research and
production, and improve market stability.

2.8    The World Bank provides treasury management services to IFFIm. The donor
countries wanted to keep IFFIm’s running costs low by utilizing existing
organizations. IFFIm operates without staff and outsources its functions to the GAVI
Secretariat and the World Bank. Key donors wanted IFFIm to have highly
conservative financial and risk management policies; AAA credit ratings; and for the
treasury manager to have supranational status.2 A competitive tender was
undertaken for the treasury management services, and the World Bank emerged as
the only qualified bidder (the donor requirements restricted the number of available
bidders). As a result, the IFFIm Board had to directly negotiate with the World Bank
for the treasury management services.

2.9    Obligations and responsibilities were very clear at the outset.3 The founding
legal agreements were signed in September 2006 by all parties involved in IFFIm.
The Finance Framework Agreement (FFA) governs the GAVI-GFA-IFFIm-World
Bank-donor relationships (Figure 3).

FINANCING IFFIM
2.10 The governments of the UK, France, Italy, Norway, Australia, Spain, the
Netherlands, Sweden, and South Africa have committed funds totaling over
US$6.3 billion to IFFIm over a period of 23 years. IFFIm bonds have raised
approximately US$4.55 billion since the program’s inception, and IFFIm has used
the proceeds to fund GAVI programs and refinance its debt (Figure 3). The upfront
costs of establishing IFFIm and gaining access to the financial markets have been
paid, yet as noted in the external evaluation, the full potential of the IFFIm
mechanism has not been utilized because its assets are not sufficiently large and are
highly concentrated on a few donors.4 New donors had been expected to join IFFIm,
but this has yet to be realized.5 Future funding from IFFIm is in decline (unless it is
replenished) just as GAVI is embarking on an ambitious spending program.

6.       Use of IFFIm Funding and Health Impact

                 1.         Overall Impact of IFFIm on GAVI Finances

      IFFIm has had a huge impact on GAVI’s spending power. Since 2006 IFFIm has
      accounted for some 64.0% of GAVI spend and has accounted for 49.2% of total GAVI
      spend since its inception. GAVI’s income year by year is shown in Figure 38.

      IFFIm has enabled GAVI to move from being something of a niche player – spending less
      than $200m a year – towards what GAVI senior management consider its ideal “cruising
      altitude” of over $1bn per annum.

      an annual basis. Nevertheless, this does re-emphasise concerns about sustainability - for
      GAVI specifically but also for the IFFIm model.

                                              THE WORLD BANK AS A FINANCIAL PARTNER TO GAVI

2.11 From IFFIm’s inception in 2006 to June 2013, IFFIm has provided US$2.4
billion to GAVI, funding 47 percent of GAVI programs in that period.6 Funds from
IFFIm allowed GAVI to ramp up its commitments and disbursements: GAVI’s
average annual commitments more than doubled from US$196 million during 2004-
2006 to US$474 million during 2007-2009.7 IFFIm has proven to be a very effective
financial mechanism to frontload funding for GAVI.

2.12 The Bank’s role as treasury manager is critical for IFFIm’s position as a
supranational and has allowed IFFIm to raise funds in the AAA bond markets on
very favorable terms, including spreads that have been lower than the weighted
average of donor’s borrowing costs. The World Bank’s reputation, participation, and
credibility have benefited IFFIm which is perceived as a “World Bank surrogate” by
investors. For example, IFFIm suffered only minor negative returns during the
recent recession starting in 2008 and was able to issue bonds in the Japanese foreign
currency denominated bond market (Uridashi market).8

IFFIM’S GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT
2.13 IFFIm is a multilateral development institution incorporated as a private
company and registered as a charity in England and Wales. IFFIm works with the
GAVI Alliance and the World Bank treasury department to achieve its objectives. As
a registered charity in the UK, IFFIm is accountable to the UK Charities Commission
and prepares an annual trustees report and financial statements for the Charity
Commissioners. The complicated IFFIm governance arrangements were chosen to
satisfy the Eurostat regulators in order to allow for off-budget financing by donors.9

THE WORLD BANK’S ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES AS TREASURY MANAGER OF IFFIM
2.14 The Treasury Management Agreement (TMA) sets out the legal relationship
between the IFFIm Board and the World Bank in relation to policy and treasury
management functions.10 The Bank provides IFFIm with a comprehensive set of
financial services: development and execution of market-based financing strategies
and funding operations, liquidity and investment management, risk monitoring and
asset-liability management, tracking of donor grants and payments, and accounting
and reporting.11 The Bank is compensated for these services on a cost-recovery basis;
earned fees from the IFFIm TMA are US$16.6 million since 2006.

2.15 The Bank maintains a single, commingled investment portfolio for IFFIm, as
well as assets held in trust for other Bank Group institutions. The Bank also manages
the risk on derivative contracts, executes a swap program, and is counterparty on all
of IFFIm’s currency and interest swap contracts.12 “IFFIm’s liquid assets are invested
in high-grade, fixed-income instruments with interest rate sensitivity matching that
of the liabilities funding IFFIm’s projected investment portfolio.”13 If the Bank
determines that the funds it manages are insufficient to meet all of IFFIm’s financial



                                                                                        13
CHAPTER 2
THE WORLD BANK AS A FINANCIAL PARTNER TO GAVI

obligations, it is empowered by the FFA, which governs the GAVI-IFFIm-World
Bank donor relationships, not to comply with a GAVI request for disbursement.14

2.16 There have been differences in the interpretation of the TMA, particularly
concerning the authority of the Bank in executing an approved strategy, including
all individual transactions. There have also been some differences in opinions on the
Bank’s conservative investment management strategy.15 The relationship between
IFFIm Board and the World Bank has evolved over time; improved communication
and engagement between the World Bank, IFFIm Board, and GAVI have
ameliorated most, but not all, of the differences between the entities. Further clarity
may be needed on the World Bank’s services to the IFFIm Board. Overall, the
relationship between the Bank and GAVI has been cordial and professional, despite
the complicated governance structure of IFFIm.

2.17 The World Bank was essential in the setup of IFFIm. The Bank was one of
only a few Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) capable of performing the roles
and functions required for IFFIm, understanding the complexity of IFFIm, and
subsidizing the systems development costs. Furthermore, liquidity management by
the Bank’s Treasury Department has generated more revenues than costs to IFFIm.16
However, there are indications that the Bank’s essential contributions—setting up
and running a new complex innovative financing mechanism and intermediating
long-term financial hedges—may not have been sufficiently recognized by GAVI
and other partners.

2.18 The credit downgrade of IFFIm is a major development that the Bank has navigated
well. IFFIm’s financial strategy required excellent credit ratings in order to qualify
for low yields. Under the original FFA, any new GAVI programs to be funded by
IFFIm could not be approved by IFFIm if it is not rated “AAA” by two of the three
major agencies. In 2012, IFFIm revised the minimum rating to “AA”. The main risk
to IFFIm’s credit rating is the credit ratings of its key donors, specifically the credit
ratings of the UK and France whose commitments jointly represent more than 70
percent of IFFIm assets. The three credit rating agencies have linked IFFIm’s rating
to those two countries’ ratings. In November 2013, Standard and Poor’s Ratings
Service lowered the long-term issuer credit rating for France and IFFIm to “AA.”17
Moody’s and Fitch downgraded France’s credit rating in November 2012 and July
2013, respectively. In early 2013, Moody’s Investor Service and Fitch Ratings
downgraded the UK to AA+ rating; subsequently, IFFIm’s credit rating was also
downgraded by the two credit rating agencies. Presently, IFFIm is not rated “AAA”
(or its equivalent) by any of the three major international rating agencies.18

2.19 Under the agreed terms, IFFIm’s credit downgrades allow the World Bank
the right “to call for collateral to protect against its exposure on IFFIm’s derivative
positions.”19 The Bank decided not to exercise this right. Instead, the Bank added



14
                                                                                CHAPTER 2
                                            THE WORLD BANK AS A FINANCIAL PARTNER TO GAVI

“an additional buffer to the existing gearing ratio limit to manage the exposure for
the World Bank under the derivative transactions entered into between IFFIm and
the World Bank.”20 This prevented further negative effects on IFFIm’s credit rating.

2.20 IEG finds the Bank showed appropriate flexibility in making an exception to
its practices of calling collateral, instead mitigating the risk through changes to the
gearing ratio. It would be appropriate to determine if there is a potential for the
World Bank’s reputation to be harmed if IFFIm continues to be viewed and
presented as a “World Bank surrogate.”

EXTERNAL EVALUATION OF IFFIM
2.21 The GAVI Secretariat, on behalf of the IFFIm Board, commissioned the
consulting company Health and Life Sciences Partnership (HLSP) to carry out an
evaluation of IFFIm. The Evaluation of the International Finance Facility for
Immunisation Report, published in June 2011, concludes that IFFIm is now a proven
concept but is not, on its own, a sustainable model and is unlikely to be replicable
for other health-sector initiatives.21 Long-term, predictable donor funding would be
preferable, as such IFFIm can be considered an efficient “second best solution” to
providing international development financing by offering features such as
predictability which traditional aid does not provide.

2.22 The Bank’s performance of treasury functions received high marks by the
evaluators. In its stewardship of IFFIm, the Bank has clearly been a vital and
effective financial partner to GAVI. It has fulfilled its roles and responsibilities as
treasury manager exceptionally well, managed liquidity well, and used its
supranational status and conservative risk management approach to the advantage
of IFFIm. The World Bank has added credibility to IFFIm through its conservative
policies and investment management which reassures investors’ confidence in
IFFIm as a World Bank-managed vehicle. Discussing various risks, the evaluators
consider the highest risk to IFFIm to be the loss of the World Bank as its treasury
manager, something which would make it cease to be perceived as a “World Bank
surrogate” by investors and therefore face sharply higher borrowing and refinancing
costs. The evaluation also makes the point that the “the importance of the World
Bank’s participation is overlooked.”22 The report remarks that the “World Bank’s
reputation, credibility, and strong AAA ratings were absolutely critical to IFFIm
being able to qualify as a supranational; zero percent risk weighting, AAA credit
ratings, and investor confidence all depended in part on the World Bank’s
participation.”23 Without the World Bank’s participation, IFFIm’s entire structure
would have been different and the feasibility of IFFIM would need to be re-
evaluated.

2.23 IEG considers the evaluation to be of high quality and concurs with the main
conclusions. IEG agrees that IFFIm has proven to be a very effective, predictable,

and flexible financial mechanism to frontload funding for GAVI, but that it is
unlikely to be replicated in the current format in the health sector. In part, this is
because the total (including non-World Bank) legal, administrative, financial
management, and governance costs are rather high and because of the drawbacks of
frontloading, namely that, unless it is replenished, IFFIm will be going into
repayment mode at a time when GAVI’s spending and financing needs are peaking.


Advanced Market Commitment to Spur Vaccine Development
ORIGIN AND ESTABLISHMENT OF THE AMC
2.24 The AMC for pneumococcal vaccines was launched as a pilot program in
June 2009. The concept of an AMC for vaccines was conceived in 2005.24 In an AMC,
donors commit funds to guarantee the price of medicines once they have been
developed. The AMC provides an innovative financing mechanism for accelerating
access to life-saving medicines in low-income countries and reduce the time gap
between access to new vaccines in industrialized countries and low-income
countries by incentivizing pharmaceutical manufacturers to develop and
manufacture medicines for diseases more prevalent in low-income countries. Thus,
the AMC is another instance where the Bank helped turn a conceptual idea into a
viable pilot for innovative development finance.

2.25 With support from the World Bank, the Government of Italy presented a
proposal for a pilot AMC for vaccines (the “Tremonti report”) to the Group of 8 (G8)
Finance Ministers in December 2005. The World Bank and GAVI were asked to co-
lead the design of a pilot AMC, and an advisory group was formed to provide
insight and support. In 2006, an Independent Disease Expert Committee
recommended pneumococcal disease as the candidate to pilot the AMC concept.25

2.26 A study conducted by GAVI and World Bank staff recommended that the
optimal arrangement for an AMC would be for GAVI to host the AMC Secretariat
and provide the programmatic functions, with the Bank providing financial and
fiduciary functions.26 The World Bank and GAVI signed the AMC Legal Agreements
in June 2009, which were subsequently revised in March 2011 to incorporate lessons
learned from the first year of implementation. GAVI funds the vaccine purchase,
UNICEF procures the vaccines from manufacturers, and the Bank provides the
financial platform for the AMC, which includes taking on the financial risk of donor
default on its own balance sheet (Figure 6).27

2.27 The AMC pilot for pneumococcal vaccines was formally launched in June
2009 with US$1.5 billion legally binding commitments from Italy, the United
Kingdom, Canada, the Russian Federation, Norway, and the Gates Foundation for
the purchase of 2 billion doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. In addition to
the donor commitments, GAVI has also budgeted US$1.3 billion for the period 2010-
2015 to help fund vaccine costs.28

2.28 The overarching goal of the pilot AMC is to reduce morbidity and mortality
from pneumococcal diseases in low-income countries. GAVI hopes to achieve this
goal by (i) accelerating the development of vaccines that meet developing country
needs; (ii) bringing forward the availability of pneumococcal vaccines by scaling up
production capacity; (iii) accelerating vaccine uptake through predictable vaccine
pricing; and (iv) testing the AMC concept for potential future applications.

AMC FUNDING AND OPERATIONS
2.29 Donors commit funds to the AMC to subsidize the purchase of pneumococcal
vaccines at an affordable price for developing countries, thereby offering vaccine
manufacturers a long-term, guaranteed market price. The AMC functions as an offer
agreement for the manufacturers of pneumococcal vaccine to supply a proportion of
the targeted demand of 200 million doses annually for 10 years at a maximum price
(tail price) of US$3.50. This is more than a 90 percent reduction from industrialized
country prices in 2009.29 The agreement also provides each manufacturer an
additional payment equal to US$7.00 minus the tail price per dose, for
approximately 20 percent of the doses they provide (Error! Reference source not
found.). This additional top–up price is to help manufacturers recover the
incremental cost of building up additional production capacity.

2.30 It is expected that the AMC will encourage multiple manufacturers to set up
production and that competition will lower prices over time. There are presently
two AMC-approved manufacturers (GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer) while two Indian
manufacturers are registered for the AMC and working to develop a vaccine. As of
April 2014, 51 eligible countries have been approved to receive pneumococcal

vaccine support and over 25 countries have introduced pneumococcal vaccines.30
The unprecedented country demand and rapid introduction of pneumococcal
vaccines have led to temporary shortages of supply and postponement of vaccine
introduction in some countries.31

THE WORLD BANK’S ROLE IN AMC’S FINANCIAL PLATFORM
2.31 The World Bank provides fairly standard financial management and
administrative services with respect to donor contributions and AMC commitments
and disbursements. Donors make grant payments to the World Bank in accordance
with specific schedules or through a demand-based payment agreement; fixed-
payment donors have pledged US$765 million and on-demand donors have pledged
US$735 million (Table 1). The Bank holds the donor contributions in trust for GAVI
and informs GAVI about the amounts being held and available for disbursement on
a quarterly basis.

2.32 The Bank also takes on an exceptional financial risk associated with donor
default on its own balance sheet. The Bank has committed to pay AMC funds to
GAVI regardless of whether or not donors actually pay on schedule or default. The
purpose of this additional commitment is to enhance the predictability of AMC
funding, even if the funds have not been received on schedule from donors.32 This
financial risk is transparently disclosed on International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development (IBRD’s) balance sheet and IBRD is compensated by a 30 basis
point premium on outstanding grant payments not yet paid by AMC donors.33

2.33 The Bank deserves recognition for having translated the AMC concept into a
pilot financial mechanism; even if it is unlikely to be replicated in the health sector
(its many critics contend that it is not a cost-effective way to subsidize vaccine
development, see Annex B). The AMC has achieved its objectives of increasing the
supply and accelerating the uptake of pneumococcal vaccines in low-income

countries, and it has inspired somewhat similar innovative financing mechanisms
for development in other sectors, such as AgResults Initiative, Low Carbon AMC,
Emission Reduction Underwriting Mechanism, and Sustainable Energy Sources.34
The Bank is involved in some of these new mechanisms.

Conclusions and Lessons on the Bank’s Contributions to Innovative Finance on
Behalf of GAVI
2.34 The Bank’s most significant contribution to GAVI is helping to develop,
establish, and effectively manage two major innovative financing mechanisms
which have helped GAVI become a major organization in global public health and
expand immunization in low-income countries. The Bank has proven twice that it
can turn conceptual ideas into viable financial pilot models and raise substantial
funds for its partner, GAVI in this case. The Bank has devoted significant time and
resources to this task, and has assumed financial risks (for the AMC) and potential
reputational risks (for both AMC and IFFIm). The Bank’s relationship with GAVI in
the financial management of IFFIm and AMC has been collegial and effective.

2.35 Leveraging resources and partnerships with the private sector and pursuing
innovative finance are major aspects of the new World Bank Group strategy. The
Bank’s work on behalf of GAVI is an example of just this. Even if the two specific
GAVI-related pilots are unlikely to be replicated in their current form, there are
lessons for the Bank and its partners for any future attempts to set up innovative
development finance:

        Find ways to keep total costs down: financial mechanisms can be costly to set
         up and operate.
        Keep governance arrangements simple and maintain a clear division of labor:
         some aspects of the arrangements are complex and burdensome.
        Ensure appropriate Bank recognition and reasonable protection against
         reputational risks associated with its work on innovative finance on behalf of
         partners: although IEG saw no evidence that controversies surrounding the
         AMC impacted the Bank’s reputation, a real risk existed.
        Innovative finance does not necessarily equate with new, additional resources
         for development. Private investors expect to be repaid. In the case of IFFIm,
         the financial mechanism borrowed from future aid to finance and accelerate
         the introduction of vaccines today.
        Balance the long-term financial risks and obligations of these arrangements
         against their short-term benefits: both mechanisms have long-term financial
         consequences for the Bank and its partners that need to be carefully
         considered.

3. The World Bank as Development Partner to
GAVI
3.1     The new World Bank Group strategy highlights the need for stronger
alignment between the Bank Group’s global engagements and the twin goals of
eliminating extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity.1 This is not a new
issue for the Bank Group. Successive Bank strategy documents and IEG evaluations
have stressed the need for effective operational linkages between partnership
programs and Bank country operations.2 The key issue is how well the Bank Group
aligns its global and regional engagements with its country-based model. How
effectively does the Bank capture potential synergies and linkages between global
and regional engagements to enhance development effectiveness at country level?

3.2   This chapter assesses the performance of the World Bank as a development
partner to GAVI at the country level. The chapter discusses the relevance of the
Bank to GAVI and vice versa and reviews the World Bank’s engagement in
immunization activities and related donor coordination at the country level.

3.3    The key finding is that the Bank has reduced its analytical, financial, and
policy dialogue engagement in immunization for a period beginning in 2008 until
recently, even though its expertise potentially could have improved development
outcomes. Although the relationship with GAVI has been constructive in countries
where there is engagement, in many countries the Bank is no longer involved in
immunization in any substantive manner. IEG country visits and interviews with
sector staff from inside and outside the Bank suggest that the Bank has opportunities
to bring its expertise on health systems, health financing, and health equity to bear
on countries’ immunization subsectors in a manner that would be highly
complementary to GAVI’s support. For the Bank, its collaboration with GAVI, or
lack thereof, exemplifies a case of opportunities for stronger linkages between a
major global partnership and its country programs.

Opportunities for Stronger Development Effectiveness in Immunization
3.4     GAVI provides extensive vaccine and related support but this support does
not cover all aspects of a country’s immunization needs, in part because the GAVI
Secretariat by design has no country-level presence and relies heavily on its partners
in the country.3 Policy dialogue, technical assistance, and operational support that
might help countries reap the full benefits of immunization and ensure sustainable
financing of vaccines have been left to partners (often UNICEF and WHO). Reliable
data on immunization coverage that can help advance policy dialogue on health
equity is not always available, as seen for example in Ethiopia; the GAVI Secretariat
and its partners have no mechanism to identify and remedy such deficiencies.


                                                                                    21
                                                                              CHAPTER 3
                                                    THE WORLD BANK AS A GOVERNANCE BANK

Partners operate with their own mandates and priorities that, naturally, do not
necessarily align with those of GAVI or seek to fill gaps in GAVI’s country support.4
The result is a risk to the development effectiveness of all partners. GAVI is not
unique: other major global programs such as the GEF and the Global Fund also
operate without country offices and have set up their own mechanisms to
coordinate dialogue and investments in-country (Box A.2 in Annex A).

3.5    There is a strong perception among senior GAVI staff interviewed for this
review that re-engagement with the World Bank would be beneficial. UNICEF and
WHO are GAVI country-level partners. Among other things, UNICEF procures
vaccines, provides some operational assistance (for example with vaccine
distribution), advocates for children’s issues, and offers some limited assistance for
health systems development. WHO is the technical agency in the field. However,
WHO and UNICEF do not always have routine policy dialogue with ministries of
finance. GAVI perceives that the Bank could add value, particularly in financial
sustainability and health systems strengthening, because of its institutional
knowledge, relationships with ministries of finance, and the perception that it can be
a lender of last resort.

3.6   IEG concurs, finding that the status quo (until at least recently) leaves
potential organizational synergies untapped. As argued in the following, there is
room for greater development results via stronger Bank involvement in:

        Helping to ensure adequate and sustainable funding for immunization.
        Addressing the serious inequities in access to immunization faced by many
         low- income countries.
        Improving donor coordination in health in order to reduce transaction costs
         and avoid creating overlapping reporting and accounting requirements for
         client countries.

Opportunities to Help Ensure Adequate and Sustainable Funding for
Immunization
3.7    GAVI’s Co-financing Policy–which the Bank helped to develop and which
came into effect in December 2008–is a vital part of GAVI’s sustainability strategy,
requiring countries to co-finance the cost of most GAVI-supported vaccines.5 The
policy’s objective is to prepare countries for financial sustainability when GAVI
support for new vaccines ends and to encourage country ownership of vaccine
financing. The degree of co-finance depends on countries’ income levels, and
countries with GNI per capita above US$1,570 are no longer eligible to receive GAVI
support. Between January 2011 and August 2013, co-financing payments from
beneficiary countries totaled US$125 million, representing 8 percent of GAVI’s total
vaccine support to the co-financing countries.6



22
CHAPTER 3
THE WORLD BANK AS A GOVERNANCE BANK

3.8    Although co-financing has supported country ownership of immunization
decisions, evidence is sparse that the policy has contributed to creating a stable and
predictable financial framework for immunization, particularly for low-income
countries. There is a substantial risk that graduating countries may fail to sustain the
financial investment in immunization and the performance of immunization
programs after GAVI’s support ends. In 2012, two graduating countries, Angola and
the Republic of Congo, failed to fulfill their co-financing commitments to GAVI (a
situation known as “default”). In both countries the problem was weak budgetary
and planning capacity rather than the availability of fiscal space.7

3.9     GAVI is concerned to ensure that graduating countries can sustain their
immunization programs after graduation, particularly as GAVI’s external
evaluations have prominently highlighted issues around the financial sustainability
of vaccines, concluding “that GAVI’s choice of vaccines has not in practice been
based on realistic considerations of the potential of low-income countries to take on
the financing of these vaccines after GAVI support comes to an end.”8 IEG country
visits also confirmed that sustainable funding for the GAVI-supported vaccine
program could be questionable after graduation, for example in Ghana, Nepal, and
Tajikistan. Some graduating countries (currently 20 countries with Gross National
Income (GNI) per capita above US$ 1,570 as of April 2014) may not be able to
continue financing the vaccines using domestic resources and would stop to provide
them. Such “defaults”—as GAVI terms them—jeopardize the public health benefits
of GAVI programs since vaccines obviously have to be provided on an ongoing
basis. There may also be implications for GAVI’s resource mobilization efforts.

3.10 In Tajikistan, for example, immunization is under-financed by the government,
highly dependent on donors, and lacking political support. The government covers
12.5 percent of immunization costs and relies heavily on international donor
contributions. The world’s largest polio outbreak in 2010 raised serious concerns
about the weakness of routine immunization services and reliability of reported
coverage, highlighting the country’s shortcomings in vaccine management and
equity issues. The Bank has conducted some relevant analytical work on
immunization through a health expenditure tracking study and provided moderate
financing for immunization up to 2008. In recent years, immunization has been a
marginal priority for the Bank. Development partners are presently unsure of
Tajikistan’s ability to finance immunization and the Bank has considered
immunization largely as GAVI’s responsibility. But there has been no dialogue and
little engagement between GAVI and the government on strategy, financing, and
sustainability of immunization. IEG was informed that policy dialogue on the role of
immunization in the national development agenda and how to finance
immunization has not occurred.

                                                    THE WORLD BANK AS A GOVERNANCE BANK

3.11 GAVI is increasing its attention to sustainable funding for immunization and
has made it clear that it would like to see the Bank re-engage on fiscal sustainability
of vaccines, including via policy dialogue at the country level. GAVI would like the
Bank to help countries avoid defaults and ensure the sustainability of country
immunization programs. As far as IEG could discern, critical discussions about the
financial consequences of introducing new vaccines and the aggregate health-sector
finance issues rarely made it onto the GAVI Board agenda in the past, even though
as noted, the Bank had concerns. Sustainability issues are increasingly being
discussed as part of the strategy development for the next phase of GAVI.

3.12 The World Bank’s experience in dealing with health-sector financing might
have provided a critical assessment of GAVI’s current focus on the rapid
introduction of new but more expensive vaccines (in comparison to the traditional,
so-called Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) vaccines). Increases in the
overall health-sector budget (or re-allocation within the sector) may be required to
sustain the new vaccines. Additional economic and fiscal analyses of vaccine choice,
combined with policy dialogue, would have been warranted. Yet during the last five
years, the Bank’s engagement with GAVI on policy issues related to vaccine
sustainability and the consequences of GAVI’s programs and vaccine choices on
countries’ health sectors has been limited and occasional. For example, a Bank
managing director arranged a side meeting with a small number of African
Ministers of Finance to discuss sustainable financing for immunization during the
2012 Annual Meeting in Tokyo; GAVI indicated that they would like a follow-up to
the meeting.

3.13 The World Bank’s experience in dealing with questions of affordability and
fiscal sustainability at the country level, including in conducting public expenditure
reviews, would have been of great benefit to GAVI and graduating countries. IEG
was able to identify only a few studies on financial sustainability of vaccines
conducted by the Bank; IEG’s forthcoming evaluation of health-sector financing also
identifies limited Bank work on public expenditure tracking and fiscal space
analysis. GAVI has done some studies, paradoxically commissioning retired Bank
staff as consultants.

3.14 IEG feels that the timing is favorable for a dialogue about these issues as the
GAVI Secretariat is developing a strategy on how to better support graduating
countries.

Opportunities to Address Inequities in Immunization Access
3.15 There are serious inequities in access to immunization. For example, the gap
in Diptheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis (DTP) coverage between the top and the bottom
wealth quintile is 37 percentage points in Indonesia, 23 in Ethiopia, and 21 in Nepal



24
CHAPTER 3
THE WORLD BANK AS A GOVERNANCE BANK

according to National Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) data. Indonesia, for
example, considers immunization to be a health priority, yet immunization coverage
rates have remained stagnant around 75 percent for a decade. There is no regular
direct communication at the country level between the GAVI and Bank staff. Other
donors expressed regret about this, since enhanced collaboration would be mutually
beneficial.

3.16 The gaps are larger in low-income countries with low immunization rates.
These equity issues have been consistently raised by Civil Society Organizations
(CSOs), think tanks, and some bilateral donors.9 Consider Ethiopia: immunization is
highly inequitable between the highest and lowest income quintiles and between
regions. The Bank has supported immunization in ways that are broadly
complementary to GAVI’s program but does not engage directly with GAVI. Bank
support helps finance health worker salaries under Promoting Basic Services (PBS, a
multidonor operation, now in its third phase). This support is clearly enabling for
the immunization program. PBS I and II also financed some medical procurement. A
recently approved Program-for-Results operation uses immunization coverage as
one of its disbursement-linked indicators. Apart from this the Bank has little direct
engagement in immunization.

3.17 The equity discussion is often framed as a tradeoff between the introduction
of newer costly vaccines and equitable and affordable access to childhood
immunization (“is it appropriate to push newer costly vaccines when a large
percentage of the population is uncovered by the old ones?”). But such framing as a
simple tradeoff may be too narrow. Reaching marginalized groups with
immunizations poses serious organizational difficulties for many countries. The
problem is not about the availability of vaccines but rather about access to
vaccination services, a problem related to weak service delivery combined with the
impacts of inequality, social exclusion, and stratification. Slum dwellers, pastoral
and nomadic groups, and minorities experiencing social exclusion are often hard to
reach by health systems.

3.18 GAVI’s forthcoming strategic plan 2016-2020 intends to address these issues
by deepening GAVI’s focus on improving coverage and equity of access to
immunization. The Bank could provide analytical, policy dialogue, and other
support in addressing these issues, depending on country context. Doing so would
be consistent with the World Bank Group goal of shared prosperity and the Bank
Group strategy’s aim to strengthen the alignment of its global engagements with its
goals. The Bank’s engagement with GAVI should be in the context of equal partners
rather than a contractual relationship, grounded in independent analysis and
consistent with the Bank’s country-driven model. The Bank should be able to
deepen its dialogue on immunization where relevant and demanded, especially
when requested by clients countries, but it is unlikely that the Bank can commit to

contractual obligations to advocate on behalf of GAVI in its policy dialogue and
analytical work in specific countries; this would counter its mandate of providing
independent evidence-based advice to client governments.

Opportunities to Coordinate Support to Health and Immunization via Global Health
Partnerships
3.19 The proliferation of global health partnerships and vertical funds (of which
GAVI is one) has heightened concerns about aid effectiveness and led to renewed
attempts to improve donor coordination in health. Several global health mechanisms
for donor coordination have been set up: (a) the International Health Partnership
(IHP+), which was launched in September 2007 to accelerate progress in achieving
all the health-related MDGs in accordance with the principles of the Paris
Declaration and the Accra Agenda for Action (AAA); (b) Joint Assessment of
National Strategies (JANS), launched in July 2009; and (c) the Health Systems
Funding Platform (HSFP), launched in early 2010. A full assessment of these
frameworks falls outside the scope of this evaluation, but the Task Team Leader
(TTL) survey and country visits suggest that a good share of Bank-GAVI interaction
has taken place in the context of one of these frameworks. The HSFP was for some
time the most directly relevant for the Bank-GAVI relationship.10

3.20 The HSFP was instrumental for harmonizing financial management in the
health sector. It was used to assess strengths and weaknesses of financial
management and implement a joint program to strengthen financial management
systems and move toward joint fiduciary arrangements. Under the HSFP, the first
Guidelines for Joint Financial Management Assessments were produced, which
were used in Ethiopia and Sierra Leone. Nepal, a pilot country for HSFP, has
demonstrated that aid coordination can be successfully implemented when a
development partner (the Bank in the case of Nepal) takes a leadership role
spearheading the effort. HSFP has recently been subsumed into IHP+; the objectives
of HSFP are captured in IHP+ and its activities have become redundant. GAVI has
throughout been a consistent partner of the Bank in implementing financial
management harmonization.

3.21 Nepal was a pilot country for HSFP and it is the only country so far where the
HSFP has been implemented. Nepal has demonstrated that close donor coordination
can be achieved and that the SWAp provides a suitable mechanism to this effect,
using a “Joint Financing Agreement” (JFA) to pool funding from several donors,
including the Bank and GAVI. Five non-pooling partners, such as WHO and U.S.
Agency for International Development (USAID), have also signed the JFA which
provides a common reporting system. The HSPF has considerably lowered
transaction costs for both, the government and the partners and has provided stable
financing for immunization in politically difficult times.

Box 1. The International Health Partnership
IHP+ represents a group of partners working together to accelerate progress in achieving all
the health-related MDGs in accordance with the principles of the 2005 Paris Declaration on
Aid Effectiveness, 2008 Accra Agenda for Action, and the 2011 Busan Partnership
Agreement. IHP+ currently has 59 members, including developing and developed country
governments, development partners, and CSOs, involved in improving health and adhering
to the commitments in the IHP+ Global Compact.

IHP+ is intended to achieve better health results by mobilizing donor countries and other
development partners around a single country-led, national health strategy, by improving
coordination among actors, by strengthening health systems, by building momentum at the
national level for improving existing country-led health plans, and by financial management
harmonization and alignment. IHP+ is not a formal partnership program with a governing
body or legally binding agreement between the partners in relation to governance. Its
activities are coordinated by an interagency core team with WHO and Bank participation.

The Bank’s Limited Engagement in Immunization
3.22 As argued above, Bank engagement, technical expertise, and participation in
donor coordination could potentially enhance the development effectiveness of
immunization and complement GAVI’s financial support for vaccines. Yet the
reality on the ground is not a vibrant Bank program, but rather one of limited
engagement in immunization, both in lending and other areas.

3.23 The World Bank has provided approximately US$ 2.91 billion for “child
health” between FY2003 and FY2012 through health-sector specific and multisectoral
programs to reach the MDGs and assist people in developing countries to create
healthy futures. The World Bank shares with the global health community the
collective goals of universal childhood immunization and strengthening health
systems.11

3.24 In the decade from 2003 to 2012, the Bank approved 390 projects with
substantial engagement in health, of which 36 projects had an immunization-related
objective or component (Table 2). Most projects with immunization objectives or
components (18 of the 36) are HSS projects that contain immunization as an element
of the general system support. In terms of internal organization, these immunization
operations were largely mapped to the Health, Nutrition, and Population (HNP)
sector board and span both investment credits and development policy operations.
Direct financing of immunization was largely restricted to seven polio projects. In
addition, five conditional cash transfer projects mapped to Social Protection
reflected immunization objectives. And six projects mapped to the Poverty

3.25 The number of broadly immunization-related projects has been very limited
in the Bank’s health-related lending, comprising 9 percent of all projects and 13
percent of projects mapped to HNP. Lending increased slightly in 2008 and
decreased gradually since then. Immunization as a share of total approved health
projects dropped from 15 percent in 2006 to less than 5 percent in 2012 ( Figure 8).
Whereas the number of HNP projects declined over that time span, immunization
disappeared entirely from projects managed by other sector boards. Over this time
period, the Africa Region (AFR) had the largest number of immunization-related
operations followed by Latin America and the Caribbean Region (LCR) and South
Asia Region (SAR). There were very few immunization operations in the Middle
East and North Africa Region (MNA), and most immunization operations in SAR
focused on polio (Figure 9). A considerable number of Bank operations focused on
middle-income countries that were not GAVI eligible, especially in Latin America
and the East Asia and Pacific Region (EAP) (Figure 9).

3.26 The Bank’s engagement in polio has been substantial and timely, committing
US$779 million for vaccines and program support to key problem countries of the
Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) (Table 3). In Nigeria and Pakistan, this
was financed largely through buy-down options by the Gates Foundation. This
funding was supportive but outside the direct GAVI mandate, as GAVI has so far
been helping countries to expand routine childhood immunization, including

limited provision of oral polio vaccine (OPV). Recently, however, the GAVI Board
approved support for the introduction of Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) to bring
GPEI to a successful conclusion. This vaccine will be added to routine childhood
immunization for 73 GAVI-eligible and graduating countries, constituting a
significant change to GAVI’s mandate. This may decrease the need for Bank funding
for polio.

LIMITED BANK-GAVI COUNTRY-LEVEL ENGAGEMENTS
3.27 The Bank has gradually refocused its attention and priority away from
immunization in policy dialogue and investment since the creation of GAVI. Project
documents, country assistance strategies a survey of TTLs (Box 2), searches for
analytical work, and IEG’s country visits all indicate a limited Bank focus on
immunization in recent years (apart from polio). The Bank has been far less involved
with GAVI-supported activities at the country level than it has with the Global
Fund, despite the fact that immunization is at the core of any public health program.

3.28 IEG is not aware of any conscious Bank decision to withdraw from
immunization lending and other support. Declining lending for immunization could
be viewed as a natural consequence of the advent of relatively generous GAVI
funding and a rational division of labor; however, this does not explain the decline
in other types of Bank support for immunization and related HSS needs.

3.29 While no single causal reason can be identified, several factors could have
limited the Bank’s engagement with GAVI-supported activities, including:

           Lack of a GAVI counterpart in-country. Bank health-sector staff do not have
            an in-country GAVI counterpart to engage with. GAVI has country
            responsible officers to assist countries with immunization and development
            issues but they are based in Geneva.

           Limited Bank participation in sub-sector coordination. The key coordinating
            mechanism for immunization services at the country level is the Interagency
            Coordination Committees (ICC), usually chaired by the Ministry of Health
            (MOH). Its membership includes development partners and organizations
            involved in immunization activities. According to interviews with Bank and
            GAVI staff, country health officials, and development partners, the number of
            countries in which the Bank actively participates in the ICC has substantially
            decreased to only a few countries presently. Anecdotal evidence suggests that
            Bank staffers have shifted their focus and time away from attending ICC
            meetings to other priorities in the health sector.

           Absence of written guidelines and directives for Bank staff on how to engage
            with GAVI.

           A perception that GAVI takes care of immunization and that the Bank can
            focus on other priorities in the health sector.

           next section).

DIRECT BANK-GAVI TRUST FUND COLLABORATION HAS CEASED
3.30 There had been direct funding between the Bank and GAVI, flowing in both
directions, but this has now ceased. Initially from 2001 to 2007, the Bank contributed
US$8 million through its Development Grant Facility (DGF) to set up the GAVI
Secretariat; it also helped implement certain GAVI activities (Table 6). From 2002 to
2006, the Dutch government provided an additional US$8.9 million in financial
support through a Bank-executed trust fund for activities related to GAVI.

3.31 Subsequently, the resource flows changed as GAVI provided US$10 million
in direct funding to the Bank’s country work on HSS through the Immunization and
GAVI (ImGAVI) Trust Fund which was set up in 2007 but discontinued in 2011. The
US$10 million ImGAVI Trust Fund was set up with funding from GAVI and housed
at the Bank to finance Bank work on strengthening the capacity of client countries’
health systems to deliver immunization and other health services in a sustainable
manner; accelerate the uptake and use of underused and new vaccines and
associated technologies; improve vaccine supply security; and increase the
predictability and sustainability of long-term financing for national immunization
programs. The Administration Agreement stipulates that the Bank should provide
an annual report on the activities financed by ImGAVI. IEG, however, was unable to
locate any such progress reports and it appears that GAVI did not request them.

3.32 Judging from the grant reporting and monitoring documents—available for
30 of the total 46 ImGAVI activities—activities included technical assistance, studies
and workshops on strengthening the capacity of countries’ health workforce and
identification of critical gaps in child health services. The ImGAVI Trust Fund was
used to strengthen health systems broadly; activities were not necessarily
immunization-specific, but many activities related to child health. Most of the grants
supported HSS (67 percent) often related to immunization sector finance and human
resource management, which are areas of Bank comparative advantage. Twenty
percent of ImGAVI activities supported immunization while 13 percent of activities
were neither related to immunization nor to HSS, such as a pilot community
nutrition project or hospital management strengthening (Figure 11).

3.33 IEG finds that the projects funded by the ImGAVI Trust Fund were used for
meaningful country activities to strengthen health systems to deliver immunization

and maternal and child health services. But the activities did not fulfill many of the
broader, rather ambitious objectives which the initial trust fund work plan set out to
achieve. These objectives were: to support efforts to create a healthy vaccine market,
undertake relevant analysis and policy dialogue on underused and new vaccines,
and increase the predictability of national financing for immunization through
analysis and dialogue with governments. It also seems that the initial 2007 work
plan was not updated on a yearly basis as had been envisioned at the outset.

3.34 In 2011, the Bank’s HNP department in consultation with legal counsel
concluded that being a recipient of direct GAVI funding through the ImGAVI Trust
Fund while being a voting member of the GAVI Alliance Board comprised a conflict
of interest; subsequently, the Bank decided to stop accepting funds from GAVI and
closed the Trust Fund.12 However, WHO and UNICEF continue to be recipients of
GAVI funding and are managing the potential conflicts of interest. Both
organizations provide technical assistance and critical services for GAVI in line with
their institutional mandates and capabilities.13 In IEG’s view, potential conflicts of
interest could have been handled in other ways than by closing the ImGAVI Trust
Fund. There is little doubt that this decision has contributed to an uneasy
relationship between the two organizations. In IEG’s experience, based on review of
many partnership programs with shared governance, institutional conflicts of
interest are common and unavoidable in partnership programs where key partners
routinely perform multiple roles (in GAVI, the Bank is a voting board member,
financial partner, development partner engaged in immunization and HSS at
country and global level, and, at different points in time, trust fund donor and
recipient). The solution is not to shy away from multiple and potentially conflicted
roles; rather, conflicts of interest should be transparently disclosed, and if possible
resolved at the governance level.

Box 2. Major Findings from Survey of World Bank TTLs
An electronic survey was administered in April-May 2013 to 112 Task Team Leaders (TTLs)
of Bank-supported health projects during the period 2006-2012, in which there was an
immunization component, ImGAVI Trust Fund activities, and either “child health” or
“health systems performance” was listed as a theme. The response rate was rather low, as is
often the case: 24 TTLs responded to the survey. Results should therefore be considered
indicative and lacking of statistical precision. The TTLs who responded to the survey
covered projects in 47 countries, and 80 percent of the respondents indicated that GAVI was
active in the countries during the time period they were working in the countries. Among
the respondents, 16 TTLs worked on investment projects, and 13 worked on policy dialogue.

The Bank TTLs who responded to the survey considered the World Bank to be a high or
substantial partner of GAVI to a much greater extent at the global level than at the country
level. The majority of TTL respondents said that GAVI’s presence has not had any
consequences for the World Bank lending to the overall health sector, but some thought that
the World Bank lending for childhood immunization was lower than it would otherwise
have been. GAVI is viewed positively by survey respondents for its focus on low-income
countries and grant assistance. Survey respondents viewed GAVI’s most important
comparative advantages as (a) mobilizing donor resources for childhood immunization in
the short term; (b) building country-owned strategies for immunization; and (c) promoting
country-owned strategies for immunization. In contrast, GAVI’s least important
comparative advantages were seen as (a) promoting a results focus to development
assistance; (b) sustaining financial resources for childhood immunization over the long
term; and (c) lowering the transactions costs of development assistance from the point of
view of beneficiaries.
Most of the TTLs indicated there has been some degree of engagement between the two
organizations in the countries in which they were working, but that it was often confined to
information sharing or consultative more than direct, active collaboration. Bank TTLs
reported direct involvement (such as helping with country grant applications to GAVI,
support introduction of new vaccines, support for immunization activities under a Sector-
wide Approach (SWAp)) with GAVI in only four countries: Benin, Bolivia, Pakistan, and
Tanzania. While some felt that the engagement should have been closer, others found it
appropriate.

The survey results suggest (as does other evidence) that the country-level engagement
between the two organizations has primarily occurred within the donor coordination
framework (i.e. the Health Systems Funding Platform, IHP+, and SWAp), and through
studies and sector work financed by the ImGAVI Trust Fund. These frameworks have made
it easier for the World Bank to engage with GAVI at the country level. The World Bank
participated in the Interagency Coordination Committee (ICC) in only a few countries. This
extent of engagement between the two organizations is consistent with the findings from the
country missions in Ethiopia, Nepal, and Tajikistan.

COUNTRY VISITS ALSO FIND OPPORTUNITIES FOR STRONGER BANK ENGAGEMENT IN IMMUNIZATION
3.35 Findings from IEG visits to Ethiopia, Indonesia, Nepal, and Tajikistan, along
with discussions in Ghana, support the analysis and findings in this chapter
pointing to missed opportunities for stronger Bank engagement in immunization.
The countries visited were a purposeful sample based on the following (not
mutually exclusive) criteria: (a) countries that were pilot countries for the HSFP,
(b) countries to which the ImGAVI Trust Fund provided technical assistance, and (c)
countries where both GAVI and the World Bank have been active in the health
sector since GAVI was founded in the year 2000, and where prior desk reviews
indicated some engagement between GAVI and the World Bank.

3.36 The country visits focused on the Bank’s roles in GAVI and its engagement at
the country level. To supplement the breadth of information obtained from desk
reviews and interviews with TTLs at the Bank, the country visits provide in-depth
information in answering evaluation questions on sustainability, as well as
questions on the Bank’s performance as a development partner in the context of the
Bank’s 2007 Health Sector Strategy. As mentioned, this stated that the Bank “looks
forward to close collaboration in the implementation of country-led system
strengthening efforts and knowledge generation with global financing partners
including . . . GAVI,” and that “particularly on health systems, [the Bank] will
substantially increase its strategic engagement with WHO, the Global Fund, and
GAVI, particularly in low-income countries.”14

3.37 DTP3 coverage - a proxy for childhood immunization coverage - has
increased substantially in all countries. Yet equitable access to immunization
continues to be a problem, particularly in low-income countries such as Ethiopia and
Nepal. Limited co-financing for GAVI-provided vaccines was assured by all visited
countries, but preliminary discussions also indicated that the countries still expect
long-term donor support for the new more costly vaccines. Cross-cutting issues
from the country visits are summarized in Table 7 and mission findings are
described in Appendix E.

4. The Bank as a Governance Partner
4.1     This chapter reviews the World Bank’s roles in the governance of GAVI as an
example of how the Bank practices its corporate oversight and governance role in a
major partnership program. The Bank, along with UNICEF, WHO, and the Gates
Foundation, are founding partners who were instrumental in the setup and launch
of GAVI, and they still hold permanent seats with voting powers on the GAVI
Board.1 The Bank has worked to align the institutional interests between GAVI and
the Bank; brought its expertise to the partnership; participated in the committee that
oversaw GAVI’s governance reform in 2008; and managed potential conflicts of
interest. The chapter does not assess the overall effectiveness of the GAVI corporate
structures such as the GAVI Board and Secretariat.

4.2    The chapter finds that the Bank-GAVI relationship on governance issues has
diminished since 2008 and that staff in both organizations would like to see closer
Bank-GAVI cooperation. There have been unresolved tensions related, for example,
to perceived discrepancies in corporate priorities, concerns over the fiscal
implications of new vaccines, diluted influence of the Bank and other founding
partners, and a perception among some Bank staff that the Bank was at times treated
more like a contractor than a complementary partner.

Pre-governance Reform Period
4.3    From GAVI’s initial years until 2008-10, the World Bank was an active
participant in GAVI’s economic and financing strategies and was a member of
GAVI’s Financing Task Force (2000-2006) and co-chair of the Immunization
Financing and Sustainability Task Team (until 2010). The Bank helped with the
design and implementation of the co-financing policy. These roles were supported
by a dedicated Bank team housed in the HNP anchor unit. This team conducted
studies on financial sustainability, strategy implementation, immunization-related
HSS, and other topics of relevance to GAVI.

4.4   The Bank was also initially a small financial contributor to GAVI using the
DGF. Since DGF funds are not designated, they were used to support the
administrative costs of the GAVI Secretariat while it was hosted at UNICEF. As
mentioned in Chapter 2, the Bank has been the Treasury Manager of the IFFIm since
2006.

4.5    At its inception, GAVI was designed as an informal alliance of partners with
a shared mission and a small Secretariat hosted at UNICEF’s office in Geneva. At
GAVI’s inception, the governance structure was divided between the GAVI Alliance
on the programmatic side and the Vaccine Fund (later the GAVI Fund) on the
financial side (Table 8). The GAVI Fund was set up as a U.S. 501(c)(3) (nonprofit)


                                                                                     37

organization based in Washington, D.C., to allow tax-exempt donations from U.S.-
based donors and provide a legal personality to GAVI. There were differences in the
culture of the two Boards, with the “GAVI Alliance Board being consensus-driven
and cognizant of the political positions of Board members, while the Fund Board
embodied a culture that focused primarily on the final results.”2 Furthermore, there
were differences “in their approaches to financial sustainability, the extent GAVI
should support vaccine research, and strategic timeframes.”3

4.6   Under the reorganization, the old GAVI Board merged with the GAVI Fund
Board in October 2008 into what is now called the GAVI Alliance Board; the hosting
agreement with UNICEF was terminated, and GAVI became a legal entity in the
form of a Swiss Foundation located in Geneva.4 The nature of the partnership was
fundamentally altered.5

4.7    As an internal GAVI matter, it falls outside the scope of this review to assess
the necessity of the reform, but the Bank’s participation in it is of interest. It appears
the governance reform process was hasty, complex, and contentious: although
preparation of the reforms had been ongoing for some time, partners felt that they
were given only short time to select the new board structure from among six
different options.6 Some issues around the change in GAVI’s legal status and new
governance arrangements proved very consequential and controversial. For the
Bank and the other multilateral partners, the reorganization gave rise to issues
regarding the number and allocation of voting board seats, concerns regarding
dilution of influence, their role in the new entity, and some legal concerns


38
CHAPTER 4
THE WORLD BANK AS A GOVERNANCE PARTNER

surrounding their participation as board members in a Foundation governed by
Swiss law rather than international law which normally governs the multilaterals.
The question for the Bank is how effectively its contributions to GAVI’s governance
reform served its development objectives, whether the Bank team received adequate
support and guidance, and whether its participation in the process invited
reputational risks. IEG is not able to draw clear conclusions on these questions, in
part because the Bank’s written records are rather silent on the reform process,
suggesting a need to better document the Bank’s contributions to global program’s
governance. Moreover, as emphasized before by IEG, the Bank lacks corporate
guidelines to inform its contributions to governance of global partnership
programs.7

Post-governance Reform Period
4.8     The new 2008 GAVI Board hybrid structure is uncommon and has had the
effect of diluting the voting influence of the founding partners. Two-thirds of the 28
board members are constituency-determined and one-third are independent
individuals (neither stakeholders nor shareholders—an uncommon feature in global
development partnership organizations). The three founding multilateral partners
representing the traditional “Alliance” element of GAVI – UNICEF, WHO, and the
World Bank — are now represented by three out of 28 votes, whereas
representatives of the private pharmaceutical sector have two votes (Figure 12).

4.9    Although the governance reforms might well have been necessary and
contributed to GAVI’s subsequent growth, the reorganization gave rise to concerns
among the founding partners, including the Bank. As also noted in an evaluation of


                                                                                    39
CHAPTER 4
THE WORLD BANK AS A GOVERNANCE PARTNER

GAVI, some partners became less involved in policy development and felt a reduced
sense of ownership in the Alliance, as it evolved from an informal partnership
hosted at UNICEF to a more formal and independent corporate identity. IEG
interviews also highlighted that the change in legal personality (from informal
partnership based on international law to a foundation governed by Swiss law) and
related corporate governance arrangements resulted in considerable discussions and
concerns among the legal departments of WHO, UNICEF, and the Bank; these
organizations are used to being represented on boards in partnerships governed by
international law with the associated privileges and immunities, while Board
membership governed by national law entails a different set of risks and
obligations.8 Moreover, Bank staff are bound by the Bank’s articles of agreement to
have sole and entire duty to the Bank. And they can only sit on partnership
programs’ boards in their Bank capacity, not in their individual capacity. In contrast,
domestic law generally assigns board members a personalized fiduciary duty
toward the legal entity they help govern. Hence the legal concerns about GAVI’s
reorganization: In the view of the legal department, it is ultimately a better fit for the
Bank to be part of an informal partnership governed by international law than a
corporate partnership governed by domestic law.

4.10 But it is unusual for the Bank to be a voting member in a partnership such as
GAVI where it is not a financial contributor. In practice, the Bank is only a voting
member of the governing bodies of those Financial Intermediary Fund (FIF)-
supported programs in which it has also been a financial contributor, by means of
annual grants from the DGF.9 At the inception of GAVI, there was a DGF grant, but
at the time of the reorganization this grant had long closed.

4.11 GAVI has de facto shifted from an informal partnership to a corporate model.
The GAVI Secretariat changed and grew in size after the reorganization. Staff
increased from about 20 in 2005 to over 200 today. The Secretariat has become an
effective independent organization, operating like a corporation. It has advanced
marketing and advocacy capabilities but limited presence at the country level.
Partners report a strong perception that the initial collaborative partnership
dimension has faded and that the model has become more Secretariat-driven.

4.12 Tensions between the partners’ corporate priorities arose in the years since
2008. GAVI and the World Bank continue to share a mission “to save children’s lives
and protect people’s health by increasing access to immunization in poor
countries.”10 However, GAVI has expressed its mandate with increased emphasis
and attention to a categorical objective, namely to accelerate immunization. In
contrast, the multilateral development organizations all have broader mandates in
comprehensive and balanced health-sector development. Many Bank staff
interviewed for this evaluation expressed concern over the cost implications of
GAVI’s singular focus on new vaccine expansion for country’s health systems, and


40
CHAPTER 4
THE WORLD BANK AS A GOVERNANCE PARTNER

GAVI has more recently renewed its emphasis on vaccine cost reductions (“market
shaping”).

4.13 Membership and participation in GAVI’s governing bodies (Box 3) offers the
Bank many opportunities to contribute to GAVI’s governance but has not been
sufficient to resolve the issues described in this review. Interviews with Bank and
GAVI staff members recalled greater interaction between the two organizations
during GAVI’s early period, and that engagement at the corporate level waned after
the governance reform in 2008. It is conceivable that GAVI required less support
from the Bank as it matured, but various tensions described below also contributed.


Box 3. The World Bank’s Participation in GAVI Board Committees
The World Bank is a member of the GAVI Alliance Board and manages the financial
platform for the AMC and is the treasury manager for the IFFIm, two innovative financing
instruments central to GAVI’s funding. In addition, the Bank is presently a member of the
following GAVI Board committees:
     The Executive Committee makes time-sensitive decisions that allow the GAVI
       Alliance to function between Board meetings.
     The Program and Policy Committee is the main advisory body to the Board on all
       GAVI program areas.
     The Audit and Finance Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight
       responsibilities in respect to the accounting, financing, budgeting, and financial
       practices by reviewing financial information to be reported to GAVI donors and
       others, evaluating GAVI’s systems of internal controls, and overseeing the audit
       process.

GAVI’s Evolving Strategy and Relationship with the Bank
4.14 GAVI was initially established with the primary objective to save children’s
lives and protect people’s health by increasing access to immunization in poor
countries, thereby achieving the MDG for child health, making it closely aligned
with the Bank’s goals. But after 2008, GAVI’s strategy was increasingly focused on
the technology aspects of its mandate that is, accelerating the introduction of new
(but also more costly) vaccines in developing countries. In this period, GAVI was
perceived by observers to have lessened its focus on the other strategic goals (see
Box4). This change in emphasis of GAVI’s corporate goals has been supported by
several of GAVI’s major stakeholders, in particular the Gates Foundation, the
pharmaceutical industry, and WHO; it has diminished but not eliminated the
alignment of corporate priorities between the Bank and GAVI.

4.15 For example, GAVI added the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccine, which
protects female adolescents from cervical cancer to its vaccine portfolio. And in June


                                                                                        41
CHAPTER 4
THE WORLD BANK AS A GOVERNANCE PARTNER

2013, GAVI decided to support polio eradication by introducing the IPV as well as to
consider vaccines for malaria and cholera programs.11 These vaccines are
administered to all age groups, marking a departure from GAVI’s focus on
childhood immunization. The potentially large recurrent cost implications for the
recipient countries were not discussed at the Board meeting where this decision was
made.


Box 4. GAVI’s Phases and Strategies
Phase I (2000-06): GAVI concentrated on two primary areas:
          Supply of new and underused vaccines;
          Strengthening vaccine delivery systems
Phase II (2007-10): GAVI had four strategic goals:
          Contribute to strengthening the capacity of the health system to deliver
           immunization and other health services in a sustainable manner;
          Accelerate the uptake and use of underused and new vaccines and associated
           technologies and improve vaccine supply security;
          Increase the predictability and sustainability of long-term financing for national
           immunization programs; and
          Increase and assess the added value of GAVI as a public-private global health
           partnership through improved efficiency, increased advocacy, and continued
           innovation.
Phase III (2011-15): GAVI’s has four goals:
          Accelerate the uptake and use of underused and new vaccines;
          Contribute to strengthening the capacity of integrated health systems to deliver
           immunization;
          Increase the predictability of global financing and improve the sustainability of
           national financing for immunization;
           Shape vaccine markets.

4.16 The alignment of the mandates and priorities of the Bank and GAVI has
diminished over time but not disappeared. As a multilateral development
organization, the Bank has broad and comprehensive roles in the health sector, as
contrasted to GAVI’s singular categorical role. The Bank became a partner and
founding member of GAVI in 2000, at a time when immunization funding was in
decline and gains made in childhood immunization since the 1970’s were
threatened. At the time, GAVI was seen as aligned with the goals and mandates of
the Bank at global and country level. The GAVI partnership would help achieve the
MDGs related to child health, complementing Bank country programs. This
alignment was the basis for the Bank’s special effort to establish IFFIm and the


42
CHAPTER 4
THE WORLD BANK AS A GOVERNANCE PARTNER

AMC, providing GAVI with sufficient and stable financial resource flows. Although
the Bank’s corporate priorities (such as access to services for the most vulnerable
populations, health systems development, and sustainable health-sector finance) are
complementary to GAVI’s mission, in practice they do not always align with GAVI’s
emphasis on making new vaccines available as quickly as possible, especially where
these vaccines entail large recurrent cost implications.

4.17 Bank staffers have a perception that there has been limited time for discussion
and critical questions at GAVI Board and committee meetings. The lack of
discussion about vaccine choice in the larger context of public health and
development priorities, combined with the Bank’s decision not to accept further
funding from GAVI and take on specific obligations in GAVI’s Strategy and
Business plan (see below), negatively affected the Bank-GAVI relationship. The
Bank’s health-sector staff, partner agency staff, and other people interviewed by IEG
report a perception that it caused the Bank to “withdraw” from GAVI. Others
describe that the Bank became cautious in its engagement with GAVI at the global
and governance level. IEG did not see evidence that the factors contributing to
lessened alignment between the Bank and GAVI have been transparently
discussed.12

4.18 The degree of specificity of the Bank’s contributions to GAVI became a source
for tension. In 2010, the GAVI Secretariat developed the Strategy and Business Plan
2011-15, which attempted to detail the specific responsibilities and available budget
for the different partners and sought to request detailed, activity-based reporting to
the GAVI Secretariat. The Bank declined to participate.13 In the Bank’s view, GAVI
was in danger of transitioning from being an alliance of equal partners to a
corporate organization in which contractors provide services to and on behalf of the
GAVI Secretariat. GAVI staff expressed disappointment that the Bank was unwilling
to take on these specific obligations and reaffirmed that accountability for
deliverables is a condition for funding.14 In IEG’s opinion, very specific and
prescriptive semi-contractual responsibilities are usually not the best way to manage
a partnership of this nature and to deliver development results in complex and
changing circumstances; hence the Bank’s declining had merit.

4.19 The consequence of all of this is that, for a period, areas of mutual concern
were not addressed. GAVI’s operational staff expressed concern about the financial
sustainability of immunization programs as countries get wealthier and graduate
from GAVI support, sometimes without appropriate budgetary allocations for
immunization. GAVI’s Secretariat expressed to the IEG a desire for Bank
involvement in addressing this issue with ministries of finance. Likewise, Bank
health-sector staffers have expressed concern about the financial sustainability of the
broader health sector, including immunization programs, at the country level, and
potential distortions of the public health-sector finance.


                                                                                     43
CHAPTER 4
THE WORLD BANK AS A GOVERNANCE PARTNER

4.20 Engagement in policy dialogue at the corporate level has increased recently
as the Bank has been involved in shaping GAVI’s next strategy phase for 2016-2020,
in addition to engaging in other areas of mutual concern, such as strengthening
supply chain, resource mobilization, and financial sustainability.

Lessons for Future Engagement with GAVI and other Partnership Programs
4.21 IEG would support efforts to revitalize Bank support for immunization and
to reengage with GAVI. The Bank’s partnership with GAVI needs to be managed
around the evolving global health priorities, the Bank’s and GAVI’s corporate
priorities, and the changing international aid architecture for health. Immunization
is important for public health, and the GAVI partnership is crucial.

4.22 The Bank needs to have strong internal support and dedicate staff resources
to support such a complex partnership. In the beginning, a dedicated Bank staff of
four professionals supported GAVI and worked hard to ensure GAVI’s success. But
Bank staff working on the GAVI partnership has not been replaced, although as
mentioned it is conceivable that GAVI required less support from the Bank as the
organization matured. However, internal Bank funding for supporting partnership
programs has become very limited, and the effectiveness of partnership support has
diminished (Figure 13). Internal Bank budget decisions have reduced funding for
GAVI-related activities. The relationship with GAVI is managed by the Bank’s HNP
department. Its budget started to decline around 2006. This also meant that fewer
resources were available for GAVI activities. The department spent US$78,000
(including staff time) in 2012 on GAVI-related activities, down from an average of
about US$140,000 annually in earlier years.15

4.23 At the same time it is critical that both the Bank and GAVI provide structured
support and organizational guidance for staff to navigate the partnership
complexities. Actual and potential conflicts of interest and differences in policy
priorities are common in complex partnerships and need to be transparently
discussed, rather than allowed to linger. Institutional resolution of the issues
affecting the Bank-GAVI partnership may entail a review and adjustment of the
World Bank’s multiple roles in GAVI, including its governance, financing, and as a
country and global partner.

4.24 The new World Bank Group strategy admits that “there has been little focus
on corporate management of partnership programs,” and highlights the “need for
more strategic decision-making around which partnerships to take on, what
partnership programs to host, what roles the Bank Group should play, what type(s)
of financing mechanism(s) to use, and when and how exits should be considered,”
and that “institutional responsibilities for oversight of partnership programs across
the Bank Group need to be clarified.”16 The findings in this review and other Global



                                                                                               45
CHAPTER 4
THE WORLD BANK AS A GOVERNANCE PARTNER

Program Reviews support the above diagnostic. The Bank-GAVI relationship has
been allowed to diminish for a substantial period of time, not so much because of
any conscious decision but more because tensions went unresolved. Some of these
tensions can be traced back to a major reform of GAVI governance to which the
Bank contributed. These lessons imply a need for more formal corporate review and
decision-making at key decision points, including when setting up a new
partnership program, when reforming its governance, and when making decisions
about where to host it.




46
5. Conclusions and Lessons
5.1    The new World Bank Group strategy aims to align regional and global
engagements with the World Bank Group twin goals and notes that “global
engagements represent an important opportunity for the Bank Group to make an
impact on development, but this rapidly growing role also places additional
demands on the World Bank Group that it must ensure are aligned with the goals.”1
This review finds that the Bank Group has some way to go to ensure successful
alignment and development results from its engagement in major partnership
programs.

5.2    The GAVI Alliance is by all accounts a successful and well-funded
partnership program supporting childhood immunization, a core element of any
public health system. GAVI is highly regarded and considered well-managed. GAVI
has attracted US$8.4 billion from a diverse range of public, private, and foundation
donors since 2000, becoming the third largest multilateral in health. Judging from its
evaluations, GAVI has been successful in bringing together key stakeholders in
global immunization, increasing the profile of immunization in national and
international health agendas, and raising the public’s awareness of vaccines as a
cost-effective intervention in poor countries.

5.3     The World Bank, together with UNICEF, WHO, and the Gates Foundation, is
one of the founding Alliance partners and has made outstanding contributions to
GAVI and thereby to childhood immunization in low-income countries. At its
inception in 2000, GAVI was designed as an informal alliance of partners with a
shared mission and with UNICEF hosting a small secretariat. In 2008, GAVI changed
its organization and legal personality and became a Swiss foundation.2 The change
marked a consequential shift in culture and operating modalities toward a corporate
model, with an accompanying rapid growth in the Secretariat. GAVI continues to
rely heavily on WHO for policy and country support, and on UNICEF for HSS and
vaccine procurement, yet the essential contribution of the key partners is publicly
less visible, and the Alliance dimension of the partnership has somewhat faded.

5.4    The World Bank is deeply engaged with GAVI in three different contexts: at
the financial level by setting up and running two innovative financing mechanisms;
the country level as development partner; and at the corporate level in the
governance of GAVI.3

5.5    Financial engagement: The Bank’s most significant contribution to GAVI is
the establishment and management of two innovative financing mechanisms, IFFIm
and AMC, contributing a third of GAVI’s financial resources from 2000 to 2010. To
operationalize these instruments required the Bank to assume financial risk, develop
new systems, and make a long-term commitment. The Bank’s financial relationship

                                                                                    47
CHAPTER 5
CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS
with GAVI and IFFIm has been highly competent and professional, if perhaps
underappreciated. The Bank provided excellent execution that successfully
translated conceptual innovations in development finance (IFF and AMC) into
viable pilot mechanisms that have helped finance GAVI’s rapidly expanding budget.

5.6    The Bank assumed a direct balance sheet risk on behalf of AMC and used its
excellent credit rating to place IFFIm bonds. The Bank reviewed these challenges at
the Board level and worked consistently to launch and implement these innovative
financial vehicles. As the treasury manager for IFFIm, the Bank successfully
managed problems caused by the credit downgrade of the two key donors. The
Bank’s relationship with GAVI as treasury manager for IFFIm has been professional,
despite the complicated governance structure of IFFIm.

5.7    Engagement at country level: The relationship with GAVI has been collegial
and constructive in countries where there is engagement, but in many countries the
Bank has little direct involvement in immunization. The Bank has de facto “left the
immunization subsector to GAVI.” IEG considers this a missed opportunity on the
analytical side. While direct vaccine support is fully covered by GAVI, the Bank, as a
trusted partner at the country level, could add significant value on issues of
immunization analytical work, policy and strategy, particularly on ensuring
sustainability and equitable access to immunization, and in investments in health
systems strengthening (HSS). These are areas of Bank comparative advantage that
other partners do not systematically cover.

5.8    Aid coordination efforts such as Joint Assessments of National Strategies and
the now defunct Health Systems Funding Platform (HSFP) to harmonize reporting
systems have been initiated in several countries. These efforts can work if pursued
with determination, as the example of Nepal shows. The Bank and GAVI should
continue to seek opportunities in additional countries for better aid coordination in
the context of IHP+ to alleviate cumbersome reporting mechanisms and reduce
transaction costs.

5.9    Governance: The mandates and priorities of the Bank and GAVI were
mutually relevant and compatible at GAVI’s inception, and relationships were
excellent with the Bank providing extensive support. Interactions between the two
organizations diminished for a substantial period of time after GAVI’s
reorganization for two reasons: First, there was a perceived discrepancy between the
Bank’s broader development objectives focusing on HSS, equitable access to
services, and fiscal sustainability, and GAVI’s focused approach on accelerating
introduction of new (and sometimes costly) vaccines in low-income countries.
Second, the governance reform diminished the influence of the founding partners
and led to concerns about handing control to an entity that might not be fully
aligned with the Bank’s priorities and that, at times, appeared to treat the Bank as a


48
                                                     CHAPTER 5 CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS


contractor more than a complementary partner. The non-renewal of the ImGAVI
Trust Fund by the Bank, citing conflicts of interest, is a telling example.

5.10 Unfortunately, these issues have not been transparently discussed and
reviewed at the corporate level between the Bank and GAVI.

Lessons for the Bank’s relationship with GAVI and other partnership programs.
5.11 The central lesson for the Bank’s relationship with GAVI is the need to
discuss, update, and re-affirm the principal partnership arrangements to reflect the
changing realities in which both partners operate. The 2008 governance reform
profoundly changed the governance structure, and with it the dynamics of the
relationship. The Bank has not, to IEG’s knowledge, reviewed what if any
consequences the governance reform should have for its own contributions to
GAVI’s governance; for example, it might be warranted to review whether the Bank
should change its status from voting member to observer.

5.12 A second lesson is to manage governance of partnership programs more
proactively and systematically, particularly during initial setup and reform. GAVI’s
governance reform in 2008 was essential but had unforeseen consequences for the
relationship between GAVI and the Bank. Rather than promote efforts to resolve the
issues, the Bank kept a cautious distance in its engagement with GAVI. As also
mentioned in the World Bank Group strategy, the Bank could benefit from
managerial oversight of how its major partnerships are governed. More robust
corporate attention to how major partnerships are governed and structured is
warranted and should be aligned with key decision points such as setup and
restructuring.

5.13 Third, the governance reform process which transformed GAVI from an
informal alliance hosted by UNICEF into a new independent Swiss foundation,
involved complex governance issues and legal concerns. The governance reform
process, in which the Bank participated at vice presidential-level, explored
organizational options. The choice of creating a new independent organization can
also create an expansionary institutional dynamic, as new organizations strive for
budget and recognition. The World Bank Group—and indeed the wider
international community—may want to carefully weigh the pros and cons of
creating new independent organizations versus housing partnerships in existing
organizations.

5.14 A fourth lesson is that the Bank’s competence and experience in concessional
development finance can be highly useful in future attempts to set up innovative
development finance on behalf of partners. The World Bank Group strategy aims to
leverage private-sector resources, partnerships, and innovative finance. The lessons
from the Bank’s work on behalf of GAVI for future endeavors is that the Bank

                                                                                     49

CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS
should: carefully consider if the short-term benefits of any innovative financial
mechanism justify the long-term consequences for the Bank and its partners; find
ways to maintain simple governance arrangements; and ensure adequate
recognition as well as reasonable protection against reputational risks associated
with its work on behalf of partners.

5.15 A fifth lesson is that clearer definition of roles and responsibilities at country
and global level could enhance the impact of the Bank, GAVI, and other
organizations’ support for immunization. The limited Bank involvement at the
country level in ensuring priority of immunization, equity of access, systems
support, sustainable financing of immunization, and donor coordination point to
missed opportunities for both the Bank and GAVI to improve their development
effectiveness. Selection of priority countries and an agreed and documented
understanding between the Bank and GAVI staff on division of labor and modes of
engagement would be helpful. This division of labor should be flexible and
acceptable to both partners; it should permit the Bank to pursue its comparative
advantages in policy dialogue and analytical work tailored to country contexts and
avoid restrictive contractual approaches.

5.16 Sixth, the Bank-GAVI experience is not unique: there are often missed
opportunities for stronger development results in the Bank’s engagements in
partnership programs. IEG’s synthesis report of global programs in 2011 found
strong operational linkages to the Bank’s country-level work in only four of 17
global programs reviewed. To remedy this, IEG has recommended a more explicit
definition of roles and accountabilities in partnership programs. IEG has also
recommended that the Bank put in place stronger coordination mechanisms
between partnership programs and the relevant sectors and empower its
representatives on program boards to work for the Bank’s corporate interests (the
Bank has yet to implement a proposal that staff serving on partnership boards be
guided by terms of reference that set out Bank-wide institutional positions). These
steps could help fulfill the World Bank Group strategy objective of closer alignment
between global engagements and Bank Group goals.

Appendix A. GAVI: Purpose, Contributions, and
Activities
1. GAVI was launched in 2000 as a partnership of public and private
organizations with a mission “to save children’s lives and protect people’s health by
increasing access to immunization in poor countries.”1 GAVI pools donor resources
to fund vaccine introduction programs, supports the development of new and
underused vaccines, and improves vaccine delivery by strengthening health
systems.

2. Described as the “quintessential informal public-private partnership,” GAVI was
designed as a casual alliance of partners with a shared mission and a small secretariat
based at the United Nations Children’s Fund’s (UNICEF) office in Geneva. This
public-private partnership is supposed to advance immunization access in poor
countries by maximizing each partner’s strengths in vaccine research; vaccine
procurement and delivery systems; health financing; and the vaccine market. The
private sector’s expected contributions to GAVI include researching and developing
vaccines that address the needs of developing countries, providing vaccine market
knowledge, expanding the number of vaccine suppliers, and securing
vaccine supplies.

3. GAVI started with a dual governance structure with GAVI on the
programmatic side and the Vaccine Fund (later called the GAVI Fund) on the
financial side.2 Over time, GAVI has become more formal with a more independent
secretariat in response to the increased number of responsibilities, programs, and the
large inflow of resources. A Governance and Reform Committee designed a change-
management plan in 2008 that took effect in January 2009, which merged the old
GAVI Board and the GAVI Fund Board into what is now called the GAVI Alliance
Board in October 2008. The new governance structure is intended to reflect the
strengths of public-private partnership by bringing together financial and
programmatic decision-making, streamlining accountabilities, and providing
operational efficiencies.3 Subsequently, administrative services were moved from
UNICEF to a new GAVI corporate secretariat.

4. The current GAVI Alliance Board is comprised of 28 seats and operates on the
basis of a “hybrid stakeholder-corporate” model. Permanent seats are held by the
Gates Foundation, World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, and the World
Bank. Aside from the four permanent members, Board representatives serve on a
time-limited basis. The Board is supported by five standing committees and one
advisory committee that oversee specific activities and the development of key
policies. The six committees are: Executive Committee, Program and Policy


                                                                                     51

Committee, Governance Committee, Investment Committee, Audit and Finance
Committee, and Evaluation Advisory Committee.

5.    The GAVI Secretariat, with offices in Geneva and Washington, D.C., is led by
the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) — currently Seth Berkley — and is supported by
six departments. The Secretariat is responsible for day-to-day operations, including
mobilizing resources, coordinating program approvals and disbursements,
developing policy, implementing strategic initiatives, monitoring and evaluation,
legal and financial management, and administration for the GAVI Alliance Board
and Committees.

6.    GAVI is funded by several mechanisms through direct contributions from
donor governments, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and private donations,
but also through three pilot, innovative financing mechanisms —International
Finance Facility for Immunisation (IFFIm), the pilot Advanced Market Commitment
(AMC) for pneumococcal vaccines and the GAVI Matching Fund. GAVI has
committed US$8.4 billion to 76 countries (from inception until August 31, 2013) and
has disbursed US$ 6.0 billion to over 70 countries (from inception until September
30, 2013). At the June 2011 London pledging conference, GAVI received further
pledges of US$4.3 billion from donor countries, the Gates Foundation, and other
private donors to fully finance operations during Phase III (2011–2015). World Bank
has been highly engaged in the establishment and management of IFFIm and the
AMC.

7.   Launched in 2006, IFFIm is an innovative financing mechanism, which GAVI and
the World Bank have pioneered. IFFIm raises funds from the international capital
markets by issuing bonds. IFFIm bonds have raised approximately US$3.6 billion since
the program’s inception and IFFIm has used the proceeds to fund GAVI programs.
IFFIm’s assets are long-term, legally binding grant agreements from sovereign donors.
The financial strength of IFFIm to repay the bonds is based on legally binding donor
payments over a period of up to 20 years. Donors have provided grants totaling over
US$6.2 billion to IFFIm (Table).

8.    A special legal entity registered in England and Wales as a company limited by
guarantee, the GAVI Fund Affiliate (GFA) was established to accept funds from pledge
agreements with sovereign donors and assigned these pledges to the IFFIm Company
to be securitized. GFA was established to keep IFFIm independent from the donors and
to safeguard GAVI’s tax-exempt status. In February 2013, GFA was removed from the
IFFIm structure in order to reduce costs and streamline operations, and GFA activities
have been transferred to IFFIm and GAVI. The GFA board initiated the process of
voluntary liquidation of GFA on March 28, 2013.4


Box A.1. Cost of IFFIm Management
The total projected operational costs over IFFIm’s lifetime are difficult to estimate as they
critically depend on future projected interest rates. The 2010 IFFIm external evaluation
estimated the lifetime cost of governance and treasury management as 4.1- 4.6 percent of
present value of then-current pledges. Essential running costs, such as directors insurance
for IFFIm Board members, legal advice, and treasury management fees are reasonable
amounting to US$5-6 million per year. Recent work by the Bank projects the cost to be closer
to the 8-10 percent range, when also taking into account the potential interest paid for
outstanding debt. This means that IFFIm’s management costs over the life of the facility
could amount to US$150-$340 million.

9.   The AMC was launched in June 2009 with a US$1.5 billion commitment from
donors with the aim “to stimulate the development and manufacture of vaccines
needed in low- income countries” by providing financial incentives to vaccine
manufacturers.5 Donors commit funds to the AMC to subsidize the purchase of
pneumococcal vaccines at an affordable price for developing countries, thereby
providing vaccine manufacturers with a long-term, guaranteed market price for the
vaccines. The World Bank manages the AMC funds, GAVI funds the vaccine
purchase, and UNICEF procures the vaccines from manufacturers. The World
Bank’s role as the financial platform for the AMC is further discussed in Chapter 3.

GAVI’s Contributions to Immunization Efforts
TYPES OF SUPPORT

10. The New and Underused Vaccine Support (NVS) is available to countries
with national Diptheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis (DTP3) coverage over 50 percent
(based on WHO/UNICEF estimates for 2009), with the exception for Yellow Fever
and Meningococcal A vaccine (Men A) applications.6 All countries applying for NVS
are required to co-finance the GAVI supported vaccines from the time of
introduction. The only exceptions for co-financing are measles second dose and
preventive campaigns for Meningitis A and Yellow Fever. Countries approved for

                                                                                          53
APPENDIX A
GAVI: PURPOSE, CONTRIBUTIONS, AND ACTIVITIES
NVS will also receive a one-time cash grant in the form of the Vaccine Introduction
Grant to support additional costs related to new vaccine introduction and to fund
pre-introduction activities. GAVI currently offers support for 10 different vaccines.7

11. In mid-2001, GAVI began offering Injection Safety Support (INS) to countries
that wanted to introduce or increase the use of auto-disable syringes and safety
boxes into their national immunization programs for vaccines not supported by
GAVI.8 Currently, INS is associated with the NVS and GAVI typically funds auto-
disable syringes and safety boxes together with the vaccines.

12. The Immunization Services Support (ISS) was established in 2000 to provide
flexible, performance-based funding to countries to improve their immunization
services. Countries receive funding based on the additional number of children
receiving immunization after an initial two years of investment funding.9

13. The Health System Strengthening Support (HSS) is based on the principles of
the International Health Partnership (IHP+) in line with the Paris Declaration on Aid
Effectiveness. Commitments vary from one to five years in duration, and funding
levels are determined by the size of the country's birth cohort and the national
income per capita.

14. The Health System Funding Platform (HSFP or the Platform) was established
in 2009 to streamline HSS support and align with country budgetary and
programmatic cycles. The Platform is intended to coordinate the various
international resources for health systems strengthening among partners, donors,
and countries in order to better align with the country priorities. Countries

requesting new HSS funding have two funding modalities: common proposal form
or funding request based on a Jointly Assessed National Health Strategy (JANS).10

15. From 2006-2010, GAVI piloted the Civil Society Organization Support (CSO)
program to support the role of CSOs in immunization-related activities, strengthen
coordination and representation of CSOs, and support CSO involvement in
countries' HSS proposals and multi-year immunization plans. 11

APPLICATION AND APPROVAL PROCESS

16. The GAVI Secretariat announces “funding windows” each year within which
GAVI-eligible countries may apply for different types of program support. To be
GAVI-eligible, countries must have per capita Gross National Income (GNI) equal to
or less than US$ 1,550 in order to apply for any of the support programs; 56
countries are currently eligible for GAVI support based on GNI per capita.12
Countries with GNI per capita beyond the eligibility threshold are no longer eligible
to receive GAVI support for new vaccines. There are currently 17 countries
graduating from GAVI support, with seven countries graduating in 2015.13

17. Only national governments can apply for vaccine funding and the five-year
plan proposals are submitted by the Ministry of Health (MoH) with signed
approvals from the Ministry of Finance and the country’s Interagency Coordination
Committee (ICC). Each support program has their set of conditions, including

                                                                                                      55

eligibility and minimum requirements; application deadlines and guidelines are
published on the GAVI Alliance Website. In addition to the standard proposal form,
countries must demonstrate that their funding proposals are integrated into the
broader framework of their long-term health plans by submitting a comprehensive
multi-year plan for immunization when applying for GAVI support for ISS, INS,
and NVS.

18. Once an application is submitted to the GAVI Secretariat, it is sent to the
Independent Review Committee (IRC) for review. The IRC then recommends the
country application to the GAVI Alliance Board using the following four categories:
recommended for approval; recommended for approval with clarifications;
recommended for approval with conditions; and recommended for resubmission.
The GAVI Alliance Board or Executive Committee approves the IRC
recommendation and a Decision Letter is sent to inform the country of the decision.

19. Once approved by the GAVI Alliance Board, funds are then transferred to the
country for implementation. For the procurement of vaccines and associated safety
supplies, countries can choose to receive either the supplies in-kind from GAVI
(procured through UNICEF or the Revolving Fund of the Pan American Health
Organization , or an equivalent cash grant in lieu of supplies and procure the
supplies directly from the vaccine producer.14 Countries receiving GAVI support
spanning several years are required to submit annual reports to the GAVI Secretariat
for progress monitoring.

20. GAVI requires each country to set up an Interagency Coordination Committee
(ICC) to review and approve all new proposals for NVS and ISS applications, and
monitor GAVI’s immunization-related country activities for annual reports
submitted to the GAVI Secretariat. The ICC is chaired by the local health ministry,
and ICC members are from the government, CSOs, WHO, UNICEF, and partner
agencies. In addition, countries must demonstrate that their funding proposals are
integrated into the broader framework of their long-term health plans by submitting
a comprehensive multi-year plan for immunization. Box A.2 offers a comparison to
how other major global partnership programs have chosen to structure their country
engagements.

Box A.2. How are other global partnership programs structured at country level?
A growing number of global partnership programs have been added to the development landscape
in recent years to channel resources to projects and programs in developing countries in their
respective sectors. Like GAVI, these programs have chosen not to build up local offices, instead
relying on countries and partner agencies to prepare and execute projects, with their secretariats
playing varying roles ranging from hands-off to technical assistance and monitoring, but generally
shying away from project execution. What follows is a brief synopsis of how some of the major global
partnerships are structured at country level.
The Climate Investment Funds (CIF). CIF is a partnership of the multilateral development banks
(MDBs). The MDBs work with governments, in consultation with civil society, to prepare country
investment plans and to prepare and execute specific projects in climate change mitigation and
adaptation. CIF was designed with a light-touch approach: its Administrative Unit (Secretariat) is
small and most work is done by the MDBs, including the World Bank and IFC.
The Global Environment Facility (GEF). GEF Agencies are responsible for creating project proposals
and for managing GEF projects. The GEF Agencies play a key role in managing GEF projects on the
ground; they assist governments and NGOs in the development, implementation, and management
of GEF projects. The World Bank Group is one of 10 GEF Agencies. GEF has designated political and
operational focal points. These are usually national government staff and act as liaison between the
GEF Secretariat and GEF Agencies implementing projects in the country.
The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Country coordinating Mechanisms
(CCMs) comprised of government, CSOs, and development partners review and endorse funding
proposals based on national strategies for combating the three diseases. Lead implementation
agencies execute approved grants; these can be government agencies, CSOs, academic institutions, or
the UNDP. The World Bank has interacted with many Global Fund activities and is a member of
some CCMs but is not a lead implementation agency. Financial oversight is contracted out to so-
called local fund agents who act as the Secretariats’ fiduciary agent in the country. In respons e to
criticisms of its oversight of funds in implementing countries, among other issues, the Global Fund
has implemented a comprehensive reform of its funding model, business operations, financial
management, and fiduciary oversight systems. Geneva-based staff of the Global Fund are spending
much more time visiting countries; negotiating directly with CCMs and PRs regarding project
funding levels, goals, and objectives, and working closely with accounting firms that track resources.
However, the Fund itself is not opening offices or executing projects in partner countries.
The Global Partnership for Education (GPE). The GPE Secretariat works with governments and
development partners to develop an education plan. Developing country governments lead the
process in collaboration with other members of the Local Education Group; the GPE Secretariat
provides technical feedback on education programs and their monitoring. Applications for financial
support are prepared and submitted by the Local Education Group. In most cases, activities financed
by GPE Program Implementation Grants are implemented by the developing-country government
with the support of a supervising entity (either a multilateral or donor country) who oversees and
reports on the use of the funds.

Co-financing and Graduation Policies

21. As part of GAVI’s Co-financing Policy that came into effect in December 2010,
developing countries are required to co-finance the cost of most GAVI-supported

                                                                                                                   57

GAVI’s support ends. In 2012, two graduating countries, Angola and the Republic of
Congo, failed to fulfill their co-financing commitments to GAVI (a situation known
as “default”). In both countries the problem was weak budgetary and planning
capacity rather than the availability of fiscal space.16

GAVI’S INFLUENCE IN VACCINE MARKET SHAPING

23. Market shaping has always been part of GAVI’s strategy in ensuring the
financial sustainability of vaccines once countries graduated, and GAVI has recently
been successful in negotiating lower vaccine prices. GAVI has been able to secure
pentavalent vaccines for US$1.19 per dose (a reduction of more than 60 percent
compared with US$2.98 in 2010), Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines for
US$4.50 per dose, and pneumococcal vaccine for US$3.30 per dose (from 2014
onwards).17 IEG finds no evidence that the World Bank has been active in vaccine
market shaping.

Independent Evaluations of GAVI
24. The Evaluation of the GAVI Phase 1 Performance report was conducted by
Abt Associates and assessed the period from 2000 to 2005. The evaluation
commenced in November 2007 and the report was released in October 2008. The
objectives of the evaluation were: 1) to identify lessons learned in GAVI Phase 1,
including how well it has evolved and learned from experience over the period
2000–2005; 2) to contribute to the adjustment of GAVI policies in the next strategic
phase of work; and 3) to document the impact and effectiveness of the GAVI
Alliance’s use of resources during Phase 1.

25. The overall assessment of GAVI’s activities and performance during Phase 1
was fair and comprehensive, praising the successes GAVI was able to accomplish in
a short time period but also providing criticism of GAVI’s weaknesses and failures.
But by the time the evaluation and recommendations were finally released, GAVI
was already embarking on new activities and organizational changes. By October
2008, the time when the final report was released, GAVI had already decided to
merge GAVI Alliance and GAVI Fund into one entity to improve decision-making
and governance issues, to introduce pneumococcal and rotavirus vaccines, and to
offer HSS funding. The report recommended for GAVI to improve support to
countries, improve strategic decision-making, strengthen evaluation mechanisms,
ensure an effective dialogue with partners, analyze funding flows for immunization,
understand vaccine market dynamics, and reassess strategies for sustainability.

26. The Second Evaluation Report, the most recent external evaluation of the
GAVI Alliance, was completed in September 2010. Commissioned by the GAVI
Alliance and conducted by Cambridge Economic Policy Associates (CEPA), the
Report assessed the period from GAVI’s inception to 2009, but primarily focused on

                                                                                       59
APPENDIX A
GAVI: PURPOSE, CONTRIBUTIONS, AND ACTIVITIES
the GAVI’s performance from 2006 to 2009. The Report commenced in December
2009 and was completed and presented to the Board in September 2010. The
evaluation design sought to answer two high-level questions: 1) to what extent has
the GAVI Alliance met its four strategic goals and 2) to what extent has the GAVI
Alliance added value at the global and country levels, over and above what would
have been accomplished without the Alliance.18

27. The report was comprehensive in reviewing GAVI outputs, outcomes, and
impacts, as well as the financial, programmatic, and organizational value added by
GAVI at the global and national levels. The evaluation teams did not review GAVI
governance structure since the governance structure was recently reviewed and
reorganized at the time of the evaluation. Five country studies supplemented the
team’s findings and analysis.

28. The report praises GAVI’s many achievements, particularly attracting
increased funding for immunization, the development of innovative financial
instruments, the accelerated introduction of vaccines in low-income countries, and
GAVI’s “country ownership” approach. The evaluation teams found GAVI’s
support to be a cost-effective intervention and found that the NVS program has
accelerated the introduction of life-saving vaccines in countries.

29. The evaluation teams also reported the weaknesses of GAVI’s strategy and
performance framework, particularly how GAVI’s activity has not sufficiently
aligned with its strategy.19 The report notes: the need for better prioritization of
secretariat and partner resources; GAVI’s failure to prioritize monitoring and
evaluation (M&E); and the poor accountability between GAVI and its implementing
partners. The report also highlights GAVI’s weak performances in reducing vaccine
prices and its issues with the HSS delivery model. Furthermore, the report notes that
GAVI’s choice of vaccines and basic funding model has had negative implications
for country financial sustainability.20

30. The Evaluation of the IFFIm Report was published in June 2011. The GAVI
Secretariat, on behalf of the IFFIm Board, commissioned an evaluation of IFFIm by
the HLSP. The evaluation assesses the extent to which IFFIm has been an effective
and efficient financing instrument to raise money for immunization and health
systems in GAVI eligible countries, and the extent to which IFFIm has contributed to
enhancing GAVI’s impact on immunization and health. A detailed description is
provided in Chapter 4.

31. The excellent evaluation concludes that IFFIm has proven to be a “very efficient
second best solution” to the development financing problem and a major source of
funding for GAVI, but might not to be easily replicable for other health-sector
initiatives. The external evaluation report remarks that the “World Bank’s
reputation, credibility, and strong AAA ratings were absolutely critical to IFFIm

being able to qualify as a supranational; 0 percent risk weighting, AAA credit
ratings, and investor confidence all depended in part on the World Bank’s
participation.”21 Without the World Bank’s participation, IFFIm’s entire structure
would have been different and the feasibility of IFFIm would need to be re-
evaluated.

32. The Advanced Market Commitments for Pneumococcal Vaccines Process and
Design Evaluation, commissioned by the GAVI Alliance and undertaken by
Dalberg Global Development Advisors, was published in February 2013. The report
is intended to provide the international development community with insights and
lessons learned from the implementation of the Pneumococcal AMC Pilot by
focusing on how key decisions were made in the design and implementation
processes. The evaluation did not discuss the overall impact of the Pneumococcal
AMC as the GAVI Secretariat has commissioned a separate outcome evaluation to
be conducted in 2014.

33. The report praises the design and implementation process as having
contributed towards the objectives of increasing the supply and accelerating the
uptake of pneumococcal vaccines in low-income countries. Overall, the report states
that the AMC as a concept has been successfully translated into a pilot program for
the pneumococcal vaccine, and that the international development community has
been able to design, establish, and administer an AMC. The report recommends
further work to reduce the tail price, strengthen performance measurements, and
ensure the 2014 outcome evaluation is well designed.

34. In recent years, development partners have also assessed GAVI in terms of
value added, aid effectiveness, and alignment and relevance to their development
objectives. The United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID)
Multilateral Aid Review 2011 assessed 43 organizations on relative value for money
spent. GAVI is rated as a “very good value for money” for delivering cost-effective
health interventions, being innovative and transparent, and taking a country-led
approach. The review also notes that GAVI needs to focus on further reducing
vaccine prices.

35. In Sweden’s 2011 assessment, GAVI is rated as highly relevant to Swedish
development assistance policy, and that GAVI has a very high level of internal and
external effectiveness with an efficient and responsive Secretariat. The Australian
Multilateral Assessment of GAVI, released in March 2012, rates GAVI highly in the
areas of delivering results, transparency and accountability, partnership behavior,
cost and value consciousness, strategic management and performance, contribution
to the multilateral system, and alignment with Australia’s interest.

Appendix B. Replicability of Innovative Financial
Mechanisms
1. Innovative financing mechanisms enable the international community to respond to
international development and global health priorities by leveraging a variety of financial
resources. The World Bank has been critical for the establishment and very effective in the
management of two globally innovative financial instruments, IFFIm and the AMC.
Working with partners, the Bank has effectively operationalized new financial
instruments, devoting significant time and resources to this task, and assuming financial
risks for the AMC and potential reputational risks (both AMC and IFFIm). The Bank’s
experience in operationalizing these innovative financial mechanisms provide lessons for
other innovative financing mechanisms beyond the sector.

2. IEG concurs with the external IFFIm evaluation and finds that in its present format
and with the current governance structure, as a UK charity, IFFIm is unlikely to be
replicable for other health-sector initiatives. IFFIm was set up in 2004 with the principal
donors requesting that commitments could be accounted for “off budget” requiring a
favorable ruling by the regulators (Eurostat). It is unlikely that after the dramatic changes
in the financial landscape in 2008 such a ruling could be obtained again today. The
mechanism is transaction intensive and not inexpensive.

3. The total projected operational costs over IFFIm’s lifetime are difficult to estimate as
they critically depend on future projected interest rates. The 2010 IFFIm external
evaluation estimated the lifetime cost of governance and treasury management as 4.1-
4.6% of present value of then-current pledges. Essential running cost, such as directors
insurance for IFFIm Board members, legal advice, and treasury management fees amount
to US$5-6 million per year. Recent work by the Bank projects the cost to be closer to the 8-
10% range, when also taking into account the potential interest paid for outstanding debt.
This means that IFFIm’s management costs over the life of the facility could amount to
$150-$340 million.1

4. Thus, unless frontloading is absolutely critical and the recipient is a mature
organization with an established pipeline of activities ready for financing, direct funding
by donors would seem to be easier and a lower cost option for the recipient.

5. The AMC – a so called “pull mechanism”-was a pilot operation to operationalize and
test the concept of an “advanced market commitment. The AMC was intended to cover
the capital cost for pneumococcal vaccine production for established manufacturers in
order to make the vaccine rapidly available for GAVI eligible countries. Because the AMC
for pneumococcal vaccines was the first AMC ever, its design process was driven by
learning by doing. The recent process and design evaluation considers the AMC a success.
IEG concurs with this assessment.

                                                                                              63
APPENDIX B.
REPLICABILITY OF INNOVATIVE FINANCIAL MECHANISMS
6. However, the choice and modification of an existing pneumococcal vaccine for the
pilot and its cost has attracted considerable criticism from civil society organizations, such
as Doctors without Borders. The long-term nature of the commitment and its
consequences for GAVI finances—forecast at about a third of overall GAVI outlays for the
next decade—have also been pointed out.

7. Recently several new vaccines, such as MenAfriVac, Oral Cholera, and Japan
Encephalitis, have been effectively developed by using so called “push mechanisms,”
facilitating technology transfer to manufacture the vaccine with the provision of up-front
funding to meet a specific target. Most important is the new low-price conjugate vaccine
for Meningitis in Africa (MenAfriVac) to combat epidemic meningitis in the African
meningitis belt. It was developed with a US$70 million grant from the Gates Foundation
and is now manufactured in India at a cost of US$0.40 per dose. Not counting vaccine
prices, development costs using a push mechanism have been a fraction (less than 5
percent) of that of the AMC. 2

Appendix E. Findings from the Country Visits
1.    The countries visited were a purposive sample based on the following (not
mutually exclusive) criteria: (a) countries that are pilot countries for the Health
Systems Funding Platform, (b) countries where both GAVI and the World Bank
have been active in the health sector since GAVI was founded in 2000, (c) countries
in which there has been some engagement (collaboration, complementarity, or
consultation) between GAVI and the World Bank (based on prior desk reviews and
interviews), and (d) countries to which the ImGAVI Trust Fund has provided
technical assistance.

MISSION SUMMARY: ETHIOPIA

2. Ethiopia’s immunization coverage rates have been steadily rising over the last
10 years, but most vaccines only cover between 60 and 80 percent of infants. Bacille
Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and DTP1 vaccine rates have fallen from 90 to 80 percent
over the last few years. The Ethiopian government expects the GAVI-supported new
vaccines, such as rotavirus, will help the country achieve single-digit under-five
mortality by 2030. However, a gap exists between official immunization coverage
and survey-estimated coverage rates raising the question of what happened to the
vaccine doses provided. The government, GAVI, and other donor partners need to
find ways to ensure effective vaccine distribution and improve coverage.

3. Since 2001, GAVI has disbursed US$ 469 million and committed US$ 740
million for vaccines, health system strengthening, and immunization services
support in Ethiopia. The government’s routine immunization spending has
increased since 2001 when GAVI funds started. In 2009, the Ethiopian Expanded
Program on Immunization’s (EPI) expenditures totaled US$56.7 million with the
government financing about 12 percent of routine immunization spending. This
increased to 51 percent in 2010 with the government spending US$26 million (US$17
per infant) on routine immunization. (WHO 2013).

4. GAVI-financed vaccines have contributed to the country’s strong reduction in
child mortality, and GAVI has been a pioneer in Ethiopia in aligning its finances for
HSS. The program disburses into the pooled MDG Performance Fund, which
finances the government’s Health Sector Development Program. The government
and partners in Ethiopia generally have a positive perception of the GAVI Alliance,
in particular for its large-scale, front-loaded, predictable financing for new vaccines,
and recent declines in the prices of some new vaccines.

5. The lack of GAVI country presence combined with lack of an effective
partnership appears to result in missed opportunities to strengthen immunization
results via operational support and health and immunization policy dialogue, for

                                                                                      73

FINDINGS FROM THE COUNTRY VISITS
example on how to speed up immunization in lagging regions and for
disadvantaged groups. Immunization is highly inequitable between the highest and
lowest income quintiles in Ethiopia. In 2011, there was a substantial gap between the
poorest and richest income quintiles with nearly 15 and 50 percent respectively of 1-
year-olds immunized. There are also large urban/rural gaps in Ethiopia. In 2005,
NDHS data illustrated that 10 percent of children in Affar had adequate
immunization coverage whereas nearly 90 percent were adequately covered in
Addis Ababa.1

6.   The World Bank has supported immunization in ways that are broadly
complementary to GAVI’s program. It helps finance health worker salaries under
Promoting Basic Services (PBS, a multidonor operation, now in its third phase). This
support is clearly enabling for the immunization program. PBS I and II also financed
some medical procurement. The World Bank is starting analytical work on basic
services for the bottom 40 percent (also the group that doesn’t receive
immunization). Thus, World Bank and GAVI support seem
broadly complementary.

MISSION SUMMARY: NEPAL

7.    Community-based programs were successfully implemented in Nepal, which
resulted in full immunization coverage increasing from 43 percent in 1996 to 87
percent in 2011. Currently, most vaccine coverage fluctuates around an average of
85-90 percent. According to the NDHS in 2011, DTP3 coverage was 92 percent and
measles was 88 percent among 1-year-olds. The Hib3 vaccine was recently
introduced in 2011 and Nepal is scheduled to introduce pneumococcal vaccines in
2014 and rotavirus vaccines in 2016. Pneumococcal disease is the leading cause of
pneumonia – Nepal’s number two killer of children under five years of age with 16
percent of total deaths in 2010. Following that, rotavirus, the leading cause of severe
childhood diarrhea, is the sixth fatal disease for children under five with 6 percent of
the total deaths in 2010. (WHO 2010)

8.    Total expenditures on health have historically fluctuated between 5-6 percent
of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Nepal, 55 percent of which are out-of-
pocket payments. Health expenditure per capita is around $33. The Nepalese
government has noted that efficiency will play a huge role in creating additional
fiscal space for the health sector. Linking payment to performance may be the best
option for the government to get more value for the money spent on health care
(World Bank 2012, UHC Forward 2008).

9.   The MoH faces funding issues due to the absence of an elected government and
a frozen budget. This has caused the health sector to be under-financed. The total
amount of disbursements from GAVI between 2001-2012 was around US$ 59 million
with US$ 110 million committed. Of this support, 61 percent can be attributed to

vaccine support and 39 percent to financing non-vaccine support such as HSS and
immunization services support.

10. The Nepal Health Sector Program 2010-2015 (NHSP II), under the Sector-wide
Approach (SWAp) framework, is dedicated to creating equal access to health care
and lowering out-of-pocket payments for services, and it is also the basis for the
HSFP. The SWAp uses a Joint Financing Agreement (“JFA”) to pool funding from
five donor agencies (World Bank, GAVI, DFID, Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau
(German Development Bank) (KFW) and Australian Agency for International
Development (AusAID) – referred to as Pooling Partners.) The Non-Pooling
partners who have signed the JFA are U.S. Agency for International Development
(USAID), UNICEF, United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), and WHO. The
agreement has been in effect since August 2010.

11. Nepal was a pilot country for HSFP and is the only country so far where the
HSFP has been implemented; however the Global Fund is not a party to the HSFP in
the country. Nepal has demonstrated that close donor coordination can be achieved,
that joint funding based on a JFA outlining the rights and obligations of pooling and
non-pooling signatories is critical, and that the SWAp provides an excellent
mechanism in achieving this objective. Although the World Bank is an active
member of the Health Sector Coordination Committee (HSCC), it is not a member
and does not participate in the ICC.

MISSION SUMMARY: INDONESIA

12. The country’s strong centralized government structure rapidly decentralized in
1999 which led to significant funding increases to the health sector and placed
service delivery in the hands of local government. Although the country has made
improvements in health outcomes since decentralization, it has been much slower
than its peers in maternal mortality, nutritional status, and underweight rates.
Inequality remains a problem in Indonesia with 46 percent of the population living
below the basic needs poverty line of US$2 per day in 2010 and large gaps in infant
mortality rates between the rich and the poor. (World Bank 2012).

13. The Indonesian government considers immunization to be a health priority.
Immunization trends have shown relatively little change over the last decade with
an average coverage mean around 75 percent. Around 2006, the rates of BCG, DPT,
Polio (Pol3) and Hepatitis B (HepB3) vaccine coverage declined. Conversely,
measles’ coverage rates have steadily increased since induction from around 75
percent to 90 percent. Pentavalent vaccine has been introduced in Indonesia and
Pneumococcal vaccines were planned for introduction in 2013. Although overall
immunization distribution has increased from 55 percent to 59 percent between 1997
and 2007, it still remains inequitable across income quintiles and urban and rural
populations.

                                                                                    75
APPENDIX E.
FINDINGS FROM THE COUNTRY VISITS
14. Health spending has been historically low in Indonesia with an average of 0.5
percent of GDP over the last decade and a half since decentralization. With private
payments capturing 70 percent of disbursements, the country has struggled with
high levels of out-of-pocket payments and informal user fees resulting in little
protection against catastrophic spending. However, public spending following
decentralization has increased and focused primarily on vertical disease-specific
programs, investments in facilities and salaries. Indonesia currently covers a
substantial part of immunization costs and is graduating from GAVI support. GAVI
has committed US$ 95.5 million to Indonesia of which US$17.5 million in vaccine
costs and US$38.3 million in vaccination oriented HSS t has been disbursed.

15. As a GAVI graduating country, Indonesia is co-financing support and carries
the majority of immunization costs. GAVI is the only partner in health actively
supporting the Government’s immunization program. The sustainability of the
health financing system faces decentralization challenges. Government has stressed
health as a priority sector and increased expenditures; however, sustainability at the
central level does not promise sustainability at the provincial and district levels.
Unfortunately, there has been inadequate funding from district offices for
operational costs.

16. The country will graduate from GAVI in 2015 and has been recipient of both
GAVI and World Bank funding. The World Bank and GAVI have both made
important contributions to the Indonesian health sector. GAVI support has focused
mainly on vaccination financing whereas the World Bank set up programs after
decentralization dealing with HSS. The World Bank financed three prominent
projects after decentralization focused on direct support for the decentralization
efforts and operational costs of immunization. (GAVI 2010). The ICC, which
implemented and monitored GAVI support for direct immunization costs merged in
2011 with the HSCC to work on similar issues in immunization, management, and
health system objectives. The World Bank used to be a participating member of the
ICC, but has been removed in 2010 from the list of signatories due to too little
engagement on its part.

17. A comprehensive sub-sector review of immunization activities was completed
for Indonesia. At present there is no regular direct communication at the country
level between the GAVI and World Bank staff. Other donors expressed regret about
this, since enhanced collaboration would be mutually beneficial. The government
did not consider the Bank a vital partner with regards to technical assistance for
vaccine sustainability. Instead JICA, UNICEF, and the WHO were cited.
Development partners expressed an interest in having the Bank participate more
actively in regular meetings with the donor community at large in order to
coordinate efforts more closely. Indonesia does not use UNICEF for vaccine
procurement. Instead it requires single-source procurements from the national
supplier BIOFARMA resulting in excessively high vaccine prices.

MISSION SUMMARY: TAJIKISTAN

18. With relation to health indicators, Tajikistan has some of the lowest in the
region with an infant mortality rate of 34 per 1000.2 The National Development
Strategy in Tajikistan prioritizes the reduction of infectious disease and vaccine-
preventable diseases, and the National Immunization Program (NIP) in Tajikistan
has deemed immunization as a health priority for the government. A National
Immunization Program Review undertaken in 2012 by the Ministry of Health,
UNICEF, JICA, USAID, and the Agha Khan Foundation emphasized the need for
more health sector funding, equitable health services, better monitoring, and vaccine
stock management. Although the government reported the immunization rate
between 2008 and 2012 for children under 1 year to be in the high 90s, the Review
highlighted serious deficiencies, with 71 percent of children having had all 8
vaccinations, vague monitoring and reporting systems, shortfalls in state and
regional funding, aging infrastructure, and limited health worker skills.3
Surveillance and equity issues were magnified in 2010 by the polio outbreak that
occurred after a 13-year absence of the disease. The outbreak also raised concerns
about the weaknesses of the routine immunization and the reliability of reported
coverage.4

19. The government introduced pentavalent vaccines in 2008 with help from
GAVI, JICA, and other international organizations. Plans to introduce the rotavirus
vaccine have been stalled until 2015 due to financial difficulties and the
pneumococcal vaccine should be introduced in 2014-2015.5 Regardless of the
government’s interest, WHO advised against introducing the HPV vaccine at the
present time.

20. Total health expenditures have been around 5-6 percent of GDP over the last
decade; however, public funds only cover a small proportion causing out-of-pocket
payments to be rather high for the European and Central Asian region. According to
the World Bank, in 2009 households contributed about 72.4 percent of total health
expenditure in the form of user fees and out –of-pocket payments. Informal
payments have also been a problem due to the low incomes of health care workers.
In terms of immunization, the government only covers 12.5 percent of costs and
relies heavily on international donor contributions. Health-sector reforms must be
put in place to build a sustainable financing system.

21. There are large inequities in the health service provision of Tajikistan.
Tajikistan’s mountainous terrain makes health access difficult for those in hard to
reach villages, and childhood malnutrition remains a problem for some of the
poorest regions. 2012 immunization data shows large inequities between income
quintiles with a 26.8 percent gap in immunization distribution between the highest
and lowest quintiles.6


                                                                                      77
APPENDIX E.
FINDINGS FROM THE COUNTRY VISITS
22. Currently, the government has only been able to make small obligatory co-
payments on vaccination costs; in order to keep within GAVI regulation, the
government has doubled its co-payments for vaccine purchases to US$550,000 in
2013. Although the Ministry of Health has requested more funding, the Minister of
Finance is reluctant to distribute more money towards health spending.
Furthermore, there is little health policy dialogue between the two branches of
government. Development partners are unsure of Tajikistan’s ability to finance its
own immunization services since GAVI and donors subsidize a majority of the
immunization costs. As a result, immunization is consequently under-financed by
the government, highly dependent on donors, and lacks political support.

23. The ICC in Tajikistan has not effectively addressed sustainability and HSS
issues. Other coordination committees have also been formed to discuss HSS issues
and immunization respectively. The World Bank is no longer part of the ICC due to
infrequent meetings; however, it is an active member of another committee. WHO’s
support is largely limited to technical assistance, UNICEF acts mainly as a
procurement agency, and the Bank is absent. The World Bank considers
immunization as GAVI’s sole responsibility; however, there has been little
engagement between GAVI and the government on strategy and sustainability of
immunization activities.

24. Unfortunately, the necessary policy dialogues to reinforce the priority of
immunization in the national development agenda and to ensure the financial
sustainability of the immunization program have not occurred. As effective
childhood immunization constitutes a cornerstone of any healthcare system and is
the major intervention to reduce childhood mortality (MDG 4), the vacuum in policy
dialogue is not only a lost opportunity for meaningful health sector involvement for
the World Bank, but also a critical shortcoming in the partnership with GAVI. Better
collaboration between the two organizations and the government could procure
health policy aimed at the creation of a more sustainable, equitable health financing
system with respect to immunization.

            3               The GAVI funding has made it possible to address the core problems that afflict immunization
                            services in Ukraine: (a) low knowledge on the major part of key medical workers about vaccine safety
                            and efficacy; (b) gaps and inconsistencies in adverse events following immunization surveillance and
                            response systems and communications related to it. The activities involved regular technical
                            consultation and joint training implementation by UNICEF, the World Bank Office in Ukraine, the
                            WHO Country Office, WHO Euro and the Ministry of Health have been ensured throughout the
                            project. WHO Euro and the WHO Country Office provided technical support, recommended qualified
                            consultants, and provided guidance for the development of the country assessment tool. The Ministry
                            of Health ensured participation of medical workers via its Ministerial Orders. Ministry of Health
                            specialists participated in the training sessions and delivered presentations.1
            4               Helped identify key issues being faced by immunization program and fiscal and operation issues
                            which need to be addressed to introduce new vaccine in Pakistan.
            5               They helped to complete the CSR health sector report and to define an HSS strategy, ultimately
                            supported by a lending project. At this time, GAVI was providing the only available trust fund for HSS.

 7. Question 6. In your opinion, how did these ImGAVI-financed activities
 contribute to the country’s immunization-related activities? Please explain.
 (Respondents answered this question only if they had supervised or implemented
 any World Bank activities funded by the ImGAVI Trust Fund.)

                     GAVI contributions were: The project contributed to achieve key elements within the NIP, which
                     strengthened its operations and deliver high quality, safe immunization services in a sustainable and
                     effective manner, within the framework of comprehensive care and wide inter- and intra-sectoral and
       1
                     community participation. Still, the sustainability of program strategies and financial support is essential and
                     arrangements should be made to fill gaps and ensure that activities continue. GAVI Funds such as this fund
                     used in 2011 in Nicaragua serve as a key agglutinators in support of the goals stated in institutional plans.

                 The activities funded under the Trust Fund aimed to: A. Understand the perception of households on health
                 service quality in general and immunization services in particular. B. Conduct a formal assessment of the
                 Adverse Effects from Immunization (AEFI) surveillance and response system (detection, reporting, and
                 causality assessment) in order to identify existing gaps and ways to improve it; C. Develop and implement
                 trainings on AEFI and crisis communication in relation to AEFI for health professionals in order to equip them
                 with better skills and knowledge on AEFI as well as improve skills on communication with the media following
                 adverse events. These activities and training have led to adjustments in the Ukrainian AEF) surveillance and
                 response system which will contribute to formation of a more efficient system for management of AEFI
      4          cases. Trainings on AEFI and crisis communication in relation to AEFI for medical workers funded under the
                 GAVI Trust Fund is expected to boost their capacity to respond efficiently to AEFI and communicate more
                 accurately with media on AEFI. As a result of the initiative, it is expected that medical workers will gain clarity
                 on what AEFI is, how causality assessment is done, and how to collect and analyze data from the field. Once
                 a better understanding on these issues is obtained, inaccurate communication and argumentation by
                 speakers on AEFI issues to the media is expected to decrease. As a result, concerns of medical workers,
                 journalists, and the public on safety of vaccines will decrease. In a longer-term perspective, doctors’
                 confidence on immunization issues is expected to increase and consequently vaccination refusal levels
                 decrease.
                 Although it raised the understanding of the issues faced by the program - its impact on making policy and
      5
                 related changes are just appearing - to date the impact has been minimal.
                 As for the ESW part, the impact was very indirect, given that we were looking at the overall health system.
      6          As for the lending product (prepared thanks to the ESWs), the impact is more clear, as the product is a
                 Results-based Financing project, which includes an indicator on immunization.

13. Question 12. Indicate other factors, if any, which have made it EASIER for the
World Bank and GAVI to engage at the country level.

        Regular communication from GAVI Secretariat about the developments,
         especially application process for HSS platform.
        More commitment of the recipient.
        Common goals of Bank project under implementation
        Multi-agency “oversight” group looking at GAVI and Global Fund health
         system strengthening work, including World Bank.
        The presence of an established donor coordination mechanism through
         SWAp.
        Personalities that respect each other’s corporate background and mandate.
        Whenever there was a visit from Geneva, we met, beyond that there was very
         little engagement or coordination.
        Willing to enter into partnership. The Bank engagement is wider so GAVI
         was used to facilitate their financing support. But unfortunately that has been
         one sided - they listen to the Bank and if it is supportive they appreciate it,
         but if issues and concerns are raised they usually sidetrack them.

         the World Bank, GAVI, and the Global Fund).

14. Question 13. Indicate other factors, if any, which have made it MORE
DIFFICULT for the World Bank and GAVI to engage at the country level.

        Better presence of GAVI at the country level.
        The absence of the above bodies at the country level.
        GAVI’s policy of withdrawal.
        Limited country capacity. Political context.
        GAVI not based in the country, only intermittent missions.
        The fact that there were not clear guidelines or mandate for collaboration and
         no clear outcomes from collaboration made it very vague and as a result there
         was little actual effort.
        GAVI sidetracking issues being raised by the Bank and just pushing their
         financing.

Operations
Identification Strategy of World Bank Immunization Operations
1. Projects were identified via Business Warehouse. The identification theme codes
employed for the search were: Child Health; Other Communicable Disease; Health
System Performance; Nutrition and Food Security; Population and Reproductive
Health; HIV/AIDS; Non-Communicable Disease and Injury; Malaria, and
Tuberculosis. The sector codes used were: Health; Compulsory Health Finance;
Public Administration – Health; and Non-Compulsory Health Finance. A total of
607 projects were identified. These were narrowed down to projects managed by the
HNP, Social Protection (SP), and Poverty Reduction and Economic Management
(PREM) Sector Boards. Further after an initial screening projects that were not health
related and falsely coded were dropped leaving 390 projects in total. From these the
objectives and components were coded for immunization, where a total of 51
projects were initially identified. After a detailed project document review only 15
were eliminated since they were not relevant. Out of the remaining 36
immunization-related operations, seven were polio specific support projects,
financing a total of US$ 1,085 million in supporting the global polio vaccination
eradication program in key problem countries.

  From 2000-2010, the GNI eligibility threshold was US$1,000. In Phase I, 74 countries were initially eligible for GAVI
support and this was reduced to 72 countries in Phase II. The threshold is adjusted for inflation annually. For 2014, the GNI
eligibility threshold is US$ 1,570.

10 It stated that “engaging and collaborating with global partners contributes both to Bank capacity to serve client countries
and to global partners’ own capacity... Bank engagement with global partners is fragmented and requires sharper strategic
direction… the Bank will assess its engagement with its partners to ensure effective and sustainable partnerships. For
example, the Bank will seek a better balance in its partnerships and its regional work on low-income countries and Middle-
income country priorities, particularly on health systems and will substantially increase its strategic engagement with WHO,
the Global Fund, and GAVI in low-income countries”. See World Bank, Healthy Development: The World Bank Strategy

  In the original IFFIm structure, the GAVI Fund Affiliate (GFA) accepted funds from pledge agreements with sovereign
donors and assigned these to the IFFIm Company to be securitized. GFA also approved funding of programs with IFFIm
proceeds. GFA, registered in England and Wales as a company limited by guarantee, was established to keep IFFIm
independent from the donors and to safeguard GAVI’s tax-exempt status. In February 2013, GFA was removed from the
IFFIm structure in order to reduce costs and streamline operations.

  The original TMA came into effect in October 2006 and ended in September 2011. After considering amendments to the
TMA, the TMA with the Bank was renewed in the present form without any changes for another five years in October 2011.

  A high-level task force on innovative international financing for health systems, chaired by then UK Prime Minister
Gordon Brown and World Bank President Robert Zoellick, recommended in 2009 to “establish a HSFP for the Global Fund,
GAVI Alliance, the World Bank and others to coordinate, mobilize, streamline, and channel the flow of existing and new
international resources to support national health strategies.” This pertains particularly to the areas of maternal and child
health and health systems strengthening in which all three agencies are active. A main purpose of the HSFP was a more
efficient channeling of HSS funding in countries, by having one common financial management framework, one M&E
framework, and one joint review process. World Bank, the Global Fund, GAVI Alliance, WHO, 2010, Health Systems

 Commenting on an earlier version of this report, GAVI’s Secretariat stated that “While the GAVI Alliance was established
as a Swiss Foundation, the Headquarters Agreement in which the Government of Switzerland recognized the GAVI
Alliance’s international legal personality became effective on 1 January 2009. Under that agreement, the GAVI Alliance, its
Board members and officials benefit from privileges and immunities in Switzerland that are virtually the same to those
enjoyed by international organizations such as WHO, UNICEF and the World Bank. GAVI Alliance Board members,
therefore, enjoy immunity from jurisdiction (criminal and civil) in Switzerland for acts carried out in the performance of
their duties for GAVI.”

  Contributing to this situation is the fact that the Bank has still not systematized the practice of requiring staff serving on
partnership boards to be guided by specific terms of reference that set out Bank-wide institutional positions. Such terms of
reference are a longstanding IEG recommendation, which World Bank management accepted in a “Partnership Program
Framework Paper” of July 2013. One result of this is that some GAVI Secretariat staff is under the false impression that the
loyalty of the Bank’s representative on GAVI’s Board would primarily be to GAVI (it is of course to the Bank).

  Commenting on an earlier draft of this report, GAVI’s Secretariat emphasized that they view the Bank as a core partner,
not a contractor. However, as with all GAVI partners, they seek to hold the Bank accountable for deliverables funded by
GAVI, this being a specific requirement of GAVI’s Board and donors. In their view, this caused tensions with the Bank.
15
  Over the 12-year partnership, the HNP anchor spent a total of US$1.7 million of the Bank’s budget on GAVI activities.
The ImGAVI Trust Fund did not generate significant new resources for managing the partnership, since its resources were
mostly used to support country-level HSS activities. By 2012, there were no trust funds for GAVI work, and the HNP
department relied exclusively on the Bank’s administrative budget.

  The Report was organized around GAVI’s four strategic goals: 1) to contribute to strengthening the capacity of the health
system to deliver Immunization and other health services in a sustainable manner; 2) to accelerate the uptake and use of
underused and new vaccines and associated technologies and improve vaccine supply security; 3) to increase the
predictability and sustainability of long-term financing for national immunization programs; and 4) to increase and assess
the added-value of GAVI as a public-private global health partnership through improved efficiency, increased advocacy, and
continued innovation.
