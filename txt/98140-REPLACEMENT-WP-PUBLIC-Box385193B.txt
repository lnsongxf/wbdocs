Important Note

This analytical report had been prepared in April-
November 2014. While the publication was in the
process of preparation, the Customs Union underwent
a number of important changes: on January 1st, 2015,
an agreement on establishing the Eurasian Economic
Union (EEU) entered into force; it is planned that
from January 1, 2016 the Single Economic Space
will become fully functioning. Further, Armenia and
Kyrgyzstan joined Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia as
the Customs Union member states.

Still, all those changes have not impacted approaches
to food safety policy. All legal documents of the
Customs Union used for this analysis remain in full
force.

    HACCP – Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points – A science-based system that identiﬁes, evaluates and controls hazards that are sig-
    niﬁcant for food safety. HACCP is a tool to assess hazards and establish control systems that focus on prevention rather than relying mainly
    on end-product testing. HACCP is based on seven principles: (1) identifying any hazards that must be prevented, eliminated or reduced
    to acceptable levels (hazard analysis); (2) identifying the critical control points at the step or steps at which control is essential to prevent
    or eliminate a hazard or to reduce it to acceptable levels; (3) establishing critical limits at critical control points which separate acceptability
    from unacceptability for the prevention, elimination or reduction of identiﬁed hazards; (4) establishing and implementing effective moni-
    toring procedures at critical control points; (5) establishing corrective actions when monitoring indicates that a critical control point is not
    under control; (6) establishing procedures, which shall be carried out regularly, to verify that the measures outlined in paragraphs 1 to 5 are
    working effectively; (7) establishing documents and records commensurate with the nature and size of the food business to demonstrate
    the effective application of the measures outlined in paragraphs 1 to 6. See Codex Alimentarius document . Hazard Analysis and Critical

    There are three main types of legal instruments in the European Union: regulations, directives and decisions. Regulations are addressed to
    member states, have direct effect, supersede national law and do not require transposition; regulations by their nature are similar to laws.
    Directives are addressed to member states but do not establish directly applicable requirements; they set objectives that need to be trans-
    posed into national laws by national legal instruments. Decisions can be addressed both to member states and/or speciﬁc entities; they
    have direct effect but are usually focused on speciﬁc narrow issues.

    Note the Customs Union does not speciﬁcally exclude these items from food but as they are not deﬁned as food they are also excluded
8
     See the companion document for a more exhaustive list of what is excluded from the deﬁnition of food.
9
     There are two additional differences that should be mentioned. In the European Union medicinal products are speciﬁcally excluded. In
     the Customs Union they are not speciﬁcally excluded but maybe interpreted as excluded based on terminology and use within the overall
     framework. In the Customs Union, biologically active additives (BAA) such as probiotic microorganisms, intended for consumption to-
     gether with food or mixing into food products are speciﬁcally deﬁned as food and while not speciﬁcally outlined in the European deﬁnition
     it does fall under substances and therefore is included as food.
10
     Even though food safety is a main objective of the food law, European legal acts do not give a deﬁnition of food safety. However,
     Regulation (EU) No. 178/2002, Article 14, provides for a ban on unsafe food and explains when, for the purposes of the food law; food is
     deemed to be unsafe: “Food shall not be placed on the market if it is unsafe. Food shall be deemed to be unsafe if it is considered to be:
     injurious to health and/or unﬁt for human consumption”. Article 5, CU TR 021/2011 “On Food Safety”.

     The term “circulation on the market” is common within the Customs Union and one that means to sell into the market place. We have
     chosen to use the common term so that the readers become familiar with the terms used in translation of Customs Union documents
     into English.

     Regulation (EC) No. 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles
     and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety;
     Regulation (EC) No. 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure
     the veriﬁcation of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules. These two documents are over-arching;
     further, Regulation (EC) No. 882/2004 together with a number of other regulations, establish speciﬁc food control procedures.
14
     The intent is to ensure the protection of the customs territory of the Customs Union from the delivery and spread of infectious and mass
     noninfectious diseases (poisonings) among the population, by products (goods) not conforming to sanitary and epidemiological and
     hygienic requirements. To establish the procedures for import into the Customs Union area and the movement between the member
     states of products which are subject to the obligatory assessment (conﬁrmation) of compliance. Finally, the intent is to protect the Customs
     Union from the importation and spreading of agents of infectious animal diseases, including those common to humans and animals, and
     goods (products) non-compliant with veterinary (veterinary and sanitary) requirements.
15
     In addition food safety control is intended to guarantee fair practices as regards trade in food and feed and the protection of consumers’
     interests, including labeling of food and feed and any other form of information intended for consumers.

     Other than the Council and the Commission of the Customs Union (currently Eurasian Economic Union Commission), there are no supra-
     national bodies that are part of the control system.

     The EU Commission contributes to development of legal norms through adoption of implementing legal acts, and enforces feed and
     food law by checking that legislation has been properly incorporated into national law and implemented by all EU countries. This is done
     through on-the-spot inspections in the EU and is carried out by the Food & Veterinary Office (FVO) based at Grange in Ireland. The FVO
     may check individual food production plants, but its main task is to check that EU governments procedures in place for checking that their
     own food producers are compliant to the EU’s high food safety standards. The FVO also plays a key role in the development of EU policy
     in the food safety, veterinary and plant health sectors.

     food law are met within the food business under their control; “food business” means any undertaking, whether for proﬁt or not and

Soviet system inﬂuenced and speciﬁed consumer needs
through a set of uniﬁed products based on harmonized
central standards (GOST). The high degree of uniformity
helped to satisfy another food need – the need for good
taste (and other organoleptics), because consumers ac-
quired a habit to certain uniform tastes of core products.
Also, because of rather high social standards, standard-
ization helped to satisfy partially the highest need of the
hierarchy of food needs – the need in instrumental food,
in particular, where it concerned such quality attributes
as special nutritive properties for speciﬁc health condi-
tions (medical purposes, special diets, vulnerable groups
of population, e.g. children).

     In the Customs Union, food enzymes and extraction solvents should fall under the deﬁnition of “novel food” and the scope of the CU
     novel food rules, because they are covered by the general deﬁnition of “food product” established by the same technical regulation CU
     TR 021/2011.

10
     Limiting the scope to the use within certain territory is an important difference because food habits, traditions and technologies may vary
     signiﬁcantly between countries and traditions, and a food item that has already become consumed within one area may be novel to the
     other area. It is important that neither the European Union nor the Customs Union recognize authorizations of novel food from other
     countries or regions valid within their territories.
11
     This is a demonstration of how ﬂexibility and broad category identiﬁcation works. EU Regulation 258/97 was adopted in 1997, while engi-
     neered nanomaterials` (ENM) ﬁrst came into spotlight of European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) only in 2006; legal deﬁnition of engineered
     nanomaterials was established only in 2011 by Regulation (EU) 1169/2011 on Food Information to Consumers. Still, because of the way the
     EU Novel Foods Regulation was designed back in 1997, it allows to include the ENM into its scope. It should be noted that in 2011 EFSA
     adopted Guidance on the risk assessment of the application of nanoscience and nanotechnologies in the food and feed chain, as it is
     deemed that a more serious toxicological study of ENM safety is needed. The Guidance is available at http://bookshop.europa.eu/is-bin/

     In the European Union, the regulated area covers “food supplements” (not to be confused with “food additives”). According to Directive
     2002/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 June 2002 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States
     relating to food supplements, food supplements are deﬁned as “concentrated sources of nutrients (vitamins and mineral salts) or other
     substances with a nutritional or physiological effect, alone or in combination, which are marketed in dose form (e.g. capsules, tablets,
     sachets, etc.) in order to supplement a normal diet”. Effective legal acts on food supplements cover only vitamins and minerals.
22
     Within the Customs Union, technical regulation 021/2011 “On Food Safety” contains the deﬁnition of “biologically active supplements”
     (or, in some translations, “biologically active additives”), which are “natural and (or) identical to natural biologically active substances, as
     well as probiotic microorganisms, intended for consumption together with food or mixing into food products”. These biologically active
     supplements/additives can be viewed broadly as dietary supplements beyond vitamins and minerals which are used for the production of
     enriched food. Biologically active supplements/additives include plants or plant extracts, animal origin substances, microorganisms, fungi,
     etc. They belong to specialized food products, and can be based on vitamins and mineral substances, but also on food ﬁbers, pollen, ﬁsh
     and marine species, algae, probiotic microorganisms, meat and milk raw materials, proteins, amino acids and their complexes, vegetable
     oils, animal and vegetable lipids, etc. These types of BAS are listed in point 1.9 of Annex 2 “Microbiological safety criteria” of CU TR 21/2011.

Food additives are substances added intentionally to                        usually approved for use under certain conditions, in

     On 16 December 2008, the regulations of the so called Package on Food Improvement Agents were adopted (Regulation (EC) No
     1331/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a common authorization procedure for food additives, food
     enzymes and food ﬂavoring; Regulation (EC) No 1332/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on
     food enzymes and amending Council Directive 83/417/EEC, Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, Directive 2000/13/EC, Council
     Directive 2001/112/EC and Regulation (EC) No 258/97; Regulation (EC) no 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16
     December 2008 on food additives; Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008
     on ﬂavourings and certain food ingredients with ﬂavouring properties for use in and on foods and amending Council Regulation (EEC)
     No 1601/91, Regulations (EC) No 2232/96 and (EC) No 110/2008 and Directive 2000/13/EC). Importantly, the Regulations of the Package
     on Food Improvement Agents replaced earlier existing directives, which signiﬁcantly changed the set of sector-speciﬁc legal requirements
     that existed earlier in the EU and increased the level of harmonization between the member states. The regulations have also been sup-
     ported with implementing legal acts (called “implementing regulations”).

food additives, because these terms do not seem to be
corresponding, but in fact are. The terms are “quantum
satis” (EU) and “in accordance with technical documen-
tation” (Customs Union).

There are cases where no legal maximum limits are
established for the use of food additives or other sub-
stances used for technological purposes in foodstuffs.
In such situations the European Union law prescribes
to follow the principle of “quantum satis”, which in Latin
means “the amount which is needed”. In the same situ-
ation, the Customs Union CU TR 029/2012 prescribes to
follow “technical documentation” which has to be avail-
able from the food additive manufacturer, and where,
in the absence of legal maximum limits, the manufac-
turer maximum limits are established. The manufacturer,
when establishing such recommended limit, shall take
into account that the substance must not exceed the
levels necessary for achieving a technological effect.

The key difference is that according to the European
Union regulations, a food processor takes the decision                                 Quantum satis

     Commission Regulation (EC) No 450/2009 of 29 May 2009 on active and intelligent materials and articles intended to come into con-
     tact with food. “Active food contact materials and articles” means materials and articles that are intended to extend the shelf-life or to
     maintain or improve the condition of packaged food. They are designed to deliberately incorporate components that would release or
     absorb substances into or from the packaged food or the environment surrounding the food (deﬁnition from Article 2.2(a) of Regulation
     (EC) No. 1935/2004). See more information, for example, in EU Guidance to the Commission Regulation (EC) No 450/2009, DG SANCO,
     23 November 2011, available at: http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/chemicalsafety/foodcontact/docs/guidance_active_and_intelligent_scof-
     cah_231111_en.pdf; Active and Intelligent Packaging: Innovations for the Future, K. Huff, Department of Food Science and Technology,
     Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State Univ. Blacksburg, Va. Active packaging systems are developed with the goal of extending shelf life
     for foods and increasing the period of time that the food is high quality. Active packaging technologies include some physical, chemical,
     or biological action which changes interactions between a package, product, and/or headspace of the package in order to get a desired
     outcome. The most common active systems scavenge oxygen from the package or the product and may even be activated by an outside
     source such as UV light. Active packaging is typically found in two types of systems; sachets and pads which are placed inside of packages
     and active ingredients that are incorporated directly into packaging materials. Intelligent materials and articles means materials and articles
     which monitor the condition of packaged food or the environment surrounding the food packaging with a time-temperature indicator is
     an example of an intelligent packaging. Time-temperature indicators are meant to give information on whether a threshold temperature
     has been exceeded over time and/or to estimate the minimum amount of time a product has spent above the threshold temperature
     (time temperature history) e.g. from the moment the food it is packed until consumption. The indication is often a visual signal. A positive
     visual signal could indicate that a product is not fresh anymore or not suitable to be eaten.

    number of mesophyll aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria. A standard plate count will not differentiate between the natural micro-
    ﬂora of a food, spoilage microorganisms, organisms added to fermented foods or pathogenic microorganism. It cannot be used to predict
    the safety of the product and will be inﬂuenced by the storage conditions of the product. Depending on the product, a high standard plate
    count may indicate that the product may have been prepared unhygienically or stored inappropriately.

    Although cooking destroys the bacteria, the toxin produced is heat stable and may not be destroyed. Staphylococcal food poisoning oc-
    curs most often in foods that require hand preparation, such as potato salad, ham salad and sandwich spreads. Sometimes these types of
    foods are left at room temperature for long periods of time, allowing the bacteria to grow and produce toxin. Good personal hygiene while
    handling foods will help keep S. aureus out of foods, and refrigeration of raw and cooked foods will prevent the growth of these bacteria
    if any are present.

    In addition to Regulation (EU) 2073/2005, microbiological requirements are established on raw milk (in Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the
    European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down speciﬁc hygiene rules for food of animal origin), however they are
    not food safety requirements. As explained in Regulation (EC) 2073/2005, microbiological criteria have been established based on Codex
    Alimentarius guideline “Principles for the establishment and application of microbiological criteria for foods, CAC/GL 21- 1997”; in addition
    to this, existing Codex speciﬁcations in respect of dried milk products, foods for infants and children and the histamine criterion for certain
    ﬁsh and ﬁshery products have been taken into account. The criteria are also based on the advice of the Scientiﬁc Committee on Veterinary
    Measures relating to Public Health (SCVPH) and the Scientiﬁc Committee on Food (SCF) of the European Commission in laying down
    microbiological criteria. Also, European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) provides its scientiﬁc opinions and support where it comes to scientiﬁc
    assessment and review of various food hazards, including microbiological hazards.

     Article 1.1, Council Regulation (EEC) No 315/93 of 8 February 1993 laying down Community procedures for contaminants in food and is
     similar to implied meaning within the Customs Union for “potentially dangerous substances”.
16
     Extraneous matter, such as, for example, insect fragments, animal hair, etc., is not covered by this deﬁnition. On further analysis, it is im-
     portant to note that contaminants do not include physical impurities.
17
     In some of the Customs Union technical regulations, “potentially dangerous substances” are listed as an independent list of substances;
     in other technical regulations, they are part of “hygiene safety requirements”; in the former case, hygienic safety requirements also cover
     other aspects or chemicals added to the foodstuffs, or objects that are present in food but are not contaminants.

     In Codex Alimentarius documents, it is common to use the word “limit” (maximum residue limit); in the EU documents, the word “level”
     (maximum residue levels) is commonly used. They designate the same concept.
28
     Such Lists are approved for each food-related technical regulation of the Customs Union.
29
     Another example is whether the products are ready for consumption as such or are subject to further process steps, for example sorting,
     as in some cases sorting technics may reduce the level of contaminant. In particular, such approach is adopted for setting maximum levels
     of mycotoxins, in particular aﬂatoxins in nuts, including hazelnuts.

     Good Agricultural Practices are a collection of principles to apply for on-farm production and post-production processes, resulting in safe
     and healthy food and non-food agricultural products, while taking into account economic, social and environmental sustainability. They
     include a range of practices that cover soil, water, crop and fodder production, crop protection, animal production, animal health and
     welfare, harvest and on-farm processing, energy and waste management, human welfare, health and safety, and wildlife and land use.
     These are voluntary in the European system and are tailored to the speciﬁc type of and size of production.

two Unions. The technical regulations and other legal
acts of the Customs Union do not establish any deﬁni-
tions relevant to pharmacologically active substances or
their residues or maximum residue levels. The wordings
that are commonly used are “veterinary preparations”
“residues of veterinary preparations” and “acceptable
levels of residues”. When acceptable levels of “residues
of veterinary preparations” are established, actually they
are established for active substances. In all other cases
when requirements refer to veterinary preparations,
what is meant is the entire drug which includes inserts
and additives (adjuvants), not only its pharmacologically
active substance itself. The European Union law clearly
deﬁnes the terms “residue”46, “maximum residue limit”47
and “residue of pharmacologically active substance”48.
In fact, “acceptable level of residue of veterinary prepa-
ration” (as used in the Customs Union legal acts) means
the same as the term “maximum residue level (MRL)
of pharmacologically active substance” as used in the
European Union law. However, in all other cases “veteri-
nary preparation” (Customs Union) is not equal to “phar-
macologically active substance” (European Union). This                               The problem (AMR) is so serious

     Monitoring of presences of prohibited substances, including antimicrobial growth promoters, steroids, hormones is performed based on

     A separate set of regulations establishes a ban on antimicrobials (antibiotics) that are used as growth promoters. Until the ban, they were
     used by adding them to animal feed. The ban was introduced gradually until they were phased out completely by Regulation (EC) No

streptomycin, penicillin that are controlled in all raw
material and food products, including processed ready-

whether it is produced inside the Customs Union or im-

below which their residues are not allowed (and can not
be found). The second group of substances covers ac-
tive substances that are controlled for imported raw ma-
terials and animal products at the point of entry to the
Customs Union and upon their supply for processing,
and only if a manufacture or supplier declares that they
were used on food producing animals. According to the
rules of entry into force of CU TR 034/2013 “On safety

enter into force when a list of regional standards that

In order to provide some insight into the complexity of
rules on the use of pharmacologically active substances
and their MRLs, below is a comparative summary be-

rules for the substances (antibiotics) that in the Customs
Union are controlled in all food products of animal ori-
gin, as well as substances that are not authorized in the
EU but are registered in the CU (Table 3). This is only
a non-exhaustive summary but it will give the reader
some idea of the complexity of the area as well as the
need to conduct a detailed analysis prior to exporting to
either of the trading blocks. One should also be aware
that there are certain discrepancies within technical reg-
ulations of the Customs Union (they can be found in
the main report).

As was mentioned, within the Customs Union there is
differentiation in the control of pharmacologically active
substances. There is a general group that is controlled
