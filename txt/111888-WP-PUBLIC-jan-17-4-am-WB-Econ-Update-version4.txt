Box    Education and labor market developments in South Africa
1.1	         Tackling these challenges requires making the following priority investments.
             First, it requires a focus on ensuring fluency in reading and mathematics by grade 3, which is part of the government’s
       plans. Rigorous evaluations have demonstrated the importance of teaching at the competency level students have (rather
       than focusing on teaching the grade level material). Successful models should be tried and evaluated in South Africa.
             Second, through secondary education, the focus should be on a general set of foundational skills and aptitudes. This
       focus will help to provide what is required by most employers, and these skills and aptitudes will give young people greater
       resilience in the labor market, since specialized technical and vocational skills fade much more quickly during periods of
       unemployment or labor market inactivity. (Sadly, recent experience suggests that many young South Africans will not be able
       to find work immediately after completing education and training.)                                                                           15
             Third, workplace experience is the best place to learn about the working world and acquire new skills that are relevant
       to today’s job market. Work experience opportunities for young people, before they leave education and training, and for
       the long-term unemployed, is important. These opportunities should be made available to all students, not just those in
       vocational education and training programs.
             Fourth, as South Africa continues to meet its commitment to minimum standards in its education infrastructure, it
       will have to take into account the overall reduction in the size of the student cohorts and the highly mobile student
       population (with many students living with extended family members to attend a particular school). Adjusting the school
       network will be a long-term and complex process. It will have to balance local decision making to meet local dynamics           Skills shortages
       and enable a more rapid response, improving efficiency but informed by the full costs of school consolidation (capital and
       recurrent spending, transportation, and so forth) and measures of the impact on the learning and engagement of students         are also a major

Box    Macroeconomic and poverty impacts of El Niño on Southern African
1.2   Development Community countries

            Using the LINKAGE global computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, World Bank (2016c) estimates the short-term
      macroeconomic and poverty impacts of El Niño–related droughts. Absent sufficient information on projected hydroelectricity
      production, cattle destocking, and the impact of the drought on other crops, World Bank (2016c) concentrates on the
      short-term impact of reduced maize production (an 18 percent decline in 2015/16 at the regional level, from a situation
      of self-sufficiency in 2014/15). Except for Madagascar, maize constitutes Southern African households’ main staple, and it
      is believed that the impact on maize production constitutes the largest channel through which El Niño affects households’
      welfare. Impacts are measured through the comparison of a business as usual (“baseline”) scenario with a scenario that
      assumes reduced total factor productivity in the maize sector to reproduce anticipated countries’ maize production in
      2015/16. Through modeling the supply and demand sides at the country level, and trade relationships among Southern
      African Development Community (SADC) countries and with the rest of the world, the CGE is employed to capture orders of
      magnitude of El Niño impacts on prices, household incomes, and demand. Combined with household surveys, these estimates
      are also used to compute poverty impacts.
            The simulation results suggest that, at the regional SADC level, gross domestic product (GDP) growth decelerated by 0.1
      percent in 2016 because of droughts, and by 0.05 percent in South Africa, the largest economy in SADC. Given the relatively
      high importance of maize in GDP, the growth impact of El Niño was felt to be much larger in Malawi (-2.2 percent); Tanzania
      (-1.4 percent); and Zimbabwe, Lesotho, and Swaziland (-0.6 percent). Given the assumed low elasticity of households’ maize
      demand to income, the simulations suggest that households reduced their demand for other goods and services to satisfy
      their maize consumption. This resulted in a surge in maize prices in 2016 that the CGE model anticipated in the range
      of 15–45 percent for the SADC countries.a In turn, countries such as Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, and Swaziland, which
      traditionally rely to a large extent on imports of maize from other SADC countries (Zimbabwe, South Africa, and Malawi),
      were hard hit on the consumption side. The combination of these effects is measured by the induced cost of maintaining
      pre-crisis real household consumption levels at post-crisis prices and GDP levels (compensating variations).b
            Poor households were particularly hit by price shocks, as they devote larger shares of consumption to maize (consistent
      with income elasticities lower than unity). The simulation results suggest that the real per capita consumption of the bottom
      40 percent of households residing in SADC countries declined by 1.7 percent, against only 0.1 percent for the population as a
      whole (box 1.2 table 1). The negative impact was particularly pronounced in Malawi (-11.8 percent), Tanzania (-7.5 percent),
      Lesotho (-6.2 percent), Swaziland (-4.7 percent), and Zimbabwe (-3.5 percent). It was only -0.5 percent in South Africa.
            Sadly, the countries that were most affected by El Niño are also those in the SADC region facing the tightest fiscal
      and external situations. Although foreign assistance is needed to address the effects of the current crisis, there is a need to
      integrate short- and longer-term mitigation solutions. Mitigation solutions can be grouped into three categories, responding to
      three complementary objectives: available financial resources, continued food supply, and protection of the poorest segments

                                 Facing the current crisis, several SADC countries have approached the World Bank for short- and longer-term solutions.
                           Demands have ranged from post-crisis needs assessments and budget support, to advice on risk mitigation options and
                           agriculture insurance programs. Initial responses from the World Bank have concentrated on (i) portfolio screening to
                           identify opportunities to support national emergency plans, (ii) development of emergency response financial operations, and
                           (iii) analytical overviews of potential longer-term disaster risk management instruments that could meet SADC countries’
                           specific needs.
                                 a. Between March 2015 and March 2016, nominal retail prices of white maize recorded the following variations:
                           Zimbabwe: +20 percent; Zambia: +41 percent; Tanzania: +64 percent; Swaziland: +54 percent; South Africa: +98 percent;
                           Mozambique: +121 percent; Malawi: +152 percent; and Lesotho: +33 percent. However, changes in food prices observed
                           on markets cannot necessarily be fully attributed to lower food supplies. Indeed, since 2015, SADC countries have seen their
                           overall macroeconomic situation deteriorate under the influence of two main factors: the decline in commodity prices, and
                           the reversal in capital flows due to rising global uncertainty. As a result, GDP growth in SADC decelerated from 3.8 percent
                           in 2013 and 3.0 percent in 2014, to 2.3 percent in 2015, and is projected at 2 percent in 2016. Reversal in capital
                           flows and lower export receipts led to sharp currency depreciation in several SADC countries, pressures on the balance of
                           payments, and accelerated inflation from exchange rate pass-through.
                                 b. For the sake of simplicity and to focus on the supply-side effects in SADC, these simulations do not factor in the
                           decline in the world price of maize recorded in recent years, from US$178 per ton in November 2014 to US$152 in
                           November 2016 (World Bank 2016b). Thus, it is likely that the simulations marginally overestimate the welfare costs of
                           El Niño.

                     1.3
                                 South Africa has come a long way since the advent of democracy in 1994. The democratic government embarked on
                           impressive efforts to make the economy inclusive, considerably expanding social spending and extending public services to
                           those who had been underserved under apartheid. The government managed to balance its new spending priorities with
                           fiscal prudence—a remarkable achievement rewarded by two of the world’s major credit rating agencies, Standard and
                           Poor’s (S&P) and Fitch, with the highly prized BBB- rating in 2000, judging South African debt to be of investment grade.
                           By 2005, South Africa’s rating had improved to BBB+. A decade on, the trend had reversed, as growth had slowed and
                           public debt increased markedly since the global financial crisis, bringing South Africa back to its BBB- rating by S&P and

                           Fitch, to which S&P added a negative outlook in December 2015, with Fitch following suit in December 2016.
                                 South Africans and investors were closely watching the reviews of rating agencies in 2016, and the markets partly
                           priced in at least one downgrade to sub-investment grade (sub-IG). To understand what the potential impact of South Africa
                           losing its investment-grade credit rating might be, a team of World Bank and SARB economists looked at the history of
                           past downgrades in 20 countries and estimated the impact on short-term borrowing costs. The study employs annual data
                           and only looks at short-term Treasury bills (where risk premia are more pronounced among longer-term debt instruments),
                           and there are still relatively few cases to study (most of them derive from the post–financial crisis period). Yet, given
                           these important caveats, the findings suggest that a downgrade to sub-IG by one major rating agency increased Treasury
                           bill yields by 138 basis points on average in the sample under study. When a second rater followed suit with such a

borrowing costs                  What would this downgrade mean for the economy? The World Bank modeled the impact of a risk premium shock that
                           increases the Treasury bill rate by 60 basis points in December 2016 (the time of the S&P and Fitch decisions) on the South

                           (Bloom 2009) and consumption decisions through higher cost of capital and an endogenous interest rate response. The
further                    flight of capital causes the nominal exchange rate to depreciate by 6 percent initially, which tapers back to its baseline as
                           the economy rebalances. The more competitive currency will improve trade, assuming the historical empirical estimates of
                           the exchange rate and trade hold. The trade response does not offset the fall in investment and consumption. However, the
                           pass-through to inflation would have been significant (the maximum impact on inflation occurs approximately two quarters
                           after the shock). The response of gross domestic product (GDP) factors is a reaction of the SARB to higher inflation. The
                           impact on GDP would have been most pronounced within two quarters of the shock (Box 1.3 figure 1), shaving a cumulative
                           1 percent off real GDP by end- 2017. This would translate into foregone nominal income of about ZAR 1,000 on average per
                           South African. The shock only dissipates three years after the shock, despite being temporary. The model assumes that the
                           authorities will react to the higher debt and ratings downgrade by reducing future expenditures, in an attempt to stabilize
                           the debt. This implies that public debt increases initially due to the shock, but ends up being lower after adjustments to
                           expenditure. GDP could still be lower if the exchange rate elasticity to exports is lower.

             Cathy Nkambule, age 56, is one of four owners of a flourishing rooftop vegetable garden atop a skyscraper in the
       inner city of Johannesburg. The garden has 26 tunnels covering bunches of spinach that are harvested daily and sold to               role, improving the
       a market within walking distance. This is the site of an urban farm run by one of the many cooperatives supported by
       the Johannesburg Municipal Government as part of an innovative urban agriculture program targeting households living                   lives of the poor
       in extreme poverty.
             “This (garden) has made a huge difference in my life. I never imagined that I would have a steady income let alone
       my own business. I now have a reason to wake up and to work hard at my own thing. I even have surplus to help others
       who are less fortunate,” she says.
             Ms. Nkambule is one of beneficiaries of the Johannesburg Municipal Government’s Food Resilience Program, which is
       aimed at tackling extreme poverty through urban agriculture. The program seeks to reduce the number of food insecure
       families by 20 percent, ensure that no one goes to bed hungry, create sustainable markets for subsistence and emerging
       farmers, and create decent jobs and disposable income. On the one hand, the program aims to reduce food insecurity by
       enabling beneficiaries to eat what they produce; on the other hand, the program promotes the emergence of farmers who
       are able to generate income and create jobs. The program was developed in response to a 2011 study by the University of
       Johannesburg, which showed that 42 percent of the city’s 4.5 million people go without at least one meal between three
       and 10 days in a month, with food accounting for up to 60 percent of the expenditures of the poor.
             The program’s objective is to wean beneficiaries from extreme poverty, to a level where they attain food security, create
       jobs, and generate their own income through a three-stage, staggered approach. Initially, the indigent families are given food
       parcels. At this stage, they receive training to enable them to transition to the next stage, in which they establish homestead,
       communal, or rooftop food gardens for which the municipality provides infrastructure support in the form of land, farming
       implements, electricity, water, seeds, training, and links to markets. The most successful farmers graduate into any of the
       municipality’s four Food Empowerment Zones (FEZs), which constitutes the third stage. FEZs leverage the municipal-owned
       large commercial farms and create opportunities for intensive farming by these emerging farmers. Eikenhoff, which is
       situated in the southern part of Johannesburg, is the biggest FEZ, spanning 270 hectares. It has cost a total investment
       of around ZAR 12 million since 2012. It benefits at least 160 families directly who are engaged in planting vegetables
       and livestock farming, including pig raising and poultry production. The other three FEZs have a collective 54 hectares
       and benefit at least 59 families, costing the municipality a total of about ZAR 10.8 million. Food gardens and FEZs are
       supported by seven agri-resource centers and satellites across the city, which provide advisory services, including registration
       of cooperatives. Ultimately, the goal of the Food Resilience Program is to enable beneficiaries to become self-sustainable
       emerging farmers, with government support expected to reduce as the beneficiaries graduate through the three stages.
       The program is important in a context where urban farming historically has been repressed, particularly in the townships,
       and in an environment in which the population of commercial farmers is aging, posing a threat to national food security.
       In 2010, approximately 3.5 percent of South African urban households were involved in some form of urban agriculture.
             This innovative program leverages the strengths of multiple partners, including the provincial government,
       nongovernmental organizations, universities, and the private sector. In Alexandra, one of the city’s poorest communities east
       of Johannesburg, a communal food garden owned by a group of seven cooperatives of local women has partnered with a
       commercial farmer. The private sector partner serves as an incubator, helping the group to navigate the agriculture produce
       value chain from planting to branding, packaging, and marketing the produce. The Alexandra project also sources produce
       from the Johannesburg fresh produce market to resell to hawkers in the community, to create a steady supply that would
       help stabilize prices. The aim is to create a fresh produce market within Alexandra through the development of a network

                           have become entrepreneurs who create jobs and generate income. To date, 107,466 indigent households have benefited
                           directly from the program. At least 240 emerging farmers have been linked to markets. More than a 1,000 people have
                           been trained in farming techniques. The program’s ability to attract multiple stakeholders will be key to its sustainability.

Box      Job creation and poverty reduction

2.1

               Relying on the Income and Expenditure Survey conducted in 2010, the World Bank estimates that the proportion
         of the South African population living below the international poverty lines of purchasing power parity (PPP) $1.9 and
         PPP$3.1 stood at 15.7 and 33.6 percent, respectively, in 2015 (World Bank 2016d). Admittedly, job creation is expected to
         be among the main factors to reduce poverty, by potentially boosting the incomes of the large group of unemployed poor.
               Using statistical matching techniques applied to the National Income Dynamics Study data for 2015, we estimate
         the impacts of job creation in different economic sectors on poverty. The method identifies unemployed individuals those                                     Job creation strongly
         whose characteristics (education, age, gender, and so forth) are closest to those of individuals employed in a given sector,
         and assumes that these individuals would be the direct beneficiaries of job creation in the said sector, having the greatest                                      reduces poverty
         likelihood of becoming employed. In turn, we estimate the net income impact for these individuals of getting a job in the
         said sector, estimating the wage they would now receive (using Mincer regressions), deducting unemployment benefits, and
         estimating their new eligibility for children’s grants, given their new labor income.
               Box 2.1 figure 1 reports the number of people (including members of the households from which the unemployed
         would become employed) that would be lifted out of poverty as a result of creating one job in a given sector. Creating
         one additional job in mining or agriculture lifts about 1.3 people from poverty. Increasing employment in construction
         and manufacturing also has a significant impact—the effect in these sectors is almost one to one. Employment in trade,
         financial services, and community services has a smaller impact—only seven in 10 people employed are elevated from
         poverty. Employment in financial intermediation is already geared toward a relatively better off and educated population;
         therefore, the impact of employment in this sector on poverty is lower than in other sectors. In some sectors, such as private
         household employees, the impact on poverty is relatively small, as the wages in those sectors are low and the impact of
         the loss of transfers on poverty is significant.

                                 South Africa’s industrial policies have a strong spatial dimension. First, they retain the objectives of balanced spatial
                           development, and the greater participation of marginalized regions, especially in the mainstream of the industrial economy.
                           Second, the provinces and cities have a direct mandate and responsibility in the implementation of various aspects of such
                           policies, most notably the special economic zones (SEZs).
                                 The SEZ Act was gazetted in 2014. Under the framework of the act, the South African authorities envisage the
                           development of 15 SEZs across the country, supported by various tax incentives (reduced corporate rates, capital allowances,
                           and employment subsidies) and direct infrastructure financing from the central government (through the dedicated SEZ fund).
                           (As of November 2016, seven locations had been designated.) International evidence suggests that SEZs can be responsible
Box   Promises and challenges of spatialized industrial policies (continued)

      for substantial job creation if they can generate employment spillovers (indirect job creation outside the SEZ) through
      backward supply chain linkages that arise from the newly established investments. In line with international evidence,
      projections for South Africa’s SEZs suggest that indirect jobs vastly outnumber the direct jobs created in the zones, see Box
      2.2 figure 1. Indirect jobs include construction jobs, but over the medium term, supply chain linkages will be the critical
      channel if SEZs are to deliver on their promise as large-scale job creators.

            Making this happen thus requires strong policy coordination provision between the government, provinces, and
      cities, with a view to maximize the integration potential of SEZs in local economies. Nowadays, this level of coordination
      constitutes a challenge in South Africa, in the absence of clear guidelines and overlapping responsibilities in the provision
      of complementary infrastructure and services to the SEZs, licensing and regulation of investment in the SEZs, and sharing
      of financial risks across public partners related to SEZ management.a Neither the SEZ Act nor its regulations make any
      reference to cities, urban areas, or metropolitan areas, and as such there exist no provisions that support or preclude
      a formal relationship between the SEZs and the municipalities where they are located. Thus, the lack of clear guidelines
      is reflected in the different fortunes of coordination observed in different zones. For example, development of the SEZ
      at Dube Tradeport was initially hampered by the project’s location being beyond the “edge” defined in the eThekwini
      municipality’s spatial development plan. More recently, examples of successful planning collaboration in Cape Town and
      Ekurhuleni highlight the importance of coordinating efforts to facilitate access to land (in alignment with province and
      city spatial development plans), streamlining regulatory approval processes, improving transport access for workers, and
      supporting training and skills development. Coordination also needs to address explicitly the burden sharing of the financial
      risks and contingent liabilities that may eventually arise and fall disproportionally on local governments in the long run.
      These risks and responsibilities stem from local government responsibility, which often assigns license holders to manage
      the SEZs (which may become financially unsustainable for various reasons), and from the capital investments linked to
      SEZs that municipalities will need to sustain in the medium term after initial funding from the national government has
      disappeared.28
            Locating SEZs with a view to foster balanced development could also undermine the possibility to meet other industrial
      development objectives, such as job creation in particular. Indeed, locating SEZs in metropolitan areas, where most growth
      and job creation will likely continue to occur, provides the best chance of unlocking the agglomeration forces that will
      make SEZs economically successful and better integrated in local economies. These agglomeration forces may arise in three
      broad areas. First, a larger market allows for a more efficient sharing of indivisible facilities (such as infrastructure), risks,
      and the gains from variety and specialization. For instance, a larger cluster of firms will make it easier to construct a
      dedicated facility or, for specialized input providers, to pay a fixed cost and enter the (larger) local market. Second, a larger
      market allows for better matching between employers and employees, buyers and suppliers, partners in joint projects, or
      entrepreneurs and financiers. Third, a larger market can facilitate learning about new technologies, market evolutions, or

                            new forms of organization. Direct interactions between economic agents in a cluster can therefore facilitate the creation,
                            diffusion, and accumulation of knowledge.
                                  Hence, although there are indisputable gains to be had from more equitable geographical distribution of economic
                            activity, there is also clear evidence that increasing urbanization has strong, positive externalities through deeper and more
                            extensive forward and backward linkages. In this context, the approach to spatial industrial policy in general, and to SEZs
                            in particular, may benefit from being more attentive to exploiting the potential of urban agglomerations to deliver the
                            large-scale job creation that is urgently needed in South Africa. This may be all the more critical in a constrained fiscal
42                          environment (see Chapter 1), where the spread of public investment may seriously dilute its impact.

      income economies, and China’s rebalancing of its production toward domestic markets. Combined, these shocks had a very

            In all likelihood, such ample variations in relative prices are expected to influence investment decisions, given their
      impact on the relative profitability of capital across sectors. For instance, the 38 percent drop in the export price of other
      mining combined with the 17 percent increase in the remuneration of capital and labor observed across sectors should
      have significantly reduced the profitability of the sector. Nonetheless, the impact of these shocks is difficult to estimate
      for a couple reasons: first, because other factors may have influenced investment decisions over the same period (one of
      them being “policy uncertainty” reflected in short-term exchange rate volatility; another one being insufficient electricity
      and inland transport capacity); and second, because the period might be too short to observe the long-term consequences
      of shocks.
            For these reasons, we employ a computable general equilibrium model to assess ex ante the long-term impact of the
      shocks. The model is static, in the sense that the quantity of factors of production (labor types by skills, capital) is fixed
      and fully used. The model also assumes perfect factor mobility across sectors, to identify the impact of shocks on long-term
      investment decisions (capital reallocation) under perfect factor market competition. Obviously, the reality is different, as
      the potential market failures that could justify the industrial policy discussed in this Chapter are not considered in this
      modeling exercise. But these assumptions are precisely useful to identify potential comparative advantages that could be
      mobilized through the correction of market failures. In other words, the assumptions are useful for assessing the scalability
      of some policy interventions as helping a given sector to realize its comparative advantage and meet its effective business
      opportunities.
            The model is built using a social accounting matrix for 2012 (Chitiga-Mabugu 2016). The model comprises 54 sectors of
      activities, four labor types, capital, 12 trade partners, and one representative household. It assumes imperfect substitutability
      between imports and domestic products (on the demand side), as well as between exports and domestic products (on the
      supply side). The model assumes imperfect substitution elasticities (equal to 1.0, equivalent to Cobb-Douglas functions of
      production) between factors of production, and fixed consumption of intermediate inputs in proportion of total output
      (and thus value added) at the sector level (Leontief structure). Traditional closure rules apply, including (i) savings-driven

                             investments, (ii) fixed trade balance, and (iii) fixed real government expenditures and policy tax rates (thus, an endogenous
                             fiscal balance affecting the savings available for investment).
                                   We use the model to simulate the long-term impact of the observed variations between 2012 and 2015 in the terms
                             of trade, through exchange rate variations and changes in commodity prices (as reported in box 2.3 figure 2; induced
                             variations in the Consumer Price Index and GDP deflator being endogenously determined by the model). The simulation
                             results suggest that the terms of trade observed between 2012 and 2015 induced a negative transfer from the rest of the
52                           word, equivalent in real terms to 4.0 percent of GDP in 2012. This estimate, which is to be compared with the actual 5.3
                             percent cumulative real GDP growth over 2012–15 (1.7 percent a year) could be interpreted as a lower bound estimate,
                             as market failures could have inhibited efficient factor reallocation across sectors. In other words, cumulative real GDP
                             growth could have at least reached 9.3 percent in the absence of such shocks (3.0 percent a year). The results also suggest
                             that the induced decline in the real remuneration of factors was felt differently across sectors. On the one hand, the
                             remuneration of unskilled labor and capital declined by 6.0 and 1.8 percent, respectively, with respect to the GDP deflator.
                             On the other hand, remuneration increased for informal labor by 9.2 percent (highly concentrated in retail trade, one of
                             the main beneficiary sectors of the shocks), for highly skilled labor by 3.2 percent, and for skilled labor by 2.6 percent.

                             demand for skilled and informal labor, and lower demand for capital and unskilled labor.

                                  From a sector perspective, the results suggest that capital would need to be reallocated toward manufacturing (based
                             on nonferrous metals), trade and accommodation (wholesale and retail trade). and financial services (business services) to
                             meet new comparative advantages. Capital would need to be reallocated away from the mining sector (other mining), which
                             would see its share in total capital stock drop from 11.8 to 7.5 percent. (A second best option, more likely to materialize
                             in the short run, is a strong decline in mining profitability, given capital’s relative inertia across sectors.)
