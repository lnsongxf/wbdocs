EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Agriculture remains vital to Kenya’s economic growth. It is also vital to the country’s
food security and poverty reduction eﬀorts. Because the vast majority of Kenya’s poor
depend on smallholder agriculture for their livelihood, increasing their productivity
can contribute at once to improving food availability, increasing rural incomes, lower-
ing poverty rates, and growing the economy. Putting more and better seeds, fertilizers,
and other inputs into the hands of farmers and pastoralists and ﬁnding ways to link
them more directly to markets are among the key thrusts of current sector develop-
ment policies. More broadly, Kenya’s Vision 2030 aims in part to transform the coun-
try’s agriculture from subsistence to a more competitive and commercially oriented
sector, one that can meet the country’s food needs, expand exports, and become a key
engine for forward growth.

Despite Kenya’s strong commitment to agriculture, sectoral growth remains well below
the 6 percent target, and meaningful gains in productivity and in rolling back rural
poverty have been slow in coming. The Economic Survey 2014 shows that the agricul-
ture sector grew by a mere 2.9 percent in 2013, down from 4.2 percent a year earlier.
Moreover, Kenya continues to rely heavily on imports to feed its growing population1
amid a widening structural imbalance in key food staples.

Key constraints limiting sector growth are well documented, as are associated response
measures. Less well understood is how risk dynamics associated with production, mar-
kets, and policy adversely impact sector performance, in terms of both inﬂuencing
ex ante decision making among farmers, traders, and other sector stakeholders and
causing ex post losses to crops, livestock, and incomes—destabilizing livelihoods and
jeopardizing the country’s food security.

The present study was commissioned in part to bridge this knowledge gap. It is the
ﬁrst step in a multiphase process designed to integrate a stronger risk focus into sector
planning and development programs. It seeks to learn from and build on a range of

CHAPTER ONE
INTRODUCTION
Despite myriad challenges, Kenya has emerged in recent years as one of Africa’s
“frontier economies,” with headline growth in the most recent decade propelling the
country toward middle-income status. Poverty rates have declined, while gross domes-
tic product (GDP) per capita ($943 in 2012) has more than doubled. Average real GDP
growth was 5.1 percent during 2010–13. Spurred by its dynamic business commu-
nity, strong communication and transport links, and relatively well-developed ﬁnancial
and services sectors, Kenya is today among the top ﬁve destinations for foreign direct
investment in Sub-Saharan Africa.7 Yet despite recent gains, poverty remains a major
challenge. Moving ahead, the Government of Kenya (GoK) has set ambitious eco-
nomic growth and poverty reduction targets; the economy is expected to expand by
6.3–6.5 percent during 2014–16 (IMF 2014a). Achieving these targets will depend to a
large extent on the future performance of Kenya’s agriculture sector.

A principal source of employment and major contributor to GDP, agriculture remains
vital to the Kenyan economy. Nearly three in four Kenyans live in rural areas and are
actively engaged in the production, processing, and marketing of crop, livestock, ﬁsh, and
forest products. The sector accounts for an estimated 75 percent of informal employment
and is the principal source of rural income and livelihoods. It also generates nearly two-
thirds (65 percent) of merchandise exports and roughly 60 percent of foreign exchange
earnings (World Bank 2013). In the ﬁve years ending in 2012, the sector’s annual contri-
bution to GDP averaged 27.3 percent (29.9 percent in 2012). Not surprisingly, Kenya’s
GDP growth is highly correlated with agriculture sector growth (ﬁgure 1.1).

Launched in 2008, Kenya’s Vision 2030 strategy identiﬁes agriculture as one of six
priority sectors critical to delivering on the GoK’s economic growth target of 10 per-
cent per annum. The second Medium Term Plan (MTP-II) of Vision 2030 covers
the period 2013–2017 and looks to build on successes achieved in MTP-I (2008–12).
Under MTP-II, objectives include maintenance of a stable macroeconomic environ-
ment, modernization of infrastructure, and diversiﬁcation and commercialization

 Kenya was ranked as the ﬁfth and fourth most popular destination for foreign direct investment in terms of new
projects in 2011 and 2012, respectively, according to Ernst & Young (2013).

CHAPTER TWO
AGRICULTURE SECTOR IN KENYA
To inform the analysis and discussion of agricultural risk in Kenya, this chapter
presents an overview of the country’s agriculture sector.12 Sector characteristics
most pertinent to risk are given particular attention. Analysis primarily covers the
33-year period from 1980 to 2012 to assess the frequency and severity of the most
important risks.

Kenya is endowed with diverse physical features, including its low-lying arid and semi-
arid lands (ASALs), an extensive coastal belt, plateaus, highlands, and the lake basin
around Lake Victoria. Yet Kenya’s agricultural resource base is best characterized by
the limited availability of productive land. An estimated 17 percent of the country
receives average annual rainfall of more than 800 mm, the minimum required for
rainfed agriculture. The remaining land (83 percent) is arid or semiarid, generally
unsuitable for rainfed farming or intensive livestock production. Cropland occupies
approximately 31 percent, with grazing land (30 percent), forests (22 percent), and
game parks, urban centers, markets, homesteads, and infrastructure accounting for
the rest (GoK 2010b).

Three main land tenure systems exist in Kenya, each of which inﬂuences produc-
tion systems in diﬀerent ways: communal lands, government trust lands, and privately
owned lands. The communal land ownership system is based on traditional customary
rights, in which individuals have a right to use but not sell land. Privately owned lands
are registered; the owner holds the title under a freehold or leasehold system. In pasto-
ral areas, trust land is the dominant tenure arrangement.

Agriculture in Kenya covers small-, medium-, and large-scale farming, with small-
holder farmers accounting for more than three-quarters of total production. Produc-
tion is heavily reliant on rainfed systems. An estimated 7 percent is irrigated.




12
  Broadly, the sector comprises six subsectors: cash crops, food crops, horticulture, livestock, ﬁsheries, and forestry. This
study focuses on cash crops, food crops, horticulture, and livestock.

CHAPTER THREE
AGRICULTURE SECTOR RISKS
The main sources of agricultural risk in Kenya are reviewed in this chapter. These
include production risks, market risks, and a general set of risks associated with the
enabling environment for agriculture. The incidence and implications of multiple or
successive shocks are also considered.

PRODUCTION RISKS
Based on analysis of available quantitative and qualitative data, the most common
risks to agricultural production in Kenya are drought, ﬂooding, and crop and live-
stock pest and disease outbreaks. The incidence of these and other adverse events
is indicated in ﬁgure 3.1, based on reports of adverse events for the period 1980–
2012. Drought emerges as by far the most common source of production shocks, fol-
lowed by ﬂoods, which have a much lower impact on crop and livestock production.
Related risk events (e.g., pest/disease outbreaks, bushﬁres) may occur in isolation but
can also present as multiple, overlapping shocks, with far greater impacts and higher
associated losses.


DROUGHT
An agricultural drought22 occurs when a deﬁcit of soil moisture signiﬁcantly reduces
crop yields. It can occur in response to low overall annual rainfall or to abnormalities
in the timing and distribution of annual rainfall.

Table 3.1 and table 3.2 are based on analysis of annual rainfall data collected from
12 weather stations for which consistent and reliable information was available for the
period 1981–2011. It is worth noting that these weather stations are well distributed



22
  Inadequate rainfall at key periods during the crop production cycle (seeding, ﬂowering, and grain ﬁlling) aﬀects crop
yields, even when overall rainfall is comparable to long-term norms. During these periods, a soil moisture deﬁcit during
a period as short as 10 days can have a major impact on crop yields. Drought is typically deﬁned relative to some long-
term average balance between precipitation and evapotranspiration, which is considered “normal” for a particular
location at a particular time of year. Drought is thus a relative concept in that suboptimal soil moisture levels and crop
yields in one agroclimatic area may be acceptable in another.

  Kenya’s dairy sector has only recently fully recovered from a 15-year crisis caused in part by mismanagement. Government ser-
  vices to the sector were reliable until the mid-1980s, but started failing in the 1990s and collapsed in early 2000 due to corruption
  and mismanagement in the cooperative sector. This caused a decline in milk handling of 266 million liters (estimated value $43
  million). A failure to pay producers for milk in 1994 alone caused a loss in excess of $16 million. Amid failing public services,
  privatization of the sector and service delivery began in 1993, including artiﬁcial insemination. With privatization and recession
  in the sector, concentrate feed production also dropped during 1993–94. Counterparty risk in the milk sector due to manipulation
  of Kenya Cooperative Creameries (KCC) board members led to delays and failures in payment. In 2008, livestock concentrate
  and fodder (hay) prices increased by 40 percent and 100 percent, respectively, due to postelection violence and impacts from the
  global ﬁnancial crisis, and in 2010, a substantial surplus in milk production caused market glut and farmer distress.

CHAPTER FOUR
ADVERSE IMPACTS OF AGRICULTURAL RISKS
The frequency, severity, and costs of adverse events are analyzed in this chapter
as the basis for prioritizing the various sources of risk. The conceptual and meth-
odological basis described below is applied to production, market, and enabling
environment risks. The various sources of risk are then reviewed to discern the
most critical ones.

CONCEPTUAL AND METHODOLOGICAL
BASIS FOR ANALYSIS
For the purposes of this study, risk is deﬁned as an exposure to a signiﬁcant ﬁnancial
loss or other adverse outcome whose occurrence and severity is unpredictable. Risk
thus implies exposure to substantive losses over and above the normal costs of doing
business. In agriculture, farmers incur moderate losses each year due to unexpected
events such as suboptimal climatic conditions at diﬀerent times in the production cycle
and/or modest departures from expected output or input prices. Risk within the con-
text of the current analysis refers to the more severe and unpredictable events that
occur beyond these smaller events and that result in substantial losses to assets and
livelihoods at the aggregate, sector level.

This concept diﬀers from the common perception of “risk” by farmers and traders
based on year-to-year variability of production and prices. It should also be distin-
guished from constraints, which are predictable and constant limitations to productiv-
ity and growth faced by farmers and other agricultural stakeholders. In Kenya, these
constraints include poor access to farm inputs, limited access to markets, limited credit,
poor infrastructure, and the decreasing size of landholdings.


LOSS THRESHOLDS
As agricultural production is inherently variable, the immediate step for analysis is to
deﬁne loss thresholds that distinguish adverse events from smaller, interannual variations
in output. This is achieved by ﬁrst estimating a time trend of “expected” production
in any given year, based on actual production, and treating the downside diﬀerence

CHAPTER FIVE
STAKEHOLDER VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT
Agricultural shocks are one important factor driving chronic poverty and food inse-
curity in Kenya. Shocks impact household well-being by limiting food availability,
weakening food access, and negatively aﬀecting monetary well-being through the
depletion of productive assets. Chronically vulnerable groups with high exposure
to hazards experience a disproportionately large impact from adverse events and
lack coping mechanisms available to other groups. In this context, vulnerability is
a useful lens through which to examine agricultural shocks because it allows policy
makers to determine which groups are most aﬀected and to target risk management
solutions accordingly.


GENERAL TRENDS IN VULNERABILITY
Some general considerations and trends concerning human development and vulner-
ability in Kenya are as follows:
     » Levels of human development, poverty, and food insecurity vary widely between
        regions.
     » Exposure to extreme weather events is highly correlated with being poor and
        being food insecure.
     » About 70 percent of Kenya’s poor live in the central and western regions, in
        areas that have medium to high potential for agriculture (IFAD 2013).
     » Poverty and food insecurity are acute in the country’s ASALs, which have been
        severely aﬀected by recurrent droughts.


LIVELIHOODS AND AGROCLIMATIC
CONDITIONS
Especially in rural areas, patterns of livelihood activities are strongly inﬂuenced by
the prevailing agroclimatic conditions, which determine planting calendars, soil qual-
ity, and crop suitability. Approximately 80 percent of Kenya’s land area lies in the

RISK PRIORITIZATION AND MANAGEMENT

RISK PRIORITIZATION
This assessment has highlighted the Kenyan agriculture sector’s key inherent risks,
which are both numerous and complex. They manifest with varying levels of fre-
quency and severity and can result in substantial losses to crops and livestock,
which can have profound short- and long-term impacts on income and livelihoods.
Putting in place eﬀective risk management measures can help to reduce agricul-
tural stakeholders’ vulnerability and the impacts of related shocks to production
and marketing systems. In resource-constrained environments, however, it is virtu-
ally impossible to address all risks at once. Thus, a prioritization of interventions is
needed to address the risks that occur most frequently and that cause the greatest
ﬁnancial losses.

Chapters 3 and 4 identiﬁed priority risks using quantitative measures and anecdo-
tal evidence collected directly from crop and livestock subsectors stakeholders. Due
to the paucity of data, some risks could not be quantiﬁed so the assessment team
relied more on qualitative measures. Based on the team’s combined quantitative
and qualitative assessment, ﬁgure 6.1 prioritizes the most important risks for focus
crop and livestock subsectors. These were validated at a roundtable at MoALF in
Nairobi on February 7, 2014. The ﬁgure shows a summary of the agricultural risks
sorted on the basis of the probability of each event and its anticipated ﬁnancial
losses. The grayer the area, the more signiﬁcant is the risk. Overall, this prioritiza-
tion identiﬁed the most important risks facing Kenya’s agriculture sector to be (1)
severe drought, aﬀecting both crop and livestock production; (2) price volatility; and
(3) crop and livestock diseases. Erratic rainfall, ﬂoods, cattle rustling, and conﬂict
were also deemed important, but to a lesser extent.

  The Livestock Emergency Guidelines and Standards (LEGS) provide a set of international guidelines and standards for the design, implementation, and assessment
of livestock interventions to assist people aﬀected by humanitarian crises. Established in 2005, the LEGS Project is overseen by a Steering Group of individuals from
the EU, FAO, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the Feinstein International Center at Tufts University, the World Society for the Protection of Animals,
and Vetwork UK.

CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ON
AGRICULTURE IN KENYA

INTRODUCTION
Like those of many of the countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Kenya’s agriculture sector
is highly vulnerable to the eﬀects of climate change. The country’s climate is already
characterized by high temperatures and low but highly variable annual precipitation,
factors that negatively aﬀect the productivity of heat-sensitive crops. Climate change
is a long-term trend that will exacerbate natural resource constraints on agricultural
production in Kenya by making weather patterns more variable and by increasing
the frequency and intensity of severe weather events. As a result, climate change will
directly aﬀect the incidence of some agricultural risk events and indirectly aﬀect the
incidence of others. Understanding how climate change trends aﬀect farm productiv-
ity is essential to formulating an agricultural risk management plan that maximizes the
use of scarce resources. Regardless of the future extent of global warming, identifying
and implementing risk management strategies that address agricultural risks, includ-
ing those exacerbated by climate change, can reduce volatility and improve sustain-
ability in the sector.

Due to the importance of the agriculture sector in Kenya’s national economy, cli-
mate change impacts on crop yields and land suitability will have far-reaching eﬀects.
Agriculture accounts for 24 percent of national GDP and 65 percent of all export
earnings (GoK 2012a). Agriculture also plays a key role in poverty reduction and
food security through its contribution to livelihood security. The sector employs more
than 75 percent of the workforce and generates most of the country’s food require-
ments. Within the sector, smallholder farms account for 85 percent of employment
and 75 percent of total agricultural output (GoK 2012a). In the Mapping the Impacts
of Climate Change index under “Agricultural Productivity Loss,” the Center for Global
Development ranks Kenya 13 out of 233 countries globally for “direct risks” due to
“extreme weather” and 71 out of 233 countries for “overall vulnerability” to climate
change when adjusted for coping ability.

INTRODUCTION
Philip Mbai is a 68-year-old small-scale farmer in Machakos County. He bought his
23-acre farm in 1978 while still working as an administrative clerk with Gailey and
Roberts, Ltd, an engineering ﬁrm, and settled down to full-time farming in 2000. He
practices mixed farming and grows maize and beans on 8 and 4 acres, respectively, and
commits another 2 acres each to green grams and cowpea and approximately another
2 acres to fruits (mangoes, bananas, and oranges) and vegetables (kales, onions, toma-
toes, and cabbages). The remainder of his farm is used for growing pasture to feed his
four exotic cattle (Guernsey) and another six indigenous cattle. A small portion is also
dedicated to bee farming, with an apiary of about 50 beehives featuring traditional log
hives, Kenya top bar hives, and modern Langstroth bee hives.


OVERVIEW OF KEY FARM ACTIVITIES
Except for the production of vegetables, Mr. Mbai’s crop production is purely rainfed,
with low attainable yields of below 0.5 ton/acre (about 10 90-kg bags per acre) largely
attributed to low and unreliable rainfall. Located about 1,600 meters above sea level,
his farm receives less than 800 mm of rainfall annually on average, although in the last
10 years, average annual rainfall has been below 600 mm and is falling. The farm serves
as a meteorological monitoring site for rainfall data and has a ﬁtted rain gauge that Mr.
Mbai monitors on a daily basis. In a good year, Mr. Mbai makes about K Sh 500/bag,
which translates to K Sh 40,000 a year. On average, Mr. Mbai derives 30 percent of his
income from maize farming and the rest from the other farm activities.

APPENDIX C
STAKEHOLDER VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS
Agricultural shocks are one important factor driving chronic poverty and food insecu-
rity in Kenya. Shocks impact household well=being in a variety of ways, by limiting
food availability, weakening food access, and negatively aﬀecting monetary well-being
through the depletion of productive assets. Chronically vulnerable groups with high
exposure to hazards experience a disproportionately large impact from adverse events
and lack coping mechanisms available to other groups. In this context, vulnerability
is a useful lens through which to examine agricultural shocks because it allows policy
makers to determine which groups are most aﬀected and to target risk management
solutions accordingly.

GENERAL TRENDS IN VULNERABILITY
    » Levels of human development, poverty, and food insecurity vary widely between
      regions.
    » Exposure to extreme weather events is highly correlated with being poor and
      being food insecure.
    » About 70 percent of Kenya’s poor live in the central and western regions, in
      areas that have medium to high potential for agriculture (IFAD 2013).
    » Poverty and food insecurity are acute in Kenya’s arid and semiarid lands
      (ASALs), which have been severely aﬀected by recurrent droughts.

VULNERABILITY, LIVELIHOODS,
AND AGROCLIMATIC CONDITIONS
Especially in rural areas, patterns of livelihood activities are strongly inﬂuenced by
prevailing agroclimatic conditions, which determine planting calendars, soil quality,
and crop suitability. Approximately 80 percent of Kenya’s land area lies in the ASALs,
home to more than 30 percent of the population and 75 percent of the country’s live-
stock (GoK 2011). ASAL districts have the highest incidence of poverty in the country,
contain 18 of Kenya’s 20 poorest constituencies, and are predominantly inhabited
by pastoralists and agro-pastoralists (GoK 2009). Pastoralist districts consistently rank
below the national average in terms of Human Development Index (HDI) scores

WEATHER AND YIELD IMPACT ANALYSIS

BACKGROUND
The World Bank is conducting a study on the eﬀect of several climatic events on dif-
ferent crops’ yield in Kenya. The purpose of the study is to determine whether and by
how much yield is aﬀected by climatic events.

Figure E.1 shows the political division of Kenya prior to implementation of the 2010
Constitution; at that time, Kenya had eight provinces.

OPTIONS FOR SCALING UP LIVESTOCK
INSURANCE IN KENYA

In the recent past, livestock insurance has gained a lot of interest in Kenya as a viable
solution to addressing covariate risks like those associated with drought. International
Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) has piloted index based livestock insurance (IBLI)
in arid and semiarid land (ASAL) regions of Kenya. The pilot started in Marsabit
County in 2010 is now in three counties (Marsabit, Wajir, and Isiolo), and ILRI has
plans to expand to all 14 counties34 in ASAL regions. Through IBLI, farmers are
able to cushion themselves against the impact of droughts, which have increased in
frequency and severity, a phenomenon associated with climate change. In Kenya, 28
severe droughts have been recorded in the last 100 years, including four droughts in
the last 10 years. In the major drought of 2000, major animal losses occurred. Analysis
undertaken by ILRI on IBLI has shown that providing access to insurance creates an
eﬀective safety net for vulnerable-but-non-poor pastoralists.

The importance of agricultural insurance in addressing food security seems to have
been embraced by Kenya’s current crop of politicians. In the 2013 presidential elec-
tion, provision of agricultural insurance was one of the key pledges of candidates. The
coalition that won the election included livestock insurance as part of its party mani-
festo. Kenya’s agricultural/livestock insurance policy is clearly spelled out in Executive
Order No. 2, which outlines what the current government intends to achieve. Medium
Term Plan II (MTP-II), which covers 2013–2017, recognizes the importance of live-
stock insurance and talks of establishing a National Livestock Insurance Scheme.

To keep its political promise and to implement the projects spelled out in MTP-II,
the government of Kenya (GoK) through the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and
Fisheries (MoALF) sought support from the World Bank Agriculture Insurance Devel-
opment Program (AIDP) to assist in formulating a large-scale national agricultural
insurance program as a public-private partnership (PPP). Starting in January 2014,
