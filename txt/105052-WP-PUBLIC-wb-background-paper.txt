Executive Summary

•	   Mental disorders impose an enormous burden on society, accounting
     for almost one in three years lived with disability globally.

•	   In addition to their health impact, mental disorders cause a significant
     economic burden due to lost economic output and the link between
     mental disorders and costly, potentially fatal conditions including
     cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, HIV, and obesity.

•	   80% of the people likely to experience an episode of a mental disorder
     in their lifetime come from low- and middle-income countries.

•	    Two of the most common forms of mental disorders, anxiety and
     depression, are prevalent, disabling, and respond to a range of
     treatments that are safe and effective. Yet, owing to stigma and
     inadequate funding, these disorders are not being treated in most
     primary care and community settings.

•	   Confronting mental disorders will require new sources of funding
     to bridge current resource gaps. Investment from a combination
     of national governments and international development partners
     could bridge these gaps and result in cost-effective mental health
     interventions.

•	   This funding will provide a strong return on investment, with scale-up
     leading to good returns in restored productivity as well as
     improved health.

devoted to mental health and budgetary
constraints in the world’s poorest regions means
that the countries that can least afford lost

There are a number of ways this could occur:
For example, natural synergies exist between
mental health and other non-communicable
diseases, and there is a growing awareness of
the importance of mental health in the fields of
maternal and child health. Cooperation across
sectors also provides an opportunity for funders,
including multilateral finance institutions such
as WBG; regional development banks such as
the Inter-American Development Bank, the
Asian Development Bank, and the African
Development Bank; regional bodies such as the
European Commission; bilateral agencies such as
the Department for International Development,
the Japan International Cooperation Agency,
and the United States Agency for International
Development; and philanthropies such as the
Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Bloomberg
Philanthropies, the Nippon Foundation, and the
Rockefeller Foundation, to use existing service
platforms to support the scaling up of mental
health treatment and care. For example, a bilateral
donor or philanthropy could contribute to the
WBG’s Global Financing Facility’s support of Every
Woman Every Child with funding earmarked
for mental health prevention and treatment.
Investment in other areas, including education,
social protection, and labor and employment,
could also be utilized to respond to the unique
needs of vulnerable groups. Multi-sector packages

                          and humanitarian aid; social inclusion and poverty reduction; and

                          leadership is needed to make mental health a priority, to commit to
                          innovative and quality services, to channel resources toward mental
                          health systems, and to strengthen community services.

                     •	   Mental health works: Introduce or strengthen programs that promote
                          and protect mental well-being into general health services (integrated
                          care), school curricula (life skills), and occupational health schemes
                          (wellness at work); and promote better coordination across these
                          platforms and sectors.

                     •	   Mental health needs: Devote additional resources from development
                          assistance donors and domestic health budgets towards implementing
                          community-based mental-health programs and strengthening the
