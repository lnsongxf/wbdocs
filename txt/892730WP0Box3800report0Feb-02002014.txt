   Executive Summary


Gender Equality in the World of Work Matters
  Jobs can bring gains for women, their families, businesses, and communities.
Jobs boost self-esteem and pull families out of poverty. Yet gender disparities persist in
the world of work. Closing these gaps, while working to stimulate job creation more
broadly, is a prerequisite for ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity.
   Gender equality in the world of work is a win-win on many fronts. A large
and growing body of evidence demonstrates both the business and the development
case. Booz & Company estimates that raising female employment to male levels
could have a direct impact on GDP, increasing it by 34 percent in Egypt, 12 percent
in the United Arab Emirates, 10 percent in South Africa, and 9 percent in Japan,
taking into account losses in economy-wide labor productivity that could occur as
new workers entered the labor force.1 Yet almost half of women’s productive poten-
tial globally is unutilized, compared to 22 percent of men’s, according to the Inter-
national Labour Organization.2 In places where women’s paid work has increased,
as in Latin America and the Caribbean, gains have made significant contributions
to overall poverty reduction.
   Both the World Development Report 2013 on Jobs (WDR 2013) and the World
Development Report 2012 on Gender Equality and Development (WDR 2012)
provide valuable and complementary frameworks to help policy makers advance
gender equality in the world of work. The WDR 2013 approach helps us to under-
stand how and when promoting gender equality in the world of work adds significant
development value. The WDR 2012, meanwhile, offers an important framework for
diagnosing and addressing gender-specific constraints. An important link between
the two WDRs is the notion of agency—women’s ability to make choices they value
and to act on those choices. Jobs can increase women’s agency by expanding their life
choices and their capacity to better support their families and more actively partici-
pate in communities and societies. Conversely, significant constraints on agency pose
major barriers to women’s work and help explain the persistence of gender gaps.
   Following the WDR 2013, “jobs” are broadly defined to include various
forms of wage and non-wage work, formal and informal. Informal work is the
largest source of employment throughout Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, and
working women are more likely than working men to be self-employed or farming.
The jobs that are best for women’s economic empowerment—and development
goals more broadly—depend on country-specific jobs challenges.

  Introduction
  Engendering Jobs


  Key messages

  ▶▶ Gender inequality is a major part of the global jobs challenge. Appro-
     priate responses require leveling the playing field and creating the
     types of jobs that can empower women.
  ▶▶ Reducing gender gaps in the world of work can yield big development
     payoffs. These extend beyond benefits to the women themselves,
     including spillover effects on children, enhanced poverty reduction,
     catalyzing business productivity, and broader social cohesion.
  ▶▶ Policy strategies geared toward economic growth or increasing general
     education levels, although necessary, are generally insufficient to close
     gender gaps. Targeted, gender-specific, and multi-sectoral solutions are
     also needed to respond to country-specific constraints.
  ▶▶ Connecting women’s agency with economic opportunities and taking a
     lifecycle approach lead to better, more comprehensive policy actions.




Context: Gender and the Jobs Challenge
   Today, as ever, the global spotlight remains squarely on jobs. As the World De-
velopment Report 2013: Jobs1 (WDR 2013) underscores, good jobs are not just the
engine of poverty reduction or a derivative of growth—they are transformative in
and of themselves and can help drive development. Yet the challenge is daunting.
Globally, 200 million people—disproportionately youth—are unemployed and ac-
tively looking for work.2 Solving the jobs challenge is critical to achieving the World
Bank Group’s twin goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity.
   Underlying this immense task is the challenge of equitable access to economic
opportunities. This has many aspects, including income, racial and ethnic dispari-
ties. This report focuses on one dimension of inequality that is often related to other
aspects of disadvantage. The starting point is the recognition that women are dis-
advantaged globally on virtually every indicator in the world of work3—earnings,
quality of employment, employment status, participation—and that these differ-
ences matter for development.
  The global jobs challenge is also about fostering the types of jobs that add the
greatest development value. In many low-income countries, unemployment is low
but underemployment is high, and the available jobs often lack basic rights and pro-
tections, not to mention opportunities for advancement. Only about one in four
of the world’s adult population was employed full-time by an employer in 2012.4

  Stylized Facts About Gender at Work


  Key messages

  ▶▶ Gender gaps in the world of work arise in multiple forms, including
     types of jobs, firms, and farming; earnings; and rates of participation.
     Diagnostics examine multiple dimensions together for a fuller picture.
  ▶▶ Women and men sort into different types of economic activity, includ-
     ing different occupations, sectors, industries, and types of firms.
  ▶▶ Women consistently earn less than men, with gaps largely traced to
     sorting.
  ▶▶ Women’s farming and entrepreneurship is generally less productive and
     profitable than men’s because of gender differences in firm characteris-
     tics and access to productive inputs rather than differences in ability.
  ▶▶ Women’s labor force participation globally has stagnated, falling
     slightly from 57 percent in 1990 to 55 percent in 2012.




  The gender differences in the world of work are striking, extensive and enduring.
They exist in multiple dimensions. Although the most obvious gap is in labor force
participation rates, there are other persistent gender gaps—in earnings and types of
jobs, particularly—that affect the extent to which paid work expands well-being,
agency, and future economic opportunities.
   One-dimensional pictures are limited, if not misleading. Often the focus is too
narrowly on labor force participation, for example. In some of the world’s poorest
countries, such as Rwanda and Tanzania, women’s rate of labor force participation
is close to 90 percent.1 However, this does not mean that women are employed in
good jobs, farming productive crops, running profitable enterprises, or earning as
much as their male counterparts. On the contrary, much of the work done by the
world’s poor is subsistence-based, insecure, and lacking in basic protections.
  Figure 2.1 illustrates the importance of a multidimensional perspective for the 10
most populous developing countries for which we have data, representing one-third
of the world’s population. In all cases, women are less likely to be in the labor force,
earn less than men, and, in all but Brazil, working women are less likely than work-
ing men to be employed in wage jobs. In Turkey, while gender wage gaps appear to
be small, there are large disparities in labor force participation and employment in
wage jobs. And a deeper analysis of Turkey’s wage differences reveals that the gap

   This chapter explores why gender gaps in the world of work have been so per-
sistent. More specifically, why do women and men sort into different types of jobs
(and firms) and enjoy different levels of access to key productive inputs, and why do
so many women stay out of the workforce altogether? There is no single dataset or
global study that can answer these questions conclusively, but established and new
emerging evidence casts important light.
   We take as a starting point the WDR 2012 analytical framework, which empha-
sized the importance of how markets and institutions (formal and informal) inter-
act with norms and behaviors at the household level and influence outcomes for
gender equality. We elaborate on the importance of market and institutional fail-
ures. Whereas some market and institutional failures stem from overt discrimina-
tion, others result from more subtle failures to address gender-specific constraints,
which are often linked to biased norms and restricted agency. We also argue that
gender gaps in the world of work are preceded by key constraints during child and
youth years. The implication is clear: while immediate jobs crises require short-term
actions directed at the working age, effective policy strategies to close gender gaps
in the world of work must start early.
  Some key definitions are in order. Social norms are widely held beliefs by a group
or society about what people should and should not do.1 They can be held at mul-

  Igniting Gender
  Equality in the
  World of Work

  Key messages

  ▶▶ Governments can play a critical role in leveling the playing field for
     women’s economic opportunities.
  ▶▶ Sound jobs strategies to reduce gender inequality in the world of work
     start with careful country-level diagnostics to understand local priori-
     ties and key constraints to women’s work.
  ▶▶ The private sector is the largest source of jobs and therefore essential to
     engage for equality in the world of work.
  ▶▶ Significant data and knowledge gaps pose major challenges to evi-
     dence-based policy-making and need to be addressed.




   Igniting gender equality in the world of work involves understanding local spec-
ificities and developing bold, coordinated actions to address overlapping disadvan-
tages. Informed by careful diagnostics that take into account gender considerations
across the lifecycle, policy makers can develop a multi-pronged approach.
   Actions should be considered at three broad levels (Figure 4.1). First, reforms and
other actions may be needed to level the playing field for equality at work, including
addressing constraints across the lifecycle and reforming the “rules of the game”.
These actions are generally government-led with participation from the private sec-
tor and civil society organizations. Second, proactive private sector leadership and
innovation can encourage women’s participation and success in the world of work,
for example by establishing company policies and practices that relieve constraints
on women’s time, encourage men’s role in caring responsibilities, tackle discrimina-
tion in the workplace, and help women gain access to productive inputs. Third, clos-
ing data gaps and investing in knowledge will enable more evidence-based policy-
making and tracking of results. This is central to achieving and measuring the prog-
ress that is needed.

  ADePT Gender is software designed to facilitate the main-             Examples of ADePT Gender output from gender and labor
  streaming of gender in poverty and labor analysis. It is or-
  ganized in two parts. The first produces a multi-dimensional
  diagnostic of gender inequality in a country in the form of a
  large set of simple tabulations and graphs. The second part
  goes deeper into gender inequalities in the labor market, pre-
  senting a comprehensive set of measures of earnings inequal-
  ity.
  Country Gender Profile: ADePT Gender presents information
  on gender gaps for several outcomes grouped following the
  three dimensions: health and human capital (endowments);
  economic opportunities; and voice, agency, and participation.
  Outcomes include rates of enrollment and attainment in all
  levels of education, user-defined health outcomes includ-
  ing those relevant for children and for reproductive health,
  rates of employment, unemployment and out-of-the labor
  force, occupational segregation indices, and participation in
  decision-making over different household expenditures. The
  sex-disaggregated outcomes are available for different vul-
  nerable population groups.
  Gender and Labor: ADePT Gender produces measures of
  overall inequality and within-gender earnings inequality, as
  well as measures of gender pay gaps for two groups of the
  employed population: wage workers and the self-employed.
  Examples of measures are 90/10 percentile ratios and Gini,
  Theil, and Atkinson inequality measures adjusted to earn-
  ings. It also computes several decompositions of gender gaps
  in pay for wage workers and self-employed workers and as-

and education, enhancing poverty reduction, and catalyzing productivity. Empowering women and girls is vital in order to
                achieve our twin goals: ending extreme poverty by 2030 and boosting shared prosperity.”
