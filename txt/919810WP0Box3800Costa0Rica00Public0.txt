THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practic e or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

      Deposit capital in the bank account, pay registration fees and
      stamp duties

      As a prerequisite for registering the company, 25% of the capital stock
      indicated in the incorporation charter (if paid in cash) must be
      deposited in a national bank. The amount deposited may be withdrawn
      once the company has been duly recorded. The founders may also opt
      to sign a promissory note at the notary public and deposit the capital
      into the bank account later. In addition, registration fees must be paid
      at the bank before business registration.
      The registration fees are as follows:
      - Stamp duties: Colegio de Abogados, CRC 10,000; Educación y Cultura,
      CRC 750 ; Timbre Fiscal, CRC 625
      - Registration fees: Registro Nacional, CRC 39,940

      - Agrary stamp (timbre agrario): CRC 68,850.41
      - Legalization of books: CRC 16,000
      Since December 28, 2012, the company books can now be registered at
      the National Registry at the time of incorporation . Furthermore, the
      company's accounting books registration is no longer necessary.
      In addition, a tax needs to be paid at incorporation, which represents
      50% of the amount of the basic wage of an “Office Clerk 1” if paid in
      January. If it is registered later on the year, the amount will be
      proportional to what’s left of the year.

        Request and obtain zoning authorization (uso de suelo) from the
        Municipal Government

        This request can also include a request for property line setbacks to be
        indicated by the Municipal Government. New land use policies were
        approved in April 2006. The greater San Jose metropolitan area
        includes 31 municipalities. The zoning authorization will be valid for 6   10 days          no charge

        months, or up to 12 months. Many municipal authorities, such as the
        Belen Municipality, do not respect their own land-use regulations when
        granting the final construction permit.

        * Request and obtain approval from National Environment
        Technical Secretary

        BuildCo must obtain approval from the National Environment Technical
        Secretary (Secretaría Técnica Nacional del Ambiente, SETENA), using
        two forms (in Spanish) available on SETENA’s Web site
        (www.minae.go.cr /setena.html). BuildCo would use Form D-1 which
        costs anywhere between CRC 1 million to CRC 1.5 million. The response
        generally takes 60 -- 90 days. This procedure and the next can be
   2    completed simultaneously.                                                  60 days         CRC 1,000,000

        Preparation of the environmental impact study (EIS) costs anywhere

      * Request and obtain approval of blue prints by College of
      Architects and Engineers

      BuildCo should submit the property survey map and a contract, signed
      by two members of the College of Architects and Engineers: an
      electrical engineer and either a civil engineer or an architect. It is
      preferred that at least four blueprint copies be submitted. The college
      has implemented the new American Power Conversion Corporation
3     (APC) system (via the Internet). If the APC submits the approval, the       20 days     CRC 660,953
      time line is 1 day; if not, it is about 5 -- 8 days. In 2007, the College
      encouraged a complete change to digital approval. The approval fee is
      0.265% of the project value, plus a fixed fee of CRC 1,500.00 for two
      construction log books.

      Request and obtain approval by the Water Department
      (Acueductos y Alcantarillados)

      BuildCo must complete and submit an approval form to the Water
      Department. In turn, the Department must verify that the construction        5 days       no charge

      project site has a water source.

      Agency: Water Department



      * Request and obtain workers compensation insurance proof from
      National Insurance Institute

      The National Insurance Institute requires proof that worker
      compensation insurance has been paid prior to issuing a building
      permit. This proof is required to start each new project. In the past,
      developers were allowed a blanket insurance policy that did not require
      purchase of insurance for every new project. In 2007, the Institute’s
      policies were revised; it now allows a blanket insurance that the
      developer adjusts, paying the differences annually. But the complexity
      of the process discourages its use. Most construction companies
      purchase individual insurance on a case-by-case basis for projects           1 day        no charge
5
      instead of globally for annual activities. This system is likely to be
      changed because of private sector complaints.

      Insurance premiums are based on the amount of coverage. The cost
      can range from 4.23% to 5.53% of the coverage amount. The
      completed form must be presented with copies of the workers’
      identification cards or (for underage employees) working permits.

      value.

      Receive on-site inspection - I

      During construction, inspections occur monthly, though not according
      to a specific schedule. The inspector may show up randomly to view the
      construction and review the construction log book (bitacora de
      construccion), which the engineer/architect uses to register entries for
7     each stage of construction. Under Costa Rican law, the engineer is          1 day        no charge
      responsible for complying with construction laws and regulations.

      Agency: Municipal Government



      * Request water connection

      After the connection is requested, an inspector from the Water
      Department visits the construction site, determines the connection
      requirements, and, on this basis, estimates the costs. Sewage
      connection is not included. With few centralized sewage connections,
      most connections are done with an independent septic system or
      treatment plant.                                                            1 day        no charge

      required. Should the installation of a transformers be required the design
      is prepared by the Section for the Design of Electrical Networks of CNFL.
      In order to establish whether this is necessary, the Engineering Study is
      issued; if the connection can be done with underground cables, the work
      can be designed by an outside electric engineer, who is registered with
      the Colegio de Ingenieros Electricistas, Mecánicos e Industriales (CFIA). In
      that case, the designs are presented to CNFL for approval. Until they are
      approved and the Engineering Study is issued, no works can be done.

      The client hires a private company to do the works according to the
      plans issued by CNFL

      The external connection works have to be done by a firm that has been
      authorized by the CNFL to do medium voltage network construction
      work. There are 21 firms with such authorization in the capital city. Once
      the supply contract between the client and the authorized provider has
      been signed, it is filed with CNFL. It takes approx. 3 days to start the
      works and, once supervised, the construction can start. The construction
      cannot start if there is not initiation date determined by the CNFL.

      The internal wiring installation can be done by any electrician hired by
      the client, but it has to be supervised by the engineer responsible for the
      design of the electric installation. CNFL does not conduct any inspections
      of the internal wiring. The internal wiring installation requires previous
      plans approved by an electric engineer authorized by Colegio de
      Ingenieros Electricistas, Mecánicos e Industriales (CFIA) and the works
4     have to be supervised by the CFIA or by another electric engineer. No        26 calendar days     USD 17,500
      certificate of compliance with NEC rules is emitted nor can it be
      requested. The plans approved by CFIA will have to be filed with the
      CNFL by the time the meter installation is requested. Three transformers
      of 50 kVA have to be installed inside the client's private property. The
      client has to pay for them. They can be installed in a post inside the
      private property (it's not allowed to install them in public places) or in a
      transformers vault.

      CNFL installs the meter and energizes the project

      Once the works have been finalized, in order to have definitive
      connection, the client has to request the meter. A donation document
      for the transformers (transferring ownership to the utility) is prepared
      and confirmed that no money is owed by the client. The payments that
      the customer has to make to CNFL have to be done in the Section of
      Electric Networks Design. The payment receipt has to be shown later in
      the office of Engineering Study to be able to go to this step (the
      Engineering Study).
      There is a guarantee deposit that is calculated according to the
      consumption. It represents one month consumption. The minimum
      amount of guarantee for the residential customer is ¢ 15.500, and for
      businesses the minimum amount is ¢ 25.000. This deposit is required for
      all clients requesting a new service. The deposit is refundable and after
      five years it begins to generate interests. It is reimbursed when the client
      terminates the service. The deposit covers the installation of the meter
      equipment with its materials. Additionally it covers the operation costs
      and the service maintenance.
5     Normally CNFL tries to both inspect the works and install the meter at          7 calendar days   CRC 611,300.25
      the same time. CNFL charges between 2 and 3% of the cost of the works
      only for the reception and the powering. The responsible to pay this fee
      is the client. Therefore, this cost is normally included in the estimation of
      costs sent to the client. If the service requires power transformers or a
      specific meter, they are installed by CNFL without extra costs.
      The installation of the meter is exclusive responsibility of CNFL. The
      internal installation planes approved by the Engineers Association and
      the electrician's certification have to be sent to CNFL before the final
      powering.

ENFORCING CONTRACTS
Economies in all regions have improved contract                   reducing backlogs by introducing periodic reviews to
enforcement in recent years. A judiciary can be improved          clear inactive cases from the docket and by making
in different ways. Higher-income economies tend to look           procedures faster. What reforms making it easier (or
for ways to enhance efficiency by introducing new                 more difficult) to enforce contracts has Doing Business
