    1. Enabling Environment
       Papua New Guinea successfully established an Education Management Information
       System (EMIS) as the point of reference system that collects, processes, and
       disseminates education data on a regular basis. The National Plan for Education 2005 –
       2014 set a roadmap for timely collection, management, and utilization of data in decision
       making. The plan set the foundation for EMIS; however, it did not institute comprehensive
       EMIS policies or an EMIS budget. Policies do not outline procedures to ensure student
       data confidentiality, nor do they define processes and procedures for sharing data with
       other government units. Policies do not require that information be reported back to local
       levels, especially schools.

    2. System Soundness
       Using an Oracle platform, EMIS captures demographic data and some financial,
       infrastructure, and human resources data; however, assessment, salary, and
       noneducation data are not integrated. Analysis was conducted using Oracle Discoverer,
       but the tool is being discontinued by the vendor and rolled into the robust Oracle Business
       Intelligence (BI) tool. Data are sourced annually through a paper-based census, which
       moves from schools to district offices and on to provincial offices, before going to the
                                                           z
       Department of Education to be entered into the system.     A pilot program introduced EMIS
       in six provinces, giving them the ability to input and access data through a digital
       interface. Internal and external audits are not conducted regularly.

    3. Quality Data
       EMIS concepts and definitions (data fields, indicators, metadata, etc.) follow a functional
       manual documented and approved by the government. Source data from most regions
       are reliable, although reporting and accuracy decline in rural locations. Systematic
       validation of data is conducted manually at provincial and district levels. Validation
       through automated systems started this year. EMIS is accessible through the Department
       of Education website through a dashboard, which also links EMIS data to the national
       education strategy. Statistics have been disseminated within 6–12 months after the start
       of the next school year; however, circulation of the 2015 census was delayed and may
       impact the timing of 2016 reports.

    4. Utilization for Decision Making
       EMIS data are disseminated through an annual statistics book and the online dashboard.
       Lack of internet access and limited communication and training prevent most
       stakeholders outside of the national government from accessing and using EMIS. Schools
       are not aware of the dashboard and instead rely on their own internal methods and
       processes for using data.

     The Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER) initiative
     collects data on the policies and institutions of education systems
     around the world and benchmarks them against practices associated
     with student learning. SABER aims to give all parties with a stake in
     educational results—from students, administrators, teachers, and
     parents to policy makers and business people—an accessible, detailed,
     objective snapshot of how well the policies of their country's education
     system are oriented toward ensuring that all children and youth learn.

     This report focuses specifically on policies in the area of Education
     Management Information Systems.
