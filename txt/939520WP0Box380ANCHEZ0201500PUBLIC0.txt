sharing across the region and trigger policy dialogue on topics relevant for the Caribbean.

This note was prepared to support the participatory policy dialogue in the context of the Caribbean Growth Forum (CGF). The CGF is an initiative facilitated by the
Compete Caribbean Program, the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank and the Caribbean Development Bank, with the support of the Canadian
International Development Agency, the United Kingdom’s Agency for International Development, CARICOM Secretariat, the University of the West Indies, the
European Union and Caribbean Export. It aims to facilitate a multi-stakeholder dialogue to identify practical solutions for the growth challenge in the Caribbean.

Abstract:
The Dominican Republic (DR) has recorded exceptional growth over the past twenty years and has
closed the gap with the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region. While in the early 90’s the DR´s per
capita income was only about 57% that in LAC, it has climbed to around 90% nowadays. However, the
country’s ability to reduce poverty and improving equity has been less stellar. This note presents some
stylized facts of the DR economy that might help understand this phenomenon. In doing so, the note
addresses the following three questions: (i) Has growth been inclusive in the DR?; (ii) Why has the DR
economy grown so rapidly?; and (iii) Why has growth not led to further improvements in equity? This
note tentatively argues that some potential factors explaining the latter are the decline in real wages
despite increasing productivity, special economic zones that are relatively isolated from the rest of the
economy, and the State’s limited capacity for fiscal redistribution.

1992 and the year 2000, the Dominican Republic
economy grew at an average rate of 6.7 percent
per annum, being the top performer in the region.
In the period 2001-2013, growth remained high at
an average rate of 5.1 percent per cent, placing the
Dominican economy in 4th place in the group of top
growth performers (after Panama, Argentina and
Peru). This overall dynamic growth has enabled a
convergence of the DR’s GNI per capita (US$4,959
in 20132) with that of the region, from 57 percent in
1992 to 90 percent of the regional average in 2013.
The country also weathered the global economic
slowdown of 2008-09 well, but declining domestic
demand and a weak performance in richer
economies contributed to slow down growth in the

    It needs to be underlined that measuring productivity as output per worker (as in this note) or as output per hour (as done by Abdullaev and Estevão) leads to similar results.

 We would like to note, though, that gains in productivity in manufacturing (Figure 3) may be also impacted by reduction of manufacturing employment in the SEZs in the 2000s, although
Abdullaev and Estevão (2013) use output per hour as a proxy and obtain similar results.

Finally, it has often been argued that the arrival of
Haitian migrants could be the source of an excess
supply of unskilled labor that would pressure
wages downward. However, evidence on this
hypothesis is inconclusive. On the one hand, Aristy-

a substitutive for the unskilled Dominican workers,
resulting in a wage reduction for less-qualified
jobs, whereas return to capital and wages of the
skilled workforce are increased. On the other                                          Non-SEZ Exports
hand, Mejía (2009) finds some evidence that
native workers in the construction sector of the
Dominican Republic are currently more affected
by unemployment than Haitians, although he does
not find strong evidence of deterioration in sector
wages provoked by the increased participation of
migrants in the workforce. Finally, the World Bank
(2012) also finds only weak evidence of downward
wage pressures caused by Haitian workers.

With limited fiscal space, the Dominican Republic
has kept its public spending on social sectors at a
low level, compared with the rest of the region. Over
the period 1991-2010, the DR spent just around
2 percent of GDP on public education, ranking
at the bottom of Latin America11. While there has
been a notable expansion in school enrollment
over the past two decades, the system has been
characterized by high student-to-teacher ratios,
double shifting by teachers, inadequate formation,
and high repetition and drop-out rates (Sánchez
and Senderowitsch, 2012). In order to address these
challenges, and following wide citizen protests that
took place in December 2010, the government
increased allocations for education to 4 percent
of GDP for the first time in the 2013 budget. The
health sector presents a similar situation, having
registered notable improvements in terms of
coverage, but facing some persistent challenges in
terms of effective access, as private out of pocket
expenditure still represents 66 percent of total
spending, and acquiring medicines is a heavy
burden for the poorer strata of the population.
In sum, there seems to be a vicious cycle that
limits the capacity of the Dominican State to
redistribute wealth. Sánchez and Senderowitsch
(2012) observe how individuals in the Dominican
Republic, especially among the middle class,
opt out from public services in the light of their
limited quality, choosing instead private solutions
(for example, private schools, private health
insurance). This seems to make them less likely to
engage in collective action demanding increasing
accountability from the public sector, and less
inclined to pay taxes, thus further limiting state
resources to improve the quality of public service
delivery. This low level equilibrium is likely to be
preventing the attainment of a welfare state in the
country, and hampering prospects for poverty and
inequality reduction.

explanations to the Dominican puzzle. Firstly, the
economic slowdown of 2003 combined with the
end of textile preferences in 2004 resulted in a
sharp decline in employment in manufacturing,
and required a reduction in real wage levels to keep
the competitiveness of DR manufacturing exports;
since then, wages have remained stagnant, in spite
of increasing productivity. In addition, employment
creation has been taking place mainly in sectors
with lower value added, such as hotels and
restaurants, and other services (where informality
prevails). These two factors combined result in
lower prospects for poverty reduction in the
country. Ongoing conversations about revamping
the 1992 labor code could be a good opportunity
to discuss the broken link between productivity
and salaries.

Secondly, and related to the previous point, Special
Economic Zones are moving towards products with
higher value added (footwear, surgical equipment),
but job creation is still limited, and linkages with
the rest of the economy remain weak; this limits the
potential for productivity improvements through
spillovers to firms outside special economic zones.
Efforts in terms of capacity building for small and
medium Dominican companies may be needed for
them to become reliable suppliers of multinationals
in SEZ’s. This would help increasing the scope for
nationwide productivity improvements, and could
potentially lead to employment creation.
