Executive summary
1.	   Agriculture in Uzbekistan is almost entirely dependent on irrigation. However, despite reforms
      to institutional arrangements, much of Uzbekistan’s irrigation is reportedly caught in a vicious
      cycle of inadequate operation and maintenance, low cost recovery, and agricultural productivity
      that is often moderate or low; in addition, many farmers earn low incomes (World Bank, 2013).
      Few incentives exist to save water because farmers do not see the direct cost of water provision.
      This study was undertaken with the aim of contributing to better irrigation water management in
      Central Asia, beginning in Uzbekistan. It identifies factors and conditions that positively affect the
      performance of local irrigation water management institutions.

2.	   The analytical framework for this assessment is formed by the eight design principles for the
      management of common-pool resources developed by Ostrom (1990). These design principles are
      in essence factors that are associated with successful collective action in governing common-pool
      resources such as irrigation water, forests, and fishing areas. By determining why these principles
      are met in some cases and not in others, and what factors are behind this variation, we can identify
      measures that promote these factors/conditions in irrigation schemes.

3.	   The assessment utilized a case study approach that emphasizes detailed contextual analysis of a
      limited number of cases or situations. Information was gathered about a range of factors, including
      the establishment and operational role of Water Consumer Associations (WCAs); strengths and
      weaknesses of the existing governance arrangements around water management; and accountability
      and information flows, among others. No technical measurements were taken.

4.	   Uzbekistan’s agricultural and irrigation sector is characterized by strong state domination and
      geared toward meeting state quotas of cotton and wheat. Each year, the WCA submits an application
      to the Administrative Irrigation System (AIS) that is based on the approved crop production plans
      and corresponding water amount and scheduling needs of each of its members. Farmers and WCA
      representatives that were interviewed for this study claimed that, typically, farmers only receive
      about 75 percent to 95 percent of the amount of water scheduled for delivery.

5.	   Farmers were asked what they think defines a good WCA and good local water management and
      governance. The following aspects were mentioned most often:
      •	      The irrigation and drainage systems are adequately planned and maintained; paperwork
              is taken care of; and good relations are upheld with the AIS and the Basin Administrative
              Irrigation System (BAIS), which saves farmers time.
      •	      Conflicts and disputes are solved among WCA members so there is no need to involve
              other government bodies.
      •	      Farmers feel they are involved in the decision-making process, and build trust among
              themselves.

6.	   The WCA head’s qualification appears to be associated with WCA performance. Good directors were
      said to be able to engage farmers in WCA activities and build trust among members and government
      officials. External factors that are associated with the quality of local water management—in the
      sense that irrigation water is fairly and predictably distributed in the eyes of stakeholders—include
      (i) the proportion of the total irrigated area that depends on electrical pumps and the reliability of
      the electricity supply; and (ii) the suitability of the growing conditions (such as soil quality) for the
      crops the WCA farmers have been assigned to grow by the state.

7.	   Findings suggest that boundaries between legitimate and illegitimate consumers of canal
      irrigation water are not always clearly defined. In most case study sites, dehkans and tomorka
      owners (also referred to as smallholders) depend on water in the WCA-managed canals to irrigate
      their crops. This makes them de facto users of the “common-pool” irrigation canal water. However,
      WCA officials claimed that since tomorka owners and most dehkans are not registered as legal

                                                    8
           entities, they cannot officially join a WCA. Interviews revealed that legitimate irrigation needs of
           dehkans and tomorka owners are not always adequately taken into account by the WCA and AIS
           when water supply schedules are prepared, making them de facto illegitimate users.1

8.	        A number of WCAs—those that perform perhaps somewhat better than others—have explicitly
           recognized smallholders as legitimate users by including their irrigation requirements in water
           delivery schedules, and sometimes even hiring a mirob to take care of their irrigation needs. Where
           this has happened, it has helped alleviate tensions between farmers and smallholders and prevented
           unpredictable water supply shortages.

9.	        User payments for irrigation water are generally not linked to the actual amount of water used.
           We find that in all of the WCAs we studied, irrigation fees are lowest for the crop that uses the most
           irrigation water—cotton, the main state-mandated crop. However, there are substantial differences
           in cotton irrigation fees across WCAs. They tend to be the lowest in the poorly performing WCAs,
           where farmers have low levels of satisfaction with irrigation services. Net returns to the volume of
           water used are 2–3 times lower for cotton than for wheat and other crops. In addition, the returns
           to the amount paid for obtaining the water are five times lower when cotton yields are low.

10.	       The best-performing WCAs tend to be those that have been able to make water available
           to cultivate profitable secondary crops. They also tend to be the ones that charge the highest
           irrigation fees for these secondary crops. Both of these actions make it possible for farmers and
           WCAs to generate sufficient resources to maintain and repair the irrigation system. Farmers in well-
           functioning WCAs already pay higher fees than farmers in poorly functioning ones, and the former
           are already active in maintaining and repairing the irrigation system.

11.	       The findings suggest that farmers who grow secondary crops use water more cautiously and look
           for options to save water or irrigate their fields more efficiently. The relatively low profitability
           of the state-mandated crops2 undermines farmers’ ability to sufficiently contribute to adequate
           maintenance of the local irrigation and drainage systems. Partly to avoid paying labor taxes that the
           WCA incurs for hiring employees, farmers claimed they also spend money directly on maintaining
           canals and repairing parts of the irrigation system that serves their area, without going through the
           WCA.

12.	       Irrigation is traditionally a male responsibility, but the gender division of labor has changed due to
           the outmigration of Uzbek men. This particularly affects dehkans and tomorka owners.

13.	       The findings suggest that even though farmers sign water delivery contracts with the WCA,
           and the WCA is in principle accountable to water consumers, the AIS plays an important role in
           monitoring overall water use, even if it is not accountable to WCAs or water consumers. The WCA
           is not in a position to enforce the contractual arrangement it has with the AIS, partly because the
           WCA does not pay for the irrigation water it receives from the AIS.

14.	       The AIS’s lack of accountability to WCAs appears to be an important reason why some WCAs are
           not keen on raising irrigation service fees. This would suggest that the AIS’s limited accountability
           prevents WCAs from mobilizing the resources needed to recover costs and pay for canal operation,
           maintenance, and repairs.

15.	       Farmers stated they supported the interference of the AIS when the WCA is weak, as it will help
           them meet the state production quota. WCAs are not allowed to fail, and the state will interfere if
           they collapse. However, in the medium term, this makes the WCA and its members dependent on
           the government, which undermines a number of design principles for the community management
           of common-pool resources and removes incentives to innovate and adopt more effective
           arrangements.

1. According to the Water Law, Dehkans and Tomorka owners can become members of a WCA. However many don’t due to lack of awaress or for
logistical reasons.
2. This study only looked at the farmers’ perspective and did not assess the profitability of state-mandated crops for the state.

                                                                  9
16.	   WCAs are not allowed to sanction farmers or other water consumers that violate the irrigation
       schedule or excessively use water, such as through fines. If there are any disputes among farmers
       over irrigation water, they are solved through discussion meetings or settled personally by the WCA
       head. This works particularly well when the WCA head enjoys the respect of the local community.

17.	   There are number of informal practices that promote effective monitoring and improve the
       accountability of the AIS and the WCA. Some WCAs—especially the better-performing ones—have
       found mechanisms to monitor water use and water users, and hold the WCA accountable through
       a committee of respected farmers. Other WCAs hold daily meetings with members of the WCA
       during the irrigation season. In some of the case study areas, the AIS meets with WCA directors
       on a regular basis (once every ten days), possibly ensuring some informal way to prevent disputes
       over water delivery. As mentioned by respondents, installing meters and controlling devices to track
       water use would go a long way toward improving monitoring and accountability for irrigation water.

18.	   In each case study site, the WCA administration reports to a General Assembly that consists of
       farmers and WCA staff, but the General Assembly is also attended by officials of the AIS, BAIS,
       Vodhoz, the Village Assembly of Citizens (VAC), and by Hokimiyat and mahalla leaders. In addition
       to the General Assembly, all WCAs have a supervisory board that consists of farmer and community
       representatives that oversee the WCA director. The WCAs appear to benefit from the hands-on
       monitoring and day-to-day problem solving these board members provide. This is particularly so in
       the high-performing WCAs.

19.	   In the well-performing WCAs, farmers and staff claimed they were driven by a “shared vision,” and
       sometimes the most experienced and resourceful farmers help others with advice, machinery, and
       even small loans. However, the overall state agricultural policy of giving priority to state-mandated
       crops (wheat and cotton) causes these crops to use most of the irrigation water, which reduces
       opportunities for farmers to innovate and allocate water to more lucrative crops.

20.	   In many WCAs, farmers and smallholders make their own maintenance arrangements off the
       books of the WCA, mainly to avoid paying labor tax. This is particularly common for farmers who
       have their own machines. While this flexibility certainly has advantages in the short term, over time
       this could undermine the role and viability of the WCA in its current form.

21.	   The findings from this study can be used to design a diagnostic tool for assessing whether the
       design principles for the sustainable management of common-pool irrigation water are being
       met. The tool consists of a set of questions that need to be answered in the field. In addition to
       drafting the diagnostic tool, this study makes a number of recommendations to improve the local
       management of irrigation water in Uzbekistan. These include:

       •	       Adopt a new Water Law/Water Code and take legal measures that provide for a better
                financing aspects of WCA operations. These legal changes should better provide for the
                WCAs’ financial and operational sustainability and provide a stronger accountability
                mechanism for their governance structure. The water code should also provide a legal
                basis for a more contractual relationship between the AIS and the WCA, with clear
                monitorable agreements on water delivery. The new Water Code should provide a strong
                legal basis for the supervisory board of farmer and community representatives to oversee
                the WCA director.
       •	       Involve dehkans (especially women) more structurally in decision making pertaining to
                water allocation scheduling, and arrange for canal water intakes for them.
       •	       Make it clearer in the law that WCAs can sanction water consumers that break rules.
       •	       Improve the provision of support services to the WCAs and promote learning across them,
                using successful WCAs as schools and training sites.
       •	       Lower the labor tax for WCAs so they can generate more resources for operation and
                maintenance (O&M).
                                                   10
•	   Bring the water allocation policy in line with the land-use liberalization policy.
•	   Better track the performance of the irrigation system, including through sample surveys,
     using some of the questions from the diagnostic tool presented in this report.
•	   Install water meters at the level of the WCA canal intake to support water delivery
     agreements of the AIS to the WCA.
•	   Upgrade outdated irrigation pumps.

Overview
I.	     Irrigation Management Transfer (IMT) has been adopted worldwide to increase cost recovery and
        make more efficient use of scarce water resources. It aims to make water users more responsible
        and active in the operation and maintenance (O&M) of local-level irrigation infrastructure. A review
        of the global IMT experience conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the
        International Water Management Institute (IWMI) revealed that constraints to further improving
        the performance of the irrigation system under IMT include: (i) a lack of political support; (ii)
        reluctance to change existing water laws; and (iii) the lack of managerial skills within Water User
        Associations (WUAs), leading to poor provision of water services (FAO and IWMI, 2007).

II.	    Uzbekistan is facing increasing challenges to satisfy future demand for irrigation water. Agriculture
        in the country is almost entirely dependent on irrigation. Climate change is expected to amplify
        seasonal and annual variation, and forecasts suggest that most of the country will experience
        severe water shortages in the future. The main water resource problem, however, seems to be
        inefficient water management rather than water shortage per se. Despite reforms to institutional
        arrangements, much of Uzbekistan’s irrigation appears to be caught in a vicious cycle of inadequate
        operation and maintenance, low cost recovery, low agricultural productivity, and low incomes for
        many farmers (World Bank, 2013). Few incentives exist to save water because farmers do not see
        the direct cost of water provision. The irrigation fees they pay function like a land tax, as these are
        not tied to actual use of water (World Bank, 2013). Available evidence suggests that the quality of
        local irrigation water management and governance varies across the country, yet it is not known
        why it works better in some areas than others.

III.	   This study was undertaken with the aim of contributing to better irrigation water management
        in Central Asia, beginning in Uzbekistan. It identifies factors and conditions that positively affect
        the performance of local irrigation water–management institutions. The study also prepared an
        associated diagnostic tool that will help design measures and program interventions to strengthen
        these institutions in ongoing or future irrigation operations. Lastly, the work intends to contribute
        to an exchange of good practices and knowledge sharing among relevant stakeholders across the
        Central Asia region.

IV.	    The analytical framework for this assessment is formed by the eight design principles for the
        management of common-pool resources developed by Ostrom (1990) and modified by Cox,
        Arnold, and Tomás (2010). These design principles are in essence factors that are associated with
        successful collective action in governing common-pool resources such as irrigation water, forests,
        and fishing areas. Their primary role is to explain under what conditions trust and reciprocity can
        be built, and how it can be maintained to sustain collective action in the face of the social dilemmas
        posed by common-pool resources. This collective action, in turn, helps prevent the deterioration of
        a managed common-pool resource. The eight principles are:
        1.	        A. User boundaries: Clear boundaries between legitimate and illegitimate users must be
                   defined.
                   B. Resource boundaries: Clear boundaries are present that define a resource system and
                   separate it from the larger biophysical environment.
        2.	        A. Congruence with local conditions: Appropriation and provision rules are congruent
                   with local social and environmental conditions.
                   B. Appropriation and provision: The benefits obtained by users from a common-pool
                   resource, as determined by appropriation rules, are proportional to the amount of inputs
                   required in the form of labor, material, or money, as determined by provision rules.
        3.	        Collective-choice arrangements: Most individuals affected by the operational rules can
                   participate in modifying them.
        4.	        A. Monitoring users: Monitors who are accountable to the users track their appropriation
                   and provision levels.
                   B. Monitoring the resource: Monitors who are accountable to the users observe the

            5.	          Graduated sanctions: Appropriators who violate operational rules are likely to be assessed
                         using graduated sanctions (depending on the seriousness and the context of the offense)
                         by other appropriators, officials accountable to the appropriators, or both.
            6.	          Conflict-resolution mechanisms: Appropriators and their officials have rapid access to
                         low-cost local arenas to resolve conflicts among appropriators or between appropriators
                         and officials.
            7.	          Minimal recognition of rights to organize: The right of appropriators to devise their own
                         institutions is not challenged by external governmental authorities.
            8.	          Nested enterprises: Appropriation, provision, monitoring, enforcement, conflict
                         resolution, and governance activities are organized in multiple layers of nested enterprises.
            Using the eight design principles as a guiding framework for our assessment, we assess the extent to
            which these are met in a range of different sites in the country and how they relate to performance.
            Then, by determining why these principles are met in some cases and not in others, and what
            factors are behind this variation, we can identify measures that promote these factors/conditions
            in irrigation schemes.
V.	         The study utilized a case study approach that emphasizes detailed contextual analysis of a limited
            number of cases or situations. It is based on the premise that truth is relative and depends on one’s
            perspective. One of the advantages of this approach is the close collaboration between researcher
            and participant, and the way in which it enables participants to tell their stories. Through these
            stories, participants are able to describe their views of reality, which enables the researcher to
            better understand the participants’ actions. Case study research can be seen as an empirical inquiry
            that investigates a contemporary phenomenon when the boundaries between phenomenon and
            context are not clearly evident, and in which multiple sources of evidence are used.
VI.	        Water Consumer Associations (WCAs), together with the irrigation authorities in the area in
            which they operate, form the unit of analysis for this study. Ten case study WCAs were selected to
            represent a wide range of circumstances thought to influence their performance. A local research
            firm carried out the fieldwork and gathered data from a total of 145 people. Data were collected
            in two phases: from May to June 2014 and from December 2014 to February 2015. Information
            was gathered on a range of factors, including the establishment and operational role of WCAs;
            strengths and weaknesses of existing governance arrangements around water management; and
            accountability and information flows, among others. No technical measurements were taken, and
            all collected data are from existing WCA records or reflect the opinions, views, and experiences of
            the study respondents. Lack of access to official data on WCAs presented a challenge to putting
            together a comprehensive sampling frame and might have introduced bias in identifying WCAs
            for the case study. Uzbekistan served as the pilot country for developing and implementing the
            research approach. A number of valuable lessons were learned, which are presented in Appendix 3.

Background on the case study sites
VII.	       Uzbekistan’s agricultural and irrigation sector is characterized by strong state domination and
            geared toward meeting state quotas of cotton and wheat. The Hokimiyat (local government)
            assigns land plots to private farmers—who often cultivate 50 ha or more—and grants them the right
            to cultivate these. Every year farmers must submit a detailed crop production plan for approval, and
            representatives of government organizations often visit farmers’ plots to verify adherence to the
            plan. Most private farmers are instructed to grow cotton and wheat, the state-mandated crops.3
            Each farmer is assigned an annual quota for these crops. The Hokimiyat may terminate the land lease
            if the cotton or wheat quota is not met for three consecutive years, in which case they auction it off
            to another farmer. Other land users are dehkans, who are smallholders and typically have 0.3–1 ha,
            and tomorka owners, who have small kitchen gardens (less than 0.3 ha). They are free to grow crops
            of their choice. The Basin Administrative Irrigation System (BAIS) and the Administrative Irrigation
            System (AIS) coordinate operation, maintenance, and repairs of the primary and secondary canals.
            All local government organizations report to the Hokim, the powerful head of the local government.
3. It should be noted that in recent years the government has reduced the area on which farmers are instructed to grow cotton and the area under
horticulture is expanding.

                                                                      13
VIII.	   All farmers in the case study sites belong to a WCA, which is regarded by many as a body that
         mediates between the AIS and farmers. Each year, the WCA submits an application to the AIS that is
         based on the approved crop production plans and the corresponding water amount and scheduling
         needs of each of its members. The Village Assembly of Citizens (VAC) is an official body that covers
         several mahallas (villages). If dehkans or tomorka owners have any complaints regarding the
         irrigated water supply, they are expected to direct these to the leader of their mahalla or the head
         of the VAC. Nearly all farmers interviewed said they welcomed the creation of WUAs in response to
         the chaotic water management situation that began when the shirkats were dismantled.

IX.	     Farmers and WCA representatives that were interviewed claimed that typically, farmers only
         receive about 75 percent to 95 percent of the water that is scheduled for delivery. Primary reasons
         why farmers receive less water than they were originally allocated include: (i) droughts in upstream
         areas that lower water levels in the main canal; (ii) the AIS supplying less water than what was
         agreed, even when water seems to be sufficiently available; (iii) an alleged “excessive” use of water
         by dehkans and tomorka owners; and (iv) electricity outages that interrupt irrigation pump activity.

X.	      As mentioned, and as can be expected from the selection process, the WCAs varied in size, water
         availability in the secondary canal, dependence on pumps, crop diversification, and so on. The
         WCA director’s qualifications, as well as the number of full- and part-time staff members, varied
         widely across the case study WCAs. The number of WCA staff members ranged between 3 and
         15, and the number of WCA staff per farmer between 2.1 and 9, suggesting large differences in
         staffing efficiency. The number of female farmers in the case study WCAs varied from 0 percent
         to 19 percent. Study respondents pointed out that female farmers tend to be more active and
         outspoken, and in general manage their farms better than male farmers.

XI.	     Farmers were asked what they think defines a good WCA and good local water management and
         governance. The following qualities were mentioned most often:
         •	      The irrigation and drainage systems are adequately planned, operated, and maintained;
                 paperwork is taken care of; and good relations are upheld with AIS and BAIS, which saves
                 farmers time.
         •	      Conflicts and disputes are solved among WCA members so there is no to need involve
                 other government bodies.
         •	      Farmers receive assistance to not only get water on time, but also to find machines, seeds,
                 fuel, or other inputs.
         •	      Farmers feel they are involved in the decision-making process, and build trust among
                 themselves.
         •	      The WCA is led by a capable person whom the community respects.
         •	      Members of the WCA treat the irrigation system as a common good for which everyone
                 is responsible. Farmers work together with the WCA to meet quotas and increase profits.
         •	      The WCA has a financial buffer (in the form of an emergency fund) for emergency
                 breakdowns in the irrigation system. This helps quickly repair breakdowns without being
                 dependent on government organizations.

XII.	    Farmers in the case study WCAs in Pap District, Namangan, and Dustlik District, Jizzakh, in
         particular, were unhappy with how their WCA functions. Overall water availability (for main and
         secondary crops) in these areas is low, and few fees are paid on time. However, in other WCAs
         where water availability is low, farmer satisfaction is much higher (such as Kuwa urta buz anori WCA
         in Fergana Oblast), which suggests that other factors are at play. In addition, water scarcity can be
         an incentive for successful collective action.

XIII.	   The qualification of the WCA head appears to be associated with WCA performance. For example,
         the case study WCAs in Akhangaran, Tashkent Oblast, Denov, Surkhandarya Oblast, and Kuwa urta
         buz anori WCA in Kuwa, Fergana Oblast, have directors that have completed higher education and
         have extensive work experience in agriculture. These WCAs perform relatively well. Good directors
         were said to be able to engage farmers in WCA activities and build trust among members and with
                                                     14
            government officials. They are also better equipped to hire educated and skilled staff members
            and find it easier to introduce innovations. Most of the well-managed WCAs appear able to attract
            qualified staff, while more poorly managed WCAs struggle in this regard. Attracting qualified staff
            is a larger problem for the WCAs in our sample that do not perform so well. They have trouble
            collecting irrigation fees, are indebted, and cannot pay salaries on time. They are also unable to
            offer the kind of working conditions that would attract qualified staff, which worsens the WCA’s
            performance and thus perpetuates the vicious cycle.

XIV.	       External factors that are associated with the quality of local water management—in the sense
            that irrigation water is fairly and predictably distributed in the eyes of stakeholders—include:
            •	         the proportion of the total irrigated area that depends on electrical pumps and the
                       reliability of the electricity supply;
            •	         the suitability of the growing conditions (such as soil quality) for the crops the WCA
                       farmers have been assigned to grow by the state; and
            •	         the WCA director’s leadership skills.

XV.	        Overall water availability (that is, the amount available to the WCA) appears to have an ambiguous
            influence on the quality of water management and on farmer satisfaction.

Design principle 1: Well-defined boundaries

XVI.	       Findings suggest that boundaries between legitimate users and illegitimate users of canal
            irrigation water are not always clearly defined. In most case study sites, dehkans and tomorka
            owners depend on water in the WCA-managed canals to irrigate their crops. This makes them de
            facto users of the “common-pool” irrigation canal water. However, WCA officials claimed that since
            tomorka owners and most dehkans are not registered as legal entities, they cannot officially join
            a WCA.4 Interviews revealed that legitimate irrigation needs of dehkans and tomorka owners are
            not always adequately taken into account by the WCA and AIS when water supply schedules are
            prepared, making them de facto illegitimate users. Where this is the case, dehkans and tomorka
            owners erratically and unpredictably withdraw from irrigation canals, which undermines the proper
            management of irrigation canal water as a common-pool resource. Much also depends on where
            the dehkans and tomorka owners’ fields are located vis-à-vis the main interfarm canal. Separate
            canal intakes for dehkans and tomorka owners exist in only two of the high-performing case study
            WCAs (those in Akhangaran, Tashkent Oblast, and Denov, Surkhandarya).

XVII.	      In some cases the WCA water supply schedule takes into account the needs of dehkans and
            tomorka owners, or at least the VAC is consulted. However, the VAC’s involvement in making
            decisions regarding the distribution of canal water for irrigation varies across the case study
            WCAs. In the poorly performing case study WCA in Dustlik District, Jizzakh Oblast, for example,
            respondents suggested that even if the VAC head represents dehkans and tomorka owners in the
            WCA and collects irrigation fees from them, in reality there is no official contact between the VAC
            and the WCA. In contrast, in the high-performing WCA in Kyzyltep District, Navoi, the head of the
            VAC is a member of the WCA supervisory board, which helps ensure that the needs of dehkans and
            tomorka owners are met.

XVIII.	     A number of WCAs— those that perform perhaps somewhat better than others—have explicitly
            recognized smallholders as legitimate water consumers by including their irrigation requirements
            in water delivery schedules, and sometimes even hiring a mirob to take care of their irrigation needs.
            Where this has happened, it has helped alleviate tensions between farmers and smallholders and
            prevented unpredictable water supply shortages. In WCAs where there is a lack of clarity on this
            issue, however, the opposite happens. Clearly, including smallholder water needs in the WCA’s day-
            to-day operations appears to be an important factor that determines the quality of local water
            management arrangements.
4. In fact, according to the Water Law, Dehkans and Tomorka owners can become members of a WCA. However many don’t due to lack of awaress or
for logistical reasons.

                                                                    15
XIX.	    A number of factors influence the extent to which legitimate users and illegitimate users are
         clearly defined, and thus whether the needs of dehkans and tomorka owners are included in the
         local management arrangements of irrigation water. These include the following:
         •	        Separate canal intakes for the irrigation needs of dehkans and tomorka owners. If there
                   are special canal water intake structures for these smallholders’ irrigation needs, chances
                   are that their legitimate needs are met in a more reliable and predictable manner.
         •	        WCA contracts for supplying water to dehkans and tomorka owners. Concrete and well-
                   developed water supply contracts between the WCA and the VAC that specify how the
                   legitimate irrigation needs of these smallholders will be met are also an important factor
                   in this regard.
         •	        Distance between the VAC office and the WCA office. We find that if the office of the
                   VAC—which in principle represents dehkans and tomorka owners—is located far (say, 20
                   km or more) from the WCA office, it hampers effective communication between these
                   two organizations. This makes it difficult to ensure that the irrigation needs of these
                   smallholders are consistently met and that they pay their irrigation fees.
         •	        Distance between the fields of dehkans and tomorka owners and the main interfarm
                   canal. If their fields are close to the main WCA interfarm canal, their unregulated water
                   intake may interrupt the main irrigation supply schedule to farmers. If their fields are
                   further away from the canal, they will depend on farmers’ willingness and preparedness
                   to let water pass onto their fields. This factor of distance works in both ways, and could
                   either support or undermine legitimate use of irrigation water.
         •	        Overall water scarcity. If overall availability in the WCA area is low, there are stronger
                   incentives to carefully plan water distribution and make sure every user’s needs are
                   incorporated into irrigation plans. However, whether this is the case also depends on
                   production conditions and whether growers have the freedom to grow the crop that is
                   most suitable for the area and most profitable.
         •	        Mirobs for dehkans and tomorka owners. If there are mirobs to specifically take care of
                   the irrigation needs of dehkans and tomorka owners, it is more likely that their needs will
                   be met.
         •	        Active and effective VAC leaders and WCA directors. All water consumers benefit
                   when local leaders communicate effectively; when they adequately build trust between
                   WCA members and also smallholders; and when they are active in decision making or
                   supervisory bodies (such as the WCA board).

Design principle 2: Congruence between the benefits and costs of using irrigation water

XX.	     The second design principle for the sustainable management of irrigation water as a common-
         pool resource is that the benefits of using the resource must be proportional to the inputs used
         or effort made to obtain it. These inputs can be in the form of labor, materials, or money. This
         principle, for example, could imply that the costs households incur for obtaining irrigation water are
         proportional to their needs (for example, depending on land size or crop type in our case) and use,
         as well as availability.

XXI.	    User payments for irrigation water are generally not linked to the actual amount of water used.
         Water consumers in all ten WCAs incur three types of costs to obtain irrigation water: the irrigation
         service fee; additional costs to maintain canals or repair structures; and, in some cases, expenses
         to pump water to their fields. Of these three costs, only the expenses incurred for pumping are
         directly related to the amount of water consumed. The irrigation service fee consists of a low and
         fixed amount per ha (about Soum 10,000–60,000 per ha, or US$3–24 per ha), depending on the
         crops grown. In some WCAs, farmers pay the same fixed fee per ha for all crop types. The irrigation
         fee accounts for only a small percentage of total production costs.

XXII.	   We find that in all of the WCAs we studied, irrigation fees are lowest for the crop that uses the
         most irrigation water—cotton, the main state-mandated crop. However, there are substantial
         differences in cotton irrigation fees across WCAs. They tend to be the lowest in the poorly

                                                     16
           performing WCAs, where farmers’ levels of satisfaction with irrigation services are low. Farmers’
           net returns to the volume of water used are 2–3 times lower for cotton than for wheat and other
           crops. In addition, famers ‘returns to the amount paid for obtaining the water are five times lower
           than other crops when cotton yields are low (this is illustrated in Table O.1 in the second-to-last
           column). This could be because cotton is planted in areas that are not very suitable for growing it.
           In these areas, the amount paid for irrigation water is not proportional to the returns, compared
           to growing wheat or other crops. However, when cotton yields are high, net returns to the amount
           paid for water can be the same for cotton and wheat (see Table O.1, last column).

XXIII.	    Charging lower fees to irrigate the state-mandated crops - that generate low profits for many
           producers - may make the costs of irrigation water proportional to the benefits of using it, but
           doing so undermines the ability of WCAs to allocate water to the crops that are most profitable
           for farmers. The best-performing WCAs tend to be those that are able to make water available
           to cultivate profitable secondary crops (neither wheat nor cotton). They also tend to be the ones
           that charge the highest irrigation fees for these secondary crops. Both actions make it possible for
           farmers and WCAs to generate sufficient resources to maintain and repair the irrigation system.

XXIV.	     Raising the irrigation fee might in theory help fund irrigation canal maintenance needs. However,
           this worries some WCA officials, who claimed that if farmers pay higher fees they will want to
           hold the WCA accountable for supplying the exact amount of water that is stated in the delivery
           contract they have with the WCA. But since the amount of water supplied to farmers depends in
           large part on how much water the AIS and BAIS supply to the WCA through the main canal, as well
           as weather conditions, the WCA administration is not confident they can honor the commitment.
           Moreover, WCA officials claimed it is impossible for the WCA to hold the AIS accountable for the
           water it has agreed to deliver to the WCA.

XXV.	      In well-functioning WCAs, farmers pay higher fees than those in poorly functioning WCAs, and are
           active in maintaining and repairing the irrigation system. In poorly functioning WCAs—such as the
           sampled WCAs in Pap District in Namangan and Dustlik District in Jizzakh—farmers have not agreed
           to higher fees. A significant number of farmers here are indebted. Some farmers fear that if water
           meters are installed they will have to pay for unlimited use by dehkans and tomorka owners, who
           withdraw water through the canals going to their farm, which is the case in Pap District, Namangan,
           and Kyzyltep District in Navoi. An important observation is that in well-functioning WCAs (for
           example, those sampled in Navoi oblast, Surkhandarya oblastand Kuwa district, Ferganaoblast)
           farmers not only pay higher irrigation fees, but they also tend to pay on time.


                                                                  17
XXVI.	       The findings suggest that farmers who grow secondary crops use water more cautiously and look
             for ways to save water or irrigate their fields more efficiently. In particular, farmers who grow
             secondary crops often use drip irrigation, arrange for wells to be drilled, or mix water from drainage
             canals with water from the irrigation canal. This is the case in the sampled WCAs in Urgench District
             in Khorezm, Akaltyn District in Syrdaryo, Kyzyltep District in Navoi, and Kattakurgan District in
             Samarkand, where water availability for secondary crops is low or medium.


XXVII.	      The relatively low profitability of the state-mandated crops from a farmers’ point of view5
             undermines farmers’ ability to sufficiently contribute to the adequate maintenance of the local
             irrigation and drainage systems. Somewhat inconsistently, the policy to give preference to state-
             mandated crops appears to be enforced even in areas where the state has allocated a substantial
             proportion of land to the much more profitable horticultural crops, making horticultural farmers
             vulnerable to late and insufficient irrigation services. There are signs that horticultural farmers are
             willing to pay much higher irrigation fees on the condition that their needs are given higher priority
             in local irrigation schedules.


XXVIII.	 Farmers must pay irrigation fees by bank transfer instead of in cash, as this is required by national
         law for all financial transfers between legal entities. This leads to substantial delays in payment. As
         a consequence, the WCAs have trouble paying staff salaries and taxes when they are due. Partly to
         avoid paying the labor taxes that the WCAs incur for hiring employees, farmers claimed they have
         not gone through the WCA but have spent money directly on canal maintenance and repairing the
         parts of the irrigation system that serve their area.


XXIX.	       Irrigation is traditionally a male responsibility, but the gender division of labor is changing due
             to the growing outmigration of Uzbek men. This particularly affects dehkans and tomorka owners.
             Following male outmigration, women in dehkan and tomorka-owning households have become
             more involved in agriculture and irrigation. Female dehkans or tomorka owners whose husband is
             absent often have trouble attending to nightly irrigation duties (farmers often only allow dehkans
             and tomorka owners to water their land at night). These intakes might be located far from their
             house, and if men are not around, women must perform this difficult task. Women feel unsafe at
             night. The burden to obtain irrigation water is clearly higher for women than for men.


Design principles 4, 5, and 6: Those who monitor water use(rs) and those that sanction violators are
accountable to water users


XXX.	        The findings suggest that even though farmers sign water delivery contracts with the WCA,
             and the WCA is in principle accountable to water consumers, the AIS plays an important role in
             monitoring overall water use, even if it is not accountable to WCAs or to water consumers. The
             WCA is not in a position to enforce the contractual arrangement it has with the AIS, partly because
             the WCA does not pay for the irrigation water it receives from it. In fact, the AIS may deliver less
             water if it turns out the water level in the rivers and canals is lower than anticipated, or pumps
             or canals are broken and there are no funds for repairs. This has caused friction between farmers
             and WCAs. The AIS’s lack of accountability to the WCA appears to be an important reason why
             some WCAs are not keen on raising irrigation service fees. This would suggest that the AIS’s limited
             accountability prevents the WCAs from mobilizing the resources needed to recover costs and pay
             for canal operation, maintenance, and repairs.


XXXI.	       WCA members interviewed in all case study sites—except those in Surkhandarya and Tashkent
             Oblasts—claimed that the WCA water supply schedule almost entirely focuses on meeting the
             production quota of the state-mandated crops. Overall, the AIS and the Hokimiyat have an interest
             in making sure WCAs are able to maintain the WCA irrigation system, deliver sufficient water to
5. This study only looked at the farmers’ perspective and did not assess the profitability of state-mandated crops for the state.

                                                                          18
          farmers in time to cultivate cotton and wheat, and prevent or settle disputes among farmers. Farmers
          stated they supported the interference of the AIS when the WCA is weak, as it will help them meet
          the state production quota. WCAs are not allowed to fail, and the state will interfere if they collapse.
          However, in the medium term, this makes the WCA and its members dependent on the government,
          which undermines a number of design principles for community management of common-pool
          resources and removes incentives to innovate and adopt more effective arrangements.


XXXII.	   In areas where the WCA is weak and its staff are not respected by farmers—such as in the
          sampled WCAs in Namangan and Jizzakh—the AIS and other government organizations intervene
          and more or less take over WCA management. However, given the continued weak performance
          of these WCAs and their farmers’ low satisfaction with water delivery, this seems to do little to
          improve the overall management of irrigation water as a common-pool resource.


XXXIII.	 In contrast, in areas with strong WCAs (such as those sampled in Navoi, Surkhandarya,
         Syrdaryo, and Tashkent Oblasts), farmers suggested there is no need for the AIS and/or Vodhoz
         to intervene. Their WCA was said to be able to solve all water management issues by itself, and
         sometimes negotiate issues directly with the BAIS. Farmers in the selected WCA in Tashkent Oblast,
         for example, claimed that as far as they are concerned, the AIS can be abolished and the WCA can
         work directly with the BAIS. A good practice was found in Kuwa district, where the AIS meets with
         all WCA directors in the district once every ten days.


XXXIV.	 WCAs are not allowed to sanction farmers or other water consumers that violate the irrigation
        schedule or excessively use water, such as through fines. If there are any disputes among farmers
        over irrigation water, they are solved through discussion meetings or settled personally by the WCA
        head. This works particularly well when the WCA head enjoys the respect of the local community.
        One WCA that is able to apply sanctions is the Kuwa urta buz anori WCA in Kuwa District, Fergana
        Oblast. Here, farmers’ water use is strictly monitored by the WCA in case farmers don’t abide by
        the agreed-upon water regulations. In this case, WCA authorities claim that the water will not be
        supplied to their farm for a period of time. Moreover, in this WCA, the eight mirobs who control the
        water supply to farm plots have a journal where farmers must sign for the water they receive. There
        is even a special journal for tomorka owners where they can write complaints to the WCA.


XXXV.	    Many respondents indicated the need to install meters and controlling devices to monitor water
          use. They also indicated the need for mirobs to do good monitoring. However, it is a challenge for
          many WCAs to find qualified mirobs, as it is difficult to find enough young and qualified specialists
          to work in rural areas. To do this challenging job, mirobs are low paid (Soum 200,000–400,000 or
          US$65–120 per month) and often paid late.


XXXVI.	 As mentioned, conflicts can arise when dehkans and tomorka owners make unplanned withdrawals
        from irrigation canals, which causes water shortages for farmers further down the canal. In some
        WCAs, this has led to conflicts between farmers and the smallholders, and between farmers and the
        WCA administration. The WCA does not have any power or legal authority to impose penalties on
        dehkans and tomorka owners (as they are not members of the WCA).


XXXVII.	 There are a number of informal practices that promote effective monitoring and improve the
         accountability of the AIS and the WCA. Some WCAs—especially the better-performing ones—have
         found mechanisms to monitor water use and users, and hold the WCA accountable via a committee
         of respected farmers. Other WCAs have daily meetings with WCA members during the irrigation
         season. In some of the case study areas, the AIS meets with WCA directors on a regular basis (once
         every ten days), possibly ensuring some informal way to prevent disputes over water delivery. As
         mentioned, installing meters and controlling devices to track water use would go a long way toward
         improving monitoring and accountability.

Design principles 3, 7, and 8: Users can modify rules and have the right to devise their own institutions;
these institutions are nested in a larger resource system

XXXVIII.	 In each case study site, the WCA administration reports to a General Assembly that consists of
          WCA members (mostly farmers) and which is also attended by officials of the AIS, BAIS, Vodhoz,
          VAC, and by Hokimiyat and mahalla leaders. In principle, the General Assembly oversees the WCA
          staff and its director. The agenda can include the election of the WCA head, board members, and
          sometimes the appointment of other key staff members. Also up for discussion are budget and
          irrigation fees for the coming year as well as planning maintenance activities for the WCA irrigation
          system. How frequently General Assembly meetings are held varies across WCAs, from no meetings
          in the poorly performing WCA in Dustlik District in Jizzakh to 20 in the high-performing WCA in
          Kyzyltep District in Navoi, with meetings typically taking place 2–6 times a year.

XXXIX.	 In addition to the General Assembly, all WCAs have a supervisory board of farmer and community
        representatives that oversee the WCA director. The WCAs appear to benefit from the hands-on
        monitoring and day-to-day problem solving these board members provide. This is particularly the
        case in the high-performing WCAs.

XL.	      In many WCAs, farmers and smallholders make their own maintenance arrangements off the
          books of the WCA, mainly to avoid paying labor tax. This is particularly common for farmers who
          have their own machines. While this flexibility certainly has advantages in the short term, over time
          this could undermine the role and viability of the WCA in its current form.

XLI.	     In seven out of ten case studies, WCA members thought the WCA administration represented
          their interests, and regarded the WCA as “their” organization. Farmers felt they were involved in
          the WCA’s decision-making process. Officials of these WCAs are to some extent able to negotiate
          irrigation regulations with government bodies, providing some flexibility to their implementation.

XLII.	    In WCAs where farmers were not satisfied with the quality of water management, they feel
          helpless. They do not regard the WCA as “their” organization but rather as an additional
          government entity. In particular, in the selected WCA in Pap District, Namangan, many farmers are
          frustrated by poor water management and the WCA’s inability to solve problems. Farmers at the
          tail end of the canal in this WCA receive insufficient amounts of water and many struggle to meet
          the production quota for cotton and wheat. Many refuse to pay their irrigation fees. In the poorly
          performing WCAs, both the WCA administration and farmers see no other solution but to have the
          government take over the financing of the WCA’s operations and the maintenance of the irrigation
          system.

XLIII.	   In well-managed WCAs, farmers and the WCA administration help each other to maintain the
          irrigation system. Farmers may provide the WCA with machinery and pay for fuel, spare parts, and
          labor when the WCA repairs interfarm canals. On the other hand, the WCA may help farmers repair
          on-farm canals, purchase fuel, or help farmers who lack equipment borrow what they need from
          the AIS or the Hokimiyat. In order to deal with sudden needs for repairs, the sampled WCA in Denov
          District, Surkhandarya has a fund for emergencies.

XLIV.	    In the well-performing WCAs, farmers and staff claimed to be driven by a “shared vision,” and
          the most experienced and resourceful farmers sometimes help others with advice, machinery,
          and even small loans. The drive to produce state-mandated crops creates a common goal for
          stakeholders, farmers, and local irrigation bureaucrats alike. This joint sense of purpose, combined
          with strong incentives for local government officials to ensure farmers meet production quotas,
          strengthens the overall commitment to deliver irrigation water to cotton and wheat crops in a
          timely manner.


                                                      20
XLV.	      However, the overall state policy of giving priority to state-mandated crops causes these crops
           to use up most of the irrigation water, which removes opportunities for farmers to innovate and
           allocate water to more lucrative crops. Dehkans and tomorka owners can only indirectly influence
           water allocation decisions, and whether their right to organize is recognized depends on the quality
           of the interaction between the dehkans, tomorka owners, the VAC, and the WCA.

Conclusions

XLVI.	     Overall, farmers state that the management of local irrigation water has much improved since
           WUAs/WCAs were established. These organizations appear to have played a role in bringing
           structure to the chaos that surrounded the local management of irrigation canal water after the
           shirkats were abandoned.

XLVII.	    In the eyes of stakeholders, a WCA’s performance depends on three conditions. First, the
           proportion of the WCA area that depends on electrical pumps should be low, especially if the supply
           of electricity is unreliable. Second, growing conditions should be suitable for the crops the WCA
           farmers have been assigned to grow by the state. If this is not the case, yields will remain low, which
           will lead to low profits for farmers, limited resources, and few incentives to improve local water
           management. Third, the WCA director should have high-quality leadership skills that enable him
           or her to build trust among water consumers and the WCA; strengthen social capital; and establish
           good relations with farmers, officials, and all water consumers, including smallholders.

XLVIII.	   Our data suggest that the presence of these characteristics and conditions is highly variable across
           WCAs in Uzbekistan. Many WCAs are deeply in debt due to low irrigation fees, high salaries, and
           substantial operational costs. In some poorly functioning WCAs, farmers are demoralized and lack
           a reliable supply of irrigation canal water for their crops. However, in other WCAs where water is
           also scarce, farmers are more satisfied with irrigation water management, partly because they are
           allowed to grow the more lucrative horticultural crops.

XLIX.	     The Ostrom design principles for managing irrigation water as a common-pool resource are met
           in some WCAs but not in others. For example, the needs of dehkans and tomorka owners are
           not always included in local management arrangements, which can interrupt water supply to all
           users. In situations where male dehkans have migrated, their wives are left behind to take care of
           irrigation. This is difficult for them as they receive their irrigation water at night, when many women
           feel unsafe.

L.	        In all of the WCAs we studied, irrigation fees are lowest for the crop that uses the most irrigation
           water—cotton, the main state-mandated crop. This undermines the second Ostrom design
           principle. However, there are substantial differences in cotton irrigation fees across the WCAs. Fees
           tend to be the lowest in the poorly performing WCAs, where farmers’ level of satisfaction with
           irrigation services is low. This would suggest that farmers are prepared and able to pay higher fees
           should irrigation service conditions improve.

LI.	       Farmers that grow cotton obtain much lower returns per unit of water used than wheat and
           horticultural crops when cotton yields are low (2 tons/ha). This implies that when growing
           conditions for cotton are poor there are enormous economic inefficiencies in using irrigation water
           to grow these crops anyway.

LII.	      WCAs are only willing to substantially raise irrigation fees (to better recover operation and
           maintenance costs) if they can hold the AIS more accountable for the amount of water it has agreed
           to deliver (given weather conditions in upstream areas). The AIS’s current limited accountability to
           the WCAs puts them in a difficult position vis-à-vis their members and makes it hard for them to be
           accountable for delivering irrigation canal water to farmers and other water consumers.

                                                        21
LIII.	    The compulsory planting of cotton and wheat (even in areas less suitable for their cultivation)
          combined with low state purchase prices undermines farmers’ ability to generate sufficient
          resources to pay for local operation and maintenance, either through their own initiatives or
          through the irrigation fees they pay to the WCAs. Those WCAs that manage to make sufficient
          amounts of water available for profitable secondary crops perform better and are better able to
          recover operation and maintenance costs. They also tend to be the ones that charge the highest
          irrigation fees for secondary crops.

LIV.	     The AIS’s involvement in managing “weaker” WCAs (those that are unable to adequately
          manage their irrigation canal water in the medium term) undermines “ownership” and the sense
          of responsibility water consumers have for the management of canal water, and makes them
          dependent on the state. WCAs rarely sanction farmers or other water consumers and it is unclear
          whether they can do that or whether only the AIS can do this, which would undermine one of the
          design principles.

LV.	      However, there are a number of good practices that promote effective monitoring and improve
          the accountability of the AIS and the WCA. These include establishing a committee of respected
          farmers to solve conflicts; holding daily meetings with members of the WCA during the irrigation
          season; and having the AIS meet with WCA directors on a regular basis.

LVI.	     The current lack of meters and controlling devices makes it difficult to monitor irrigation water
          use or establish accountability between water suppliers and consumers. In many WCAs, farmers
          and smallholders make their own maintenance arrangements off the books of the WCA to avoid
          paying labor tax. This is particularly common for farmers who have their own machines. Over time
          this could undermine the role and viability of the WCA in its current form.

LVII.	    Even if in principle irrigation water consumers are able to devise their own institutions, meet, and
          make decisions, this design principle is undermined by the nationwide effort to produce wheat and
          cotton. WCA rules can only be changed if they remain within the overall state agricultural policy,
          which gives priority to state-mandated crops. Also dehkans and tomorka owners can only indirectly
          influence water allocation decisions, and whether their right to organize is recognized depends on
          the quality of the interactions between the dehkans, tomorka owners, the VAC, and the WCA.

Diagnostic tool

LVIII.	   Based on the findings of this study, we designed a diagnostic tool that can be used in the field
          to assess, for example, whether a particular WCA meets the design principles for sustainable
          management of common-pool irrigation water. This tool can affect the extent to which conditions
          for well-functioning local governance arrangements for managing irrigation water are present. It
          will also help in the design of priority interventions that improve local water management so it is
          more sustainable, reflects local conditions, and includes all water consumers.

LIX.	     The tool consists of a set of questions that need to be answered in the field. The questions
          (presented in Chapter 7) are based on each of the Ostrom design principles for the sustainable
          management of irrigation water as a common-pool resource.

Recommendations

LX.	      In addition to drafting the diagnostic tool, we make a number of recommendations for improving
          the local management of irrigation water in Uzbekistan. These are presented below.

Recommendations for institutions

I.	       Clarify the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders in the management of local irrigation water
          in order to strengthen operational functioning of the WCAs. This includes the AIS, WCA staff,
          WCA members, other water consumers and local government officials of other organisations. The
          clarification could be provided through a new Water Law/ Code (see below).
                                                     22
II.	     Involve dehkans (especially women) more structurally in decision making that pertains to water
         allocation scheduling, and arrange for them to have canal water intakes. More awareness raising
         among them of how they should more actively engage with decision making and providing beter
         support services to make that happen is important. As dehkans and tomorka owners are important
         consumers of the irrigation water that is managed by the WCAs, their water needs must be better
         addressed, and their involvement in decision making that pertains to water allocation schedules
         must be more structural. The VAC does not currently seem consistently able to adequately manage
         this.

III.	    Clarify in the Water Law/ Code whether WCAs are allowed to sanction water consumers that
         break the rules. If WCA members establish rules and regulations for allocating irrigation water to
         all consumers, it is important that the WCA, under certain circumstances, be able to sanction water
         consumers that break those rules. This is an important condition for operating the irrigation system
         as a common-pool resource.

IV.	     Strengthen the provision of support services to the WCAs and promote learning across them,
         using successful WCAs as schools and training sites. Many WCAs are in need of support services
         that better enable them to fulfill their role and better recover costs. Many of them confront similar
         challenges, but some appear better able to address them than others. There are significant learning
         opportunities to be had by exchanging experiences across WCAs, and in allowing poorly performing
         WCAs to learn from successful ones. Ultimately, such WCA-to-WCA learning could also be done
         across different countries in the region

V.	      Encourage and empower the WCA board. The WCA board plays an important role in supervising
         WCA authorities, giving advice, overseeing its overall functioning, and solving conflicts. It is important
         that its role be further strengthened and not undermined by new government regulations.

VI.	     Better track the irrigation system’s performance through administrative data collection or sample
         surveys that feature some of the questions in the diagnostic tool. In order to help policy makers
         understand whether water allocation systems are working and whether the BAIS, AIS, and WCA
         are adequately performing their functions, it is important that the WCA’s performance is more
         systematically monitored. In addition, sample surveys could be conducted that systematically
         collect data on water consumers’ satisfaction with the current irrigation system. Such feedback to
         policy makers and service providers is critical if they are to have a good overview of where things
         succeed and where they need improvement, and for addressing shortcomings in a timely manner.

Recommendations for policies

VII.	    Adopt a new Water Law/Water Code and take legal measures that provide for a better financing
         aspects of WCA operations. These legal changes should better provide for the WCAs’ financial and
         operational sustainability and provide a stronger accountability mechanism for their governance
         structure. The water code should also provide a legal basis for a more contractual relationship
         between the AIS and the WCA, with clear monitorable agreements on water delivery. The new
         Water Code should provide a strong legal basis for the supervisory board of farmer and community
         representatives to oversee the WCA director, and should also provide a stronger, more structural,
         and direct role for dehkans and tomorka owners in decisions pertaining to water allocation.

VIII.	   Bring the water allocation policy in line with the land-use liberalization policy. While the
         government has indicated its interest in allowing farmers to grow the crops that they prefer—usually
         horticultural crops—the water allocation policy at the local level often prevents the allocation of
         adequate irrigation water to these lucrative crops, which also provide much higher returns per
         volume of water used.


                                                       23
IX.	    Lower the labor tax for WCAs to generate more resources for O&M. A lower labor tax will improve
        WCAs’ functioning by enabling them to more systematically contract laborers for maintenance
        work; farmers currently hire such laborers informally. This will make it possible for WCAs to better
        plan and implement canal repair and maintenance work.

Recommendations for investment

X.	     Improve the water delivery contracts between AIS and WCA and install water meters at the level
        of the WCA canal intake. Contracts that the AIS signs for the amount of water to be delivered to the
        WCA, and the amount actually delivered, need to be better monitored. The AIS needs to be held
        accountable for the volumes of water it actually delivers to the WCA (given weather conditions in
        upstream areas). Meters at the level of the WCAs’ water intake will enable these amounts to be
        more accurately measured. This would allow WCAs to provide more reliable irrigation service to
        their members and will open opportunities to raise irrigation fees and improve cost recovery.

XI.	    Upgrade outdated irrigation pumps. Many WCAs and farmers depend on irrigation water that enters
        the canals through electric pumps or they use pumps themselves. For a reliable and predictable
        supply of local irrigation canal water, it is important that outdated irrigation pumps that are owned
        and/or managed by the AIS (and possibly the WCAs) be replaced with modern ones. However, this
        requires a reliable supply of electricity to all areas in Uzbekistan, and requires a financing model to
        be found that enables pumping stations to recover their costs.

1. Introduction
Background
1.	   During the past decade or so, government irrigation agencies in many developing countries were
      under pressure to become more financially sustainable, increase cost recovery, and make more
      efficient use of scarce water resources. Government irrigation agencies were often constrained
      by slow bureaucratic procedures, dwindling budgets, rigid policies, and unmotivated personnel, all
      of which led to poor performance. Many attempted to collect irrigation service fees but few were
      successful. The time was ripe for a fundamental change in the irrigation subsector.

2.	   Irrigation Management Transfer (IMT) has since emerged around the world in an effort to not
      only increase cost recovery but to make water consumers more responsible and active in the
      operation and maintenance of local-level irrigation infrastructure. It was believed that increased
      ownership and decision-making authority by water consumers themselves would provide greater
      incentives to recover costs and improve the irrigation system’s performance. Such an approach—
      where decision making is driven by water consumers and Water User Associations (WUAs)—would
      also make the irrigation management system more accountable to farmers.

3.	   A review of the global IMT experience conducted by the FAO and IWMI revealed there have been
      substantial improvements along a number of performance indicators. Cost recovery has increased
      and communication between system management and end users has improved. The closer
      involvement of WUAs in decision making around local water management has indeed resulted
      in increased accountability, transparency, and responsibility, as has been witnessed in China and
      Mexico, for example (FAO and IWMI, 2007). However, there has been a tendency to overstate the
      objectives and expectations of IMT programs, which creates expectations that have not always been
      fulfilled.

4.	   Major constraints to further improving the performance of the irrigation system under IMT were
      found to include: (i) a lack of political support in some countries, leading to insufficient funding and
      a lack of support for the reform process; and (ii) reluctance to change existing water laws, which
      has resulted in reliance on ministerial decrees that have insufficient weight and authority. This has
      often led to an unclear and weak legal basis regarding the responsibilities and nature of WUAs.
      WUAs’ water rights are often not well developed under the law. A third constraint has been the lack
      of managerial skills within WUAs, which leads to poor provision of water services (FAO and IWMI,
      2007).

5.	   Irrigation canal water is essentially a common-pool resource. Common-pool resources are a
      subset of “public goods.” A characteristic of all public goods is that many people can use them at
      the same time, because exclusion is difficult. Common-pool resources, by contrast, are public goods
      with finite, or subtractive benefits. If one person uses more, less remains for others. Common-
      pool resources are therefore potentially subject to congestion, depletion, or degradation, or use
      that is pushed beyond the limits of sustainable yields (Wade, 1987). Canal water is a common-pool
      resource—it can be used jointly and its consumption is subtractive in the sense that water applied
      to A’s land is not simultaneously available for B’s. Therefore, when water is scarce, it increases
      the likelihood of congestion, which is manifested in conflict, hoarding, and yield reductions, where
      water arrives too late (Wade, 1987).

6.	   Across the world there is strong evidence that local communities can successfully manage
      common-pool resources. Successful collective action in governing common-pool resources such as
      irrigation water, forests, and fishing areas takes place in many countries on all continents. Until the
      1980s, many scholars had presumed that users of common-pool resources could not self-organize
      to manage them. Thus, scholars often recommended imposing government or private ownership
      based on the theories of Hardin (1968), among others. However, following North’s (1990) conception

                                                   25
       of institutions as mechanisms for reducing uncertainty in complex, uncertain environments, it was
       found that such institutions are often able to reduce uncertainty, build trust, and generate norms
       of reciprocity, which makes collective action possible. Ostrom (1990) subsequently defined the
       eight “design principles” for managing common-pool resources. We use these design principles to
       study irrigation water in Uzbekistan as a common-pool resource and assess to what extent local
       communities are successfully managing it and what conditions favor success.

7.	    Uzbekistan is facing increasing challenges to satisfy future demand for irrigation water. Agriculture
       in Uzbekistan is almost entirely dependent on irrigation, which covers about 4 million ha, or about
       80 percent of cultivated land. At the current rate of population growth, annual renewable water
       availability is expected to fall below 1,700 m3 per capita by 2030, which is considered the threshold
       for water scarcity. Climate change is expected to amplify seasonal and annual variation, and forecasts
       suggest that most of the country will experience severe water shortages in the future.

8.	    The main water resource problem, however, seems to be inefficient water management rather
       than water shortage per se. Much water is said to be lost in conveyance to and within the on-farm
       systems, and water is poorly used by irrigators, who have had very little, if any, training in efficient
       water application methods (Burton, 2014). There is almost no proper measurement of water within
       the on-farm system, and the measuring structures that were provided at the interface of the off-
       and on-farm systems are generally not functioning (World Bank, 2013).

9.	    Uzbekistan is characterized by a very strong state and there are strong vertical links between
       the state ideology, the water discourse, and practice. Central to the official water discourse is the
       idea that water is supposed to be free and readily available (Kraak, 2012). The concept of water as
       a free good has its origin in the Soviet Union. Moreover, free water has taken on a pseudoreligious
       significance, and it is claimed that water pricing is impossible because “water comes from God”
       (Glantz, 1999).

10.	   In Uzbekistan, IMT started in 1999 with the creation of WUAs. The state created these in response
       to the chaotic water management situation that followed the dissolution of the shirkats (collective
       farms that had succeeded the Soviet-era kolkhoz and sovkhoz). The distribution of land among
       individual farmers led to an institutional vacuum, where no one was in charge of managing irrigation
       and drainage water. There was no mechanism to manage and allocate water among farmers, and
       conflicts over water use were common.

11.	   The Law on Water and Water Use of 2009 governs the role of WUAs. It enables WUAs to collect
       Irrigation Service Fees (ISFs), which are based on contracts signed with WUA members. According
       to the law, farmers that are legal entities and all other water consumers can be members of a
       WUA. Self-governing bodies can also be members. By 2013, the WUAs were reregistered as Water
       Consumer Associations (WCAs) and restructured following a new provision issued by the Ministry of
       Justice. Apart from the name change, this new provision intended to include all water consumers in
       any given territory, including dehkans, tomorka owners, and mahallas as members. It also involved
       a change from commercial to noncommercial and nongovernmental status and restructuring the
       board, which leads to less oversight of the WCA director.

12.	   Efforts have been underway since 2010 to draft a new water law/water code and related legal
       measures; the goal is to improve the legislation that regulates the financial aspects of WCA
       operations to make them more sustainable. The new code also intends to provide a stronger
       accountability mechanism for the WCA governance structure. In 2013, an interagency working
       group finalized a draft water code that embodied a change from supply management to demand
       management. On October 7, 2013, the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources (MAWR)
       submitted the document to the Cabinet of Ministers for review and feedback. Although no feedback
       was formally received from the Cabinet of Ministers, the Oliy Majlis (Parliament) has included the
       draft water code in their plan for the first quarter of 2016 for review and adoption.


                                                    26
13.	   Despite these reforms, much of Uzbekistan’s irrigation allegedly continues to function poorly. The
       system is said to be caught in a vicious cycle of inadequate repairs (see Picture 1) and operation and
       maintenance, low cost recovery, low agricultural productivity, and low incomes for many farmers
       (World Bank, 2013). Over the past twenty years, operation and maintenance (O&M) of the national
       irrigation and drainage infrastructure has suffered from substantial underfunding, with only about
       15 percent to 25 percent of requirements provided by the MAWR’s recurrent budget (see Picture
       2 for the conditions of pumps in one WCA in Khorezm). Overall system and on-farm water-use
       efficiency is by most accounts much lower than optimal; only about one-quarter of the distribution
       channels are equipped with anti-seepage lining (see Picture 3)(World Bank, 2013). It is estimated
       that some 50 percent of water supplied to farm boundaries does not reach the field. The drainage
       system has suffered more than the irrigation system and is in very poor condition (Burton, 2014).

14.	       There are few incentives to save water because farmers do not see the direct costs of water
           provision. The irrigation fees they pay function like a land tax, as these are not tied to actual water
           use (World Bank, 2013). Dehkans (smallholders) and tomorka (kitchen garden) owners often pay
           a fixed fee per ha. The Government of Uzbekistan (GoU) more than recovers the cost of irrigation
           services by heavily taxing cotton and wheat production through low fixed procurement prices for
           these crops. However, these funds are not sufficiently used to improve the quality of irrigation
           and drainage. The net result is deteriorating irrigation services, declining farm output, and growing
           environmental problems. In addition, because water is provided more or less for free (marginal
           costs are zero for water consumers), there is a lack of interest in using water efficiently (World Bank,
           2013).

15.	       Available evidence suggests that the quality of local irrigation water management and
           governance varies across the country, yet it is not known why it works better in some areas
           than others. The theory around the management of common-pool resources suggests that local-
           level water consumers must have developed a range of mechanisms to sustainably share canal
           water. Understanding the factors that cause some local irrigation management systems to work
           better than others can help design a diagnostic instrument that assesses whether these factors
           are met and identifies program interventions for putting these in place. Methods for undertaking
           such assessments should be underpinned by a solid analytical framework for the management of
           irrigation canal water as a common-pool resource.

Objectives
16.	       The main objective of this study is to contribute to better irrigation water management in Central
           Asia, beginning in Uzbekistan, by: (i) identifying factors and conditions that positively affect
           the performance of local irrigation water management institutions; (ii) preparing an associated
           diagnostic tool that will help design measures and program interventions to strengthen these
           institutions in ongoing or future irrigation operations; and (iii) facilitating the exchange of good
           practices and knowledge sharing among relevant stakeholders across the region. The aim was to
           pilot the approach in Uzbekistan before covering other Central Asian countries.

17.	       By looking at irrigation water in Uzbekistan as a common-pool resource, we assess what local,
           social, economic, and biophysical conditions favor local communities’ successful collective
           action to manage irrigation canal water in an optimal manner. Irrigation and drainage programs
           and schemes can then define interventions that promote these conditions. These objectives are
                                                        28
         pursued through a case study approach, which involved a systematic, in-depth assessment of local-
         level institutional arrangements to manage irrigation and drainage water in ten selected sites across
         the country.

18.	     By adopting a case study approach, the assessment is able to assess the performance of local
         water management systems and analyze the extent to which preconditions for successful
         collective action are met. It allows us to gather in-depth and relevant experiences and perspectives
         from irrigation water consumers and officials within the circumstances in which they operate.

Analytical framework
19.	     The analytical framework for this assessment is formed by the eight design principles for the
         management of common-pool resources developed by Ostrom (1990) and modified by Cox,
         Arnold, and Tomás (2010). These design principles are in essence factors that are associated with
         successful collective action in governing common-pool resources such as irrigation water, forests,
         and fishing areas. Their primary role is to explain under what conditions trust and reciprocity can be
         built and maintained to sustain collective action in the face of social dilemmas posed by common-
         pool resources. This collective action, in turn, helps prevent the deterioration of a managed common-
         pool resource (Cox, Arnold, and Tomás, 2010). The potential benefits from collective action have to
         be clear and substantial (see Box 1).

Box 1. The importance of scarcity and risk for collective action

Research has shown that in South India, scarcity and risk were particularly important in influencing
collective action. When resources such as irrigation water are scarce, collective action was more likely
to take place. Other factors that appeared to explain why some villages managed their common-pool
resources better than others are the village’s social structure, state presence, relationships with markets,
and demographic composition (Wade, 1994).

20.	     A recent review of the relevant literature on the Ostrom design principles (covering 92 studies)
         showed that the principles are empirically well supported (Cox, Arnold, and Tomás, 2010).
         The principles provide a valuable framework for our assessment. We use the modified version
         of the design principles as proposed by Cox, Arnold, and Tomás (2010) to assess the extent to
         which local water governance arrangements fulfill them in each of the case study sites, and what
         factors determine that. However, these principles should not be regarded as a magic bullet or an
         institutional panacea, and thus should not be applied as a prescription for improving the governance
         of common-pool resources in particular settings. This concern pertains to possibly overgeneralizing
         the principles to a large diversity of cases. The eight principles are:

         1.	      User boundaries: Clear boundaries between legitimate and illegitimate users must be
                  defined.
                  B. Resource boundaries: Clear boundaries are present that define a resource system and
                  separate it from the larger biophysical environment.
         2.	      A. Congruence with local conditions: Appropriation and provision rules are congruent
                  with local social and environmental conditions.
                  B. Appropriation and provision: The benefits obtained by users from a common-pool
                  resource, as determined by appropriation rules, are proportional to the amount of inputs
                  required in the form of labor, material, or money, as determined by provision rules.
         3.	      Collective-choice arrangements: Most individuals affected by the operational rules can
                  participate in modifying them.
         4.	      A. Monitoring users: Monitors who are accountable to the users track their appropriation
                  and provision levels.
                  B. Monitoring the resource: Monitors who are accountable to the users observe the
                  condition of the resource.

                                                     29
       5.	       Graduated sanctions: Appropriators who violate operational rules are likely to be assessed
                 using graduated sanctions (depending on the seriousness and the context of the offense)
                 by other appropriators, by officials accountable to the appropriators, or by both.
       6.	       Conflict-resolution mechanisms: Appropriators and their officials have rapid access to
                 low-cost local arenas to resolve conflicts among appropriators or between appropriators
                 and officials.
       7.	       Minimal recognition of rights to organize: The right of appropriators to devise their own
                 institutions is not challenged by external governmental authorities.
       8.	       Nested enterprises: Appropriation, provision, monitoring, enforcement, conflict
                 resolution, and governance activities are organized in multiple layers of nested enterprises.

21.	   These design principles explain under what conditions trust and reciprocity can be built and
       maintained to sustain collective action. We use the eight principles as a guiding framework for
       our study and assess the extent to which these are met in a range of different sites in the country,
       and how they relate to performance. Then, by determining why these principles are met in some
       cases and not in others, and what factors are behind this variation, we can identify measures that
       promote these factors/conditions in irrigation schemes.

Land-use and farming practices in Uzbekistan
22.	   Uzbekistan’s agricultural sector features three types of producers: Private farmers, dehkans, and
       tomorka owners. Private farmers are commercial entities that lease large amounts of land from
       the state, often 50 ha or more (although horticultural farms can be much smaller). They are often
       referred to as fermers. They usually have to follow state directives on what crops to grow and
       where to sell the harvested produce. Dehkans are smallholders who own their land, often typically
       between 0.3 and 1 ha. Tomorkas are small kitchen gardens (often smaller than 0.3 ha). Dehkans and
       tomorka owners have full freedom to choose what crops they want to plant and whether and where
       to sell their harvests. Tomorka owners usually grow vegetables and a limited amount of fruit trees,
       while dehkans may grow all kinds of fruits and vegetables, but also crops such as rice.

23.	   The local government authority, the Hokimiyat, assigns land plots to private farmers and grants
       them the right to cultivate these. Every year farmers have to submit a detailed crop production
       plan for the government to approve. Representatives of government organizations often visit
       farmers’ plots to verify adherence to the approved land-use plan and can penalize farmers if they
       do not follow it.

24.	   Most private farmers are instructed to grow cotton and wheat, the state-mandated crops.
       Annually, each farmer is assigned a quota for these crops. This is the minimum amount they have
       to produce and sell to the state at prices that are fixed and well below the market price. The quota
       is in principle based on the soil quality and water availability, as well as the yield of the respective
       crops during previous years. It is set on an annual basis. For the state-mandated crops, the state
       provides subsidized credits for inputs at the beginning of the year, and the costs of these are often
       subtracted when farmers are paid for their harvest (at a 3 percent interest rate). Unlike their cotton
       harvest, farmers are allowed to keep the amount of wheat that is produced in excess of the quota
       and sell it to buyers other than the state.

25.	   The Hokimiyat may terminate the land lease if the cotton or wheat quota is not met for three
       consecutive years, in which case they auction it off to another farmer. The state plays a central role
       in organizing the manual cotton harvest through annual cotton-picking campaigns.

26.	   Farmers are interested in growing “secondary” crops, which are those they can choose and sell on
       the free market (typically fruits or vegetables); these can be lucrative. However, secondary crops
       do not receive priority in farmers’ state-mandated crop production and water delivery plans. Land
       can be allocated to secondary crops in three different ways. The first is where a farmer grows the

                                                    30
        secondary crop at the same time as the state-mandated crop. In our case study, the WCAs were
        only allowed to do this on 5 percent to 10 percent of the land. The second way is to grow secondary
        crops on the land allocated for wheat cultivation after the wheat is harvested in early summer, if
        water is made available (see Map 1 for an example). The third way involves areas where it is not
        compulsory for farmers to grow a state-mandated crop; in this case, they are free to decide what to
        grow, provided there is enough water available. This situation occurred in only one of the case study
        WCAs, in Akhangaran District, Tashkent Oblast.

        Note that cotton and wheat normally rotate. Wheat is often sown on cotton plots after the cotton is
        harvested. See Map A2.11 in Appendix 2 for an additional example of how secondary crops fit into
        the cropping pattern.

27.	    Agricultural and water management development efforts in Uzbekistan mainly focus on farmers’
        state-mandated production of cotton and wheat. However, dehkans and tomorka owners
        contribute to more than 80 percent of agricultural production in the country (excluding crops such
        as cotton, wheat, and rice) and ensure food security in rural and urban areas (Alimdjanova, 2009).
        The importance of their contribution is growing. In Fergana Oblast, for example, the irrigated area
        under kitchen gardens increased from about 5 percent in 1980 to 17 percent of all agricultural land
        in 2010 (Mukhamedova and Wegerich, 2014).

Methodology

28.	    The study utilized a case study approach that involved a systematic, in-depth assessment of
        local-level institutional arrangements for managing irrigation and drainage water in ten selected
        sites across the country. Case study research emphasizes detailed contextual analysis of a limited
        number of events or conditions and their relationships. It is based on the premise that truth is
        relative and dependent on one’s perspective. Where the boundaries between the phenomenon of
        local irrigation water management and the context within which irrigation water is allocated and
        used are not clearly evident, case study research can offer a better understanding of the issue’s

                                                       31
            complexity. It makes use of multiple sources of evidence (Yin, 1984) and can add much to what is
            already known from previous research.


29.	        A strength of this approach is the close collaboration between researcher and participant, and the
            way in which it enables participants to tell their stories. Through these stories, participants are able
            to describe their views of reality, which enables the researcher to better understand participants’
            actions (Baxter and Jack, 2008). Social scientists have particularly made wide use of this qualitative
            research method to examine contemporary real-life situations (ibid).


30.	        WCAs and the irrigation authorities in the area in which they operate form the unit of analysis
            for this study. Exploratory interviews with key informants in Uzbekistan at the study’s design stage
            revealed that at the lowest governance levels, WCAs and the local Administrative Irrigation System
            (AIS) are currently the key institutions for distributing water among farmers and for operating and
            managing local irrigation canals.


31.	        The ten case study WCAs were selected to represent a wide range of circumstances thought to
            influence their performance. The selection strategy was to maximize the diversity of cases. Out of
            the 1,510 WCAs registered in Uzbekistan,6 32 were initially selected. These were chosen to cover
            different (i) agroecological conditions; (ii) WCA size; (iii) dependence on pump irrigation; (iv) overall
            water availability; (v) crop diversity; and (vi) extent of donor support. A final ten were then selected
            to ensure they would represent a wide range of situations, on the basis of the following additional
            criteria: land size; membership; type of crop; irrigation service fee (ISF) collection rate; size of debt;
            and performance (according to the government). Appendix 1 presents the sampling criteria and
            their scores for each of the selected WCAs. The selection was based on information provided by
            authorities in the selected regions. Figure 1 presents an overview of some of the key selection
            criteria and how each case WCA fits it. The ten case studies were selected from nine oblasts across
            the country.

32.	        A local research firm carried out the fieldwork. Data collection involved document review,
            observations, and individual and small group interviews. Interviews were conducted with (i) WCA
            staff; (ii) WCA members (primarily farmers); (iii) representatives of the Hokimiyat; and (iv) BAIS
            and AIS officials. Limited follow-up data collection took place in three WCAs to gather information
            on dehkans’ and tomorka owners’ access to water and the involvement of these groups in water
            management at the local level, among other issues.

33.	        Information was gathered from a total of 145 people. This included 30 representatives from local
            government, 23 WCA staff members (including two women), 71 farmers (including six women), and
            21 dehkans and tomorka owners (including two women). There were two rounds; 91 respondents
            participated in the first round and 55 in the second (see Table 1).

34.	        Data were gathered in two phases. The first phase was from May to June 2014 and covered eight
            case study sites. In the course of analyzing the data collected from this phase, a number of gaps
            emerged. These included a lack of information on (i) the situation of dehkans and tomorka owners
            in WCAs; and (ii) cases where WCAs include many horticultural farmers. To fill these gaps, an
            additional data collection phase was held from December 2014 to February 2015. We selected
            three WCAs out of the eight covered in phase 1 and revisited them for additional data collection.
            We also sampled two additional WCAs, in Kuwa District, Fergana Oblast. Data were gathered during
            three days in each of these two WCAs that were added to the sample.

35.	        Field researchers collected information on a range of factors, including the establishment and
            operational role of WCAs; strengths and weaknesses of the existing governance arrangements
            around water management; and accountability and information flows. Additional information
            was collected about equality of irrigation services, infrastructure maintenance, irrigation service
            fee collection, WCA membership composition, qualifications of staff and leaders, returns to crop
            production, and the impact of water management quality. Data were also collected on exogenous
            factors, defined as those beyond the control of farmers and the WCA administration; these included
            the role of public agencies, overall water availability, and so on.

36.	        All information was collected in Uzbek and summary write-ups were prepared in Russian. Data
            analysis and report writing was done by the World Bank task team. Detailed maps of the WCAs
            were produced together with local experts. These included a map with the location of the land of
            all water consumers within the WCA (farmers, dehkans, and tomorka owners) and the location of
            the main and internal canals; and a map with the main crops grown during the summer season and
            the secondary crops that farmers grow during the fall and spring. These are presented for each case
            study WCA in Appendix 2.

Limitations

37.	        Lack of access to official data on WCAs made it challenging to put together a comprehensive
            sampling frame7 and might have introduced bias in identifying WCAs for the case study. It meant
            that information on selection criteria for the research sites/WCAs was based on what was provided
            by government staff at the oblast and raion level. The research design attempted to address a bias
            toward well-performing WCAs in three ways: (i) by collecting information on WCAs in ten different
            regions under different conditions; (ii) by stressing to local government authorities the importance
            of researching poor performing WCAs; and (iii) by asking two stakeholders (Hokims and WCA
            directors) to rate WCA performance on a scale of 1–5. The study team then selected a cross-section
            of low- and high-rated WCAs. However, it is unclear how well this worked in practice.

38.	        No physical and technical measurements were taken and all collected data are from existing WCA
            records, or reflect the opinions, views, and experiences of study respondents. While this provided
7. To date, the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources has been unable to provide the task team with a database of WCAs and key indicators.

                                                                       34
       insightful information, complementing these data with a number of technical measurements (such
       as irrigation efficiency, crop yields, or other performance indicators) would have helped improve
       data analysis.

Lessons learned

39.	   This study is part of a regional assessment of local irrigation governance in Central Asia.
       Uzbekistan served as the pilot country for developing and implementing the research approach.
       The methodology and research instruments were continually improved during the study’s
       implementation and only fully developed during the second phase of data collection. A number
       of valuable lessons were learned that will help strengthen the approach and methodology—
       including sampling, data collection tools, techniques, and analysis—when the study is rolled out to
       other countries in Central Asia. These lessons are presented in detail in Appendix 3 and are briefly
       summarized here.

40.	   Overall, the approach generated a wealth of information from a range of contexts and situations,
       and covered many different stakeholders. Despite the sensitivity of the topic, the method provided
       us with detailed insights into many different aspects of the local management of irrigation water.

41.	   The sampling would have been much improved if we had been able to obtain more background
       information Uzbekistan’s WCAs. This would have made it possible to assess where water is generally
       scarce and where it is relatively abundant, and would have enabled us to select areas from both
       groups and sample WCAs from among these. Subsequently, we could have conducted a quick survey
       of WCAs in selected areas to gather more detailed characteristics about them, and then could have
       chosen the case studies from among these, making sure a balanced range of characteristics were
       covered.

42.	   The study could have more systematically covered all stakeholders if the team had drawn up a list
       of all water consumers and all “players” in a WCA after the field research pilot, and then used this
       information to design lists of people to invite to participate in the study. As evidence came in from
       the first few case studies, it became apparent that the presence of dehkans and tomorka owners
       within the WCA irrigation system was an important factor for local water management. Yet this
       group of stakeholders was not included on our initial interview lists.

43.	   Case study research requires the continuous field presence of a well-trained social scientist who
       can guide and supervise the data collection team, and design follow-up data collection strategies
       in the field to clarify issues that arise. This involves more than simply facilitating discussions and
       conducting in-depth interviews with stakeholders. To this end, an irrigation specialist should possibly
       be added to the research team.

44.	   After completing data collection in each case study site it is a good idea to discuss findings with the
       team so that moderators and interviewers involved in data analysis can share observations that
       might not be reflected in interview transcripts. The study would have also benefited from more
       structured data collection, using pre-prepared sets of visual exercises, making more use of maps,
       pictures, and transects to gather data, and conducting group field visits that promote stakeholders’
       active participation in the case study area.

45.	   For each case study WCA, it is important to gather technical background data that includes water-
       use and crop-production economics. It appeared difficult to obtain reliable statistics on planned and
       actual water provided to the WCA, and to farmers and other water users. Similarly, hard information
       on crop production, prices, and crop water use were not available, making it difficult to assess
       incentives and economic inefficiencies in local water use.

46.	   The rest of the report is structured as follows. Chapter 2 describes Uzbekistan’s land-use policy and
       institutional context and provides an overview of each case study site. Chapters 3–6 present the
       findings within the framework of the design principles for the sustainable management of irrigation
       water as a common-pool resource. These chapters also discuss what factors seem to cause these
       principles to be more prominent in some WCAs than others. Chapter 7 then presents conclusions
       and recommendations, including the draft diagnostic tool.

2. Background on the research sites
Institutional arrangements and practices
47.	   Each research site has a similar formal institutional setup. The BAIS and the AIS coordinate
       operation, maintenance, and repairs of the primary and secondary canals. The BAIS is responsible
       for managing the primary canals while the AIS is in charge of the secondary ones. The BAIS deals
       with overall water allocation and the AIS is responsible for delivering water from the secondary
       canal to the WCA intake point of the interfarm canals. WCAs are responsible for delivering water
       from interfarm canals to farmers’ on-farm canals. Farmers then ensure water is delivered to each
       part of their plots.

48.	   All local government organizations report to the Hokim, the powerful head of the local government.
       Representatives of the BAIS and AIS can participate in or set meetings with WCA members on water
       supply and consumption issues. They also help WCAs and farmers to prepare applications for water
       supply. In 2013 WCAs had to reregister as NGOs and pay a reregistration fee. Amounts are very low
       and vary between Soum 16,000 and 40,000 (US$7–17).

49.	   All farmers in the case study sites belong to a WCA, which many regard as an intermediary
       body between farmers and the AIS. Nearly all farmers interviewed stated that they welcomed
       the creation of WUAs in response to the chaotic water management situation that started when
       the shirkats were dismantled. Most suggested they remember this transition period as a time
       marked by difficulties and conflicts over water distribution. Farmers are convinced that WUAs play
       an essential role, and farmers in Denov, Surkhandarya Oblast, said that without them they would
       expect to experience conflict, social unrest, and to sustain losses. Farmers in Chodak WCA in Pap
       District, Namangan Oblast, claimed that:

                “After the shirkat was disbanded, a situation arose in which there were now 13 farm
                enterprises on the shirkat territory. There used to be one chairman who decided all issues
                related to irrigation, and addressed water allocation issues. After the dissolution every
                farmer became his own director, and began to manage his water resources without the
                consent of neighboring farms. This led to conflicts over water resource distribution.”

50.	   Each year, the WCA submits an application for water supply to the AIS that is based on the
       approved crop production plans and corresponding water amount and scheduling needs of each
       of its members. The AIS reviews the application and checks whether the schedule is realistic. The
       Hokim’s office assesses whether the schedule is in line with the standard water needs of the main
       state-mandated crops. The plan is subsequently submitted to the BAIS, which reviews it in light
       of expected water availability. Once the plan is approved, a detailed water supply agreement is
       reached between the AIS and the WCA. Farmers often sign water supply contracts with the WCA at
       the beginning of a calendar year; such contracts stipulate the amount of water a farmer can expect
       throughout the year. According to the WCA staff interviewed for this study, the agreement between
       the AIS and the WCA may take the form of a contract, but this is not always the case. The overall
       focus of the water delivery schedule is making sure that farmers receive enough water to meet the
       quota for the state-mandated crops (cotton and wheat).

51.	   The Village Assembly of Citizens (VAC) is an official body that is responsible for social development.
       It covers several mahallas. If dehkans or tomorka owners have any complaints regarding irrigation
       water supply, they are expected to direct these to the leader of their mahalla or the head of the
       VAC. These persons are then expected to follow up with the WCA on behalf of the dehkans and
       tomorka owners.

52.	   Farmers and WCA representatives that were interviewed claimed that typically, farmers only
       receive about 75 percent to 95 percent of the amount of water that is scheduled for delivery.
       Primary reasons why farmers receive less water than originally allocated include: (i) droughts in
       upstream areas that lower water levels in the main canal; this was mentioned in the selected WCAs
                                                   37
          in Kyzyltep District in Navoi Oblast, Pap District in Namangan, and Urgench District in Khorezm;
          (ii) the AIS supplying less water than what was agreed, even when water seems to be sufficiently
          available, which was allegedly the situation in the selected WCAs in Denov District, Surkhandarya,
          and Dustlik District, Jizzakh; (iii) excessive water use by dehkans and tomorka owners (as per case
          study WCAs in Navoi and Namangan); and (iv) electricity outages that interrupt irrigation pump
          activity, as was mentioned in the selected WCAs in Navoi and Jizzakh. Picture 4 shows one of the
          water pumps in the selected WCA in Jizzakh and Picture 5 displays irrigation pumps in Politemit-BKh
          WCA, Kattakurgan District, Samarkand.

53.	      In eight out of the ten case study WCAs, farmers said they have experienced a positive change in
          water availability during the last five years, and a decrease in conflicts over water. Improvements
          were claimed to be due to WCA activities. It was suggested that before the WUAs/ WCAs were
          established five to six years ago, there were many water disputes among farmers. With the
          establishment of the WUAs/WCAs, however, water delivery schedules were agreed upon and farmers
          started to settle disputes among themselves via the WCA. This led to better water distribution and
          higher water availability for farmers. In the sampled WCAs in Dustlik, Jizzakh, and Pap, Namangan,
          however, water availability for farmers has not improved. Water consumers here claim they face
          many difficulties that have not yet been resolved. Overall water availability in the WCAs in Fergana
          and Namangan Oblasts is allegedly negatively affected by an increase in irrigation water use—such
          as for growing rice—in upper riparian countries.

Overview of the case study WCAs
54.	              As mentioned, and as can be expected from the selection process, the WCAs varied in size,
                  water availability in the secondary canal, dependence on pumps, crop diversification, and so on.
                  Table 2 presents the characteristics of each case study WCA. All WCAs were between 1,400 and
                  6,200 ha in size, except the selected WCA in Samarkand, which covers 23,000 ha. Dependence on
                  pump irrigation (as opposed to gravity irrigation) ranged from 4 percent for the WCA in Denov,
                  Surkhandarya, to 70 percent for WCAs in Urgench, Khorezm, and the Kuwa urta buz anori WCA in
                  Kuwa district, Fergana Oblast. Cotton and wheat were the dominant crops, except in the Kuwa urta
                  buz anori WCA where horticultural crops dominate. Six out of the ten WCAs have received donor
                  support (see Table 2).

                  across the case study WCAs (see Table 3). Some WCA directors had higher or vocational education,
                  while others had only completed secondary school.

                farmers per full-time staff member, while this figure is 8.8 for Alisher Navoiy WCA in Akhangaran,
                Tashkent Oblast (see Table 3). Overstaffing however does not necessarily suggest poor performance.
                The WCA in Kyzyltep, Navoi, for example, seems overstaffed but was said to perform well.

An introduction to each of the case study sites is presented in Appendix 2.

57.	            All WCAs are affected by a shortage of qualified staff and high levels of staff turnover. Farmers and
                WCA staff claimed that many well-qualified specialists who used to work on the kolkhoz and shirkat
                farms have left their jobs and were said to be no longer in the region/country. In seven out of the
                ten case studies, farmers and WCA staff claimed that weak technical skills of WCA staff was an issue.
                Only in the selected WCAs in Navoi and Tashkent Oblast was this not an issue.

Female farmers
58.	            Few of the private farmers in the selected study sites are women. The number of female farmers in
                the case study WCAs varies from 0 percent to 19 percent, and was on average 8 percent. Interviews
                conducted with female farmers in Khorezm in Namangan and Akhangaran in Tashkent Oblast
                revealed that many of them started working at low positions in a kolkhoz. Because they performed
                well, they were promoted to a management position, where they obtained management skills,
                knowledge about agriculture, and made connections in the Hokimiyat. These skills and connections
                helped them to eventually lease farmland and successfully manage their own farms.

59.	            Study respondents pointed out that female farmers tend to be more active, outspoken, and
                in general manage their farms better than male farmers. For example, there is only one female
                farmer in the WCA in Namangan, and she was the only farmer who managed to meet the state
                quota for wheat this year. Female farmers have equal rights and responsibilities, and study findings
                do not suggest any discrimination against female farmers by the WCA administration, government

                                                                                40
                 organizations, or other farmers. Women nevertheless seem underrepresented in WCA decision-
                 making bodies and positions.

Performance

60.	             Farmers were asked what they think defines a good WCA and good local water management and
                 governance. The following qualities were mentioned most often:
                 •	      The irrigation and drainage systems are adequately operated and maintained; paperwork
                         is taken care of; and good relations are upheld with AIS and BAIS, which saves farmers
                         time.
                 •	      Conflicts and disputes are solved among WCA members so there is no need to involve
                         other government bodies.
                 •	      Farmers receive assistance to not only get water on time, but also to find machines, seeds,
                         fuel, or other inputs.
                 •	      Farmers feel they are involved in the decision-making process and build trust among
                         themselves.
                 •	      The WCA is led by a capable person whom the community respects.
                 •	      Members of the WCA treat the irrigation system as a common good for which everyone
                         is responsible. Farmers work together with the WCA to meet quotas and increase profits.
                 •	      The WCA has a financial buffer (in the form of an emergency fund) for emergency
                         breakdowns in the irrigation system. This helps quickly repair breakdowns without being
                         dependent on government organizations.

61.	             As can be seen in Table 4, farmers in the case study WCAs in Pap District, Namangan, and Dustlik
                 District, Jizzakh, in particular, were unhappy with how their WCA functions. Overall water
                 availability to main and secondary crops is low, and few fees are paid on time (in Dustlik). However,
                 in other WCAs where water availability is low, farmer satisfaction is much higher (such as Kuwa urta
                 buz anori WCA in Fergana Oblast) suggesting that other factors must be at play. In addition, water
                 scarcity can be an incentive for successful collective action.

62.	          Only one of the WCAs in our sample was run by a female director (Kuwa urta buz anori WCA in
              Kuwa, Fergana Oblast). Interviews revealed that, in addition to WCA staff, it is also mostly men who
              hold management positions in the government organizations responsible for water management
              (such as the AIS, BAIS, and Hokimiyat). While government agencies and WCAs do employ females,
              they mostly work as accountants or clerks and do not play an important role in decision-making
              processes.


63.	          Discussions with farmers and WCA staff revealed that performance is highly variable across
              the WCAs. Table 4 summarizes the performance of each case study WCA along a set of indicators
              on which (subjective) data were collected in the field, including overall satisfaction with WCA
              activities. The latter reflects the WCA’s ability to solve irrigation-related issues and mediate conflicts
              between farmers, as well as farmers’ involvement in WCA activities, among others. An overall WCA
              performance indicator is determined on the basis of the first three indicators—water availability for
              main crops, water availability for secondary crops, and overall farmer satisfaction, which all assume
              the values high, medium, or low.


64.	          Chodak WCA in Pap District, Namangan is one of the poorest-performing WCAs in our sample;
              irrigation water availability for main and secondary crops is unreliable and farmer satisfaction is
              low (see Table 4). The WCA is located in hilly terrain, and irrigation water is delivered to the WCA by
              two pump stations operated by the AIS. Farmers interviewed for this study said there are frequent
              interruptions in electricity supply and the pumping stations are often out of order. The AIS has no
              resources to install new equipment. Respondents claimed there are constant problems with water
              supply to the fields, which results in low agricultural yields. In addition, soil tends to be poor and not
              very suitable for cotton and wheat cultivation; soil salinity was also said to be high. Some farmers
              have not been able to meet their cotton and wheat quota and gave up or had to give up their land.
              30 percent of the land relies on irrigation pumps to water their crops (see Picture 6).

                                                                42
65.	   Farmers in the Chodak WCA do not want to pay for irrigation water since they claim the WCA does
       not deliver enough to them. Many farmers claim the WCA administration has poor management
       skills and water management is weak. The WCA head and most of the WCA staff have less than
       secondary education and are less qualified than in the other case study WCAs. Respondents said
       the staff has poor record-keeping and long-term planning skills. Dehkans and tomorka owners
       use water from a separate mountain river and do not use water from the WCA-managed system.
       Dehkans also use wells and apply drip irrigation technology. Some claimed that in this WCA, given
       its water management difficulties, it is preferable to be a dehkan, as one can more easily chose the
       most suitable crops to grow and there is less land to manage.

66.	   Haet Boshi WCA, in Dustlik District, Jizzakh Oblast, is the other WCA where farmers are unsatisfied
       with the irrigation water supply and regard the performance of their WCA as poor (see Table 4).
       Dependency on pump irrigation here is also is high (50 percent) due to the somewhat hilly terrain.
       There are frequent electricity outages, which interrupts the irrigation pumps. There are two pumps
       on the WCA’s balance sheet; one of them was broken when the field research took place. Farmers
       own another 12 pumps and pay for pump electricity themselves. Soil salinity is high. The WCA head
       has only had ten years of schooling and was said to have limited planning skills. The WCA employs
       eight people, and only two of them have educational qualification above secondary school.

67.	   Hazarbag-Denov Sakhovati WCA in Denov District, Surkhandarya Oblast, is among the better-
       performing WCAs with high farmer satisfaction (see Table 4) despite low water availability in
       the main canal (see Table 2) and no donor support. Nearly all land (96 percent) is served through
       gravity irrigation. The head of the WCA is well respected by the members. He has completed higher
       education and has extensive experience in agriculture. He advises farmers on cultivation and water
       management matters. Even staff from the Hokimiyat come to him for advice. The WCA employs
       five mirobs who take care of water in the area. Unlike in some other WCAs, dehkans and tomorka
       owners are included in the water distribution schedule and receive water accordingly. They were
       said to receive sufficient water. There are separate canal off-takes for dehkans/tomorka owners’
       land. This allows the WCA to deliver water to their land according to certain schedule and control
       the amount of water supplied.

68.	   Suvchi Mehnat-Rohat WCA in Kyzyltep District, Navoi Oblast, is also a high-performing WCA (see
       Table 4), even if overall water availability in the secondary canals is “medium” (see Table 2).
       Farmers indicated that there usually is enough water for main and secondary crops, but there are
       water supply shortages due to droughts or unlimited water consumption by dehkans and tomorka
       owners. The WCA does not have any debts, and farmers pay their irrigation fees on time. The WCA’s
       director is well educated and well off, and enjoys the respect of the farmers and members of the
       local community. However, dehkans and tomorka owners take water from the WCA interfarm canals
       whenever they can, and their unscheduled use causes frequent conflicts between farmers and the
       WCA administration. However, the WCA has no right to legally limit their water consumption. There
       are no canal intakes to dehkans and tomorka owners’ lands.

69.	   Qodirjon Azimonov WCA, Kuwa District, Fergana Oblast, also performs well. Farmers are satisfied
       with the way it functions, and water supply to both main and secondary crops is high (see Table
       4). All irrigation is by gravity. The WCA recently installed meters on interfarm canals in this WCA
       (with the help of a donor). The WCA director has secondary vocational education (in irrigation).
       Dehkans and tomorka owners pay the irrigation fee to the VAC and mahalla offices, which then
       transfer the funds to the WCA. Dehkans and tomorka owners are included in the irrigation schedule.

       For a full description of all ten case study WCAs, see Appendix 2.

70.	   Seven out of the ten case study WCAs lack equipment to maintain the irrigation system. These
       include low-, medium-, and high-performing WCAs. This includes the poor-performing case
       study WCAs in Pap, Namangan, and Dustlik, Jizzakh, as well as for the medium-performing WCA in
       Urgench in Khorezm, Akaltyn in Syrdaryo, Kuwa urta buz anori WCA in Fergana Oblast, and the high-
                                                   43
       performing ones in Kyzyltep in Navoi, and Denov in Surkhandarya. Tractors, bulldozers, and cranes
       are needed to maintain and repair canals. WCAs that do not have these machines borrow them
       from either the AIS or Hokimiyat, or from well-off farmers. This makes the WCA inflexible and less
       autonomous. WCAs that have these machines are able to conduct repairs more efficiently.

71.	   Some relatively well-performing WCAs received equipment from donors, but not all well-
       performing WCAs received donor support. Farmers have helped maintain the machines by paying
       for spare parts, fuel, and mechanics’ labor costs. The selected WCA in Akhangaran, Tashkent Oblast
       had received a tractor and a bulldozer (now broken) from a donor-funded project. In Kuwa, the WCA
       had received some machines from the former shirkat, which has been well maintained and is used
       to maintain canals. In Chodak WCA, Pap, Namangan a tractor and bulldozer were provided to the
       WCA from a former shirkat. When these broke down several years ago, the WCA administration was
       unable to fund repairs, keeping the machines grounded. Handing over machines to these poorly
       performing WCAs has not appeared to solve the issue. Three out of the ten WCAs, including the
       poorly performing one in Pap, Namangan, and Dustlik, Jizzakh, as well as in Akaltyn, Syrdaryo, also
       lack office equipment, including personal computers. Clearly, owning good equipment helps but is
       not a prerequisite for good performance.

72.	   The WCA head’s qualification appears to be associated with WCA performance. For example, the
       case study WCAs in Akhangaran, Tashkent Oblast, and Denov, Surkhandarya Oblast, and Kuwa urta
       buz anori WCA in Kuwa, Fergana Oblast, have a director that has completed higher education and
       also has extensive work experience in agriculture (see Table 3). These WCAs perform relatively well,
       except for the Kuwa urta buz anori (see Table 4). Good directors were said to be able to engage
       farmers in WCA activities and build trust among members as well as with government officials.
       They are more able to hire educated and skilled staff members, and also have an easier time
       introducing innovations and new technology such as drip irrigation, water meters, and pumps. In
       contrast, WCAs where the head has no additional training beyond secondary school and limited
       relevant management experience—such as in the selected WCAs in Dustlik, Jizzakh Oblast, and Pap,
       Namangan Oblast—performed among the worst. Here WCA members and government officials
       appear to have less respect for the decisions of WCA directors and the WCA has trouble arranging
       daily operations and collecting irrigation fees. However, many of these directors inherited a WCA
       that has significant problems such as debt, an irrigation system in poor condition, and broken
       equipment.

73.	   Most of the well-managed WCAs appear able to attract qualified staff, while poorer WCAs struggle.
       For example, in Suvchi Mehnat-Rohat WCA in Kyzyltep, Navoi, employees earn a good salary and
       are paid on time. The head of the WCA personally looks for the best candidates in the district to fill
       vacancies. Attracting qualified staff is a more significant issue for the WCAs in our sample that do
       not perform so well. They have difficulties collecting irrigation fees, are indebted, and are unable to
       pay salaries on time. They are unable to offer the kinds of working conditions that attract qualified
       staff, which worsens the WCA’s performance and thus perpetuates the vicious cycle.

74.	   The following “external” factors are associated with the quality of local water management.
       Quality water management here implies that stakeholders view the distribution of irrigation water
       as fair and predictable.
       •	        Proportion of the total irrigated area that depends on electrical pumps and the reliability
                 of the electricity supply. The more the irrigation system relies on pumps, the worse the WCA
                 performs. There are two reasons for this: (i) the pumps are usually on the government’s
                 balance sheet and are frequently broken; and (ii) frequent electricity outages interrupt the
                 water supply schedule, causing shortages in irrigation water for farmers. The exception
                 to this situation appears to be the sample WCA in Kattakurgan in Samarkand (see Table
                 5). Also, farmers that own pumps can face substantial electricity bills, which add to their
                 overall input costs and thus increases production risk and vulnerability.

                •	            Growing conditions, such as soil quality for the crops the state has assigned the WCA
                              farmers to grow. For example, in the sampled WCA in Pap, Namangan, soil salinity is high,
                              and growing conditions are not favorable for cotton and wheat. Yields are therefore low
                              and farmers have little incentives to improve local water management.
                •	            The WCA director’s leadership skills. All respondents pointed to this issue as very
                              important. The WCA director should be able to build trust, strengthen social capital,
                              establish good relations with farmers and officials, and include all water consumers (also
                              the dehkans and tomorka owners) in water management. He/she should help ensure
                              water is distributed in a fair way.

75.	            Overall water availability (the amount available to the WCA) appears to have an ambiguous
                influence on the quality of water management and on farmer satisfaction. In some WCAs where
                water is abundantly available, such as the case study WCA in Akhangaran in Tashkent Oblast, farmer
                satisfaction is high (although fee payment is low). However, even in WCAs where water is scarce,
                farmer satisfaction can be high, such as in the Kuwa urta buz anori WCA in Kuwa, Fergana Oblast. In
                this WCA, water is managed in a timely and fair way, even if water is scarce and its supply affected
                by frequent power outages that interrupt the operation of irrigation pumps.

3. Design principle 1: Well-defined boundaries
76.	        Well-defined user boundaries and resource boundaries is the first design principle for the
            management of common-pool resources. It refers to the importance of defining clear boundaries
            between legitimate and illegitimate users of the resource. It also emphasizes the need for well-
            defined resource boundaries that separate it from the larger biophysical environment. This chapter
            discusses the extent to which this principle is met in each of the case study areas, and what factors
            favor their presence.


77.	        The resource system appears to be well defined in the case study WCAs—it is the irrigation water
            that is supplied to the WCA through the irrigation network run by the AIS and BAIS. The irrigation
            resource boundaries are determined by the local hydrology, which in turn determines the layout of
            the canals and fields that can be irrigated from them. In some of the WCAs, dehkan and tomorka
            owners have their own separate water supply; for example, from a natural river or canal. This is the
            situation in the Pap, Namangan WCA, which has a fairly hilly terrain.


78.	        The findings suggest that boundaries between legitimate and illegitimate users of canal irrigation
            water are not always clearly defined. In most case study sites, dehkans and tomorka owners depend
            on water in the WCA-managed canals to irrigate their crops. This makes them de facto users of the
            common-pool irrigation canal water. However, WCA officials claimed that since tomorka owners and
            most dehkans are not registered as legal entities, they cannot officially join a WCA.8 As noted, even
            if the new regulation of 2013 allows for this, respondents were not aware.


79.	        Discussions with dehkans and tomorka owners suggest that in some cases, very few of them have
            a good understanding of what a WCA is, what it does, and what it could do for them—even if in
            nine out of the ten case studies they depend on water from WCA canals. This is illustrated by one
            tomorka owner in the following way:


                   “I have never had any contact with our WCA. The WCA does not have any contracts with us,
                   only with farmers. They do not even come to our mahalla. I also have not heard that any of our
                   men participate in the WCA meetings. If there are any problems with the water supply we go
                   to the head of our mahalla or VAC.”
                                                            —Akhangaran, tomorka owner, female, 66 years old


80.	        Interviews revealed that the legitimate irrigation water needs of dehkans and tomorka owners are
            not always adequately taken into account by the WCA and AIS when water supply schedules are
            prepared, making them de facto illegitimate users. Where this is the case, dehkans and tomorka
            owners erratically and unpredictably withdraw from irrigation canals, which undermines the proper
            management of irrigation canal water as a common-pool resource. In some cases the WCA water
            supply schedule takes into account the needs of dehkans and tomorka owners, or at least the VAC
            is consulted.


81.	        Much also depends on where the dehkans and tomorka owners’ fields are located vis-à-vis the
            main interfarm canal. In three of the sampled WCAs where their needs are not incorporated into the
            water supply schedule, irrigation water passes through dehkans and tomorka owners’ fields before
            it reaches the fields of private farmers. This is the case in the sampled WCAs in Pap in Namangan,
            Kyzyltep in Navoi, and Kattakurgan in Samarkand. The dehkans and tomorka owners withdraw water
            from these canals at will. As their water use is not included in the WCA delivery schedule, some
            farmers receive insufficient water, which can lead to conflict.

8. According to the Water Law, Dehkans and Tomorka owners can become members of a WCA. However many don’t either (i) due to lack of awaress
among WCA staff, WCA members, local government officials and Dehkans and Tomorka owners, or (ii) for logistical reasons.

                                                                   46
82.	            When the fields of dehkans and tomorka owners that depend on WCA water are located toward
                the end of the interfarm canal, farmers need to allocate water to the dehkan and tomorka owners’
                land. This does not always happen. In some cases (such as in our sampled WCA in Tashkent Oblast),
                the WCA water delivery schedule includes water for the dehkans and tomorka owners. In such a
                case, private farmers will let the water flow on to the dehkans and tomorka owners’ land, provided
                they have enough to irrigate their own land. Our findings suggest that farmers may do this at night
                or on weekends. However, when there is a water shortage in the main canal, farmers are inclined to
                give priority to their own fields and ignore the needs of dehkans and tomorka owners.

83.	            Some WCAs incorporate the irrigation water needs of dehkans and tomorka owners into their
                water delivery schedules. This happens in both high- and poor-performing WCAs. (see Table 3). In
                two of the four high-performing WCAs, the needs of dehkans and tomorka owners are incorporated
                into the water delivery schedule, and they pay for irrigation water. In the selected WCAs in
                Surkhandarya, Tashkent Oblast, and Fergana Oblast, for example, the water delivery schedule
                takes the needs of this group into account. Farmers and WCA officials claimed that the schedule is
                adhered to and there are no conflicts between farmers and dehkans/tomorka owners. In five sites,
                WCAs have a contract with the VAC and/or the mahalla offices that represent dehkans/tomorka
                owners. This includes one of the poor-performing WCAs, the sampled WCA in Jizzakh (see Table 6).

84.	            In some of the other case study WCAs (such as those in Khorezm and Namangan Oblast), no such
                contracts exist; dehkans/tomorkas have to rely on farmers to receive water from their interfarm
                canals. In the poorly performing WCA in Pap, Namangan, the VAC and mahalla offices are located
                far from the WCA office (more than 25 km) and their representatives visit the WCA office only twice
                a year. The WCA here deals directly with dehkans/tomorka if needed. In some WCAs, dehkans/
                tomorka owners take water whenever they need it. This the case, for example, in the medium-
                performing WCA in Kattakurgan, Samarkand, where dehkans/tomorka owners are located near the
                main interfarm canal.

85.	            Separate canal intakes for dehkans/tomorka owners exist only in two of the high-performing case
                study WCAs (those in Akhangaran, Tashkent Oblast, and Denov, Surkhandarya). In one other high-
                performing and one other medium-performing case study WCA (in Navoi and Kuwa), there is a
                special mirob that was hired by the mahalla office who is in charge of water distribution among
                dehkans and tomorka owners. In the Kuwa urta buz anori WCA in Kuwa, Fergana Oblast, all tomorka
                owners have a contract with the VAC for the water supply, and the VAC has a contract with the WCA
                to supply water to tomorka owners’ land (see Box 1).

                                                                       47
Box 1. Contracting water supply between tomorka owners and a WCA in Kuwa, Fergana

In Kuwa urta buz anori WCA in Kuwa, Fergana Oblast, the money the VAC collects from tomorka owners
is handed over in cash to the WCA. The WCA has nine mirobs, one of whom is responsible for supplying
water to the tomorka owners’ land. In addition, the VAC informally hires mirobs that are responsible for
distributing water among tomorka owners. When the WCA is about to provide water to tomorka owners’
land, the WCA mirob contacts the VAC, which asks their mirobs to inform the tomorka owners. The VAC
collects money from the tomorka owners to pay the VAC mirobs (each family pays Soum 500–1,000 per
month). All tomorka owners pay on time; there are no debts. If there are problems with water supply, the
tomorka owners will contact the VAC mirobs or mahalla leaders, who, via the VAC, will contact the WCA
mirob. The VAC head is also a member of the WCA supervisory board, which helps to negotiate better deals
with the WCA. If there are significant water supply shortages, the VAC head can also talk directly to farmers
and ask them to provide water to tomorka owners.

86.	    In some cases, dehkans and tomorka owners receive irrigation water from mountain rivers and
        springs, and are not connected to WCA irrigation systems. This is the case for the WCA in Akhangaran
        District, Tashkent Oblast, and parts of the selected WCA in Pap, Namangan. In such cases, dehkans
        and tomorka owners need to organize water rotation schedules among themselves. Mahalla leaders
        and the VAC can serve as intermediaries in these negotiations. However, research elsewhere in
        Uzbekistan suggests that such arrangements can be weak and lead to anarchy (Mukhamedova and
        Wegerich, 2014).

87.	    As mentioned, in principle, the VAC represents the irrigation interests of dehkans and tomorka
        owners in the WCA. However, the VAC’s involvement in decision making around the distribution
        of canal water for irrigation varies across the case study WCAs. In the poorly performing case study
        WCA in Dustlik District, Jizzakh Oblast, respondents suggested that even if the VAC head represents
        dehkans and tomorka owners in the WCA and collects irrigation fees from them, in reality there
        is no official contact between the VAC and the WCA. In contrast, in the high-performing WCA in
        Kyzyltep District, Navoi, the head of the VAC is a member of the WCA supervisory board, which
        helps ensure the needs of dehkans and tomorka owners are met. In the medium-performing WCA in
        Akaltyn District, Syrdaryo Oblast, the WCA always consults the VAC when putting together the water
        delivery schedule to help make sure the needs of dehkans and tomorka owners are met.

88.	    The new WCA regulation issued in 2013 makes it possible for dehkans and other water consumers
        to become members, even if they don’t have a legal status. However, in none of our sampled
        WCAs were dehkans or tomorka owners members of the WCA. Farmers reported that they had
        not yet noticed any significant changes in operating procedures following the re-registration and
        restructuring. WCA officials seemed unaware that dehkans and tomorka owners could now be WCA
        members.

89.	    In this chapter, we discussed the extent to which there are clear boundaries between legitimate
        and illegitimate users of irrigation canal water, and also whether the irrigation system has well-
        defined boundaries. The boundaries of the resource system are determined by the local hydrology,
        which in turn determines the layout of the canals and fields that can be irrigated from them. This
        makes the resource boundaries clear in all WCAs. Regarding boundaries between legitimate and
        illegitimate users, things are less clear. For example, it is not always clear whether it is legitimate
        for smallholders to use irrigation water from the WCA canal system. While dehkans and tomorka
        owners are de jure members of the WCA, in reality, not all members always recognize their needs.
        There is thus a de facto lack of clarity on their status, and water supply schedules do not always
        take their needs into account. This leads to friction and unpredictable water supply. However, a
        number of WCAs—those that perform perhaps somewhat better than others—have explicitly
        recognized smallholders as legitimate users by including their irrigation requirements in water
        delivery schedules, and sometimes even hiring a mirob to take care of their irrigation needs.
        Where this has happened, it has helped alleviate tensions between farmers and smallholders and

                                                     48
       prevented unpredictable water supply shortages. In WCAs where there is a lack of clarity on this
       issue, however, the opposite happens. Clearly, including smallholder water needs in the WCA’s day-
       to-day operations appears to be an important factor that determines the quality of local water
       management arrangements.

90.	   A number of factors influence the extent to which legitimate and illegitimate users are clearly
       defined and thus whether the needs of dehkans and tomorka owners are included in the local
       management arrangements of irrigation water. These include the following:
       •	       Separate canal intakes for dehkans and tomorka owners. If there are special canal water
                intake structures for these smallholders’ irrigation needs, chances are that their legitimate
                needs are met in a more reliable and predictable manner.
       •	       WCA contracts for supplying water to dehkans and tomorka owners. Concrete and well-
                developed water supply contracts between the WCA and the VAC that specify how the
                legitimate irrigation needs of these smallholders will be met are also an important factor
                in this regard.
       •	       Distance between the VAC office and the WCA office. We find that if the office of the
                VAC—which in principle represents dehkans and tomorka owners—is located far (say, 20
                km or more) from the WCA office, it hampers effective communication between these
                two organizations. This makes it difficult to ensure that the irrigation needs of these
                smallholders are consistently met and that they pay their irrigation fees.
       •	       Distance between the fields of dehkans and tomorka owners and the main interfarm
                canal. If their fields are close to the main WCA interfarm canal, their unregulated water
                intake may interrupt the main irrigation supply schedule to farmers. If their fields are
                further away from the canal, they will depend on farmers’ willingness and preparedness
                to let water pass onto their fields. This factor of distance works in both ways, and could
                either support or undermine legitimate use of irrigation water.
       •	       Overall water scarcity. If overall availability in the WCA area is low, there are stronger
                incentives to carefully plan water distribution and make sure every user’s needs are
                incorporated in irrigation plans. However, whether this is the case also depends on
                production conditions and whether growers have the freedom to grow the crop that is
                most suitable for the area and most profitable.
       •	       Mirobs for dehkans and tomorka owners. If there are mirobs to specifically take care of
                the irrigation needs of dehkans and tomorka owners, it is more likely that their needs will
                be met.
       •	       Active and effective VAC leaders and WCA directors. All water consumers benefit
                when local leaders communicate effectively; when they adequately build trust between
                WCA members and also smallholders; and when they are active in decision making or
                supervisory bodies (such as the WCA board).

4. Design principle 2: Congruence between the benefits and
costs of using irrigation water
91.	         The second design principle for the sustainable management of irrigation water as a common-
             pool resource is that the benefits from using the resource must be proportional to the inputs
             used or effort made to obtain it. These inputs can be in the form of labor, materials, or money. This
             principle also emphasizes that the appropriation and provision rules should be in line with local
             conditions and traditions. This principle, for example, could imply that the costs households incur
             for obtaining irrigation water are proportional to their needs (for example, depending on land size
             or crop type in our case) and use, as well as availability. This chapter discusses the extent to which
             this design principle is met in each of the case study areas, how this is related to WCA performance,
             and what factors are important for these principles to be met. We first look at the costs that water
             consumers incur for obtaining water, as well as the benefits of using the water; that is, the net
             returns from cultivating the irrigated crop. We will also look at the net returns to the amount of
             water used.

92.	         User payments for irrigation water are generally not linked to the actual amount of water used.
             Consumers in all ten WCAs incur three types of costs to obtain irrigation water: The irrigation service
             fee; additional costs to maintain canals or repair structures; and, in some cases, expenses to pump
             water to their fields. Of these three costs, only the expenses incurred for pumping9 are directly related
             to the amount of water consumed. The irrigation service fee consists of a low and fixed amount per
             ha (about Soum 10,000–60,000 per ha, or US$3–24 per ha), depending on the crops grown. While
             these amounts differ across WCAs, in none of them is the fee directly linked to the actual amount
             of water used. Volumes of water supplied to farmers and other water consumers are generally not
             measured, and determining the level of the fee does not involve any field measurements. This is
             illustrated by an accountant from the selected WCA in Pap District, Namangan:

                          “I am an accountant and I do not know much on irrigation issues. For example, I do not
                          know how to measure the amount of water that we supplied to farmers. We receive water
                          according to a certain maximum. I am not able to check what percentage of the limit we
                          actually received.”
                                                                    —Namangan, accountant, male, 40 years old

Costs incurred for obtaining water
Irrigation service fees

93.	         Farmers in many of the WCAs we studied consider the irrigation service fee to be a payment for
             the WCA’s operational costs only, and believe that the water itself should be provided for free.
             Others regard the fees as part of something they believe they have already paid for—the land
             tax. Measuring and paying for actual volumes of water received is for many a new concept. Some
             farmers were worried that if water meters are installed, they will be charged for the actual amount
             of water supplied, which will increase their costs. However, this view was mostly common in the
             poorly performing sample WCAs in Pap District, Namangan, and Dustlik District, Jizzakh, where the
             quality of irrigation water delivery is unsatisfactory.

94.	         Farmers who are not satisfied with the water supply refuse to pay the fee, or have not paid it for
             several years. In poorly performing WCAs such as the selected WCAs in Dustlik District, Jizzakh,
             and Pap District, Namangan, few farmers pay on time. This makes it even more difficult for the
             WCA to operate and maintain the irrigation system, so it enters into a downward spiral of poor fee
             collection and poor repairs and maintenance (such as shown in Pictures 7 and 8).


9. Unfortunately, little information on pumping costs was available for this study. However, some WCAs lower the irrigation fees for those farmers that
operate their own irrigation pumps.

                                                                         50

95.	           In some WCAs, farmers pay the same fixed fee per ha for all crop types. This is the case in the
               medium-performing sample WCAs in Akhangaran, Tashkent Oblast, and Kattakurgan District,
               Samarkand (see Table 7). However, in other WCAs, the fee is lower for state-mandated crops
               than for the more lucrative secondary ones (for example, in the high-performing sample WCAs in
               Urgench District in Khorezm, Kyzyltep District in Navoi, and Kuwa District in Fergana Oblast), even
               if state-mandated crops use much more water. The irrigation fee for secondary crops can be the
               same for all secondary crops (such as in Navoi), or differ by crop type (such as in Khorezm). The
               WCA in Denov District, Surkhandarya, is a unique case in that it is the only WCA in our study where
               the irrigation fee (in Soum per ha) for cotton is twice as high as for wheat and secondary crops. The
               alleged reason is that cotton is the most water-demanding crop in the area, and that the irrigation
               fee per ha for cotton cultivation should therefore be highest. It is interesting to note that overall
               water availability in the secondary canal here is low, which perhaps provides an incentive to the
               WCA to charge more per ha for the crop that uses the most water (cotton).

96.	          As mentioned, and as seen in Table 7, the highest irrigation fees for cotton (Soum 20,000–30,000
              per ha) are levied in three out of the four high-performing WCAs. In the other WCAs the fees vary
              between Soum 10,000 and 13,500 per ha. Irrigation fees for wheat are the same as those for cotton
              except in one sampled WCA—the WCA in Denov, Surkhandarya, where irrigation fees for wheat are
              half those of cotton. The highest irrigation fees were levied in Kuwa urta buz anori WCA in Kuwa
              District, Fergana Oblast. Because of the scarcity of water, reliance on pumped irrigation water, and
              a relatively good return on their crops, horticultural farmers in this WCA as well as in the other
              selected WCA in Kuwa District have invested in drip irrigation technologies.10

97.	          The two sampled WCAs in Kuwa District in Fergana Oblast charged higher fees per ha to grow
              horticultural crops (see Table 7), despite the fact that they receive less water with which to grow
              these crops than they do for others. They were said to charge more because horticulture is more
              profitable. According to respondents in the two Kuwa WCAs, however, the fee payment rate is much
              higher among farmers that grow at least some horticultural crops. Focus groups with horticultural
              farmers and dehkans in this area revealed that they are ready to pay even higher fees, provided they
              receive better service. It would allow them to hire qualified mirobs and better maintain canals. This
              is illustrated by the following quote from one study respondent:

                          “We all are ready to pay even higher irrigation fees than Soum 143,000 per ha, if we get
                          more water and will receive it on time. If we can water our trees eight times per season, as
                          it is supposed to be, we will get higher income. If we have higher income, we can pay more
                          money for irrigation. Our income depends primarily on the irrigation.”
                                            —Kuwa urta buz anori, dehkan (horticultural crops), female, 49 years old

98.	          Raising the irrigation fee might in theory help fund irrigation canal maintenance needs. However,
              this worries some WCA officials, who claimed that if farmers pay higher fees they will want to
              hold the WCA accountable for supplying the exact amount of water that is stated in the delivery
              contract they have with the WCA. But since the amount of water supplied to farmers depends on
              how much the AIS and BAIS supply through the main canal, as well as weather conditions, the WCA
              administration is not confident they can honor the commitment. Moreover, WCA officials claimed
              it is impossible for the WCA to hold the AIS accountable for the water that it has agreed to deliver
              to the WCA. Also, fewer farmers might be able to pay the fee on time, and as a consequence the
              WCA will have more difficulty paying WCA staff salaries, which will cause tension. WCA officials also
              worry this will encourage farmers to leave the WCA and arrange for their own irrigation system; for
              example, by using tube wells.

99.	          In well-functioning WCAs farmers already pay higher fees than in poorly functioning ones (see
              Table 7). They are also already active in maintaining and repairing the irrigation system. This is
              the case in Kyzyltep District in Navoi, Denov District in Surkhandarya, and Kuwa District, Fergana
              Oblast. Moreover, farmers in the well-performing WCAs suggested that higher irrigation fees would
              be acceptable if it allows their WCAs to purchase/rent equipment or machines. The main reason
              farmers are motivated to pay a higher fee is that they see the results of the work their WCAs do,
              and they understand what they are paying for. They think that if a WCA functions well, they will get
              enough water and enjoy higher profits.

100.	         In contrast, in poorly-functioning WCAs—such as the sampled WCAs in Pap District in Namangan
              and Dustlik District in Jizzakh—farmers do not agree to pay higher fees. A significant number of
10. In Qodirjon Azimonov WCA in Kuwa, seven out of ten horticultural farmers recently installed drip irrigation. Six of them paid full price for the
equipment themselves, and one took a loan from the bank.

                                                                        52
           farmers here are indebted. Some farmers fear that if water meters are installed they will have to
           pay for the unlimited use of water by dehkans and tomorka owners, who withdraw water through
           the canals going to their farm, which is said to be the case in Pap District, Namangan, and Kyzyltep
           District in Navoi.

101.	      The amount paid for the volume of irrigation water used (expressed in Soum/m3) is much lower
           for cotton than for wheat (and also than for horticultural crops, although this differed per WCA).
           Expressed in m3 of water per harvested ton, cotton uses about three times more water than wheat
           and about 13 times as much as a horticultural crop like onions. However, when expressed in m3
           per ha, cotton and onions are about equal in terms of water use, with each using about three times
           as much as wheat. In those WCAs where farmers pay much lower fees per ha for cotton than for
           horticultural crops, cotton growers pay much less for the irrigation water they use, compared to
           those that cultivate other crops (see Table 8).

102.	      An important observation is that in well-functioning WCAs (for example, the sampled WCAs in
           Navoi, Surkhandarya, and Kuwa), farmers not only pay higher irrigation fees; they also tend to
           pay on time. In well-functioning WCAs, debt levels vary from 0 percent to 20 percent of the annual
           budget; while in poorly performing WCAs the amount owed by farmers to the WCA might be more
           than 100 percent of the annual WCA budget. An exemption is the WCA in Akhangaran District,
           Tashkent Oblast—this WCA was said to perform well and the fees are relatively low.

103.	      Farmers must pay irrigation fees WCA by bank transfer, as this is required by national law for
           all financial transfers between legal entities. This leads to substantial delays in payment. As
           a consequence, the WCAs have trouble paying staff salaries and taxes when they are due. Such
           long payment delays have led WCA specialists to quit their jobs and search for other employment
           opportunities. These difficulties arise in two different ways.
           (i)	      Farmers sell their main crops to the government and receive payment for cotton (the
                     dominant crop) in their bank accounts several months after the harvest. Therefore, in
                     most WCAs they have trouble paying the irrigation fee on time. This was the case, for
                     example, in the studied WCAs in Khorezm, Samarkand, Namangan, Jizzakh, Syrdaryo, and
                     Tashkent Oblast.
           (ii)	     In some WCAs (such as the one in Akhangaran District in Tashkent Oblast), many farmers
                     grow horticultural crops, and many sell these for cash. They therefore do not always have
                     money in their accounts to pay the irrigation fee. Here, farmers’ total debt represents 111
                     percent of the WCA annual budget.

104.	      To counter the cash flow problem caused by the late payment for cotton harvests, WCAs accept
           the irrigation fee in the form of in-kind payments, such as harvest produce. The WCA then officially
           deducts the price of the crops from the irrigation fee the farmer is supposed to pay, and distributes
           the crops among employees. This is the case, for example, in the selected low-performing WCAs
           in Dustlik District, Jizzakh, and Pap District, Namangan. Another form of in-kind payment involves
           farmers allowing the WCA to use their equipment/machinery and materials (fuel, cement, and so
           on) that are required to maintain the canals or repair some part of the common irrigation system.
                                                                 53
              The cost of the materials and rent are then deducted from the fee the farmer is supposed to pay
              the WCA. In the high-performing WCA in Kyzyltep District in Navoi, for example, instead of paying
              their irrigation fee, farmers sometimes rent out their equipment to the WCA, buy cement or fuel
              for maintenance and repair activities, or give the WCA some part of their harvest (secondary crops).
              In the medium-performing WCA in Akaltyn, some farmers said they repair a part of the common
              irrigation system in lieu of paying the irrigation fee.

105.	         In about half the WCAs we studied (mostly the low- and medium-performing ones) dehkan
              farmers and tomorka owners do not pay for the water they use (see Table 9). In some of the case
              study sites they pay the VAC, which then transfers the amount to the WCA, fulfilling contractual
              obligations. In the latter case, amounts vary between Soum 15,000 and 50,000 per ha. Payments
              can be made in cash. The head of the high-performing Qodirjon Azimonov WCA in Kuwa District,
              Fergana Oblast, claims that collecting fees from dehkans and tomorka-owning households is difficult
              for several reasons. He conveyed that:

                             “When mirobs come to the houses, there are no adults at home or people say that they
                             do not have money at the moment, or pensioners did not receive the monthly pension yet,
                             etc. But anyone receives water anyway.”

              WCA authorities have no legal way to cut them off from irrigation canal water. All they can do is hire
              an extra person to work with tomorka owners and convince them of the importance of paying for
              water.

106.	         Due to low payment of the irrigation fee, only a portion of the planned WCA budget is executed,
              although this significantly varies across WCAs (see Table 9). This proportion varied from 37 percent
              in the low-performing WCA in Dustlik District in Jizzakh to 84 percent in the high-performing WCA
              in Kyzyltep District in Navoi. The total executed budget per km of interfarm irrigation canal varied
              between Soum 0.1 and 2 million per km, and this figure tends to be higher among the better-
              performing WCAs (see Table 9).

Using their own funds to pay for maintenance

107.	   Partly to avoid paying the labor taxes (see Box 2) that the WCAs incur for hiring employees,
        farmers claimed they have not gone through the WCA but have spent money directly on canal
        maintenance and repairing parts of the irrigation system that serve their area. Farmers who said
        they used their own funds to maintain the irrigation system claimed they spent Soum 1–9 million.
        The money is used to rent canal cleaning and repair equipment, purchase materials, and pay for
        labor. One other reason why they prefer to arrange the maintenance themselves is that renting
        equipment, purchasing fuel, and buying other materials is up to 20–25 percent cheaper if one pays
        by cash. If they transfer the money to the WCA’s bank account, however, the repair work will be
        more expensive for them. Rather than finance the maintenance and repair costs, the WCA’s role
        therefore appears to have become helping farmers plan the maintenance, find machinery (for
        example, requesting it from AIS or Vodhoz), purchase fuel, and so on. This is especially the case for
        the high-performing WCAs.

Box 2. Taxes and WCAs

Taxes represent a significant portion of the WCA budget. Recent legislative changes turned the WCA in a
nonprofit organization, requiring it to pay labor tax only. The WCA pays a unified social tax (25 percent of
the salary budget), a pension tax (currently 3.5 percent; the tax rate changes every year), and a variable
income tax for its employees that ranges from 7.5 percent to 22 percent, depending on how much the salary
is above the subsistence wage. For example, if the total monthly salary budget (the amount that is actually
spent on paying WCA employees) is Soum 2,000,000, only 71.2 percent of the amount (Soum 1,424,000)
goes to employees, and 28.8 percent (Soum 576,000) is paid as taxes. Since for most WCAs the main item of
expenditure is salary (70–100 percent of the budget), taxes are quite a substantial part of spending.

108.	   The ability of many farmers to maintain the canals using their own cash depends on whether they
        can grow secondary crops. Secondary crops in general are more profitable than main crops, and
        unlike cotton, farmers can sell them for cash (see below).

109.	   An important part of the irrigation system’s annual maintenance is done through hashars (work
        parties). Respondents indicated that three different types of hashars are organized every year.
        The first is organized by the AIS to maintain secondary canals that provide the WCA with irrigation
        water. The second type involves the maintenance of canals located on farmers’ land and the WCA’s
        common irrigation canals. This type is conducted by the WCA together with farmers. The third
        type is organized by the VAC, where dehkans and tomorka owners clean and fix canals located on
        their land. Dehkans and tomorka owners participate in hashars twice a year to clean and repair the
        canals located on the land of their mahalla. Respondents reported that WCA staff rarely approach
        dehkans and tomorka owners to participate in hashars; VAC and mahalla leaders do it instead. In the
        selected WCA in Denov District, Surkhandarya, a small portion of the WCA (4 percent of the area)
        depends on pumps that are operated and paid for by farmers. To make things fair, the WCA charges

110.	   According to the data, costs and returns vary significantly across different crops and across farmers.
        In this section we review the costs and returns for crops in WCAs with good water availability and
        good/medium performance (the sample WCAs in Akhangaran District in Tashkent Oblast, and
        Kyzyltep District, Navoi), and a WCA with low water availability and low performance (the studied
        WCA in Pap District, Namangan). The data suggest that wheat is more profitable than cotton, and
        most secondary crops are more profitable than wheat.

111.	          Growing wheat leaves a farmer with higher returns on average than growing cotton, mainly
               because the input costs to grow cotton are about 50–80 percent higher than for wheat, while
               gross returns for cotton are only 8 percent to 30 percent higher (see Table 10). The WCA irrigation
               fees account for only 0.8 percent to 3.5 percent of these costs. Net returns for cotton tend to be
               lower on average than for wheat, but can be equal to wheat when yields are high.

Note: A farmer that grows wheat has to sell two tons per ha to the government at a price of Soum 412,000 per ton. A farmer can
either keep and use the last 0.5–1.5 tons for his/her own needs, or sell it on the market. In 2014 the market price for wheat varied
from Soum 600,000 to Soum 700,000 per ton. Farmers also produce 100 packs of wheat straw per ha as a side product, which can
be sold for around Soum 3,000 per pack. To grow cotton, a farmer needs to spend around Soum 2 million (US$670–800) per ha each
year. Yields were said to vary between 1.5 and 3.5 tons per ha, but typically between 2 and 3 tons per ha. The average state quota
for cotton production was said to be 2.5 ton per ha. The average price to sell cotton to the government ginneries was Soum 937,400
(US$310–370) per ton of cotton in 2013. A cotton field provides 500–1,000 cotton stalks from 1 ha. The market for these was Soum
1,000 in 2014. However, farmers don’t sell these, but rather let their employees harvest them for free or as part of payment for their
labor. We have estimated the value of these for farmers as Soum 100,000 per ha.


112.	          Crop yields can be highly variable, even more so under uncertain irrigation water supply conditions,
               which can reduce incomes (see Box 3).

Box 3. Income losses from poor irrigation service conditions

“The plan for the wheat for my farm is 3.5 tons per ha and I have to sell to the government 2.2–2.3 tons per
ha. I have managed to meet the quota this year; however, many other farmers in the area could not do that.
For the cotton the situation is much worse. I have spent a lot of money to plant the cotton this year. To cover
the costs I borrowed Soum 10 million from the bank to pay for fertilizers, fuel, and seeds. However, when the
cotton bloomed we did not have water. And we did not have water for the next three months—June, July,
and August. None of our farmers could water the cotton. Because of that I have managed to harvest only 5
tons of cotton from 25 ha while my plan was 30 tons. My plan for the wheat was 40 tons and I managed to
get 44 tons (120 percent). After paying all expenditures and selling wheat I had Soum 5 million on my bank
account. And I have decided to cover part of my debt for cotton from this money. Basically after the season
I even owe the bank some money.”

113.	          Apart from the lower input costs and thus the lower risks involved, there are a number of
               additional reasons farmers prefer to grow wheat instead of cotton. First, cotton occupies the
               field during the whole growing season (March–October), whereas wheat can be planted in winter
               (November) and harvested in late spring (June). Consequently, farmers can grow secondary crops
               on land where wheat has been harvested or can rent out the land to their employees for the

                                                                 56
              remaining four months of the growing season. Moreover, farmers receive government payment for
              the wheat crops immediately after delivery, whereas they need to wait several months after cotton
              is harvested for the money to be transferred to their bank accounts.

114.	         Farmers claim that secondary crops are much more profitable than the state-mandated crops.
              For example, the average net returns to land for growing vegetables can be as high as Soum 4
              million (US$1,600) per ha, 3–8 times higher than for cotton or wheat cultivation. Farmers can sell
              their secondary crops on the free market and obtain all payments in cash. The actual income largely
              depends on the timing. Right after the peak harvest period, prices tend to be lower than they are
              2–3 months later. As mentioned, secondary crops are often grown on land where wheat has just
              been harvested or on land devoted entirely to secondary crops. However, authorities only allow
              farmers to do the latter on 5 percent to 10 percent of their land.

115.	         Farmers’ net returns per volume of irrigation water tend to be much lower for cotton than for
              wheat and horticultural crops (onions) (see Table 11). That is because the net returns per ha are
              lower for cotton while the volume of water used per ha is highest for this crop. In order to assess
              whether these returns to the volume of water are proportional to the costs incurred to obtain it,
              however, we need to compare these with, say, the irrigation fees paid for the water. This is shown in
              the last two columns in Table 11.

116.	         We see that for the lowest yields and lowest irrigation fees in our sample, farmers’ net returns
              per irrigation fee paid are five times lower for cotton than for wheat and ten times lower than
              for horticultural crops like onions, while for the highest yields, those for cotton and wheat are
              similar and for horticultural crops are lower (see Table 11, last two columns). Note, though, that
              the figure for horticultural crops is based on the irrigation fee of Soum 120,000 per ha in Kuwa urta
              buz anori WCA, in Kuwa District, Fergana Oblast. If we take the second highest irrigation fee in the
              sample WCAs (of Soum 40,000 per ha, which is more typical), this figure is 100. The data indicate
              that farmers‘ returns to irrigation fee paid are typically 1–5 times lower for cotton than for wheat,
              and about 2.5–10 times lower compared to horticultural crops (excluding Kuwa urta buz anori WCA)
              (see Table 11 last two columns). Note that these data exclude all other costs that farmers incur for
              irrigation water, such as their own expenses incurred to maintain the irrigation canals, purchase drip
              irrigation equipment, and so on.

117.	         In conclusion, we can say that while farmers’ net returns to the volume of water used are 2–3 times
              lower for cotton than for wheat and other crops, the returns to the amount paid for obtaining the
              water are similar to wheat, especially when cotton yields are high. However, when cotton yields
              are low (for example, because it is grown in areas not very suitable for growing it) farmers’ net

                                                                     57
         returns to costs incurred for obtaining the water can be 5 times lower for cotton than for wheat. In
         these areas, the amount paid for the irrigation water is not proportional to the returns, compared
         to growing wheat or other crops.
118.	    The productivity of the tomorkas can be very high even if cash inputs are low, leading to high
         profits per unit of land. No cash payments are incurred for labor or water as they use household
         labor, and free or cheap water from the irrigation canals when they can. Moreover, tomorka owners
         keep part of the vegetables to produce seeds for the next year, and use animal dung to fertilize
         the soil. The only cash costs they incur are land and property tax (for respondents in our sample,
         it varied from Soum 100,000 to 180,000 a year). In total, cash costs for growing crops on tomorka
         land would not exceed Soum 500,000 a year, and if they would sell everything that was harvested
         from these plots they would earn no less than Soum 1.5–7 million (from 0.1 ha of land) (see Box 4).

Box 4. Low cash costs and high returns to land for smallholders

“We do all the work in our tomorka and orchard ourselves, myself and my husband. Plant the crops, weed,
harvest. Do everything ourselves. Fertilizers we do not buy, we have some livestock and use dung for the
purpose. We also do not buy seeds to grow potato, onion and other vegetables. Instead, we use seeds from
the previous year harvest. I think we only buy carrot seeds, but they are not expensive. We received a good
return last year, for all the crops we got Soum 4.5 million. We were busy repairing our house this year.
Because of that we received only Soum 1.5 million for selling our crops this year.”

Obtaining water for main and secondary crops
119.	    Only in some WCAs are farmers able to obtain sufficient irrigation water to water the lucrative
         secondary crops. Annual water delivery schedule and contracts with farmers do not usually
         include a provision for irrigating secondary crops. As was shown in Table 7 sufficient irrigation
         water for secondary crops is available only in the sample WCAs in Denov District in Surkhandarya,
         Kyzyltep District in Navoi, and Akhangaran District in Tashkent Oblast, all high-performing WCAs.
         Provided that the state production quota of cotton and wheat are met, farmers can in principle
         negotiate with the AIS and the Hokimiyat on what size land they are allowed to grow secondary
         crops, and have irrigation water delivered accordingly. But the data suggest that in reality, this is not
         a priority.
120.	    As water for irrigating secondary crops is usually not included in the water delivery schedule,
         farmers in most WCAs can only grow secondary crops by using irrigation water that is allocated to
         the main crops. When they are able, farmers grow secondary crops after harvesting wheat in June.
         This is, for example, the situation in the case study WCAs in Denov District in Surkhandarya, Urgench
         District in Khorezm, and Akaltyn District in Syrdaryo. Estimating the water needs of secondary crops
         is said to be more complicated and requires time, according to the WCA director in Tashkent Oblast.
         However, many WCAs were said to have insufficient water in their canals to adequately irrigate
         secondary crops. In the sampled WCAs in Pap District in Namangan and Dustlik District in Jizzakh,
         water is not available to irrigate secondary crops; when they do not have alternative water sources
         (such as private wells), farmers only grow state-mandated crops. This situation is further illustrated
         in Box 5, which presents water allocation practices in the sampled WCAs in Kuwa District, Fergana
         Oblast.

Box 5. Water allocation in Kuwa causes farmers to lose money
Horticultural farmers in the case study WCAs in Kuwa District, Fergana Oblast, expressed their frustration
that priority is given to state-mandated crops and that they are not allocated enough water to irrigate their
horticultural plots. In Kuwa District, a large proportion of land is allocated to horticultural crops. However,
the WCA’s water allocation schedule gives priority to cotton and wheat. In spring and summer, cotton and
wheat farmers receive water first, and in higher quantity. Farmers who grow horticultural crops, along with
dehkan farmers and tomorka owners, receive water second. This can cause farmers to lose considerable
income.

                                                      58
121.	        Horticultural farmers are sometimes forced to ask their mirobs to secretly reallocate water slated
             for other farmers’ cotton or wheat plots to their horticultural plots, according to the interviews
             conducted for this study. This leads to social tension and even conflict. Participants in discussions
             with horticultural farmers stated they receive water only 3–4 times per season instead of the
             required 7–8 times. They claimed farmers who grow wheat and cotton may receive a continuous
             flow of water for several days, while horticultural farmers receive water for only 20 minutes to
             several hours. Discussions with cotton and wheat farmers from Qodirjon Azimonov WCA in Kuwa
             District, Fergana Oblast, revealed that horticultural farmers tend to steal their water; they also said
             that horticultural farmers’ mirobs reallocate water from their plots and hope the cotton/wheat
             farmers will not notice. Participants stated that they might even “get in a fight” with them because
             of this. Mirobs from the WCA were said to mediate conflicts between these two groups of farmers.

122.	        Horticultural farmers do not blame the WCA for the low priority given to their irrigation needs.
             Instead, they blame the policy of giving preference to state-mandated crops. Horticultural
             farmers believe that the WCA works hard and tries its best to improve water management in the
             area. However, they wish that the government’s irrigation policy would show more “respect” for
             horticultural crops so they can be allocated enough water to earn a decent income.11 They also
             thought that the generally low amounts of water provided to the WCA by the AIS and BAIS and the
             generally low availability of water in the main canal were to blame for the lack of water available for
             horticultural crops.

123.	        The findings suggest that farmers who grow secondary crops use water more cautiously, irrigate
             their fields more efficiently, and look for ways to save water. In particular, farmers who grow
             secondary crops often use drip irrigation, arrange for wells to be drilled, or mix water from drainage
             canals with water from the irrigation canal. This is the case in the sample WCAs in Urgench District
             in Khorezm, Akaltyn District in Syrdaryo, Kyzyltep District in Navoi, and Kattakurgan District in
             Samarkand, where water availability for secondary crops is low or medium.

124.	        Not being able to grow secondary crops lowers the benefits farmers get from using irrigation
             water, and from farming more broadly, and inhibits the means to jointly undertake the common
             irrigation infrastructure’s operation and maintenance needs. Farmer satisfaction regarding the
             WCAs is low in the two sampled WCAs in Jizzakh and Namangan, where no secondary crops are
             grown. As we have seen, benefits from using irrigation water appear to significantly differ between
             WCAs depending on the extent to which they can grow lucrative crops.

125.	        Despite WCA officials’ claims that farmers at the tail end of the interfarm canals receive irrigation
             water for their lands first, tail end farmers tend to receive less water than others. To address this
             problem, some of the WCA officials claimed to allocate more time and/or water to tail-end farmers.
             This is the case in the sample WCAs in Urgench District in Khorezm, Denov District in Surkhandarya,
             Kyzyltep District in Navoi, and Akhangaran District in Tashkent Oblast. Lining and repairing canals
             also helps in this respect. In areas where WCAs failed to provide tail-end farmers with sufficient
             water, these farmers have lower productivity and tend to refuse to pay irrigation fees; this was the
             case in the sample WCAs in Pap District in Namangan and Dustlik District in Jizzakh.

126.	        The relatively low profitability – from a farmers’ point of view - of state-mandated crops
             undermines farmers’ ability to sufficiently contribute to adequate maintenance of the local
             irrigation and drainage systems. Somewhat inconsistently, the policy to give preference to state-
             mandated crops appears to be enforced even if the state has allocated a substantial portion of land
             to the much more profitable horticultural crops, making horticultural farmers vulnerable to late and
             insufficient irrigation services. There are signs that horticultural farmers are willing to pay much
             higher irrigation fees on the condition that their needs are given higher priority in local irrigation
             schedules.

11. It should be noted that in recent years the government has reduced the area on which cotton has to be grown, freeing up irrigation water for other
crops.

                                                                         59
Difference in costs incurred by male and female growers

127.	    Irrigation is traditionally a male responsibility, but the gender division of labor is changing due
         to the growing outmigration of Uzbek men. This particularly affects dehkans and tomorka owners.
         Female members of households are traditionally responsible for duties such as gardening, weeding,
         and food processing, while male members of households are normally in charge of negotiating deals
         with government organizations, arranging irrigation, and irrigating household plots (Veldwisch,
         2008). Following male outmigration, however, women in dehkans and tomorka-owning households
         have become more involved in agriculture and irrigation (Mukhamedova and Wegerich, 2014).
         Younger women have particularly started to play a more important role. However, it can be difficult
         for female farmers whose husband has migrated to take care of irrigation activities, as reflected in
         the testimony in Box 6.

128.	    Female dehkans or tomorka owners whose husband is absent often have trouble attending to
         nightly irrigation duties. Farmers often only allow dehkans and tomorka owners to water their land
         during the night. These intakes might be located far from their house, and if men are not around,
         women must perform this difficult task. In addition, when there is a technical irrigation problem on
         a dehkan or a tomorka owner’s land where there is no man, women claim it is difficult for them to
         fix it or to arrange for repairs (see Box 6). Clearly, the social cost incurred to obtain irrigation water
         is higher for women than for men, given the transport difficulties they face, especially at night (see
         Box 6).

Box 6. Women struggle to irrigate their plots

“I am the only female farmer in our region. If there is a need to water the field or check if there is water in
the canal, men can do it by foot or bicycle. But this is more difficult for women to overcome the distance by
foot. It was my turn to water the field last Monday; I got a call at 2 am that I can start watering. I went to my
field but there was no water in my canal. The water started running at 4:30 am and after that I had to be for
the whole day in the field to control the irrigation to my wheat crop. If there is no water it is a big problem
for farmers. It is especially difficult for women. I do not have a husband and I have to do everything myself,
sometimes it is very difficult. If there is no water on time I am very worried and can even cry. If there is water
I am happy and get strengths to do anything”.
                                                                      —Namangan, farmer, female, 51 years old

“There are households in our area that have to manage a tomorka while the head of the household and
older children are working in Russia. Only the wife and younger children often remain at home. Farmers
allow dehkans and tomorka owners to water their land mostly at night. It is difficult for the women to go 30
km from the tomorka to the gateway at night and leave kids home alone. There are farmers who help these
women and allow them to use water during the day. But not all farmers are like that, especially in our area
where there are frequent difficulties with water supply. And the woman cannot just not go to the gateway
and not water the tomorka. In this case the family will starve.”
                                                          —Namangan, WCA accountant, male, 40 years old

“Women struggle a lot. We have to water our land at night—a woman cannot do it herself. She needs to find
somebody to do that and pay him for the service. The person will ask for Soum 5,000–10,000 for one day
depending on the amount of land that needs watering.”
                                                           —Navoi, tomorka owner, female, 48 years old

129.	    In this chapter we reviewed whether the costs of getting irrigation water are proportional to the
         benefits of using it. We found that in all WCAs the irrigation service fee is fixed per ha and not based
         on actual amount of water used. Amounts are low and the irrigation fee accounts for only a small
         percentage of total production costs. We find that in all of the WCAs we studied, irrigation fees are
         lowest for the crop that uses the most irrigation water—cotton, the main state-mandated crop.

                                                       60
        However, there are substantial differences in cotton irrigation fees across WCAs. They tend to be
        lowest in the poorly performing WCAs, where farmers’ level of satisfaction with irrigation services
        is low.

130.	   Farmers’ net returns to the volume of water used are 2–3 times lower for cotton than for wheat
        and other crops. In addition, the returns to the amount paid to get the water are five times lower
        when cotton yields are low. This could be because it is planted in areas not very suitable for growing
        it. In these areas, the amount paid to obtain the water is not proportional to the returns, compared
        to growing wheat or other crops. However when cotton yields are high, net returns to the amount
        paid to obtain water can be the same for cotton and wheat.

131.	   Charging lower fees to irrigate the state-mandated crops which tend to generate low profits
        for farmers may make the costs of irrigation water proportional to the benefits of using it, but
        doing so undermines the ability of WCAs to allocate water to the crops that are most profitable
        for farmers. The best-performing WCAs tend to be those that are able to make water available to
        cultivate profitable secondary crops. They also tend to be the ones that charge the highest irrigation
        fees for these secondary crops. Both actions make it possible for farmers and WCAs to generate
        sufficient resources to maintain and repair the irrigation system.

132.	   The state regulation that makes it mandatory for farmers to grow cotton in areas less suitable
        for growing it, together with the current practice of paying producers low prices for seed cotton,
        leads to low profit margins for cotton from a farmers’ point of view, and makes it hard for WCAs
        to recover costs of operation and maintenance. This particularly affects the WCAs where overall
        water is scarce and where there is limited irrigation water available to grow the more profitable
        secondary crops. These WCAs or their farmers often also incur additional pumping costs to meet
        their irrigation needs. When overall water availability is low, a WCA can still perform well, provided
        it is able allocate sufficient amounts of water to secondary crops, which enables farmers to recover
        their costs.

5. Design principles 4, 5, and 6: Those who monitor water
use(rs) and those that sanction violators are accountable to
water users
133.	    In the previous chapter we looked at whether the costs of appropriating irrigation water are
         proportional to the benefits it provides, and what factors determine whether this is the case. In
         this chapter we will look at design principles 4, 5, and 6. Design principle 4 requires that those who
         monitor the use of the irrigation canal water, and those who monitor irrigation water users, are
         accountable to those water users. Design principle 5 states that users who violate operational rules
         should be sanctioned by other users or by officials accountable to them. Lastly, design principle
         6 implies that irrigation water users and their officials have access to low-cost conflict resolution
         methods.

AIS monitoring and accountability

134.	    The findings suggest that even though farmers sign water delivery contracts with the WCA,
         and the WCA is in principle accountable to water consumers, the AIS plays an important role in
         checking whether farmers stick to those water-use agreements. It is particularly common for the
         AIS to “look over the shoulders” of the WCA in the poorly functioning WCAs. The WCA also monitors
         farmers’ water use, but—unlike the AIS—does not have any legal way to penalize farmers.

135.	    While the AIS plays an important role in monitoring overall water use, it is not accountable to
         WCAs or water consumers. Even if a contract is signed between the WCA and the AIS, when the AIS
         is unable to honor the agreement and cannot deliver the agreed amount of water when needed,
         the WCA is not in a position to hold the WCA accountable. Data suggest that it is not uncommon
         for the AIS to be unable to deliver the agreed amount of water. This is usually due to lower-than-
         expected volumes of primary canal water it receives from the BAIS, though problems with outdated
         water pumps (see Picture 9), electricity supply, poor management, and lack of maintenance and
         repair to the irrigation structures under AIS responsibility likely also play a role.

        Picture 9. Irrigation pumps owned and operated by Goybu WCA, Urgench District, Khorezm




136.	    The WCA is not in a position to enforce the contractual arrangement it has with the AIS, partly
         because the WCA does not pay for the water it receives from it. As we saw in Chapter 4, farmers
         pay irrigation service fees per the amount of land they have. However, study findings reveal that the
         WCAs, and thus the farmers, often receive only a portion of the promised water from the AIS. Indeed,
         the AIS may deliver less water if it turns out that there is greater water shortage and water levels in
         the rivers and canals are lower than anticipated, or if pumps or canals are broken and there are no
         funds for repairs. This has caused friction between farmers and WCAs. Farmers—especially those

                                                      62
        who paid their irrigation fees on time—insist on receiving all of the water they were promised. But
        the WCA has no mechanism to hold the AIS to account and no way to force it to meet its contractual
        obligations. The WCA is not legally entitled to the water it was promised by the AIS, and will not be
        compensated if the deliveries are not made.

137.	   Poorly functioning and outdated pumping equipment can be responsible for the AIS’s failure to
        deliver water to the WCA. For example, the AIS of one of the worst-performing case study WCAs—
        the selected WCA in Pap District, Namangan—operates pumping stations that have low capacity and
        are frequently broken. The WCA’s water supply is often interrupted for days and sometimes weeks.
        Farm productivity is very low. The WCA is said to be poorly managed and some farmers refuse to pay
        the fee, or pay very late. The current head of the WCA was appointed by the Hokimiyat, as nobody
        wanted to apply for the position. Picture 10 shows a WCA pump in Pap District, Namangan.

                     Picture 10. WCA-owned water pump in Pap District, Namangan




138.	   The AIS’s lack of accountability to the WCA appears to be an important reason why some WCAs
        are not keen on raising irrigation service fees. Some WCA officials claimed that if irrigation fees are
        raised, farmers will demand more accountability from the WCA regarding the quantity and timing of
        water delivery to their farms. This is difficult for the WCA to do, given that they in turn rely on water
        delivery from the AIS, and there are few mechanisms to hold the AIS accountable if it fails to deliver
        water. This would suggest that the AIS’s limited accountability prevents the WCAs from mobilizing
        the resources needed to recover costs and pay for canal operation, maintenance, and repairs.

139.	   The Hokim instructs local government and AIS officials to ensure that the water allocation schedule
        to the WCAs delivers sufficient and timely amounts of water to the state-mandated crops. WCA
        members interviewed in all case study sites—except those in Surkhandarya and Tashkent Oblasts—
        claimed that the WCA water supply schedule almost entirely focuses on meeting the production
        quota of these state-mandated crops. Overall, the AIS and Hokimiyat have an interest in making
        sure WCAs are able to maintain the irrigation system, deliver sufficient water to farmers to (mainly)
        cultivate cotton and wheat, and prevent or settle disputes among farmers. Farmers stated they
        supported the interference of the AIS when the WCA is weak, as it helps them meet the state
        production quota.

140.	   The strong involvement of the AIS in local water management planning and monitoring, especially
        when the WCA is weak, is related to the Hokim’s role in making sure local cotton and wheat
        production quotas are met. As mentioned, in areas where the WCA is weak and its staff are not
        respected by farmers (such as in the sampled WCAs in Namangan and Jizzakh), the AIS and other
        government organizations intervene and more or less take over WCA management. However, given
        the continued weak performance of these WCAs and farmers’ low satisfaction with water delivery,

                                                     63
        this “interference” seems to do little to improve the overall management of irrigation water as a
        common-pool resource. It also risks undermining design principles 4 and 5, which suggest that those
        that monitor resource use and sanction rule violators should be accountable to resource users.


141.	   In contrast, in areas with strong WCAs (such as the sampled WCAs in Navoi, Surkhandarya,
        Syrdaryo, and Tashkent Oblasts), farmers suggested there is no need for the AIS and/or Vodhoz to
        intervene. Their WCA was said to be able to handle all water management issues and sometimes
        negotiate all issues directly with BAIS. Farmers in the selected WCA in Tashkent Oblast, for example,
        claimed that the AIS can be abolished and that the WCA can work directly with the BAIS.


142.	   A good practice was found in Kuwa District, where the AIS meets with all WCA directors in the
        district once every ten days to discuss current issues with water delivery, maintenance activities
        (including hashars), new regulations, and required documentation, among other issues. Respondents
        regarded this as a good practice, as it provides opportunities for WCA directors to learn from each
        other. Relevant experiences and practices by WCAs outside Kuwa District are sometimes also
        discussed for how they can be applied to their own area.


WCA monitoring and accountability

143.	   In the WCAs that function relatively well, the WCA administration has a strong informal influence
        on farmers’ water-use behavior and plays an important role in getting farmers to honor the water-
        use agreements they have signed with the WCA. For example, in the sampled WCA in Akhangaran
        District in Tashkent Oblast, farmers have a committee called beshyuzbashi. WCA members elect the
        most respected farmers to sit on this committee, who then monitor the water consumption of all
        farmers in the area. They also help settle disputes among farmers, and help farmers complain to
        the WCA administration about not receiving sufficient water. The selected WCA in Denov District
        in Surkhandarya has a similar committee. In the case study WCA in Akaltyn District in Syrdaryo, the
        head of the WCA meets daily with members of the WCA during the irrigation season. All farmers
        typically attend these meetings. Discussion topics include whether everybody has used water
        according to the schedule, problems with water supply, and plans for the following day.


144.	   In one WCA (Kuwa urta buz anori WCA in Kuwa District, Fergana Oblast) water delivery contracts
        with members explicitly include “force majeure” conditions, stating the factors that are outside
        the WCA’s control (such as droughts, electricity supply interruptions, AIS pump breakdowns, and
        so on). This was said to decrease tension between the WCA and water consumers. Water is fairly
        scarce in this WCA, and returns to irrigation water can be high given the prominence of horticultural
        crops.


145.	   It is unclear whether WCAs are allowed to sanction farmers or other water consumers that violate
        the irrigation schedule or make excessive use of water, such as through fines. WCAs not being able
        to apply sanctions would undermine the design principle that those who violate operational rules
        are sanctioned by users or by officials accountable to users. An exemption to this practice, again, is
        the Kuwa urta buz anori WCA in Kuwa District, Fergana Oblast. Here, farmers’ water use is strictly
        monitored by the WCA, and, if they violate the rules, it is claimed that the WCA can stop supplying
        water to their farm for a period of time. The eight mirobs who control the water supply to farm plots
        keep a journal where farmers have to sign for the water received. There is even a special journal for
        tomorka owners where they can write complaints to the WCA.

146.	   Finding qualified mirobs is a particular challenge for many WCAs. Poor technical skills make staffing
        mirobs difficult in places such as Goybu WCA in Urgench District, Khorezm, and Chodak WCA in Pap
        District, Namangan. It is difficult to find enough young and qualified specialists willing to work in
        rural areas. To do this challenging job, mirobs are low paid (Soum 200,000–400,000 per month) and

                                                    64
        often paid late. They have to travel long distances, be in the field at night, and have technical and
        social skills. Some WCAs rely on young people who lack social skills, which can exacerbate water
        conflicts.

147.	   Many respondents indicated the need to install meters and controlling devices to monitor water
        use. This came up, for example, in the sampled WCAs in Khorezm, Samarkand, and Denov,
        Surkhandarya. WCA staff claimed these devices can help resolve water consumption conflicts
        between farmers. They can also enable the WCA to verify precisely how much water was received
        from the AIS during the season. If this amount was less than what was agreed, the WCA should at
        least in theory be able to complain to the AIS and hold it accountable, or negotiate for an increase
        in supply. Picture 11 shows a tertiary canal intake (without metering device).

        Picture 11. Tertiary canal intake in Politemit-BKh WCA, Kattakurgan District, Samarkand




Conflict resolution
148.	   Irrigation water shortages were said to have a range of serious consequences, including: (i) tension
        and conflicts between farmers and the WCA (such as in the sampled WCAs in Jizzakh and Navoi),
        between farmers and dehkans/tomorka owners, and/or between farmers; (ii) farmers refusing to
        pay ISFs (such as in the sampled WCAs in Namangan and Jizzakh); (iii) farmers losing their land-use
        rights if they are unable to meet the state quota; and (iv) migration of farmers to other regions of
        Uzbekistan or abroad (such as in Namangan).

149.	   As mentioned, conflicts can arise if dehkans and tomorka owners frequently make unplanned
        water withdrawals from irrigation canals, which causes water shortages for private farmers
        further down the canal. In some WCAs, this has led to conflict between farmers and the dehkans/
        tomorka owners and between farmers and the WCA administration. The WCA does not have any
        power or legal way to impose penalties on dehkans or tomorka owners, as they are not members of
        the WCA. This was the case in the Navoi and Namangan WCAs.

150.	   If there are disputes among farmers over irrigation water, they are solved through discussion
        meetings or settled personally by the WCA head. This approach works particularly well in those
        WCAs where the head enjoys the respect of the local community (such as in the sampled WCAs in
        Navoi and Samarkand).

151.	   A number of WCAs have informal well-functioning conflict-resolution mechanisms. These include
        informal committees made up of respected community members and experienced farmers. In the
        case of conflict regarding water use between different users, these committees try to mediate a
        solution. In some WCAs, the most respected farmers have established a special committee that
        deals with all water disputes among farmers. In the event of a water supply problem, farmers

                                                    65
        forward a complaint to the committee, which helps negotiate the issue with the WCA. This is a
        relevant example of Ostrom’s sixth design principle, which states that water users and their officials
        should have “rapid access to low-cost local arenas to resolve conflicts among users or between
        users and officials” (Cox, Arnold, and Tomás, 2010).

152.	   As mentioned, some respondents (for example, in Surkhandarya and Jizzakh) claimed that if there
        are no water meters, it is very difficult for the WCA to know the actual amount of water that
        was supplied to a farmer. Similarly, it makes it hard to determine what amount of water the WCA
        actually received from the AIS, and to enforce water delivery contracts and solve problems around
        perceived shortages.

153.	   In conclusion, the AIS’s lack of accountability makes it hard for WCAs to deliver good services, and
        undermines its ability to raise irrigation fees. Also, while it is helpful in the short term for the AIS to
        “take over” the management of weaker WCAs, in the medium term it damages the WCA’s authority
        and capacity to solve their own conflicts. It also undermines the sustainable management of the
        irrigation canal water as a common-pool resource. The inability of the WCA to sanction its members
        when they break water-use rules and regulations has a similar effect.

154.	   However, there are number of informal practices that promote effective monitoring and improve
        the accountability of the AIS and the WCA. Some WCAs—especially the better-performing ones—
        have found mechanisms to monitor water use and water consumers, and hold the WCA to account
        through a committee of respected farmers. Other WCAs hold daily meetings with members of the
        WCA during the irrigation season. In some of the case study areas, the AIS meets with WCA directors
        on a regular basis (once every ten days), possibly ensuring some informal way to prevent disputes
        over water delivery. As mentioned by respondents, installing meters and controlling devices to track
        water use would go a long way toward improving monitoring and accountability for irrigation water.

6. Design principles 3, 7, and 8: Users can modify rules and have
the right to devise their own institutions; these are nested in a
larger resource system
155.	   In the previous chapter we looked at design conditions 4 and 5 for the management of common-
        pool resources, which are about resource use and user monitoring and accountability. We assessed
        how these differ across WCAs and why. In this chapter we review design principles 3 and 7, which
        concern the need for common-pool irrigation water users to be able to modify rules and devise
        their own institutions. We also review design principle 8, which looks at cross-scale cooperation
        and vertical linkages between the local irrigation water management institutions and the larger
        irrigation resource management system.

WCA decision-making structures
156.	   In each case study site, the WCA administration reports to a General Assembly that consists of
        farmers and WCA staff, but the meeting is also attended by officials of the AIS, BAIS, Vodhoz,
        VAC, and by Hokimiyat and mahalla leaders. In principle, the General Assembly oversees the WCA
        staff and its director. The agenda can include the election of the WCA head, board members, and
        sometimes the appointment of other key staff members. Also up for discussion are the budget
        and irrigation fees for the coming year as well as planning maintenance activities for the irrigation
        system. In one of the selected Kuwa WCAs, for example, the WCA presents a report about its
        activities, and WCA staff and water consumers can pose questions to Hokimiyat and AIS officials.

157.	   At the start of each growing season, each WCA administration drafts a budget for their upcoming
        expenditures to ‘run’ the WCA which is discussed during the general assembly. This budget includes
        staff salaries, office costs, other costs (electricity, fuel) for operating the irrigation and drainage
        system, and taxes. Then during the general meeting farmers discuss and vote on the proposed
        budget. In principle, members can propose adjustments and the final budget and the level of the
        irrigation service fee are decided through majority vote. As we have seen, the fee varies among
        WCAs. Also it was said to be up to WCA members to decide whether they want pay one single fee
        per ha for all crops or whether they would like the fee to differ between crop types.

158.	   How frequently General Assembly meetings are held varies across WCAs. In our sample, the
        number of meetings in 2013 varied from no meetings in the poorly performing WCA in Dustlik
        District in Jizzakh, to 20 meetings in the high-performing WCA in Kyzyltep District in Navoi, with
        meetings typically taking place 2–6 times a year.

159.	   In addition to the General Assembly, all WCAs have a supervisory board of farmer and community
        representatives that oversee the WCA director. The WCAs appear to benefit from the hands-on
        monitoring and day-to-day problem solving these board members provide. This is particularly so
        in the high-performing WCAs. However, the regulation issued by the Ministry of Justice in 2013
        weakens the oversight role of this board and gives more power to the WCA director.

Government involvement
160.	   In WCAs where farmers were not satisfied with the quality of water management, they feel
        helpless about the situation. They do not regard the WCA as “their” organization but rather as
        an additional government entity. In particular, in the selected WCA in Pap District, Namangan,
        many farmers are frustrated by poor water management and the WCA’s inability to solve problems.
        Farmers at the tail end of the canal in this WCA receive insufficient amounts of water, and many
        struggle to meet the production quotas for cotton and wheat. Many refuse to pay their irrigation
        fees. In the poorly performing WCAs, both the WCA administration and farmers see no other solution
        but to have the government take over the financing of the WCA’s operations and the maintenance
        of the irrigation system.


                                                     67
161.	   Many respondents in the low-performing WCAs claim that their WCA is too weak to solve the
        issues that arise; they suggest significantly involving the AIS and Vodhoz in water management
        at the local level instead. In the WCA in Pap, Namangan, for example, the Hokimiyat temporarily
        appointed a WCA director, as WCA members appeared unable to identify one to help them solve
        their water management problems. In low-performing WCAs, trust among farmers—and between
        farmers and the WCA—tends to be low. Here, farmers are uncertain about the timing and the
        amount of water they will receive, especially those at the end of the canal. They are constantly
        stressed about meeting the quota, losing their land, and being unable to make at least some profit.
        Farmer incomes tend to be low. Also, there are more opportunities to “cheat” and take more water
        than allocated, which further erodes trust.

162.	   Findings suggest that inclusive governance arrangements can significantly increase farmers’
        sense of community. For example, in the sampled WCA in Denov District in Surkhandarya, WCA
        management has involved farmers, dehkans, and tomorka owners in operating and maintaining
        the irrigation and drainage system. Farmers provide their equipment to the WCA free of charge;
        the WCA only pays for the fuel. Farmers maintain the parts of the irrigation system that are located
        on their land, and dehkans and tomorka owners maintain the irrigation infrastructure that runs
        through their fields. The fees and water are fairly distributed. This WCA is fully responsible for all
        matters related to water management. The AIS and the Hokimiyat are minimally involved in water
        management in the area.

163.	   In many cases, the Hokimiyat, AIS, or VAC provides free office space for the WCA administration,
        either in the Hokimiyat building or in the building of the rural administration. In other instances,
        donors provided support to establish WUAs. While government support to the WCAs is of course
        helpful, it also risks integrating them too closely into the government structure, which undermines
        their accountability to users.

164.	   In well-managed WCAs, farmers and the WCA administration help each other to maintain the
        irrigation system. Farmers may provide the WCA with machinery and pay for fuel, spare parts, and
        labor when the WCA repairs interfarm canals. On the other hand, the WCA may help farmers repair
        on-farm canals, purchase fuel, or help farmers who lack equipment borrow what they need from
        the AIS or the Hokimiyat. To this end, the sampled WCA in Denov District, Surkhandarya, has a fund
        for emergencies (see Box 7).

Box 7. Emergency fund of the WCA in Denov District, Surkhandarya

In case of an emergency with the irrigation system—such as a canal breakdown—this WCA emergency fund
allows the WCA to address the issue without involving government bodies. The fund currently consists
of Soum 7.5 million. If a WCA has its own machinery—as do the case study WCAs in Tashkent Oblast,
Surkhandarya Oblast, and Kuwa district —it can more quickly repair interfarm canals. In addition, the WCA
can lend the equipment to farmers to repair on-farm canals; in return, farmers can help the WCA take care
of the machines by paying for repairs.

165.	   In poorly functioning WCAs (such as the one Pap District, Namangan), the WCA is less involved in
        repairing interfarm canals and helping farmers maintain on-farm canals. Farmers of this WCA claim
        that their WCA does not have the machinery or resources to maintain the irrigation system. Instead,
        the AIS and the Hokimiyat help farmers do this, for example, by providing machinery or materials. In
        this WCA, despite the low productivity and low income, farmers do their best to maintain on-farm
        canals, but receive no help from the WCA.

166.	   In seven out of ten case studies, WCAs members thought the WCA administration represented
        their interests, and regarded the WCA as “their” organization. The seven case studies included
        the selected WCAs in Akhangaran (Tashkent Oblast), Navoi, Samarkand, Syrdaryo, Surkhandarya
        oblasts, and Kuwa district (both WCAs). Farmers here felt they were involved in the WCA’s decision-
        making process. Officials of these WCAs are to some extent able to negotiate irrigation regulations
        with government bodies, providing some flexibility to their implementation.
                                                    68
167.	   In the well-performing WCAs, farmers and staff claimed to be driven by a “shared vision,” and the
        most experienced and resourceful farmers sometimes help others with advice, machinery, and
        even small loans. Also, the WCA receives enough water to irrigate the main crops of all farmers;
        because water is less scarce, there is less need to “cheat.” This is the case in the selected WCAs in
        Surkhandarya, Syrdaryo, Navoi, and Tashkent Oblast. Here there is a common understanding that
        “everybody should meet the production quota” or that “all parts of the irrigation system should be
        well maintained.” This encourages farmers to work together and motivates well-off farmers to help
        others.

168.	   The drive to produce state-mandated crops creates a common vision and goal for stakeholders,
        farmers, and local irrigation bureaucrats alike. This joint sense of purpose, combined with strong
        incentives for local government officials to ensure farmers meet the production quotas, strengthens
        the overall commitment to the timely delivery of irrigation to cotton and wheat crops. WCAs are not
        allowed to fail, and the state will interfere if they collapse.

169.	   Nonstate institutions such as the WCA can to some extent make independent water allocation
        decisions, but only within the overall framework of the state’s agricultural policy. The state’s strong
        presence—even at local levels—ensures that the entire irrigation and drainage system is geared
        toward the production of state-mandated crops, and almost all water allocation decisions made
        by the WCAs serve these crops’ production. This makes the WCA and its members dependent on
        government directives, removing incentives to innovate and use more effective water management
        arrangements. Moreover, because of the relatively low profitability of the state-mandated crops,
        there are not enough resources to adequately operate and maintain the irrigation and drainage
        network.

170.	   Respondents named two barriers to women’s inclusion in decision-making processes regarding
        water management. First, few women have the necessary technical qualifications, such as
        hydroengineering or irrigation. Second, to hold a management position in a WCA or to be a farmer
        requires being in the field at night. It also involves traveling some distance every day (30–50 km).
        Few women can be at the field at night by themselves and not that many have driver’s licenses.

171.	   WCA members have the right to organize, meet, and make decisions around how they allocate
        water, manage operations, and conduct maintenance. They can decide on operational aspects,
        set the irrigation fee, and determine the irrigation schedule. A range of informal institutions for
        managing and maintaining canals, and for dispute resolution, have emerged in some of the better-
        functioning WCAs. In many, for example, farmers and smallholders make their own maintenance
        arrangements off the WCA’s books, mainly to avoid paying labor tax. This is particularly common for
        farmers that have their own machines. While this flexibility certainly has advantages in the short
        term, over time this could undermine the role and viability of the WCA in its current form.

172.	   All decision making by WCA members has to remain within the overall state agricultural policy
        of giving priority to state-mandated crops. These use most of the irrigation water, which removes
        opportunities for farmers to innovate and allocate water to more lucrative crops. Dehkans and
        tomorka owners can only indirectly influence water allocation decisions, and whether their right
        to organize is recognized depends on the quality of the interaction between the dehkans, tomorka
        owners, the VAC, and the WCA.
7. Conclusions and recommendations
173.	   This final chapter presents conclusions and proposes a set of policy recommendations that would
        help institute the design principles to manage irrigation water as a common-pool resource. We also
        present a first draft of a diagnostic tool that that can be used at the local level to assess whether it
        is likely that the design principles are met and what can be done to make sure that they are.

Conclusions
174.	   Overall, farmers claimed that the management of local irrigation water has much improved
        since WUAs/WCAs were established. These organizations appear to have played a role in bringing
        structure to the chaos that surrounded the local management of irrigation canal water after the
        shirkats were abandoned.

175.	   Farmers identified a number of characteristics of well-functioning local water management
        institutions. These include: water is allocated in a timely and fair manner; operation and
        maintenance is well planned; good relationships are enjoyed with the government irrigation
        management system; conflicts among WCA members are solved internally; farmers are involved in
        decision-making processes; farmers trust each other; everyone takes care of irrigation system; and
        the WCA has a financial buffer for emergency repairs.

176.	   In the eyes of stakeholders, a WCA’s performance depends on three conditions. First, the
        proportion of the WCA area that depends on electrical pumps should be low, especially if the supply
        of electricity is unreliable. Second, growing conditions should be suitable for the crops the WCA
        farmers have been assigned to grow by the state. If this is not the case, yields will remain low, which
        will lead to low profits for farmers, limited resources, and few incentives to improve local water
        management. Third, the WCA director should have high-quality leadership skills that enable him or
        her to build trust among users and the WCA; strengthen social capital; and establish good relations
        with farmers, officials, and all water consumers, including smallholders.

177.	   Our data suggest that the presence of these characteristics and conditions is highly variable
        across WCAs in Uzbekistan. Many WCAs are deeply in debt due to low irrigation fees, high salaries,
        and substantial operational costs. In some poorly functioning WCAs, farmers are demoralized and
        lack a reliable supply of irrigation canal water for their crops. They look to the local government to
        solve their problems. In other WCAs, however, farmers are satisfied with how their WCA functions,
        and feel involved in decision-making processes. Interestingly, overall water availability (the amount
        available to the WCA) has an ambiguous influence on the quality of water management and farmer
        satisfaction. Even in WCAs where overall water is scarce, farmer satisfaction with irrigation water
        management can be high.

178.	   Relatedly, the Ostrom design principles for the management of irrigation water as a common-pool
        resource are met in some WCAs, but not others. For example, the needs of dehkans and tomorka
        owners are not always included in the local management arrangements for irrigation water, which
        can interrupt the water supply to all users. A number of factors influence whether their needs are
        addressed: (i) if separate canal intakes exist for the irrigation needs of dehkans and tomorka owners;
        (ii) if the WCA has signed contracts with the VAC to supply irrigation water to dehkans and tomorka
        owners; (iii) if the VAC office is not too far from the WCA office (less than 10 km) to foster interaction
        between them; and (v) whether mirobs have been appointed for dehkans and tomorka owners.

179.	   In situations where many male dehkans have migrated, their wives are left behind to take care
        of irrigation needs. The current practice in which dehkans tend to receive their irrigation water at
        night has put these women in a difficult position for several reasons, one of which involves their
        need to care for their family. They also feel unsafe at night and are often unable to travel the far
        distances that can be required.

                                                      70
180.	   In all of the WCAs we studied, irrigation fees are lowest for the crop that uses the most irrigation
        water—cotton, the main state-mandated crop. This undermines the second Ostrom design
        principle. However, there are substantial differences in cotton irrigation fees across WCAs. They
        tend to be the lowest in the poor-performing WCAs, where farmers have a low level of satisfaction
        with irrigation services. This would suggest that farmers are prepared and able to pay higher fees—
        also for cotton and wheat cultivation—when irrigation service conditions improve. Those that grow
        cotton obtain much lower returns per unit of water used than wheat and horticultural crops when
        cotton yields are low (2 tons/ha). This implies that when growing conditions for cotton are poor
        there are enormous economic inefficiencies in using irrigation water to grow these crops anyway.

181.	   WCAs are only willing to substantially raise irrigation fees (to better recover operation and
        maintenance costs) if they can hold the AIS more accountable for the amount of water they
        have agreed to deliver (given weather conditions in upstream areas). The AIS’s current limited
        accountability to the WCAs puts them in a difficult position vis-à-vis their members and makes it
        hard for them to be accountable for delivering irrigation canal water to farmers and other water
        consumers.

182.	   The compulsory planting of cotton and wheat (even in areas less suitable for their cultivation)
        combined with low state purchase prices undermines farmers’ ability to generate sufficient
        resources to pay for local operation and maintenance, either through their own initiatives or
        through the irrigation fees they pay to the WCAs. Those WCAs that manage to make sufficient
        amounts of water available for the profitable secondary crops perform better and are better able
        to recover operation and maintenance costs. They also tend to be the ones that charge the highest
        irrigation fees for these secondary crops.

183.	   The AIS’s involvement in managing “weaker” WCAs (those that are unable to adequately manage
        their irrigation canal water in the medium term) undermines “ownership” and the sense of
        responsibility water users have for the management of canal water, and makes them dependent on
        the state. WCAs lack the ability to sanction farmers or other water consumers—only the AIS can do
        this, which also undermines one of the design principles for reducing uncertainty and promoting
        trust for the sustainable management of common-pool irrigation water.

184.	   There are number of good practices that promote effective monitoring and improve the
        accountability of the AIS and the WCA. These include establishing a committee of respected
        farmers to solve conflicts, having daily meetings with members of the WCA during the irrigation
        season, and having the AIS meet with WCA directors on a regular basis.

185.	   The current lack of meters and controlling devices to monitor water use makes it difficult to monitor
        irrigation water and establish accountability relationships between suppliers andconsumers.

186.	   In many WCAs, farmers and smallholders make their own maintenance arrangements off the
        books of the WCA to avoid paying labor tax. This is especially true of farmers that have their own
        machines. This could undermine the role and viability of collective action through the WCA in its
        current form.

187.	   Even if irrigation canal water consumers in principle are able to devise their own institutions,
        meet, and make decisions, this design principle is undermined by the nationally enforced policy
        to make it mandatory to grow wheat and cotton. Currently, WCA rules can only be changed if they
        remain within the overall framework of this state policy.

188.	   Dehkans and tomorka owners can only indirectly influence water allocation decisions, and
        whether their right organize is recognized depends on the quality of the interaction between the
        dehkans, tomorka owners, the VAC, and the WCA.



                                                    71
Recommendations
189.	   The findings enable us to arrive at a number of recommendations for improving the local
        management of common-pool irrigation water in Uzbekistan. These are presented below along
        three categories: institutions, policies, and investment.

Recommendations for institutions

190.	   Clarify the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders in the management of local irrigation water
        in order to strengthen operational functioning of the WCAs. This includes the AIS, WCA staff,
        WCA members, other water consumers and local government officials of other organisations. The
        clarification could be provided through a new Water Law/ Code (see below).

191.	   Involve dehkans (especially women) more structurally in decision making that pertains to water
        allocation scheduling, and arrange for them to have canal water intakes. More awareness raising
        among them of how they should more actively engage with decision making and providing beter
        support services to make that happen is important. As dehkans and tomorka owners are important
        consumers of the irrigation water that is managed by the WCAs, their water needs must be better
        addressed, and their involvement in decision making that pertains to water allocation schedules
        must be more structural. The VAC does not currently seem consistently able to adequately manage
        this.

192.	   Clarify in the Water Law/ Code whether WCAs are allowed to sanction water consumers that
        break the rules. If WCA members establish rules and regulations for allocating irrigation water to
        all consumers, it is important that the WCA, under certain circumstances, be able to sanction water
        consumers that break those rules. This is an important condition for operating the irrigation system
        as a common-pool resource.

193.	   Strengthen the provision of support services to the WCAs and promote learning across them,
        using successful WCAs as schools and training sites. Many WCAs are in need of support services
        that better enable them to fulfill their role and better recover costs. Many of them confront similar
        challenges, but some appear better able to address them than others. There are significant learning
        opportunities to be had by exchanging experiences across WCAs, and in allowing poorly performing
        WCAs to learn from successful ones. Ultimately, such WCA-to-WCA learning could also be done
        across different countries in the region

194.	   Encourage and empower the WCA board. The WCA board plays an important role in supervising
        WCA authorities, giving advice, overseeing its overall functioning, and solving conflicts. It is important
        that its role be further strengthened and not undermined by new government regulations.

195.	   Better track the irrigation system’s performance through administrative data collection or sample
        surveys that feature some of the questions in the diagnostic tool. In order to help policy makers
        understand whether water allocation systems are working and whether the BAIS, AIS, and WCA
        are adequately performing their functions, it is important that the WCA’s performance is more
        systematically monitored. In addition, sample surveys could be conducted that systematically collect
        data on water users’ satisfaction with the current irrigation system. Such feedback to policy makers
        and service providers is critical for addressing shortcomings in a timely manner.

Recommendations for policies

196.	   Adopt a new water law/water code and take legal measures that provide for a better financing
        aspects of WCA operations. These legal changes should better provide for the WCAs’ financial and
        operational sustainability and provide a stronger accountability mechanism for their governance
        structure. The water code should provide a strong legal basis for the supervisory board of farmer
        and community representatives to oversee the WCA director. This study suggests that WCAs benefit
        from the hands-on monitoring and day-to-day problem solving these board members provide. The

                                                      72
        water code should also provide a legal basis for a more contractual relationship between the AIS
        and the WCA, with clear monitorable agreements on water delivery. It should also arrange for a
        stronger, more structural, and direct role for dehkans and tomorka owners in decisions pertaining
        to water allocation, More broadly, the new water code should clarify the roles and responsibilities
        of all stakeholders in the management of irrigation water.

197.	   Bring the water allocation policy in line with the land-use liberalization policy. While the
        government has indicated its interest in allowing farmers to grow the crops that they prefer—usually
        horticultural crops—the water allocation policy at the local level often prevents the allocation
        of adequate irrigation water to these lucrative secondary crops. These also provide much higher
        returns per volume of water used, leading to more economically efficient water use.

198.	   Lower the labor tax so WCAs can generate more resources for O&M. A lower labor tax will improve
        WCAs’ functioning by enabling them to more systematically contract laborers for maintenance
        work; farmers currently hire such laborers informally. This will make it possible for WCAs to better
        plan and implement canal repair and maintenance work.

Recommendations for investment

199.	   Improve the water delivery contracts between AIS and WCA and install water meters at the level
        of the WCA canal intake. Contracts that the AIS signs for the amount of water to be delivered to
        the WCA, and the amount actually delivered, need to be better monitored. The AIS need to be held
        accountable for the volumes of water it actually delivers to the WCA (given weather conditions in
        upstream areas). Meters at the level of the WCAs’ water intake will enable these amounts to be
        more accurately measured. This would allow WCAs to provide more reliable irrigation services to its
        members and will open opportunities to raise irrigation fees and improve cost recovery.

200.	   Upgrade outdated irrigation pumps. Many WCAs and farmers depend on irrigation water that enters
        the canals through electric pumps, or they use pumps themselves. For a reliable and predictable
        supply of local irrigation canal water, it is important that outdated irrigation pumps that are owned
        and/or managed by the AIS (and possibly the WCAs) be replaced with modern ones. However, this
        requires a reliable supply of electricity to all areas in Uzbekistan, and requires a financing model to
        be found that enables pumping stations to recover their costs.

Diagnostic tool
201.	   Using the findings from this study and following from the recommendations, we designed a
        diagnostic tool that can be used to assess whether, in a particular WCA and the corresponding AIS,
        it is likely that the design principles for sustainable management of common-pool irrigation water
        are being met. This tool then helps assess the extent to which conditions for well-functioning local
        governance arrangements to manage irrigation canal water are present. It can also be used to design
        priority interventions to improve local water management to make sure it reduces uncertainty,
        builds trust, is more sustainable, reflects local conditions, and includes all water consumers.

202.	   The tool consists of a set of questions that apply to a local management unit of irrigation canal
        water, such as a WCA. These questions are based on each of the Ostrom design principles for the
        sustainable management of irrigation water as a common-pool resource.

Well-defined boundaries

        1)	      Is there an institutional mechanism that enables the needs of dehkans and tomorka
                 owners to be incorporated into decision making about the WCA’s annual irrigation plan?
        2)	      Do WCAs have a contract with the VAC to deliver irrigation water to smallholders? Is the
                 VAC office more than 10 km away from the WCA office?

                                                     73
         3)	      Is there a concrete delivery schedule that specifies how much and when irrigation canal
                  water will be provided to dehkans and tomorka owners?
         4)	      Are there separate canal intake structures for dehkans and tomorka owners?
         5)	      Are there mirobs who deal specifically with the needs of dehkans and tomorka owners?
         6)	      Do dehkans and tomorka owners pay for the irrigation water that they use, and do those
                  that use more also pay more?

Congruence between the benefits and costs of irrigation water use

         7)	      Are there farmers growing state-mandated crops (cotton/wheat) and is the land suitable
                  for this? Are yields of these crops in the area typically lower than 2 tons per ha?
         8)	      Are the irrigation fees higher for the crops that provide higher returns per volume of water
                  (for example, highly profitable secondary crops)?
         9)	      Are secondary crops included in the water delivery schedule?
         10)	     Are irrigation fees paid in full and on time? Is the proportion of the budget that is executed
                  larger than 80 percent of the proposed budget?
         11)	     Is the proportion of the area that relies on pumps for irrigation water larger than 50
                  percent, and do the pumps operate at least 80 percent of the time during the growing
                  season?
         12)	     Do farmers that rely on their own pumps for irrigation pay lower fees?
         13)	     Do farmers and smallholders at the tail end of the canal receive at least 90 percent of the
                  water as those whose fields are located at the beginning of the canal?
         14)	     Do female dehkans and tomorka owners whose husband is absent have to irrigate their
                  land, mostly at night?

Those who monitor canal water use and canal water users are accountable to these users

         15)	     Is the proportion of water the AIS agreed to deliver to the WCA actually measured,
                  monitored, and delivered?
         16)	     Does the AIS rely on irrigation pumps and are these in adequate working condition?
         17)	     Does the AIS interfere in the WCA’s local water management decisions?
         18)	     Does the WCA director meet with WCA farmers to discuss water management issues at
                  least once a month?
         19)	     Does the AIS meet with WCA directors to discuss water management issues at least once
                  a month?
         20)	     Does the WCA have a committee of respected farmers that meets to discuss water
                  management issues?
         21)	     Do water delivery contracts between the WCA and its members include “force majeure”
                  conditions?
         22)	     Are WCA members able to sanction those who violate operational rules, or can only the
                  AIS do that?
         23)	     Does the WCA have sufficient mirobs and are they sufficiently qualified?

Users can modify rules and have the right to devise their own institutions, which are part of a larger
resource management system

         24)	     Does the General Assembly of the WCA meet at least once per year?
         25)	     Is there an active supervisory board?
         26)	     Are dehkans and tomorka owners involved in discussions around water management?
         27)	     Do the AIS and the Hokimiyat leave the WCA to make its own water management decisions?
         28)	     Does the WCA have an emergency fund with which to, for example, address canal
                  breakdowns?
         29)	     Does the WCA have an agreed-upon vision statement?
         30)	     To what extent is the director a respected member of the community?

203.	    The tool has been applied to each of the case study sites to assess the extent to which they meet
         the conditions for reducing uncertainty and building trust for sustainably managing common-pool
         irrigation canal water. For most of the questions, a score is given to each WCA, where 1 indicates
         “yes” and 0 indicates “no.” For some of the questions the score is determined as explained in the
         second column of Table 12b. The total score represents the extent to which the WCA meets the
         Ostrom design principles for local management of irrigation canal water. We have used the data
         collected for this study to conduct a first test of the draft diagnostic tool. Note that data are not
         available for all questions for all WCA case studies.

204.	    Available data suggest that the overall score varies significantly across the ten case studies (see
         Table 12a and Table 12b). There is a reasonably strong correlation between the overall score for
         each of the case study WCAs based on the draft diagnostic tool and the overall WCA performance
         scores as assessed earlier in the report. This could suggest that meeting the Ostrom design principles
         is related to overall performance of the case study WCAs. Highest scores are obtained by the case
         study WCAs in Navoi, Surkhandarya, and the two selected WCAs in Fergana Oblast. Three of these
         four WCAs were also regarded as high performing in our earlier assessment. Only Kuwa urta buz
         anori WCA in Fergana Oblast has a high score for the diagnostic tool and only a medium score for
         overall performance. This is mainly related to a relatively good score for module 1 on well-defined
         boundaries of this WCA. The two WCAs with the highest scores for the diagnostic tool are both also
         high performing according to the earlier assessment (see Table 4). They score particularly well for
         the design principles regarding “well-defined boundaries” and “congruence between the benefits
         and costs of irrigation water use.”

205.	    Among the three WCAs with the lowest scores for the diagnostic tool, two have a low score
         and one has a medium score according the earlier performance assessment of the case study
         WCAs (see Table 4). The two lowest-scoring WCAs that also have the lowest performance score
         particularly low for “well-defined boundaries” and for “congruence between the benefits and costs
         of irrigation water use.” Further fine-tuning and testing of the diagnostic tool is needed before it can
         be fully applied in the field.

Rolling out the assessment method to other Central Asian countries
206.	   This country study served as the pilot to test the approach and methodology before rolling it
        out to other Central Asian countries. Countries in this region share the same history where after
        the dismantling of state-dominated institutions that served communal farming methods under the
        Soviet Union, an institutional vacuum existed for the local management of irrigation canal water.
        Countries subsequently experimented with different institutional arrangements for local irrigation
        canal water management.

207.	   There is therefore an opportunity for cross-country learning on what has worked best under the
        circumstances that exist in Central Asia and why. The draft diagnostic tool can help with this learning
        process. It enables an assessment of the conditions that are important for reducing uncertainty and
        building trust among irrigation users as well as with government providers that are essential for the
        sustainable management of local irrigation canal water management. The diagnostic tool also helps
        to subsequently track these conditions. However there is a need to further test and fine-tune the
        diagnostic tool in each of the Central Asian countries to make sure the specific institutional situation
        in each of the countries is reflected in the questions that make up the tool, while keeping the nature
        of the questions the same to enable cross-country comparison.

Appendix 2. Description of each research site
Introduction to Case Study 1. Goybu WCA, Urgench District, Khorezm Oblast. This WCA has about 100
km of canals that irrigate about 1,500 ha for 43 members (see Table 2 and Map A2.1). Seventy percent of
the area depends on pump irrigation, making it the WCA in our sample with the highest dependency on
electric water pumps. There are four pumps on the WCA’s balance sheet, four pumps on the AIS’s, and 35
on farmers’ balance sheets. Most farmers have a pump and incur electricity expenses, and have to buy and
maintain the pumps. If a WCA’s pump is broken, farmers provide the WCA with spare parts and cover the
labor costs of the repair. The WCA has no electricity payment debts. However, it has a salary debt (Soum
3.3 million). There were said to be frequent electricity outages that affect water availability. The head of
the WCA has established good working relations with farmers, officials, and VAC/mahalla leaders. Members
of the WCA are generally satisfied with the services; they are motivated to pay the irrigation service fee
on time and to keep common parts of the irrigation system in good shape. The WCA has an office with the
necessary office equipment. The WCA plays an important role in resolving conflicts among farmers. The
plots of dehkans and tomorka owners use water from interfarm and on-farm canals without paying. There
are no contracts between the WCA and VAC/mahalla who represent the dehkans and tomorka owners.

Introduction to Case Study 2. Politemit-BKh WCA, Kattakurgan District, Samarkand Oblast. This is the
largest WCA in our sample. It has 202 members and almost 1,100 km of canals that irrigate about 23,000 ha
(see Table 1 and Map A2.2). There is only one WCA in all of Kattakurgan district and all farmers are members
of the WCA. Before 2010, there used to be four WUAs, but all of them were merged into one WCA. One-
third of the area is served by pump irrigation. The director of this WCA is respected by both farmers and
local authorities. He spends a lot of time in the field working with farmers and advising them. The WCA
office is located in the same building as the hokimiyat. The WCA has a well-furnished office and is equipped
with at least three computers, a printer, a scanner, and a copy machine. Water availability is satisfactory for
state-mandated crops, but less so for secondary crops. The WCA area is located far from the main canal and
from April to May there is a seasonal drop in water availability in the main canal, which particularly affects
the secondary crops, as priority is given to the state-mandated crops. The plots of dehkans and tomorka
owners are located nearer to the main canal than farmers’ land, and are irrigated using water from the WCA
irrigation system, taking water from the canals whenever they can. They are not WCA members and do not
pay for the water.

Introduction to Case Study 3. Suvchi Mehnat-Rohat WCA, Kyzeyltep District, Navoi Oblast. This WCA has
15 members and covers about 1,000 ha (See Table 1 and Map A2.3). Farmers conveyed that usually there is
enough water both for main and secondary crops, but there are water supply shortages due to droughts or
unlimited water consumption by dehkans and tomorka owners. The WCA has a proper office and functioning
computers. The WCA has no debt and farmers pay their irrigation fees on time. Farmers claimed they are
keen to work together to manage water resources. They have heard that water management is worse in
other WCAs and are proud that theirs functions well. The WCA’s director is well educated and well off, and
respected by farmers and members of the local community. Dehkans and tomorka owners take water from
the WCA canals whenever they can. They do not pay and believe it is a private farmer’s responsibility to
clean and maintain canals. Some tomorkas are located between the main canal and the farmers’ fields.
Their unscheduled withdrawals from the WCA interfarm canals cause frequent conflicts between farmers
and the WCA administration. However, the WCA has no legal way to limit their consumption. There are no
canal intakes to the land of dehkans and tomorka owners.

Introduction to Case Study 4. Chodak WCA, Pap District, Namangan Oblast. This is one of the smaller WCAs
in our sample with 113 km of canals and ten members (Table 1 and Map A2.4). It is located in hilly terrain.
Water is delivered to the WCA by two pump stations operated by the AIS. It was said there are frequent
shortages in electricity supply, and the stations are often out of order. The AIS has no resources with which
to install new equipment. The pump stations were built in the 1950s, and are now so old that spare parts are
no longer available on the market. This forces the AIS to use parts from other equipment, which does not
last long. Farmers interviewed for this study claimed there are constant problems with water supply to the
fields, resulting in low agricultural yields. The soil tends to be poor, not very suitable for cotton and wheat
cultivation, and soil salinity was said to be high. Only half of the land in the area is suitable for farming, and
landslides often occur. Some farmers have not been able to meet their quota of state-mandated crops and
either gave up or had to give up their land. Farmers do not want to pay for water since they claim the WCA
does not deliver enough to them. Farmers have no interest in investing in the joint management of water.
Many of them claimed the WCA administration has poor management skills. The WCA head and most of
the WCA staff have less than secondary education. They were said to have poor record-keeping skills and do
not engage in long-term planning. Dehkans and tomorka owners use water from a mountain river. Dehkans
also use wells and drip irrigation technology. Some claimed that in this WCA it is much preferable to be a
dehkan, as you can more easily choose the most suitable crops for the situation and you have less land to
manage than a private farmer.

Introduction to Case Study 5. Hazarbag-Denov Sakhovati WCA, Denov District, Surkhandarya Oblast. This
WCA is among the larger ones in our sample, with 84 members and an area of about 4,000 ha (see Table 1
and Map A2.5). Nearly all land (96 percent) is served through gravity irrigation. Farmers claimed to all get
enough water, irrespective of where their plot is located. There is a strict schedule, and everybody follows
it. The head of the WCA is well respected by the members. He has completed higher education and has
extensive experience in agriculture. He advises farmers on cultivation and water management matters.
Even staff from the hokimiyat come to him for advice. (He believes that farmers should not be given land
to cultivate before they have undergone agricultural training.) The WCA has a proper office and good
equipment, including computers. Farmers pay their irrigation fees on time. The WCA has no debt. Unlike
other ones, this WCA employs two accountants: one to work with farmers and one to work specifically with
dehkans. The WCA employs five mirobs who take care of water in the area. Dehkans and tomorka owners
are included in the water distribution schedule and receive water accordingly in sufficient amounts. There
are separate canal off-takes for dehkan/tomorka owners’ land. It allows the WCA to deliver water to their
land according to a certain schedule and to control what is supplied. The WCA has a contract with the
VAC and mahalla offices. The head of the VAC and mahalla leaders represent dehkans/tomorka owners at
the WCA meetings. If there are any shortages in supply, dehkans/tomorka owners complain to the VAC or
mahalla office. Dehkans and tomorka owners pay the irrigation fee to mahalla offices or to the VAC. The
tariff is Soum 150 per 0.01 ha. Then, mahalla offices and the VAC transfer the money to the WCA. If dehkans
or tomorka owners do not have cash, they can pay by debit card at the bank.

Introduction to Case Study 6. Haet Boshi WCA, Dustlik District, Jizzakh Oblast. This WCA has 115 km of
canal, which is small relative to the total size of the irrigated area (about 4,000 ha; see Table 1 and Map
A2.6). Dependency on pump irrigation is high (50 percent) due to the somewhat hilly terrain. There are
frequent electricity outages that interrupt the irrigation pumps. Farmers have trouble paying electricity bills.
There are two pumps on the balance sheet of the WCA, one of which was broken when the field research
took place. Farmers own another 12 pumps and pay for their electricity themselves. Soil salinity is high. The
WCA head has only ten years of schooling and was said to have limited planning skills. He often relies on
the better-trained and more experienced accountant. The WCA has only one room for an office situated
in the hokimiyat building. There is no computer. All documents are stored at the accountant’s house. The
WCA employs eight people, and only two of them have educational qualifications above secondary school.
Half of the farmers do not pay for water. The WCA has significant debt and has not paid any salary to its
employees for months. The head of WCA has asked the hokimiyat for help in convinving farmers to pay. The
interests of dehkans and tomorka owners are represented in the WCA through the VAC. They are supplied
with water according to a schedule. They claimed to pay for water to the VAC head but it is not clear how
these payments appear on the WCA books.

Introduction to Case Study 7. Mustakil Dier WCA, Akaltyn District, Syrdaryo Oblast. This WCA has 44
members and a total irrigated area of about 2,500 ha. Total canal length is 216 km (see Table 1 and Map
A2.7). Only 15 percent is pump irrigated. The WCA head is relatively young but has a good education and
strong managing skills. He has established good relations with the AIS and all the farmers, and knows how
to promote cooperation among members. His team is well qualified. The accountant, agronomist, and land
surveyor have higher education. The WCA has a one-room office that is well furnished and large enough to
hold meetings with farmers. Overall, farmers claim water is sufficiently availabile for their state-mandated
crops, but less than satisfactory for lucrative secondary crops. The mission statement of the sampled WCA
in Syrdaryo says that it aims to “help all farmers meet the state quota.” Farmers share this mission and
claim they work well with the WCA administration. Despite the fact that irrigation fees are low, a significant
number of farmers pay late. The main reason is that farmers are only able to pay once they receive their
harvest payments from the government, and farmers say they receive these late. However, farmers also
use their own funds to maintain the irrigation system (both on their own plots and in the common canals).
Some also provide the WCA with machines for free. In return the WCA keeps the irrigation fees low. The
WCA director claimed that a major part of dehkans and tomorka owners’ land is located outside the WCA.
They do not receive water from the WCA and do not pay an irrigation fee.

Introduction to Case Study 8. Alisher Navoiy WCA, Akhangaran District, Tashkent Oblast. This WCA covers
an irrigated area of about 2,200 ha and has 37 members. The total length of the canal is only 25 km and
one-fifth of the area is pump irrigated (see Table 1 and Map A2.8). It is the only WCA in our sample that
does not grow any cotton. The head of the WCA is well qualified and knows how to solve operational
problems, as well as who to turn to for help. He has experience working with international organizations.
There are not many problems with water supply to farmers. The WCA has a decent office equipped with
computers. However, fee payment is low and the WCA is fairly indebted. Farmers have to pay the irrigation
fees by bank transfer, and only pay when they have money in their accounts, which depends on when they
receive payments from the government for the state-mandated crop. A second reason may be that water
is easily available in the raion, so farmers’ dependence on WCA management is relatively low; this might
affect their motivation to pay the fee. Dehkans and tomorka owners receive water from the WCA according
to a schedule, and there are separate off-takes to their land. The WCA has a contract with the VAC. The
head of the VAC represents dehkans/tomorka owners at the WCA meetings, and if there are any water
supply shortages, dehkans/tomorka owners complain to the VAC. Tomorka owners and dehkans pay the
irrigation fee to the VAC; the VAC provides receipts and transfers the money to the WCA. The fee is Soum
15,000–20,000 per 1 ha.

Introduction to Case Study 9. Kuwa urta buz anori WCA, Kuwa District, Fergana Oblast. This WCA has 135
members and the total irrigated area is about 1,481 ha. The majority of farmers grow horticultural crops; 80
percent of the land is devoted to these, and the remainder to cotton and wheat. The WCA is located at the
Kyrgyz border, and water availability is low. The WCA depends heavily (70 percent) on pump irrigation. Water
availability is affected by frequent electricity shortages. However, despite this, all respondents thought that
the WCA manages to distribute water fairly among all water consumers, including to dehkans and tomorka
owners. Highly qualified mirobs were said to distribute efficiently. The distribution schedule is strictly kept
and everybody follows it. If farmers are unable to meet the quota due to to water supply shortages, the
WCA helps prepare official documents to prove that low water availability was the reason, so that there
are no penalties for farmers. The WCA received machines from the former shirkat, such as a tractor and
a crane. The machinery is well maintained and still used to clean canals. The WCA director is female, has
higher education, and is well respected by water consumers, directors of other WCAs in the raion, and the
raion administration. The WCA recently installed meters on interfarm canals in this WCA with the help of a
donor, SDC, which also held seminars and training.

The largest part of the area (about 1,100 ha) is irrigated by pumps. During the last five years, water availability
has declined, for a number of reasons. During the spring and summer, when farmers need water the most,
there are 4–5 power outages per day and the WCA can use pumps only around 10 hours per day. During
shortages, farmers that grow wheat and cotton receive water first (80 percent of the water is allocated to
these farmers), and other farmers and dehkans later. Frequent power interruptions cause pumps to break
down. Also, water to the WCA area is delivered by a large government-owned pumping station built in
1978, which needs to be replaced. Last year it was broken for 45 days during the vegetation period. Water
consumers claimed the WCA represents farmers well in negotiations with the AIS and hokimiyat. The WCA,
for example, has contacted the hokimiyat multiple times to complain about power interruptions, but were
told these are outside the local government’s control. The hokimiyat promised a new pump station would
be installed in 2016. Dehkans and tomorka owners pay the irrigation fee (Soum 62,000 per ha per year) to
the VAC and mahalla offices, and then the fee is transferred to the WCA. Dehkans and tomorka owners are
included in the irrigation schedule.

Introduction to Case Study 10. Qodirjon Azimonov WCA, Kuwa District, Fergana Oblast. This WCA has 50
members; 24 grow wheat and cotton, 10 grow horticultural crops; there are also 15 mahalla and 1 VAC. The
total irrigated area is 3,406 ha. There is enough water for main crops, horticultural crops, and secondary
crops. All irrigation is by gravity. Recently the WCA installed meters on interfarm canals in this WCA with
the help of a donor, SDC, which also held seminars and trainings). The WCA has a good office (a separate
one-floor building) with all the necessary office equipment. The WCA charges farmers that grow wheat/
cotton and secondary crops Soum 25,000 per ha per year, and horticultural farmers Soum 45,000 per ha per
year. The WCA director and farmers explained the difference is due to the fact that horticultural farmers get
higher income and spend less on labor.

The WCA director has secondary vocational education (irrigation), and has worked in the current position
for the last four years. Interviewed farmers said that previously, they had a WCA director whom they did
not trust. They all went to the supervisory board and complained, and elected a new director. Participants
believe that they have the power to choose who will run the WCA. Dehkans and tomorka owners pay the
irrigation fee to the VAC and mahalla offices; the fee is then transferred to the WCA. Dehkans and tomorka
owners are included in the irrigation schedule. According to the WCA head the fee is Soum 200 per 0.01 ha
per year.

Appendix 3. Methodology review and lessons learned
Data used for this study were largely gathered through ten case studies. This method was chosen because
it enabled the team to assess the phenomenon of local irrigation water management within its real-life
context. Where the boundaries between the phenomenon of local water management and the context
within which irrigation water is allocated and used are not clearly evident, case study research can offer a
better understanding of this complex issue and add much to what is already known from previous research.

This assessment was the first of a broader regional assessment, and Uzbekistan served as a pilot to test
the methodology and determine whether it is suitable for achieving the study’s objectives. It is therefore
appropriate to review how the method performed and what has been learned.

Overall, the approach generated a wealth of information from a range of contexts and situations, and covered
many different stakeholders. Despite the sensitivity of the topic, the method provided us with detailed insight
into many different aspects of the local management of irrigation water. The methodology also provided
many clear ideas regarding what factors cause the Ostrom design principles to be better met in some WCAs
than in others. However, there were also shortcomings, which are summarized below, together with lessons
learned and what we will do differently when this research is repeated in a following round.

1. Ensure a balanced sample. We did not have a comprehensive sampling frame of WCAs from which to choose
the case study WCAs. Instead, we used lists of WCAs available at the oblast and raion levels. Characteristics
of these WCAs were gathered through informal conversations with local government officials. However, this
information was probably insufficient to ensure the sampled WCAs comprised a balanced spectrum of high-
and low-performing WCAs, or of WCAs with a large and small proportion of areas under horticultural crops,
or of high and low overall water availability. In an attempt to correct this, the team had to expand the sample
to include WCAs where horticulture plays an important role and where overall, water is relatively scarce.

Lesson learned: It would have been better to put more effort into assessing where water is generally scarce
and where it is relatively abundant; choose sample areas from both groups; and then select WCAs from
among these. Subsequently, we should have conducted a quick survey of WCAs in selected areas to gather
detailed characteristics of the WCAs and then chosen the case studies from among these, making sure a
balanced range of characteristics were covered.

2. Cover all stakeholders. The list of stakeholders to be covered needed to be continuously adapted. For
example, as evidence came in from the first few case studies, it became apparent that the presence of dehkans
and tomorka owners within the WCA irrigation system was an important factor for local water management.
Yet this group of stakeholders was not included in our initial interview lists. Similarly, the head or other
members of the WCA board were not interviewed in all WCAs, as their importance became only clear after
we had started data collection.

Lesson learned: During the pilot test, the team should have drawn up a list of all water users and all “players”
in a WCA and then use this information to design the lists of people to invite to participate in the study.

3. Use researchers instead of facilitators. Case study research requires a thorough understanding of the
rationale behind the research, the reasons why it is conducted, and its objectives. It implies more than
facilitating discussions and conducting in-depth interviews with stakeholders. Intense efforts are needed to
probe, triangulate findings, and cross-check all information that is gathered with other information. It involves
taking the initiative to solve any remaining “puzzles” and covering all outstanding issues. We discovered that
the data collection team was not always sufficiently prepared for this approach. Once this was realized, a
junior international researcher was hired to provide hands-on support for data collection in the field.

Lesson learned: Case study research requires the continuous field presence of a well-trained social scientist
who can guide and supervise the data collection team and design follow-up strategies in the field to clarify
any issues that come up. This is essential to ensure that every effort is made to obtain the information needed

                                                       97
to thoroughly understand the local situation around irrigation water management. To this end, an irrigation
specialist should possibly be added to the research team.

4. Use more participatory data collection tools and spend more time at each case study site. The data
collection team was given a high degree of freedom regarding how to collect information in the field. On
average, three days were spent at each of case study site. This appeared to be insufficient. Numerous
interviews and small group discussions were held with a range of stakeholders. While this generated much
valuable information, a more structured data collection that includes more exercises with participants, and
that makes use of visual tools such as maps, ranking, and scoring of issues and problems, would have added
depth to the gathered data. This would have required longer stays in the field by the data collection team.

Lesson learned: Case study research would have benefited from more structured data collection, using pre-
prepared sets of visual exercises, making more use of maps, pictures, and transects to gather data, and
conducting group field visits that promoted stakeholders’ active participation in the case study area. A longer
stay in the field (up to five days) would be necessary to make this possible. After each case study it is a good
idea to discuss findings with the team to allow moderators and interviewers involved in data analysis to share
observations that might not be reflected in interview transcripts.

5. Obtain more and better technical data. It appeared difficult to obtain reliable statistics on planned and
actual water provided to the WCA and to farmers and other water users. Similarly, hard information on crop
production, prices, and crop water use were not available, making it difficult to understand incentives and
assess economic inefficiencies in local water use.

Lesson learned: It is important to gather technical background data from each of the case study WCAs that
includes water use and crop production economics.

6. Expand the sample. Given the diversity of situations in which irrigation water is locally managed, and the
many factors at play, ten case studies appeared to not always be sufficient to draw conclusions.

Lesson learned: Depending on the variability in circumstances in which local irrigation water management
takes place, expand the sample to 12–15 case studies.
