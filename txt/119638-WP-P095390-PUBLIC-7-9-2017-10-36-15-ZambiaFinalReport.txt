This report is a result of many efforts. I would like to thank in particular Thea Hilhorst (The World Bank,
Washington) and Sue Mbaya (LGAF Africa Secretariat, Nairobi) for their unflinching support during the
entire process of LGAF. Many thanks also to the TAG members for the valuable review of the
background reports.

I would also like to thank my assistant Elias Mwambela (Department of Geomatic Engineering,
University of Zambia) for the logistic and administrative support rendered during the course of the
assignment. Emmanuel Tembo (Department of Geomatic Engineering, University of Zambia) joined
our two man team in March 2016, and equally his input has been valuable. To the expert
investigators1, kudos for the patriotic work rendered. I say patriotic because the rewards were not
congruent with the amount of work they did.

Executive summary

Introduction

The LGAF process is an important ingredient in the land governance of the country as it reveals the
strengths and weaknesses in the Zambian land governance system in light of international best
practice. At the same, it identifies the key areas for intervention. These will be inputs in the design of
measures that will be used to reform the land governance system, for instance, the current
consultation process for reviewing the draft land policy. The design stage may generate new policy,
legislation, or new technology.

Contextual background

Zambia currently has a total population of 13.1 million (2010) people rising from about 5.7 million in
1980. About 58.5% live in rural areas and are dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods. The
economy is highly dependent on copper mining industry which accounts for 95% of export earnings.
Zambia is a multi-party state whose supreme law is the constitution which has been amended a
number of times with the latest amendment in 2016. The amended constitution continues to
guarantee land rights and introduces the establishment of the land commission. Further, the
constitution devolves administrative power to local governments. Although there are several policies
related to land, currently Zambia does not have a specific policy on Land. It has been grappling with
drafting the Land Policy for almost three decades. The draft land policy is under public consultation.
In addition there are several pieces of legislation that affect land, the main one being the Lands Act of
1995. To fill the gaps of the Lands Act a Customary Lands Bill is being drafted.

Tenure system

Zambia has a dual tenure system consisting of leasehold (Statutory) and customary tenure. This duality
has persisted since the colonial times. The term of leasehold is limited to a maximum of 99 years.
Other terms of leases include 14 year leases which are provisional, a 30 year leases for resettlement
schemes and a 30 year occupancy licences for housing improvement areas and 10 year land records
which are issued by local authorities. An important form of land holding is land that is reserved for
public use e.g. forests and national parks. This category overlaps leaseholds and customary areas. In
addition to leasehold and customary tenure there is also the unrecognised/ de-facto tenure which
actually constitutes large portion in and around urban areas e.g. in Lusaka it is estimated that over
60% of holdings are informal. It is estimated that 90% of the rural population subsist on customary
tenure.

Institutional arrangements

There are several institutions which play various roles in land governance some of which overlap. The
main institution dealing with land is the MLNREP. The ministry deals with general administration of
land including allocation, surveying and registration. Other key players include the Ministry of
Agriculture, MLGH, the Vice President’s office and Ministry of Tourism and Arts and Ministry of Chiefs
and Traditional Affairs. Chiefs play an important role in the administration of customary land. There
are 4 paramount chiefs, 8 senior chiefs and 240 chiefs country wide.

Substantive findings

Good practices

The preliminary assessment found a number of good practices in the Zambian Land governance
system with regard to international best practices and these include:
 The formal recognition of tenure rights in rural areas (individuals and groups) as specified under
    the Zambian Constitution and Lands Act;
 Possibility of regularising of urban informal settlements as provided by the new Urban and
    Regional Planning Act of 2015. This aspect was also included in the repealed Housing (Statutory
    and Improvement Areas) Act;
 The prompt transfer of acquired land to destined use and timely compensation of owners;
 Collection of most agreed payments from private parties on the lease of public lands;
 A one stop shop for investment applications which is housed at the Zambia Development Agency;
 Searchable public land register/cadastre which are easily accessible with published fee schedules
    and contain private encumbrances, restrictions and spatial records; and
 Valuation rolls which are publicly accessible for all taxable properties

Weaknesses/Issues

The identified weaknesses (issues) in the land governance system as compared to international best
practices are summarised below:
 Less than 50% land rights are protected in practice or recorded and mapped (including women’s
    rights);
 The cost of on-demand recording of rights and property transfer exceeds 5% of the property value,
    hence illegal transactions are high;
 Less than 50% of public land is not disposed of through open tender and lack benefit sharing
    information;
 There is no policy for prior land identification for investors and for cross sector coordination on
    land use;
 Non-documentary forms of evidence are almost never used (in statutory areas) to obtain
    recognition of claims to property;
 Different public land registers are not synchronized, linked nor regularly updated;
 The formal court system takes too long to dispose of most land related cases;
 There is no effective mechanism for dealing with institutional overlaps in land related matters

1 Introduction
The question of land governance has eluded many countries across the world. Many have struggled
to find solutions to persistent problems of dealing with indigenous and/or customary tenure,
balancing the goals of equity, efficiency and sustainability in the development and management of
land. The question has been complicated by the contextual nature of land issues and the lack of a
consolidated global assessment framework. Zambia has also gone through various legal and
institutional reforms to try and fix some emanating governance issues. The reforms started just after
independence in 1964. The major ones were the enactment of the Land (Conversion of Titles) Act in
1975 and the Lands Act in 1995. Further, Zambia has grappled with drafting a guiding land policy. It
has been on the cards for over two decades. Part of the challenge for the policy completion has been
in agreeing the content of the Policy between the different interest groups, complicated by the
emerging issue of transfer of public or customary land to private, largely foreign, investors.

In rural and peri-urban areas the challenge has been the protection of customary rights without
creating additional risks for the rights holders. In urban areas, the problem of informal settlements
has persisted for as long as the Country has been independent. Reviews of land ownership suggest
that land ownership is skewed towards the male population (the gender issue). Zambia is land
abundant but the majority of the population still lives on less than a dollar a day. It is a paradox.
Institutions tasked with the mandate of managing land face various technical, institutional and
financial barriers. Formal resolution of land disputes takes overly long. Registers of land information
in public institutions are not synchronised while identification of land for investment is mostly ad hoc.

Land Governance Assessment Framework (LGAF) was developed by The World Bank in conjunction
with its partners to help countries to check land governance status against global good practice using
a common framework. It highlights areas for legal, policy or procedural reform to improve governance
in land administration over time. LGAF allows to assess arrangements in these countries compared to
global good practice along a large number of dimensions, each of which are ranked by stakeholder
panels on a 4-level scale (A to D). These cover key areas of good governance identified in 5 topic areas,
namely:
1.       Recognition and respect for existing rights (legal and institutional framework)
2.       Land Use Planning, Management and Taxation
3.       Management of Public Land
4.       Public Provision of Land Information
5.       Dispute Resolution and Conflict Management

These focus areas are analysed in nine (9) modules or panels, namely (i) land tenure recognition; (ii)
rights to forest and common lands & rural land use regulations; (iii) urban land use, planning, and
development; (iv) public land management; (v) process and economic benefit of transfer of public land
to private use; (vi) public provision of land information; (vii) land valuation and taxation, (viii) dispute
resolution and (xi) review of institutional arrangements and policies. For each module/panel a series
of land governance indicators, each divided into several dimensions, have been selected based on
international experience. For each dimension, pre-coded statements are given for scoring (from best
practice (A) to weak practice D) based on international experience (see the LGAF website for a
manual).

Beyond the substantive content, the LGAF process at the country level aims to be inclusive and
establish a consensus and priority actions on (i) gaps in existing evidence; (ii) areas for regulatory or
institutional change, piloting of new approaches, and interventions to improve land governance on a
broader scale (e.g. by strengthening land rights and improving their enforcement); and (iii) criteria to


                                                     8
assess the effectiveness of these measures. It also aims to put in place a structure and process to
systematically track progress in improving land governance over time.

This report synthesises the nine panel reports into one. Section 1.1 deals with the LGAF
implementation process highlighting the main steps involved. Section 1.2 discusses the methodology
that was followed. The tenure typology and institution mapping is discussed in section 2. Section 0
presents the main findings from the assessment for all the indicators and dimensions.

1.1 Process of Implementation of the LGAF
The country coordinator (CC) oversaw the implementation process supported by one assistant. The
process started in June 2015 after the CC signed the contract with the World Bank and ideally should
have ended in December 2015. It was however extended to June 2016. The process consists of a
number of discrete steps as summarised in (Figure 1 ) (The World Bank, 2013):




                                        Figure 1: Implementation steps


1.2 Methodology and comments
Preparation consisted of reviewing the LGAF definitions, indicators and dimensions, assembling a
team of expert investigators and potential panel members, and compiling the inception report. The
inception report was submitted to the LGAF Africa Secretariat for approval. After approval, the team
of EIs began the process of collecting data, analysing it and then compiling the background reports2.
Background reports were first reviewed by the CC, LGAF Secretariat and finally by the Technical
Advisory Group (TAG) who sent back the comments back to the EIs via the Secretariat.

 Data collection and report compilation took much longer than anticipated to various problems including EIs
not giving the assignment the needed attention due the low fees that were assigned, some members pulling out
and difficulties of accessing data.

The EIs revised the reports after receiving the reactions of the TAG and re-submitted the reports to
the CC who then prepared the panel briefs for each panel topic. The briefs and full background reports
were sent to the respective nine panel participants. Panel discussions were held in the last week of
February and first of week of March 2016. Participants for each panel discussion were drawn from the
private sector, non-governmental organisations, community based groups, local government, national
government and academic institutions. Efforts were made to identify participants who were experts
in their field and or held a senior position within government or working on a related land governance
aspect. A combination of internet searching and professional networking was used to identify the key
people to be selected. The number of participants in each panel session ranged from 5 to 7 persons.
Each session lasted for three hours. Each panel session included an introduction of the LGAF process
and aims of the discussion, review of all the dimension scores and policy recommendations. The
results of the panel discussions were Aide Memoirs compiled by the CC and thereafter distributed to
the respective EIs. The Aide Memoirs comprised the discussions and conclusions of each panel in
terms of scores and policy recommendations. The EIs then revised their respective reports and
submitted to the CC.

The revised background reports were then used to compile the country synthesis report. The synthesis
report was submitted to the Secretariat for review and go-ahead for the national validation workshop.
The participants were again drawn from various sectors based on experience or expertise. The
workshop reviewed all the scores and policy recommendations, and made recommended immediate
future action points. The national was held on 4th May 2016 in Lusaka. The results of the workshop
were used to compile the final country synthesis report which was submitted to the World Bank.

2.1 Context analysis
2.1.1 Socio-economic situation

Zambia has a mixed economy consisting of a rural agricultural sector and a modern urban sector that,
geographically, follows the rail line. Currently, construction sector contributes 14 percent of the gross
domestic product (GDP), agriculture contributes 9 percent of the GDP, manufacturing sector and
mining each contribute 8 percent of the GDP ( (CSO, 2014)). For many years, the modern sector was
dominated by parastatal organisations, while private businesses dominated the construction and
agriculture sectors. Historically, the country’s economy has been based on the copper mining industry,
accounting for 95 percent of annual export earnings and contributing 45 percent of government
revenues during the decade following independence (1965-1975).

After several years of stagnation, the annual average economic growth rose from 2 percent prior to
2002 and reached 6 percent during 2006 - 2010. This is attributed to prudent macroeconomic
management, market liberalisation, privatisation efforts, expansion of investments in the copper
mining industry and related infrastructure, and a steep increase in copper prices ( (MoFNP, 2013)).

According to the Living Conditions Monitoring Survey 2010, 60 percent of Zambians are classified as
poor. In the Zambian context, poverty is defined as lack of access to income, employment
opportunities, and entitlements, including freely determined consumption of goods and services,
shelter, and other basic needs. As of 2010, poverty continued to be more prevalent among rural than
urban residents (78 percent                         Table 1: Demographic characteristics
and 28 percent, respectively) (
(CSO, 2011)).

Table 1 presents selected
demographic indicators from
the 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010
Zambia       Population     and
Housing Censuses. The 2010
census reported a population
of 13.1 million and a population
growth rate of 3 percent per
annum.       The      population
increased steadily from 5.7
million in 1980 to 13.1 million
in 2010. During the 2000-2010
inter-censal period, growth
rates varied by province,
ranging from 2 percent in
Western to 5 percent in Lusaka
( (CSO, 2012)). The population density in Zambia increased from 8 people per square kilometre in 1980
to 17 in 2010. Average density by province in 2010 ranged from a high of 100 people per square
kilometre in Lusaka to a low of six people per square kilometre in North Western. In addition to being
the most densely populated provinces, Lusaka and Copperbelt are also the most urbanised. The rural
population stands at 58.5 percent of the total population.

2.1.2 Legislation

There are various pieces of legislation in Zambia, which have a direct or indirect bearing on land tenure
or land administration in the country. Some new Acts have been introduced and others have been
repealed or amended since 1991. Still others are being drafted e.g. the Customary Land Bill.

Constitution of Zambia 1991
Zambia is a unitary, multi-party state. The Constitution is the supreme law of Zambia. It was enacted
in 1991 to repeal the 1973 constitution. Further amendments were made in 1996 and 2016. Some
important highlights concerned with land matters are contained in the sections dealing with
fundamental rights and freedoms.

Part III, article 16, states that no individual can be compulsorily deprived of any property without
adequate compensation, unless under an Act of Parliament or in such cases as where the acquisition
is for recovery of tax, the land is abandoned, the land is required for exploiting minerals, or for the
implementation of a land policy. Part III, article 17, prohibits the search of property or entry on
premises without the owner’s consent, unless under terms set by the constitution, such as collection
of tax. Part XIII, article 127, allows for continuation of the existence of the Institution of Chief in any
area of Zambia in accordance with the culture, and traditions of the peoples concerned. In addition,
Article 128 of Part XIII allows the Institution of Chief to operate as a corporation and to hold assets or
properties in trust for itself and the peoples concerned.

Special mention should be made of articles 127 and 128. The recognition of the chiefs’ establishments
as institutions, that they should continue in existence according to their traditions, and that they can
hold property in trust for their people, has significance in relation to how customary land should be
administered. Chiefs are already custodians of customary land, and if they should continue in
existence according to their traditions, it means even administration of land should continue to be
based on those same traditions. Since they do already hold land, it can be said that they do
constitutionally hold that land in trust for their people.

Land Policy
The Zambian Government currently does not have a land policy. The last draft policy was made
available in October, 2006. An attempt to put in place a national land policy has been held up for more
than two decades now. A national land policy formulation process was initiated in 1993, and a Draft
Land Administration and Management Policy were issued by the Ministry of Lands. The same remains
in draft form to-date... It is said to be “a working document and not a formal policy document” and
that it “should not be quoted and interpreted as the policy of the Government of Zambia or any other
government ministry or department until it has been finally agreed and adopted” ( (GRZ, 2006:1)).

The draft policy does however provide indications of the direction of government thinking regarding
critical land issues in the country. It states that the vision of the Government is to have an efficient
and effective land administration system that promotes security of tenure, equitable access and
control of land for the sustainable socioeconomic development of the people of Zambia.

National Policy on Environment (NPE)
The National Policy on Environment (NPE) was approved in 2009, with the objective of harmonizing
different sectoral development strategies, rationalize legislation concerning the use and management
of land, and attain an integrated approach to environmentally-sustainable development. The NPE was
designed to create a comprehensive framework for effective natural resource utilization and
environmental conservation. The NPE widely covers issues pertaining to the agricultural sector and
climate change.


                                                    12
Draft National Policy on Climate Change (NPCC)
The draft NPCC falls under The Ministry of Lands, Natural Resources and Environmental Protection. In
April 2012 the first draft of the National Policy on Climate Change was crafted whose vision is a
prosperous climate change-resilient economy by 2030 that will have significantly increased living
standards of the population and reduced its vulnerability to the impacts of climate change. Land use
for agriculture has been well recognized in the NPCC. The NPCC seeks to promote sustainable land-
use management practices through the development and promotion of sustainable agricultural
practices such as conservation agriculture.

National Agriculture Policy (2004-2015)
The overall objective of the current National Agriculture Policy (NAP 2004-2015) is to facilitate and
support the development of a sustainable and competitive agricultural sector that assures food
security at national and household levels and maximizes the sector's contribution to Gross Domestic
Product (GDP). The NAP is currently being revised. The draft or revised NAP 2013 seeks to utilize the
available natural resources in an efficient and more sustainable manner to promote growth of the
agricultural sector. The policy has explicitly included objectives that directly inform on land use issues.
For instance, there is an objective on the promotion of sustainable management and use of natural
resources that has such measures as the: promotion of sustainable land management technologies
(including conservation agriculture, appropriate stock densities); promotion of afforestation,
community woodlots and agro-forestry, among others.

Decentralisation Policy
The Decentralisation Policy of 2002 aims to devolve authority, functions and responsibilities to district
level in order to improve quality of service delivery at the sub-national level, including management
of natural resources. Although the process of decentralization was stagnant for some years it is now
fully supported by the current Patriotic Front government, building on the Sixth National Development
Plan (2011-2015) and the Revised Decentralisation Implementation Plan (2009-2013).

2.1.2.1 Acts related to land registration, surveying and planning

Lands Act (no. 20, 1995)
All land in Zambia is subject to this Act, but no land can be alienated for a term longer than 99 years.
The Act provides for the continuation of leaseholds and leasehold tenure; for the continued vesting
of land in the President and alienation of land by the President; for the statutory recognition and
continuation of customary tenure; and for the conversion of customary tenure into leasehold tenure.
In addition, the Act provides for the establishment of a Lands Tribunal and a Land Development Fund.
The Act describes ‘customary area’ as all land, which until the Act was referred to as Reserves and
Trust land. ‘Land’ means any interest in land whether the land is virgin, bare or has improvements, but
does not include any mining rights as defined under the Mines and Minerals Act. Though all land in
Zambia is vested in the President, the actual alienation is delegated to the Commissioner of Lands.

(a) Administration of Land
The President can alienate land to any Zambian or non-Zambian. A non-Zambian can be granted land
if the person is a permanent resident, an investor, has prior written Presidential consent, or is a
registered company, a charitable organisation, or a registered commercial bank. The President can
also grant land if the non-Zambian is inheriting the land, obtaining land under a lease agreement, or if
he has been granted a concession or right under the National Parks and Wildlife Act. However, the
President cannot alienate any land held under customary tenure without consulting the responsible
chief, affected person, or if the applicant has not obtained prior approval of the chief and the local
authority. The chief is a recognised institution by constitution.


                                                    13
An applicant is required to pay a consideration3 in money and ground rent for land alienated to
him/her, except if land is intended for a public purpose or is being converted by the owner from
customary to leasehold tenure. A person cannot sell, transfer, or assign any land without the prior
consent of the President. Every piece of land in a customary area held under customary tenure
immediately before the commencement of the Act has continued to be so held and recognised. The
recognition of customary tenure, however, does not bring about the registration of ownership rights.
It is just meant for the protection of use and occupancy rights.

A lease can be renewed for a further term of 99 years, if it is not liable to forfeiture, and none of its
conditions has been contravened. If it is not renewed, the lessee is entitled to compensation for the
improvements on the land only. In case of succession, ground rent, covenants, a provision contained
in a lease or any Act of Parliament having reference to the subject matter of the lease remains
attached to the estate being succeeded. Similarly, every condition or right of re-entry, except ground
rent, contained in the lease remains attached to the land regardless of how the lease was severed.
Further, where a lessee breaches a term or condition of covenant, the President may notify the lessee
within three months of his intention to cause a certificate of re-entry to be entered in the register for
the land in question. The certificate may be registered if the lessee fails to justify his cause for the
breach.

It is illegal to occupy vacant land, whether state or customary, without lawful authority and any person
so occupying is liable to eviction. For customary land, this authority may be a chief’s permission since
the chief is a recognised institution by constitution.

Through a statutory instrument, the President sets ground rent, which each lessee should pay. If the
rent is not paid on the date it is due, the lessee is liable to pay a penalty of twenty-five percent of the
rent due. The rent4 is paid annually and the initial amount per year is indicated in the lease document.

(b) Land Development Fund and Tribunal
Neither the Fund nor the Tribunal existed before this Act. The Minister of Lands administers the Fund.
It is intended to fund new land developments. Any district council wishing to develop land in its area
can apply for money from the Fund. The Fund consists of all moneys appropriated through Parliament,
75 % of the consideration paid when the President alienates land, and 50 % of ground rent collected
from all land.

The Tribunal was set up as result of tremendous delays in solving land disputes. Thus, the tribunal has
jurisdiction to inquire into and make amends in any dispute over land, compensation or land rights,
and obligations. Concerning compensation, this statement suggests the role of the Compensation and
Advisory (Land Acquisition) Board has been taken over by the Tribunal. A person aggrieved by the
Tribunal’s decision can appeal to the Supreme Court within 30 days. The Tribunal is on the same level
as the High Court. Its operations started in November 1996. There now exists a new Lands Tribunal
Act enacted in 2010 for the administration of land disputes.

Land Survey Act (CAP 293, 1960)
The Act provides for the Surveyor General (SG) to supervise all surveys, to preserve all survey records,
and to generally administer the provisions of the Act. The Act also provides for the establishment of
the Survey Control Board (SCB), chaired by the SG, to regulate the practice of the survey profession,
to conduct examinations and trial surveys for purposes of licensing surveyors, to maintain a register
of land surveyors, and to hear complaints against land surveyors.

3
  Consideration fee is the fee paid to MLNREP based on the size/value of land being alienated according to the
Lands Act.
4
  The ground rent is paid to central treasury whether land for all types of land

                                                     14
A Government surveyor is allowed to examine survey records lodged for approval with the SG, and
may prepare, certify and issue at request copies of approved diagrams filed with the SG. However, he
is not liable for any defective survey or work done by another land surveyor regardless of whether
such survey or work has been approved or registered. The law does not restrict the obtaining of
licences to professional surveying graduates only. As long as one is above 21 years of age, has more
than five years of practical experience, and has passed the law examination which is offered once or
twice every year depending on the professionals’ demand and the trial surveys set and approved by
the SCB, he can get a licence. However, every land surveyor is responsible for the correctness of all
his/her works to the SG. It is an offence to practise cadastral surveying without a licence.

Lands and Deeds Registry Acts (1914 and 1994)
(a) Registration of documents
Every document purporting to grant, convey, or transfer land or any interest in land, or to be a lease
or an agreement for a lease or permit of occupation for a longer term than one year must be
registered. Similarly, a document purporting to create any charge upon land, whether by mortgage or
otherwise, must be registered. Any document that evidences the satisfaction of any mortgage or
charge, and bills of sale of personal property where the grantor remains in apparent possession must
also be registered. All bills of sale must be registered within three months of their execution, whilst all
other documents must be registered within thirty days, ninety days or one year, if within same district
as the registry, within Zambia or outside Zambia, respectively. If such documents are not registered
within the prescribed time, they become invalid.

Three types of registers are kept; the lands register, the common leasehold register and the
miscellaneous register. The lands register contains documents relating to land other than land that is
on common leasehold. The common leasehold register registers documents relating to strata titles.
Any other document is registered in the miscellaneous register. Any document relating to land that is
lodged for registration must describe the land by reference to a diagram, plan, or description of the
land, quoting the year and the Surveyor General’s number of the plan, diagram, or description. A
diagram means a diagram derived from survey measurements, drawn and approved as per Land
Survey Act. A plan means ‘a plan of a piece of land which has been approved by the SG as sufficiently
detailed, where the SG is satisfied that for the time being an actual survey is impractical’. A description
means a ‘sketch plan of land, showing with reasonable accuracy the position of boundaries of the land
in relation to the position of the adjoining land, approved by the SG…’ The interpretation of the
meaning of plan and description is left to the Surveyor General. The introduction of ‘plans’ and
‘descriptions’ was intended to circumvent cadastral surveys.

Registration does not cure defects in a document. Registration of a document comprises the filing of
the document, or a certified copy, and entry in a register of the names of parties, date of the
document, date of registration, and a brief description of the document. The registers and their
related files are kept separately. Documents are filed consecutively. The registry may be searched and
examined by anyone, and certified copies may be obtained, if required, upon payment of a prescribed
fee.

Bills of sale are based on the provisions of the Bills of Sale Acts, 1878 to 1882, of the United Kingdom.
These together with the Land Transfer Act, 1897, and the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act, 1881,
are too old to be entirely valid today.

(b) Provisional certificate and certificate of title
To register a document for dealing in land for a term longer than fourteen years, one first needs to
have a certificate or provisional certificate of title. The certificate of title, provisional or final, is


                                                    15
conclusive evidence of ownership from the date of registration, and the registered proprietor is
protected against ejection or adverse possession, except in the case of mortgage, fraud, or mistakes
in the certificate such as wrong description of boundary or grant to more than one person. However,
a court may upon good cause, cancel or amend a provisional certificate. To get a provisional certificate
or certificate of title one has to apply for it to the registrar (under the Deeds and Registry section). The
registrar will investigate the title and make advertisements in the Government gazette and one
newspaper, before issuing the certificate. After obtaining the provisional certificate, one has to wait
for six years before applying for the full certificate of title. However, in the case of an original grant of
land, a certificate of title is issued without any provisional certificate.

(c) Transfer and transmission of registered land
A purchaser from a registered proprietor of any estate or interest in land, in respect of which a
certificate of title has been issued, is not required to inquire into the circumstances under which the
proprietor got his estate or interest in land. A bona fide purchaser or mortgagee for valuable
consideration is also not liable for recovery of damages, or possession, or deprivation of land in respect
to which a certificate of title had been issued. This stands regardless of whether his vendor or
mortgagor became a registered proprietor through fraud, error, or a void instrument.

A registered proprietor with a provisional certificate or certificate of title may create various estates
in his land. The Land Transfer Act, 1897, of the United Kingdom, controls transfer of registered land,
in case of a deceased proprietor or carrying through a charge contained in an assent. The power of
sale of property subject to an unredeemed mortgage lays with the mortgagee, as of the Conveyancing
and Law of Property Act, 1881, of the United Kingdom. The mortgagee has the same protection and
remedies as if the mortgage operated as a transfer or lease of the mortgaged estate or interest.
Whenever the mortgage is wholly or partially discharged, it is noted in the register and on the
outstanding instrument of title.

(d) Trust and caveats
Trusts5 cannot be entered in the Lands Register or on a provisional certificate or a certificate of title,
except those that are specially authorised. All trusts declared by deed or instrument may be registered
in the Miscellaneous Register. Any person claiming to be entitled to or to be beneficially interested in
any land or estate by virtue of any unregistered agreement, instrument or transmission may lodge a
caveat with the registrar. The caveat protects the estate or interest in land against any dealing, until
it is removed. Such caveat is notified to the registered proprietor.

Common Leasehold Act (1994)
The Common Leasehold Act was enacted to allow for the registration of “horizontal” rights (strata
title) for high-rise flats and semi-detached buildings. The Act thus provides for the division of land and
buildings into units with separate titles by means of common leasehold schemes. Upon registration of
the scheme, the unit-holders become a corporate body with perpetual succession and a common seal.
Incorporation of the scheme members has the same effect as a contract under seal. Amongst other
things, the body corporate can make by-laws, enforce by-laws, and control and manage the common
property (that which is not part of any one unit). The Act only allows Quantity Surveyors and Architects
to prepare plans. The Surveyor General must approve the plans before registration.

Urban and Regional Planning Act of 2015
The Act aims to provide for development, planning and administration principles, standards and
requirements for urban and regional planning processes and systems; provide for a framework for

5
 Section 74 subsection 2 of the Lands and Deeds Registry Act stipulates that Trusts affecting land may be
declared by any deed or instrument, and such deed or instrument may be registered in the Miscellaneous
Register.

                                                     16
administering and managing urban and regional planning for the Republic; provide for a planning
framework, guidelines, systems and processes for urban and regional planning for the Republic;
establish a democratic, accountable, transparent, participatory and inclusive process for urban and
regional planning that allows for involvement of communities, private sector, interest groups and
other stakeholders in the planning, implementation and operation of human settlement
development; ensure functional efficiency and socioeconomic integration by providing for integration
of activities, uses and facilities; establish procedures for integrated urban and regional planning in a
devolved system of governance so as to ensure multi-sector cooperation, coordination and
involvement of different levels of ministries, provincial administration, local authorities, traditional
leaders and other stakeholders in urban and regional planning; ensure sustainable urban and rural
development by promoting environmental, social and economic sustainability in development
initiatives and controls at all levels of urban and regional planning; ensure uniformity of law and policy
with respect to urban and regional planning; repeal the Town and Country Planning Act, 1962, and
the Housing (Statutory and Improvement Areas) Act, 1975.

The current Act provides for establishing planning authorities, and supervises and controls land use
and the preparation and implementation of development plans. A planning authority is a public body
with delegated authority to undertake town and/or regional planning. A district council may be
appointed as a planning authority. For this purpose, twelve municipalities in Zambia are designated as
planning authorities. These are Chililabombwe, Chingola, Kalulushi, Kitwe, Luanshya, Mufulira, and
Ndola in Copperbelt province; Kabwe in Central; Chipata in Eastern; Kasama in Northern; Lusaka
district in Lusaka; and Livingstone in Southern province. Under this Act, a land user is required to
obtain planning permission before undertaking to develop the land.

2.1.2.2 Additional legislations

Various other statutes exist which control the environment, water abstraction, the use of agricultural
land and thus in one way or the other affect land administration. These include:
 Land Acquisition Act, CAP, 296, 1970, provides for the compulsory acquisition of land by the
   President in the public interest. If such land is not developed, no compensation is given.
 Agricultural Lands Act, CAP 292, 1960, is concerned with the establishment of the Agricultural Lands
   Board. The Board controls dealings in agricultural land and ensures its good management.
 Water Act, CAP 312, 1949, authorises members of the public to abstract certain volumes of water
   for their purposes for a particular period under set conditions. It establishes the Water Board for
   this purpose.
 Land (Perpetual Succession) Act, CAP 288, 1926, provides for incorporation of trustees of an
   association in order to facilitate perpetual succession to land and to incorporate associations that
   lacked capacity to hold land on title.
 National Parks and Wildlife Act controls the allocation of land in national parks for tourism
   purposes.

   Local Government Act. The Local Government Act empowers district councils to administer land
    within their districts and have responsibility for land-use planning, in coordination with the Town
    and Country Planning Department. The district councils, as agents for the Ministry of Lands, Natural
    Resources and Environmental Protection, process applications for leases of state land and evaluate
    requests for the conversion of customary land to state land.
   Zambia Wildlife Act No. 12 of 1998. The Act provides for the establishment of the Zambia Wild life
    Authority to be responsible for all Game Management Areas and National Parks (including water
    catchment areas in these parks) covering approximately 33 percent of the total land area of Zambia.
   Forests Act Cap 199 of 1973. The Act provides for the conservation and protection of forests and
    trees.
   Fisheries Act, Cap 200 of 1974. The Act deals with the control and development of fishing.

                                                   17
   Mines and Minerals Development Act No. 7 of 2008. The Act provides for environmental protection
    during prospecting, mining, decommissioning and abandonment of mines. During mine
    dewatering, the Act provides for best practice of how to treat water from mine operations before
    discharging into the natural environment to avoid pollution and land including farmlands
    degradation in mining areas.

   Zambia Development Agency Act No. 11 of 2006. The Act provides for fostering economic growth
    and development by promoting trade and investment in Zambia through an efficient, effective and
    coordinated private sector led economic development strategy. The Act provides incentives for all
    sectors including agriculture and energy aimed at attracting investments. The ZDA Act provides for
    legal protection and facilitates acquisition and disposition of all property rights such as land,
    buildings and mortgages. Leasehold land, granted under 99-year leases, may revert to government
    if it is ruled to be undeveloped after a certain amount of time (generally five years).
   Environmental Management Act of 2011. In 2011, the Government passed the Environmental
    Management Act, which upgrades the functions of the former Environmental Council of Zambia
    (primarily focused on pollution) to become the Zambia Environmental Management Agency, with
    broader environmental oversight functions. Subsidiary legislation to this Act is the Environmental
    Impact Assessment Regulations that guide the execution of the environmental impact assessment
    studies for projects such as agriculture, aquaculture or irrigation projects that have a likelihood of
    causing environmental damage. It also provides for the development of management plans on how
    to mitigate such envisaged damage to ensure that the project safeguards environmental
    sustainability.

   Disaster Management Act. In April 2010, Zambia adopted a Disaster Management Act, conferring
    the Disaster Management and Mitigation Unit (DMMU) and its national and regional offices the
    mandates to prevent, mitigate and respond to disasters. It also provides for the establishment of a
    Disaster Management Information system responsible for early warning information and inventory
    on related resources, and a National Disaster Relief Trust to fund emergencies. The Act addresses
    disasters induced by climate change such as floods and droughts that have an impact on land
    management, agriculture and food security. The increases in frequencies of floods and droughts
    due to climate change have been noted in the Act.
   National Water Resources Management Act. The Zambian Government has recently adopted a new
    Water Act that promotes participatory management and water resources development in an
    integrated and sustainable manner. The Act provides for an autonomous regulatory body for the
    sector – the Water Resources Management Bureau – which is responsible for water allocation and
    licensing, and for regulation of all waters in Zambia (including international waters and
    groundwater). Given that many of the land use or management projects involve the water sector,
    the legal and institutional framework for water resources management is central to discussions on
    land management and agricultural production in Zambia.

   International agreements. Zambia has signed, ratified and domesticated international agreements
    and implemented national strategies and programmes that contribute to sustainable management
    and development of its land resource. The Ministry of Lands, Natural Resources and Environmental
    Protection (MLNREP) serves as the focal ministry on multilateral land and environmental
    agreements such as the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNFCCD), the
    United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its Kyoto Protocol, the
    Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the Global Environment Facility (GEF), among others. For
    example, Zambia has made major strides towards implementation of the obligations under the
    UNCCD. The country has developed a number of legal and policy frameworks relevant in meeting
    some of the UNCCD obligations and requirements. These include the National Policy on
    Environment, the Environmental Protection and Pollution Control Act (EPPCA), the Energy Policy of


                                                    18
    1994, the Energy Act, the Wildlife Act and policy, the Fisheries Act and policy, the Forest Act and
    policy, the Agricultural policy and many more.

2.2 Tenure typology
Zambia has a dual tenure system comprising on one part statutory or legal tenure and on the other
part customary or indigenous tenure. Statutory tenure is that which is both recognised at law.
Leasehold tenure is mainly practised on state land, which is defined under the Lands Act, No 20 of
1996 as “land which is not situated in a customary area”. The latter is defined, under the same Act, as
“notwithstanding section thirty-two, the area described in the Schedules to the Zambia (State Lands
and Reserves) Orders; 1928 to 1964 and the Zambia (Trust Land) Orders, 1947 to 1964”. The main
form of holding land under this statutory tenure is leasehold. There is no freehold.

2.2.1 Statutory tenure

According to available official figures, 6 percent of the total land area of Zambia (753,000 square
kilometres) is state land. The rest (94%) are “customary areas”. The land, rights and attendant private
and public restrictions are recorded in the public registers (Lands, Common leasehold or
Miscellaneous).

The following are the terms of the leases and related conditions:
 99-year lease with certificate of title is granted based on an approved diagram prepared from a
  survey done by a licensed land surveyor. Due to various problems, including shortage of licensed
  surveyors this is difficult to get.
 14-year lease with provisional certificate based on sketch plan is granted where land has not been
  surveyed. This was intended to offset the delays in the granting of the leases due to lack of surveys.
  It is renewable and, if a survey has been done and the corresponding diagram is approved, it can
  be extended to 99 years.
 30-year lease for Government (re) settlement schemes based on a site plan prepared from
  topographic maps.
 30-year occupancy licences within housing improvement areas in urban areas. The district councils
  hold the land comprised in such areas on leasehold as a block (see Housing (Statutory and
  Improvement Areas) Act). In order to give such licences the district council may subdivide the area.
   10-year Land Record Card. These are issued by local authorities (councils).




2.2.2 Customary tenure




                                                  19
Customary tenure is recognised
at law, however, it is not
recorded or the records that
pertain to it such as maps of
chiefs’ areas are not part of
official registers. Customary
areas are home to the majority
rural Zambian population or
approximately 60 percent going
by the CSO 2010 census.

Though customary tenure is now
legally recognised, through the
Lands Act, there is no further
practical,            beneficial,
consequence to the customary
system. The only consequence is
that the holder of land under
customary tenure cannot forcibly
be removed from his/her land                                Figure 3: Land tenure areas
(Normally they have to negotiate
for a compensation).

However, the holders enjoyed this security to a large measure even before the Act was enacted. In
cases where leasehold has been granted within a customary area, any further land dealings, such as
transfers, exclude customary institutions. It has been argued that the conversion as provided in the
Lands Act does not remove the land in question from customary areas ( (UN-HABITAT, 2012b)). This is
the legal position as may be deduced from Appendix 9 of the Lands Act (Orders in Council 1928 –
1964). This needs clarity from the law as it can lead to conflicts. (van Asperen, 2014), for instance,
points to three potential conflicts that may arise due to overlapping tenure; informal over statutory
tenure arising from emergence of informal settlements within city boundaries, statutory over
customary tenure arising from conversions, and customary over statutory due to counter claims from
traditional and state authorities.

One key aspect of traditional tenure is free access to land by all members of a community. Even junior
members of a family may have their own fields to cultivate, obtained from the family, though they
may not have the rights to dispose of the land outside that family. Generally, there are similarities in
the structure of rights in customary areas, though as noted above there are still variations between
the various tribes in the extent and practise of these rights. Three types of basic rights can be
recognised in customary areas ( (Mvunga, 1980)):
     individual ownership
     concurrent interests, and
     communal interests.


Individual ownership means the landholder has more rights in the land than any other person. The
individual owns the land for as long as he/she wishes. The rights can only be terminated by absolute
transfer, e.g. by way of gift, to another party, by death and abandonment of the land. Where death
occurred, an individual’s rights could be transmitted to an heir. Concurrent interests refer to parallel
interests in the same piece of land. This may occur, for instance, where other persons have access to
wild fruits or, after harvest, can graze animals on another person’s field. The exercise of these interests
does not mean the person in whose field the cattle are grazing ceases to be owner. This is an important


                                                    20
facet of traditional tenure that may be confused with communal tenure. Communal ownership instead
involves the use of certain tracts of land, which are not individually owned ( (Mvunga, 1980)). One’s
entitlement to the exercise of any of the rights is based on membership to the community within
which the land is situated. Therefore, a member is entitled to the use of a well, grazing grounds or
produce of the wild forest.

2.2.3 Public land

According to the Zambian Lands Act, Cap 184, section 4 (2), "public purpose" includes the following:
   a) for the exclusive use of Government or for the general benefit of the people of Zambia;
   b) for or in connection with sanitary improvements of any kind including reclamations;
   c) for or in connection with the laying out of any new township or the extension or improvement
       of any existing township;
   d) for or in connection with aviation;
   e) for the construction of any railway authorised by legislation;
   f) for obtaining control over land contiguous to any railway, road or other public works
       constructed or intended at any time to be constructed by Government;
   g) for obtaining control over land required for or in connection with hydro-electric or other
       electricity generation and supply purposes;
   h) for or in connection with the preservation, conservation, development or control of forest
       produce, fauna, flora, soil, water and other natural resources.

Public land is constituted through Acts of Parliament and published through government gazette
notices, which include the written descriptions of boundaries. Public land can be found on either state
land or customary areas. Most of this land is mapped and includes:
    a) Forest reserves. These are categorised into National and local forests, the former being for
        protection of nature and the latter for production and are managed by the Forest Department
        under MLNREP. According to MTENR (2008), of the total forest land, about 30,751,000
        hectares are located on customary land and 11,824,000 hectares are located on State land.
        Privately owned forests with legal land titles, accounting for 5,283,000 hectares fall under
        State land.
    b) National Parks and Game Management Areas (GMAs). These are now managed by the
        Department of National Parks and Wildlife under the Ministry of Tourism and Arts. No
        exploitation is allowed in National Parks. In GMAs, settlements are allowed and villagers can
        undertake some livelihood activities such farming, though this usually brings about the
        problem of human – animal conflicts.
    c) National monuments. These include natural heritage and cultural conservation sites.
    d) Zambia is a signatory to a number of international conventions and agreements. Through
        these a number of conservation areas have been declared such as the RAMSAR sites (wet
        lands) and Man and Biosphere reserve.

2.2.4 De facto tenure

However, in addition to these two systems, there is another, albeit unrecognised, informal (de facto)
tenure or squatting. This is largely common in and around urban areas or centres of employment. Its
spatial distribution is unknown. In some urban areas such as Lusaka it is estimated that over 60% of
urban land for new development is informal. There are a number of reasons for this informality.
Among them include lack of financial, planning and administrative capacity by local authorities to
develop and implement a pro-poor land delivery system. Moreover, the land delivery system is not
only slow to address the huge demand for land (especially for low cost housing) in cities, but is also
riddled with bureaucratic hurdles. In this regard, the majority poor tend to find easy access to land in
illegal settlements. Further, this situation is compounded by corrupt practices where civic leaders and

                                                  21
other political actors get involved in fraudulent land allocations or sales ( (Chitonge & Mfune, 2015)).
A consequence of this situation is that a large number of urban dwellers tend to lack formal rights
recognition and protection.

2.2.5 Tenure overlaps

Public land6 overlaps both state land and customary areas. In addition, the Lands Act allows conversion
of customary tenure to leasehold. However, the Act is not explicit on the status of the land under the
converted tenure. The Act does not mention of any new inclusions to or exclusions from customary
areas as described in its Schedules. This may suggest that the figures of 6 and 94 % for state land and
customary areas, respectively, still stand today. The map (Error! Reference source not found.) above
hows the distribution of the land types. If the public areas are overlaid with the state land and
customary areas, the picture changes dramatically, especially for customary areas. These overlays
show that there are overlaps in terms of jurisdictions and further implications on reversions. For
instance, does the land for a degazetted national forest on customary land revert to customary status
or remains state land? However, the overlaps do not necessarily entail confusion in the management
of the relevant resources. The issue here is to differentiate management from ownership. These rights
may not vest always in one person or institution. The overlay also shows that if protected and
restricted areas are excluded, the size of customary areas reduce to 58 percent of the total land area
of Zambia (Table 2). Note that water bodies and other protected areas have not been removed from
this figure.

2.3 Institutional framework
Ministry of Lands, Natural Resources and Environmental Protection (MLNREP)
In terms of institutional framework, the MLNREP is the principal ministry responsible for land
administration and for the formulation and coordination of all legislation that is related to land
management in the country. The MLNREP is divided into six departments, four of which deal directly
with matters of land administration, namely (a) the Lands Department, (b) the Lands and Deeds
Department (c) the Survey Department, and (d) Forestry Department. The other two departments are
the Department of Human Resources and the Department of Planning and Information. The MLNREP
also houses several key statutory bodies and departments. There are several specialized agencies and
departments with specific mandates. Because of their specialized mandates, they are best described
as separate key stakeholders. These include the Zambia Environmental Management Agency (ZEMA),
Lands Tribunal and Zambia Forestry College at Mwekera. The functions of these specialized
departments or agencies are highlighted in the sections below.

(a) The Lands Department
The Lands Department is divided into three sections: Land Administration, Legal, and Estates and
Valuation. The Land Administration Section has administrative responsibility for all land matters in the
country in addition to ensuring the proper development of areas planned by the local authorities
under the direction of the Department of Physical Planning in the Ministry of Local Government and
Housing and the Land Husbandry Section of the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives. The
Commissioner of Lands is the head of the Lands Department and administers land throughout the
country through delegated authority from the Republican President.

(b) The Lands and Deeds Department
The principal function of the Lands and Deeds Department is to register ownership and real rights in
and over immoveable property in order to provide security of title; ensure a complete record; provide
easy access to information; ensure speedy registration of all documents lodged; and be cost effective.
As such, the registry keeps records of all land transactions and issues title deeds to all land situated in
state land areas, as well as customary land that is being converted to statutory leasehold.

(c) The Survey Department
The Survey Department is responsible for the provision of accurate land information to the general
public and to specific sectors. The land information is made through the provision of surveys and
mapping services. The department is divided into cadastral, survey and mapping branches. The
Cadastral Services Branch is responsible for the accurate fixation and recording of legal title and
addresses issues of boundary disputes. The Mapping Services Branch deals with services related to
the production and revision of national topographic and specialized mapping. The Survey Services
Department deals with the establishment and maintenance of a reliable national control network for
use in cadastral mapping, engineering and other surveys.

(d) The Forestry Department

                                                    25
The institutional arrangement for managing forests in Zambia falls under the authority of the Forestry
Department of the MLNREP. The Forestry Department has a central office in Lusaka and an office in
each of the 10 provinces and within each of the districts. It has the mandate to manage forest
resources and enforce regulations in state reserves, classified as National Forests and Local Forests,
and on plantations. Whilst the Forestry Department has jurisdiction over forest resources on state
lands, the majority of forest resources are found on customary land, which fall under customary law
and management systems. Here the authority is with the local Chiefs and Village Headmen.

(e) The Environment and Natural Resources Management Department (ENRMD)
The Environment and Natural Resources Management Department (ENRMD) is responsible for the
overall policy formulation on environment, natural resources and pollution control in the Ministry
which is the focal point for all environmental and natural resource management issues in the country.
The Department also co-ordinates, monitors and evaluates the operations of the executive agencies
that have been created to implement policies on behalf of the government.

(f) The Lands Tribunal
The Lands Tribunal is a statutory, administrative body under the Ministry of Lands whose objective is
to arbitrate in disputes arising under the Lands Act.

The Ministry of Finance
The Ministry of Finance (MoF) is responsible for developing the country’s macro-economic framework
and planning of all national public investment programmes, including lands as well as mobilization and
allocation of financial resources. Through provision of financial resources the MoF plays a critical role
in the efficiency of land policy formulation and implementation.

Ministry of Agriculture
Through the Land Husbandry Section, the Ministry of Agriculture is responsible for identifying,
planning, demarcating and recommending land for agricultural purposes, and monitors land use
changes. The ministry plays a crucial role in identifying and opening up suitable land for agricultural
use.

Ministry of Justice
Land holding entails legal procedures that are enshrined in various statutes and covenants. The
Ministry of Justice acts as legal adviser to the Ministry of Lands in the interpretation of land law and
the overall management of land matters as well as the drafting of new laws to enable government
achieve its objectives in land management.

The Ministry of Local Government and Housing and District Councils
The Ministry of Local Government and Housing has the responsibility to coordinate all developmental
activities carried out at District Level and is as such directly involved in the coordination of planning
and implementation of all land management related projects or programmes. District councils, under
the general direction of the Ministry of Local Government and Housing, have the power to control the
development of land in their areas. Councils have the power to deal with state land, in which they act
as agents of the state under the direction of the Commissioner of Lands. As mentioned above, at the
central level, the Commissioner of Lands within the Ministry of Lands exercises authority on behalf of
the President.

Government Valuation Department
Through the Government Valuation Department, the Ministry of Local Government and Housing
advises the Ministry of Lands (Estates and Valuation Section) on property valuation and any other

matters pertaining to real estate management. The department also utilizes property data from the
Lands and Deeds Registry of the Ministry of Lands to prepare valuation records.

Ministry of Commerce, Trade and Industry
The Investment Centre under the Ministry of Commerce, Trade and Industry cooperates with the
Ministry of Lands in identifying suitable land for various developmental projects. The Ministry
facilitates the speedy registration of companies to assist would-be investors acquire land for various

investments; (3)Regularizing their immigration status; (4) Acquiring other licenses required to operate
a business in any particular sector; and (5) Access any other after-care assistance that may be required.

The Ministry of Tourism and Arts
The Ministry of Tourism and Arts is in charge of all natural resources related to wildlife management.
It houses several key statutory bodies and departments. These include the Zambia Wildlife Authority
(ZAWA) and the National Heritage Conservation Commission. Wildlife management are important
aspects which can directly affect land and agriculture production dynamics through issues of human-
wildlife conflicts. The Ministry assists entrepreneurs in the identification of land suitable for tourism
purposes on land in game management areas. The Ministry provides advice to the Ministry of Lands
on the suitability of land for specific purposes such as resource conservation and protection of the
environment. The Zambia Wildlife Authority (ZAWA) under the tourism portfolio gives concessions on
land in areas demarcated as game management areas and national parks. The Authority prepares
development plans with land information produced by the Ministry of Lands and also regulates the
development of tourism enterprises.

The Ministry of Chiefs and Traditional Affairs
The Ministry of Chiefs and Traditional Affairs was set up in 2011 for the purpose of administering and
promoting chief’s affairs, traditional governance systems, conservation and preservation of Zambia’s
heritage, culture and arts. As part of its mandate, the Ministry deals with various land matters or
disputes in various chiefdoms. Customary land is administered by local traditional leaders. The chiefs
and village-level headmen have authority under formal and customary law to oversee customary land
and protect their community’s welfare. The traditional leaders grant occupancy and use-rights,
oversee transfers of land, regulate common-pool resources (opening and closing grazing areas, cutting
of thatch), and adjudicate land disputes. They are often the main point of contact between state
officials, donors, and rural communities ( (Chileshe, 2005); (Brown, 2005))

Office of the Vice-president
Through the Department of Resettlement, the Office of the Vice-President identifies land for re-
settlement particularly for retirees and other urban residents in need of land so that they can own
land on title and have some means of earning a livelihood. To identify suitable areas and have them
designated, planned, demarcated and developed, the office is required to work in close collaboration
with the Ministry of Lands. The Office of the Vice-President also superintends the Disaster
Management and Mitigation Unit (DMMU) which is mandated to implement the 2010 Disaster
Management Policy or Act.

Rural Land Rights
Approximately 7.9 million (60.5%) of Zambian population live in the rural Zambia ( (GRZ, 2010)),
Census of Population and Housing). A large percentage of this population wholly depend on land for
their day to day livelihood by way of farming, fishing or animal husbandry. In Zambia individuals’
rural land tenure rights are recognized by both statutory8 and customary law. The majority of
rural people, however, hold land under customary tenure. Rural people’s right to access, use and
administer such land is well recognized by the Lands Act (1995).

Despite the fact that customary law tends to recognize the rights of customary land holders, in
practice, because the rights are not recorded, individual rights are often open to abuse. For example,
inheritance rules and an ethnic groups’ conceptualization of gender roles tend to disempower
women who make up approximately 50% of the population.

The law i n Zambia allows individuals to hold land under customary tenure with their rights protected
within the limits o f cu sto m a n d traditio n . While cu sto m a ry autho rities hav e bee n
granted the right to administer such land in their chiefdoms, including allowing for conversion to
leasehold, there is no legal instrument that limits the chiefs’ discretionary powers in the
administration of land ( (Mulolwa, et al., 2009); (Gumbo & Mfune, 2013)). For example, existing
guidelines on land alienation merely prescribe procedures to be followed in land alienation and
not how the exercise of discretionary power can be regulated.

The governance of customary land remains a serious concern particularly as the majority of the poor
live in the rural areas under customary land administration. Although the lands Act (1995) has
provided for the recognition of land under customary tenure, there are no laid down procedures or
supporting statutes that protect the customary land rights. It is also observed that due to the lack of
a specific legal framework on customary tenure the chiefs who are the regulators of customary land
has ended up abusing their powers in some parts of the country

  Subsection 2 of Section 7 of the Lands Act of 1995 states that the rights and privileges of any person to hold
land under customary tenure shall be recognised and any such holding under the customary law applicable to
the area in which a person has settled or intends to settle shall not be construed as an infringement of any
provision of this Act or any other law except for a right or obligation which may arise under any other law.

                                                                    29
Urban Land Rights
Approximately 5.1 million (39.5%) of Zambian population live in the Urban Zambia (2010, Census of
Population and Housing). While the rights of leaseholders are well recognized and protected, it is
important to note that the majority of urban dwellers live in municipal areas designated as unplanned
settlements. In Lusaka, which is the most populated city in the country, the percentage of people
living in unplanned settlements is as high as 65% percent (Chitonge & Mfune, 2015). The rights of
individuals in these places are not well protected. While the Housing (Statutory and Improvement
Areas) Act Cap 194 provides for the upgrading and regularization of such settlements, individuals
have only been conferred with transient rights through 30 year occupancy licenses. Moreover, as
(Chitonge & Mfune, 2015) indicate, the uptake of these licenses is low with only 12% of people
obtaining them. The scenario which is cited for Lusaka is similar to all urban areas of Zambia.

It should again be pointed that while the law (Land and Deeds Registry Act Cap 185) provides for
registration of rights on land in planned for settlements, more than 50% of land holders have not had
their rights registered. This is partly due the lengthy and somewhat out of reach cost of registration
of land rights to a good percentage of the population.

Rural Land Rights
The only route to complete individualization of tenure in Zambia, if so desired, is through leasehold9.
Under the Lands Act, Cap 184, individuals holding land under customary tenure can also convert up to
250 hectares of the land to leasehold. In this regard, the law provides opportunities for
individualization of land rights. In practice, however, bureaucratic procedures and an over-centralized
land administrative system are inhibiting rural dwellers opportunities to obtain title deeds for their
land.

9
  Subsection 1 of Section 8 of the Lands Act (1995) stipulates that after the commencement of this Act, any
person who holds land under customary tenure may convert it into a leasehold tenure not exceeding ninety-
nine years on application, in the manner prescribed, by way of- (a) a grant of leasehold by the President; (b) any
other title that the President may grant; (c) any other law.

                                                                   30
As it has been alluded to earlier customary land rights are rarely recorded and mapped by the people
within that customary setup though the law (Lands Act) provides for that. Normally outsiders
(individuals or group of individuals) from the urban areas especially tend to a have it easy to register
their rights on land because of financial capabilities to follow through the process (site plan, consent
from the chief, approval by local council where land falls, surveying, and registration.

Urban Land Rights
Despite the existence of leasehold, most land in urban areas is held informally in unplanned
settlements and therefore not registered. Because so far, most individual land in most unplanned
urban areas (which have far more people than planned areas) remains unsurveyed and recorded.
Somehow again even though land parcels may be surveyed they may not be recorded. This means
that one has not completed the process of registration and the implications of not having interests on
land registered are two sided: The Land owner and the Government. On the side of the land owner,
the implications are, among others, security of tenure is not guaranteed, legal transactions cannot be
effected on this piece of land; while on the side of Government, the implications among others are
the loss of revenue as in fees that come with the registration of rights and the regular revenue of
ground rent, and the difficulty in monitoring or accounting for registered land. This normally arises
from land allocated by both MLNREP and land bought from private owners as in subdivisions. This is
partly because the process of surveying and registration or recording is disjointed and not wholesale.

The non-surveying and recording status of land, in practice, does not deter in any way the conducting
of land transactions though by law any land transaction or dealing has to be registered. But this is only
possible if such land is surveyed and registered. It is a challenge talking about statistics of illegal land
sales since such dealings are not recorded however in practice we see land changing ownership and
from several cases of illegal land allocations before the Lands Tribunal and the High Court (Chitonge
& Mfune, 2015).

Restrictions on Rights
Legal restrictions on land leases include restrictions on the size of customary land that can be
converted to leasehold, duration of lease and restrictions on lease of land by non-Zambians. Lease of
customary land is restricted to 250 hectares and in the absence of survey diagrams for such
conversion; the land survey regulations restrict the lease to 14 years. Further, the Lands Act specifies
the conditions under which non-Zambian individuals and entities may engage in lease transactions.
However, the extent to which illegal transactions occur or whether the restrictions are widely
accepted is not well known. Given the lack of adequate data, this dimension was not scored.

Women and Land Rights
While under leasehold, the law provides for the registration of property rights including women’s
rights, the law does not provide for registration of property rights under customary tenure. This in
turn has a bearing on women who hold land under customary tenure as their rights are not formally
registered. The majority of women that rely on land are located in the rural areas, and here, customary
norms and conventions that underpin the property rights of rural dwellers, including women, are often
unrecorded.

Equality of women’s property rights to those of men is established by both international human rights
instruments and national law. However, in rural areas where land is held under customary tenure,
inheritance rules, patriarchal structures and how women’s gender roles are perceived tend to limit
women’s exercise of property rights (Sitko, 2010). Secondly, intra-household power asymmetries
(where men are viewed as the heads of the family) tend to influence how women’s usufruct rights are
exercised. In this regard, despite the fact that the law establishes equality between men and women


                                                    31
in terms of property rights, the women folk do not enjoy such rights because of the various limitations
to exercising these rights. Example of these restrictions is that in some customs when the husband
dies the widow is not allowed to continue living on a particular piece of land as before because the
land was owned by her late husbands and such rights are not transferable.

Forest and Common lands
In the Zambian context the definition of common lands is restricted to mean grazing lands, grave sites,
village woodlands, river frontages or any other classification reserved for communal use by a group
people in a particular settlement.

Zambia’s forest land is divided into state land, customary land and privately owned land according to
the Forest Act 2015. Forests in the legal context are forests occurring in state reserves, customary land
and privately owned land. There is a serious knowledge gap and a lack of formal recognisation of rights
to such forests by stakeholders due to weak policy and legal framework, inadequate instiutional
capacity and poor funding on one hand to carry out implementaion on the ground and due to lack of
information on the other hand. According to Lands Act Cap 184 of 1995, leasehold titles can be issued
on customary lands but not without taking into account of the customary laws and approval by the
Chief and the relevant council. For example, the management of forests on customary lands have for
a long time been left to the local communities pursuant to the Forest Act of 1973 and 2015 which
identifies forest produce on customary lands conserved for the use and benefit of the inhabitants.
Therefore, there is a distinction between property rights tied to forest produce and those tied to land,
implying that a person may acquire land but not the resources or property on it. For example a
concession license holder can extract the forest produce but is not allowed to use such land for other
purposes such as farming and ecotourism unless land is leased.

The Forest Act of 1973 provided for a centralized management, of common lands and protected forest
areas with government having absolute power over all aspects of common land management. This
Act has now been replaced by the enactment of Forest Act No. 4 of 2015 which clearly defines
responsibilities and roles of various stakeholders and common lands.

Rural group rights
The right to use and benefit from natural resources for groups is enshrined in the national constitution
and are bestowed in both statutory and customary laws as well as the Forest Act of 2015, Fisheries
Act of 2011 and Wild life Act of 2015. However, the right to commercial exploitation of forest
resources by rural groups is subject to permits and licenses issued to an individual or a group by
appropriate government institutions identified in section 3.1.2 and as provided in relevant legislations.
The group also needs to be registered with the Registrar of societies as a corporative of enterprise.

However, ever though the tenure of most groups in rural areas is formally recognized, ways for them
to gain legal representation are not regulated and is a big challenge. For example, in 2006 Joint Forest
Management (JFM) system under statutory Instrument No. 47 of 2006 was piloted through the
Provincial Forestry Action Programme (PFAP) which aimed at testing and generating JFM guidelines.
However only a few Forest reserves and only one (1) customary area piloted the JFM and these faced
some administrative challenges. The Forests Act No.39 of 1973 proved to be a stumbling block on
which the statutory Instrument was developed. This Act did not have provisions on community
participation or benefit /cost sharing schemes, and there was no legislation governing benefits sharing
arising from the use or sell of resources.


Recognition and Protection of Users’ rights to key natural resources
Generally, users’ rights to key natural resources are legally recognized in the available legislation but
the implementation of such rights sometimes may take a long time. The Forest Act of 2015 recognizes
the user rights to key natural resources such as forest products like fruits, mushrooms, medicines, fire
woods, grass for thatching roofs, etc., are not protected but may be major resources like animals and


                                                   33
is supported by other related legislations such as the Fisheries Act, Cap 22 of 2011, Mines and Minerals
Act No.11 of 2015 but these pieces of legislation may not be harmonious. For example the cross-
sectoral nature of water resources management and development, and the need to allocate water
among various competing users require a strong integrated approach supported by equitable
allocation framework and legislative provisions.

Coexistence of Multiple rights over common land and natural resources
Even though there is a possibility of co-existence of multiple rights over common land and natural
resources by law, and respected in practice, mechanisms to resolve disputes are often inadequate or
not there. The complexity of co-existence of multiple rights arises due to the fact the management of
common lands is based on informal rules regarding resource tenure. For example, the use of common
land for subsistence purposes is unregulated with the exception of charcoal production and
commercial fish harvesting which require a license. According to the (IDLO/FAO, 2011), the challlenges
faced by land administrators include illegal settlements (enchroachment), illegal charcoal production,
illegal fishing and illegal mining. The models such as Joint Forest Management (JFM) and (Community
Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) have elements of multiple rights which have not
worked due to lack of adequate policy and legal framework. Multiple rights include but not limited to
collection of herbs, ecotourism, recreation activities, education activities, harvesting of timber and
fuel wood as well as any other benefits. All related laws recognize other resources such as rivers for
fishing, minerals for mining and wild life but do not include a one stop dispute resolution mechanism.
This situation has resulted in conflicts such as granting of a title in a common land without a thorough
consultative process and the chief using his discretion to give rights to individuals on common land.

Multiple rights over the same plot of land and its resources.
Co-existence of rights over is legally possible and respected in practice over the same plot of land but
mechanisms to resolve disputes are often inadequate because these are often dealt with in other
laws. To look at the coexistence of rights there is need to consider three cases:
    a) Customary land: In customary land multiple rights (surface or underground) exists because no
        one has exclusive rights and there are no problems enforcing such rights. It becomes a
        problem when you have people from outside (investors) because they want to have
        exclusively rights to the piece of land.
    b) Public Land: In the case of public land for example the forest reserves, rivers, etc., multiple
        rights can co-exist and normally conflicts rarely arise if they do mechanisms to resolve are
        adequate.
    c) Leasehold: In this case the rights (surface or underground) can co-exist on the same plot by
        law for example if it is the same person with these multiple rights but if these rights are by
        different persons then the law does not support. Also if the lessee uses the land for a
        completely different purpose other than what is provided in the agreement this becomes a
        source of conflict.

In cases where the national benefit outweighs the individual benefit on a piece or pieces of land, the
legislation provides for compensation. For example Mines and Mineral Development Act provides for
compensation if mining activities are started on a piece or pieces of land belonging to other
individuals. Furthermore though legally coexistence of rights is possible one piece of land, permits or
licences will be required to enjoy such rights like harvesting of fish or carry out game ranching or
hunting.

Another case of interest involves mineral exploration. Under the Mines and Mineral Act of 2015 there
a provision for co-existence of surface and underground rights. An holder or the lawful occupier of the
land within the area of exploration license can cultivate land for agriculture, fishing and will have
access to water and grazing areas as long as such activities do not interfere with exploration work.


                                                  34
The nature of disputes which may arise in this case varies greatly and may be handled under other
related laws.

Multiple rights over land and sub-soil resources on the same plot
Multiple rights over land and mining/other sub-soil resources located on the same plot cannot legally
co-exist because mining rights override other land use rights. For example in some forest reserves
where there are minerals, those areas have ceased to be managed as such and are deemed as mining
areas and occupiers compensated. A permit is required by the holder of mining rights to exercise any
other right.

The Mines and Minerals Development Act of 2015 provide over riding rights to forest rights in the
protected forest area as well common lands. The Forest Act of 2015 recognizes mining rights in any
forest type. In addition the rights to use and benefit from natural resources for the general population
is enshrined in the national constitution and bestowed in both statutory and customary laws.
However, the right to commercial utilization of forest resources is subject to permits and licenses are
issued by respective government departments. According to the Mines and Development Act of 2015,
the holder of the mining right cannot exercise any rights under this Act on land occupied as a village
or land under customary tenure unless the holder converts from customary tenure to leasehold
through the legally established procedures provided for under the Lands and Deeds Registry Act, Cap
185.

Mapping and recording of group rights
Although there is demand for mapping and recording of group rights, the law does not provide
opportunities for those groups holding land under customary, group or collective tenures to record
and map land rights. However, the law does not discriminate who should have their rights mapped
and registered under the Lands Act, Cap 184 & Lands and Deeds Registry Act, Cap 185 as long as such
a group formed and registered a cooperative.

However, the deterring factors are the high costs mapping and registering of such rights, the length
process of registration of rights and the statutory obligations (fees) that the group is subjected to after
mapping and registration of rights. It should be made clear though that the law does allow for
recording of rights as groups for common areas such as grazing land.

Boundary demarcation of communal land
Going by the definition of the communal lands adopted in this report, there are no boundary
demarcations for communal land allowed for by customary law (unwritten) or written law. In the case
of degazattion of the forest in customary land, it surveyed and mapped but normally such are not
titled and this case the forest falls under public land. The use and control is then governed through
the Forest Act.

Rural Land Use and Transferability Restrictions
Restrictions regarding rural land use are fairly justified and enforced in that the rights to the resources
in forests, wetlands, pastures and national parks in that regulation regarding restrictions on rural land
use effectively serve public purpose but enforcement is weak. This is mainly due to lack of capacity
and financial resources centralized management system. The Forest Act of 2015 clearly stipulates that
a person shall not do activities such as fell, cut, take or remove any forest produce without a licence
or permit from the Forest Department. It also places restrictions on squatting, camping, building,
excavating, setting fire to the forests. According to Fisheries Act of 2011 if a fisheries management
area is in a Local Forest, National Forest or National Park, the exercise or enjoyment of any fishing
right or interest in the area shall be consistent with sustainable management and conservation. It
prescribes the need to have appropriate equipment for fishing and enforcement of fish bans which
really serve public purpose when it comes to sustainability. The same is true with regards to wild life
hunting which requires a permit but poaching in GMA and national parks is common.

Restrictions on rural land transferability effectively serve public policy objectives however the
enforced is fairly poor. While land vests in the hands of the President, Land in Zambia is held under
two systems: Customary and Statutory. Restrictions imply that only land that is converted to leasehold
can be transferred. The Lands Act, Cap 184, stipulates that leasehold tittles can be issued on customary
land but not without taking into account of the customary laws (unwritten) and approved10 by the
chief and the relevant local council where such land is situated. Whereas, the Forests Act of 2015
stipulates that the rights to trees including all forest resources are vested in the President.

In addition there are other regulations that are serving a public purpose but are not enforced, for
example, most small scale farmers cultivate customary land held in common ownership with the
community although the rights of farmers are individualized even when it comes to transferring such
land. In addition the land has no formal documentation and the landholders do not pay land tax. The
Lands Act, Cap 184 provides the need for transparency in land use and management through the
regulations which are achieved by seeking public input regarding land-use regulations and by
informing the public of the implementation of land-use plans and changes in these plans. However
the President cannot give customary land away to either a Zambian or a Non Zambian unless he/she
consults the Local Chief, local authority and if the land is in a Game Management Area (GMA) then
he/she should consult those currently occupying or using the land in question.

Rural land use plans
Rural land use plans are not elaborated or changed via public process and resulting burdens are not
shared at least to majority of cases especially at finalisation and implementation stages. Public input
is required and sought in preparing and amending land use plans but comments are not reflected in

     Approval means consent by the chief to have the piece of land converted to leasehold tenure

                                                                  36
the finalization of land use plans. Most of the land in Zambia is held under customary tenure by
individuals, families, clans and communities from generation to generation without temporal
limitation. All these need to provide inputs during the rural land use planning process. The President
may declare any land to be a national or local (common) forest and like manner declare the
degazettion of a national or local forest or alteration of the boundaries of the forest by way of reducing
or enlarging.

This is done through rural elaborate land use and management plans after going through an elaborate
public process. However the gradual change may take place after relevant consultations are done.
Similarly, the same procedure is followed if the change is for increasing environmental protection,
degazettion, concessions, mineral and petroleum exploration but with restrictions for local resource
use to avoid damage to forest resource. In all cases Public input is required and sought in preparing
and amending land use plans but comments may or may not be reflected in the finalization of land
use plans and this may be attributed to lack of consensus on the interpretation of the comments by
those compiling the final report and also due to lack of experts. An integrated approach is required
for land use planning because of various interest groups.

Rural Land Use Change
Less than 30% of the land that has had a change in land use assignment in the past 3 years, and has
not changed to the destined use (e.g. forest, pastures, wetlands, national parks etc.). In line with the
macro-economic achievements in the past decade rural land use has swiftly changed for intended
purpose such as mining and agriculture.

There has been a reduction in forest land after conversion to agriculture and mining land from 15% in
1990 to 9% in 2012. Due to high demand for land such conversions changed swiftly to agriculture such
as the Mkushi farming block, Nansanga farm block, mwekera forest reserve and Lusaka forest reserve.
There has been transfer of land for large scale foreign investment and conversion of forests and
common land to crop land ( (Jayne, et al., 2014), (Sitko, et al., 2014)). Conversion of forests for other
uses is estimated at 27.1 % and conversion of land for large scale operations is estimated between 14-
53% of the total arable land. There has been expansion of mines with new ones opened between 1996
and 2011, four large scale mines to include Lumwana, Kansashi, Mulaishi and Munali Hills nickel mines,
the effect of which has changed the rural land use and those who were affected by such expansions
were compensated and resettled elsewhere.

Rural Land Use Rezoning
For a developing country like Zambia rezoning of rural land use is inevitable due to change in the
economic agendas. However, although the processes of rezoning rural land use are public and clear,
the mechanisms to safe guard existing rights are not fully effective. The process involves the
Commissioner of Lands who administers land on behalf of the President, such as farms and agricultural
holdings, as stands for buildings and other uses, all under leasehold. On the other hand chiefs
administer land in customary areas but the Commissioner of Lands may allocate land under customary
tenure provided that it is vacant and the chief does not object. Also departments falling under a
number of ministries such as forestry, fisheries and mining and other statutory institutions also
contribute to land management. This unfortunately leads to duplicity of roles (Table 5) leading to
corrupt practices with no proper system to effect the efficient and equitable distribution of land.
Under Fisheries there are specific regulations concerning rezoning of aquaculture areas, licensing,
environmental protection, control of fish diseases and the movement, importation and exportation of
fish. The same is true for wild life. The forest policy 2014 and Forest Act of 2015 are not specific on
rezoning of rural land use that safeguards existing rights. Land conversions and the establishment of
farming blocks for commercial farming, as discussed above, are also a concern among small scale
farmers and have the potential to create conflicts when it comes to rezoning. Even though customary


                                                   37
laws are officially recognized ( (GRZ, 1995)), pressure on customary areas is increasing and conversion
to leasehold has become frequent for development purposes.

Protected Rural Land use Plans
Due to ever increasing demand of land due increased economic activities and investment, most lands
protected for rural land use (forest, pastures, wetlands, national parks etc.) plans do not correspond
to actual use. The share of land set aside for specific use that is used for a non-specified purpose in
contravention of existing regulations is between 10% and 30%. The Government set a target of 15%
in 1990 to be area for the forest estate, which by 2012 declined to 9.6% of the total land area of
Zambia. The reduction is attributed to land de-gazettion for settlements, agriculture, mining and
infrastructure developments. In addition, the reduction is also associated with deforestation, illegal
settlements and encroachments.

The deforestation rate is estimated at 250,000 ha per annum arising from a combination of above
factors. For example the Ichimpe and Mwekera forest reserves were degazetted to pave way for
mining activities rather than establishing forest plantations. The forest, Fisheries and Wild life Acts
provide for the development of community development plans to guide the sustainable development
of these resources. The wetlands cover 13% of the total country's land surface area. The national parks
which support a lot of wildlife are located in the wetland areas and these also support different
economic activities which include game viewing, game hunting, ecotourism, fishing, irrigation, dams,
small and large scale agricultural activities. Two wetland areas namely; the Kafue flats and Bangweulu
swamps have been designated as wetlands of international importance or Ramsar sites. The utilization
of dambos in Zambia is widespread and the intensity of use is determined by the dambo nature, type
and location. Dambos in Zambia are also important for biodiversity. However, no reference to dambos
is made in Zambian legislation and there is no local institution controlling the use of dambos,
consequently their use is not monitored and document.

3.3 Urban Land use planning and development
Planning and development in Zambia has been influenced by the Town and Country Planning Act
which was recently replaced by the Urban and Regional Planning Act No. 3 of 2015. In 2014, the urban
population was estimated at 6.1 million or 40.5 per cent of total population, which according to the
United Nations will rise to 12.0 million or 50.8 percent by 2030, and 26.8 million or 58.3 percent by
2050 implying a fivefold increase (GRZ, 2013).



                                                    38
The Urban and Regional Planning (URP) Act No. 3 of 2015 is now the principal legislation for urban
land use planning. It introduces the concept of comprehensive 5 year Integrated Development Plans
(IDPs) to be prepared for all municipalities; incorporates “informal unplanned areas” as “special
treatment areas” for urban regeneration and introduces the concept of “planning agreements”
between Chiefs and Local Authorities to ensure effective and coordinated planning of peri-urban areas
and all customary land.

Urban land use (Layout and Master) Plans are available at most Local Authorities as it is a statutory
requirements for all Councils to prepare these Plans. The procedures for both the preparation and
implementation of urban land use plans are clear and well documented in planning law and
regulations, statutory instruments and Government Gazettes. For various reasons, local authorities
and other planning agencies do not strictly follow the laid down procedures when implementing the
Statutory Plans. Any developer who has acquired land (lease or title) and needs to erect a structure,
develop, change the use of or subdivide the land must first obtain Planning Permission from the Local
Planning Authority (Refer to URP Act Part VI Sec 49-60). However, only 30 to 50 percent of all new
developments, changes to urban land or subdivisions that occur have planning permission. Over 50
percent of developments or land uses are granted retrospective (planning) permission which
promotes disorderly and illegal development since planning regulations and standards are often
overlooked. Developers who contravene this requirement are supposed to be fined, have their
structures demolished without compensation or ordered to restore the land to its original use as
designated in the Local Area Plan in cases of changes to land use. However, only in a few cases are
sanctions and penalties imposed, even in retrospect. Other Legislation that affect Land use planning
and development include the Lands Act of 1995, Land and Deeds Registry and Land Survey Acts which
are the main pieces of legislation for land administration and management which also determine
urban land ownership. The Local Government Act of 1991, Public Health Act, the Environmental
Management Act of 2011, Mines and Minerals Act and National Heritage Conservation Act all have an
effect on how urban land is used and developed. The Rating and Rental Act also affect housing
development and ownership. Although a sound and adequate legislative corpus for urban land use,
planning and development exists, most laws and regulatory frameworks are not harmonised and often
contradict leading to significant overlap, disputes and conflicts in the implementation process. For
example while the Local Government Act empowers the district councils to provide services for
allocated plots, the MLNREP allocates the land often before services are provided and it takes a long
time before actual services such as water and roads are actually provided. This would suggest poor
urban land use planning despite having a plethora of laws to guide the process.

Restrictions on urban land ownership
There is a series of regulations that for the most part serve public purpose but enforcement is
deficient. Urban land ownership and transfer are restricted by some constitutional and legal provisions
on property rights, the Urban and Regional Planning Act which stipulate a Development Order and
zoning system that should strictly be followed. Mining areas, protected areas, and lands along rail,
road and power lines and highways, natural urban water bodies, forests and ecologically sensitive
areas are restricted.



                                                                     39
The Constitution prescribes a dual land law system of state land and customary land, vests all land in
the President and recognizes property rights and protects individuals against the deprivation of
property unless authorized by law. In State land private individuals acquire land on 99 year leases
while in customary area, land can be held in perpetuity by members of the tribe or can be converted
to leasehold for exclusive use of the private individual. The Constitution does not recognise squatter’s
rights nor does it explicitly recognise the right to adequate housing but it prescribes the equal worth
of men and women and under Article 23 prohibits discrimination on basis of sex ( (UN-HABITAT,
2012)). Lands Acquisition Act of 1970 provides for compulsory acquisition privately owned urban land
with or without compensation. Compensation may be denied for undeveloped land held by absentee
owners (GRZ, 1970).

The Commissioner of Lands has final authority for urban allocation and alienation but has delegated
responsibility to Local Authorities who also ensure that land owners comply with appropriate
legislation and Urban Development Plans. The state grants four types of leases in urban areas: (1) a
10-year Land Record Card in unplanned informal urban areas which is registered at the local authority;
(2) a 14-year lease for unsurveyed land registered at the MLNREP; (3) a 25- to 30-year Land Occupancy
License for residential unplanned or upgraded settlements registered at the local authority; and (4) a
99-year leasehold for surveyed land registered at the MLNREP. Due to poor records especially at local
authority level it is difficult to ascertain the number of lease. Between January and December of 2015
the MLNREP had transacted 940 lease agreement and 1639 separate certificates of title. This is
indicative of the volume of leases handled yearly by the Ministry. Individuals and corporates in urban
areas are allowed to hold title to land and to sell, rent, mortgage or transfer land but only with the
consent of the Commissioner of Lands. All sales of land, mortgages and transfers are required to be
registered in the Deeds Registry in order to take effect. Any transactions outside the registry are thus
illegal and may result in loss.

Urban land ownership and transfer are restricted by TCP’s Development Order which prescribes a
zoning system that identifies Classes of Development and Use Groups and which should be complied
with by developers. Mining areas, protected areas, and lands along rail, road and power lines and
highways are restricted and cannot be privately owned. Natural urban water bodies, forests and
ecologically sensitive areas are also restricted. In Zambia public and private urban land may be illegally
settled upon with the landowners subsequently surrendering ownership most often without
compensation. Illegal settlers tend to exert political pressure which forces the landowners to
surrender the land. A case in point was the allocation of land to squatters by Apollo Company in Lusaka
West. The residents of such illegal settlements proceed to apply for recognition following which they
are given Land Records or Occupancy Licenses. Illegal occupations and expiry of leaseholds have
prompted some urban landowners to subdivide and sell their land to profit oriented real estate
developers to the disadvantage of the majority poor. These subdivisions are done to prevent land
invasions by illegal settlements which could lead to the loss of the land by the owner without
compensation.



Restrictions on urban land use (disaster risk)
Urban areas are prone to hazards and risks such as fires, techno-industrial accidents (oil and hazardous
material spills), droughts, seasonal and flash floods, extreme temperatures and dry spells. Although
disaster prone areas are restricted, people are wittingly or unwittingly allowed to settle on or close to
these areas and sanctions against breaches of these Regulations are rarely imposed. There have been
cases of industry (e.g. cement factories) being set-up near human settlements and cases where human
settlement is close to restricted areas such as cemeteries. The risk of urban disasters is increased by
non-compliance to Regulations, weak enforcement of the Development Order by Planning Authorities


                                                   40
and non-enforcement of sanctions and penalties. Most residents are not educated on the importance
of Development Plans (and zoning regulations) while development control and monitoring
mechanisms remain very weak resulting in irregular urban land use and development often in disaster
prone areas.

Land use planning should be transparent so as not to exclude the people it is meant to serve, be
forward looking and should allow for compliance and enforcement especially taking into consideration
existing regulations.

Urban expansion/infrastructure development transparency and respect for existing rights
Information on planned urban expansion and infrastructure development is publicly available with
sufficient anticipation but the way in which land rights by those affected are dealt with is largely ad
hoc. Major challenges are the lack of institutional resources that limits the planning input, confusion
in terminologies used for different urban land use plans and out-dated and outmoded land use plans
that have not been reviewed and updated for a long time despite the statutory requirement of plan
review every five years. Implementation of urban land use plans has been a key challenge due to
inadequate human, technical and financial resources and political interference. The weak institutional
capacity has contributed to weak public participation in urban development. Local Authorities
advertised new Master Plans or changes to Plans but the public rarely goes to review and make
comments. The methods used to provide public information are lacking since a number of people
would want information to be readily available, for example, in form of posters (visual displays),
leaflets and road shows.

Involvement of stakeholders in urban land use planning
Are changes in urban land use plans based on a clear public process and input by all stakeholders?
Public input is sought in preparing and amending land use plans as reflected in the TCP Act Section 15
(1) which states that “the Minister may by statutory notice order for preparation of a development
plans for any area specified in such notice and may stipulate after consultation with the planning
authority the time to be granted to the planning authority for the preparation and submission of the
development plan to him, and may extend such time; change the area of a development plan by
additions or exclusions; change the area of an approved development plan by exclusions: Provided
that the order to prepare a development plan or a notice changing the area of a development plan or
an approved development plan shall not become operative until forty-five days after the date of
publication of the said order or notice, and any interested person may, within twenty-one days after
the date of the said publication, object to the Minister to the preparation of such a plan or such change
in area and, where any person does so object, the Minister may, prior to the expiry of the said forty-
five days, order a public inquiry there into under section forty-nine, in which case the said order or
notice shall not become operative until the Minister by statutory notice so declares.” Further TCP Act


                                                             41
Sec 2 states that the Minister shall cause an order made under subsection (1) to be published in three
consecutive issues of a newspaper circulating in the area to which the order relates.

The lack of clear communication strategy has resulted in inadequate public participation and
community awareness of development plans. Communication methods in form of posters, leaflets in
local languages, road shows etc. are inadequate. Public agencies have not fully taken advantage of
technologies such as the Internet and Participatory GIS to make information on changes to land use
available to the public. Although changes in land use and management are made in a transparent
manner they mainly benefit specific groups of residents. Rarely are applications for rezoning refused
or modified in anticipation of future developments but if consent to change or modify an approved
development plan has been refused the applicant can appeal to the Minister. If the latter refuses
consent the applicant can either appeal to the High Court of Zambia or the matter may be referred to
the Town Planning Tribunal for adjudication before the Minister makes the final decision. Applications
for minor changes are only dealt with by Planning Authorities who have limited powers under the TCP
Act to give consent or refuse applicants to carry out specific changes.

Urban Land use changes and speed of development
Between 30% and 50% of the land that has had a change in land use assignment in the past 3 years
has been developed to its destined use. Part IV Sec 56 (1) and (2) of the URP Act provides for variations
in planning permission. The TCP Act Section 15 (1) states that “the Minister may by statutory notice
order for preparation of a development plans for any area specified in such notice and may stipulate
after consultation with the planning authority the time to be granted to the planning authority for the
preparation and submission of the development plan to him, and may extend such time; change the
area of a development plan by additions or exclusions; change the area of an approved development
plan by exclusions. Economic circumstances may partly cause delayed development though
weaknesses in development control and monitoring have contributed. In Zambia less than 50% of the
land that has had a change in land use assignment in the past 3 years has been developed to its
destined use. The legal provision that incomplete developments are deemed legal after four years has
been seen as a weakness in land use and management since many people did not feel compelled to
develop their land.

Policy on delivery of low-cost housing
There is a policy for low cost housing and services but implementation has major gaps so that the
number of those with inadequate shelter actually increases. With independence in 1964 several
vacant farms and public lands and former contractors’ compounds were illegally occupied and form

                                                               42
present day informal unplanned urban settlements. A number of unplanned settlements have been
upgraded to improve the stock of low cost housing. In 1970 the National Housing Authority (NHA) was
established but from the 1990s the NHA tended to focus more on middle and upper income housing.
The 1996 National Housing Policy aimed to provide adequate affordable housing for all income groups
in Zambia. However implementation has been met with many challenges including inadequate
government funding. Government is assisting Local Authorities to build low cost housing. The 1996
NHP is being reviewed with the hope of putting in measures that will increase the low cost housing
stock. Most urban local authorities have prepared land use plans which they are implementing to
some extent but which cannot cope with rapid urban growth and are so rigid and inflexible that many
people are driven into informality.

Land use planning and urban expansion in Lusaka
In the largest city, while a hierarchy of regional/detailed land use plans is specified by law, in practice
urban spatial expansion occurs in an ad hoc manner with infrastructure provided some time after
urbanization. Lusaka, which was planned on Garden City principles, was designated the capital city in
1935. While it was easy to guide and manage Lusaka’s urban spatial expansion during the colonial
times, it became increasingly challenging after independence. This is reflected in the fact that not less
than seven Master Plans for Lusaka have been prepared since 1935. The 1975 Doxiadis Master Plan
for Lusaka, the 2000 Lusaka Structure Plan and the current Comprehensive Urban Development Plan
(CUDP) for Lusaka have been the major Land Use Plans used to guide urban spatial expansion.

While a hierarchy of detailed land use plans exists for Lusaka as specified by law, in practice the City’s
urban spatial expansion occurs in an ad hoc manner resulting in un-coordinated development,
compartmentalised, haphazard, piecemeal uncoordinated and disorderly physical development and
the ubiquitous poor quality of living and environmental conditions. The existing land use plans have
not been reviewed and updated despite the statutory requirement of plan review every five years. As
such the land use plans tend to be out-dated and outmoded due to rapid urbanisation and population
growth. Implementation of urban land use plans has been a key challenge due to inadequate human,
technical and financial resources and capacity and sometimes political interference.

Land use planning and urban expansion in four major cities
This dimension seeks to assess whether Land use planning effectively guides urban development in
the four next largest cities. In the four major cities in the country, while a hierarchy of
regional/detailed land use plans is specified by law, in practice urban development occurs in an ad hoc
manner with infrastructure provided some time after urbanization. Land use planning in Kitwe, Ndola,
Livingstone and Kabwe - the next four major cities after Lusaka - is guided by a similar hierarchy of
regional and detailed land use plans as specified by law.

Kitwe and Kabwe were established as mining towns; Ndola as an industrial centre and administrative
capital for the Copperbelt and Livingstone, which once was capital of Zambia as a major tourist centre.
Urban growth dynamics and the urbanization challenges of these towns do not vary much from those
of Lusaka.

As with Lusaka, urban development in the four towns occurs in an ad hoc manner with infrastructure
provided some time after urbanization. The proliferation of informal unplanned settlements is also a
major challenge despite the existence of land use plans. Local Authorities have insufficient capacity to
anticipate urban growth and absence of national and local policies to guide and coordinate urban
development. Settlement planning frameworks are largely driven by a sectoral approach through the
5-year National Development Plans. Government uses a myriad of ordinances, statutes and orders to
guide the urban development which has resulted in rapid spontaneous urban growth.

Planning process and urban growth
In the largest city, the urban planning process/authority is struggling to cope with the increasing
demand for serviced units/land as evidenced by the fact that most new dwellings are informal.
The URP Act of 2015 puts forwards a new planning process that anticipates both current and future
urban growth. Planning processes have been significantly affected by rapid population growth and
urbanisation and continued rural to urban migrations in Zambia. Wholesale and rapid changes to
Development Plans have potential to affect future urban land use and development though rarely are
applications for rezoning of Development Plans refused. The proliferation of informal settlements and
the growing expansion of cities lead to serious environmental degradation (including air pollution) and
poor traffic management (congestion, weak transportation systems, etc.). Unplanned urbanisation
taking place through spontaneous settlement patterns is very costly and difficult to address once it
has occurred. The latter problems are exacerbated by inefficient urban planning practices, poor road
network, lack of city compactness and density, weak mixed use, and unevenly distributed socio-
economic urban functions.

Appropriateness and affordability of residential building permits provisions
Requirements to obtain a building permit are technically justified but not affordable for (and not
complied by) the majority of those affected. No data was available to indicate how many of properties
in urban areas actually had building permits. Planning law stipulates that a development (building)
permit for a major development or change of land use shall be granted within 90 days of receipt of
the application for or within 28 days of receipt of an application for a development permit for any
other development. In reality however these periods are often exceeded either because the applicant
does not meet the requirements of the law or conditions attached to the grant. In this case the
developer is allowed to make minor adjustments or revise the building plans to meet the Regulations.
In some cases the application may be out-rightly rejected with reasons given for the rejection. Once
approved inspections must be carried out at various stages of construction e.g. foundation, walls,
roofs, fittings etc. A gap in the law which allowed illegal developments to be regularised if no
enforcement or stop notice was issued within four years was akin to “legalising illegality”. The new
URP Act of 2015 has removed this provision and so all illegal developments will remain illegal until
fully regularised with authorities.

The major challenges related to building permits comprise a long list of requirements based on
planning and building regulations most of which are out-dated and restrictive. Enforcement and Stop
Notices are rarely given out for illegal developments or non-compliance which results in proliferation
of sub-standard building structures and illegal developments. Despite the existence of the TRP Act and
the introduction of the URP Act of 2015 enforcement remains a challenge due to lack of building
inspectors at local government level. The enactment of the URP Act of 2015 implies the need for
increased planning capacities and skills at all levels. A nationwide capacity and skills building
programme is required to meet the increased functions and responsibilities of planning agencies.

Feasibility of formalisation of urban residential housing
The requirements for formalizing housing in urban areas are clear, straight-forward, and affordable
but are not implemented consistently in a transparent manner. It is estimated that as much as two-
thirds of all urban housing is informal and located in unplanned settlements. Lusaka, for example, has
more than 45 unplanned settlements of which 37 have been formally recognised a s “improvement
areas” under the Housing (Statutory and Improvement Areas) (HSIA) Act of 1974. After recognition,
housing is formalised by surveying, preparation of a land use map and provision of basic services. The
HSIA does not specify minimum standards for the houses to be constructed and hence the need to
specify to some detail the minimum expected standard of a house. Permits required under the HSIA
are often given late and many extensions occur without authority. The HSIA forbids residents from
having more than one structure per plot of land. The declaration as an Improvement Area allows
service provision with the full blessing of government or council but it may be many years before the
legalised areas are upgraded. In many cases the residents or NGOs may have already provided some
services. The HSIA requires Councils to compensate residents when they are moved to pave way for
service and infrastructure provision. Financial resources are often not available which slows down the
process of service and infrastructure provision in Improvement Areas. Donors and NGOs fill the gap
by supporting upgrading, environmental improvements and even provision of credit but the scale of
their interventions is limited. Such donor initiatives encourage the residents to build better houses
and obtain Occupancy Licenses.

There is no clear policy and strategy to deal with informal unplanned settlements and the existing
legislation needs to be reviewed. The process for declaring a settlement as an improvement area is
cumbersome and takes too long and conditions would have changed by the time the process is
complete. Since the HSIA excludes other laws from applying these areas, it encourages the
construction of sub-standard structures and is a source of conflict among agencies on which laws to
apply when dealing unplanned settlements. The HSIA does not provide a special building code or set
of standards allowable in Statutory or Improvement Areas and the building standards operating in
urban areas are too expensive and cumbersome for use by the lower income majority. The HSIA gives
Council the authority to resettle residents on compensation but this not done. Regarding land tenure
the Improvement Areas Act is not specific on what ‘improvement’ really means’.

Strategies for tenure security, infrastructure and housing in cities with informal tenure
Existing regulations do not provide incentives for new informal occupations and a strategy exists to
regularize land rights and provide services to existing informal occupants.
The Housing (Statutory and Improvement Areas) (HSIA) Act of 1974 has been the main legal
instrument for regularising informal tenure. After an unplanned settlement is declared an

                                                                45
Improvement Area (under the HSIA) the tenants are given Occupancy Licenses. Since the settlements
are located within Township Boundaries, the area must be re-zoned under the Town and Country
Planning Act, Cap. 283 and a layout prepared and submitted to the Surveyor General for approval.
Once approved, the area is declared an “Improvement Area”, the council is granted a head lease or
block title for the whole area. Once the declaration is made, residents are issued with 30-year
occupancy licences while the area goes through the process of upgrading. The Occupancy Licenses can
be later replaced by certificates of title.

The provision and production of affordable housing is failing to meet demand due to high population
growth. The inhabitants are hence turning to acquire informal housing resulting in unplanned
settlements mushrooming mostly in the peri-urban areas. These units are in most cases unsafe and
sub- standard and located in the illegal and worst parts of urban centres, they lack legal status and the
provision of basic services such as clean water and sanitation. The existing land delivery system for
low cost housing still gives room for growth of shanty compounds because land is not being made
available to the poor. Housing is unaffordable for a bigger section of the Zambian community.

Management and recording of urban property in condominiums
Common property under condominiums is recognized but the law lacks clear (or regulations) for
management and publicity of relevant records. The Common Leasehold Schemes Act Cap 208 Vol. 12
of the Laws of Zambia was enacted to allow for the registration of “horizontal” rights (strata title) for
high-rise and semi-detached buildings. The Act thus provides the division of land and buildings into
units with separate titles by means of common leasehold schemes (akin to Sectional Titles in some
countries like South Africa). Thus this law allows for dividing of units in a condominium with separate
titles where Sectional titles do not exist and where previously a head lease was held by a Local
Authority or the National Housing Authority (NHA). Upon registration of the scheme, the unit holders
become a corporate body with perpetual succession and a common seal. Incorporation of the scheme
members has the same effect as a contract under seal. Amongst other things, the body corporate can
make by-laws, enforce by laws and control and manage common property (that is not part of any one
unit). Although common property under condominiums is recognised by the Act, arrangements that
allow for effective management and recording of urban property and chattels are not common.

Common property under condominiums is recognised by the Common Leasehold Schemes Act but the
law lacks clear regulations for the deposition, management and publicity of relevant records. As such
the allocation of sectional titles to sitting tenants and the management and publicity of records has
always challenging. Soon after handing over residential units to sitting tenants most condominiums
degenerated and were blighted as most residents did not want to take responsibility for the operation
and maintenance of these facilities. The law has not been clear on the maintenance of such properties
while Local Authorities have not reacted quickly to come up with bye laws to ensure good upkeep of
the surrounding areas of condominiums.

3.4 Management of Public Land
The definition of “public” land can be deduced from the definition of “public purpose” under the Lands
Act, Cap 184. Public purpose includes exclusive use of Government or for the general benefit of the
people of Zambia; for public infrastructure; and for preservation or control of natural resources e.g.
forest, fauna and flora.

Given the above definition, it can be seen that there are several institutions that are involved in the
management of public land. These include
    (a) Ministry of Lands, Natural Resources and Environmental Protections (Surveys; Lands; Lands
        and Deeds Registry; Forestry; and Environment and Natural Resources)
    (b) Ministry of Mines (Department of Mines)
    (c) Ministry of Energy and Water Development (Water and sewerage companies) Zambia
        Electricity Supply Corporation; Water Management Authority)
    (d) Ministry of Local Government and Housing (District councils)
    (e) Ministry of Transport, Works, Supply and Communications (Aviation; Road Development
        Agency; Zambia Railways)
    (f) Ministry Tourism and Arts (Wildlife and National Parks)

Acquisition here on the part of government includes de-gazetting public land (according to panel
discussion) or direct acquisition of customary land by investor with government facilitation. Public land
ownership is justified by provision of public goods and the assignment of management responsibility
for different types of public land is clear as given in the various related statutes. Nonetheless, public
institutions do not have adequate capacity (equipment, finances and human resources) to carry out
their mandates and management responsibility is often at the wrong level of government. Inadequate
capacity was consistently reported in the annual reports (MLNREP, 2013); (MLNREP, 2014); (MLNREP,
2015). Most public institutions are not represented at district level. Further, the alarming rate of
deforestation in the country is a testimony to the inadequate capacity to enforce existing laws.

Most public land (60 - 90%) is clearly identified on the ground and on maps. These include national
parks and game management areas, forest reserves, wetlands and national monuments which were
declared through government gazettes. During the colonial time, all the protected reserves were
gazetted, marked and mapped. After the attainment of independence in 1964, there has been an
increasing systematic invasion of public land for agriculture, human settlements, mining and other
economic activities. Certain areas have since been completely or partially degazetted. While some
areas still show as being protected areas on the ground they are completely fully developed into
human settlements or other developments. Further, the newly created townships are not mapped,
RAMSAR sites, wayleaves and other public utilities have not been clearly identified on the ground and
on maps.

Although public access to land records is limited due to the centralized cadastre/land register (in
Lusaka and Ndola) and lack of updating, in essence after payment of some fees, the public can access
all the public land information. The fees are contained in the Service Charter which is available on the
MLNREP web site (http://www.ministryoflands.gov.zm/). Most key information such as the locality,
area of the land allocations and parties involved are recorded and publicly available. However,
information for restricted areas such as military land and the financial terms of the allocation of public
land to private interests especially corporates is not publicly accessible.

More than 50% of land acquired in the past 3 years is used for private purposes. Most developmental
projects usually are undertaken on public land and customary land. A number of forest reserves and

                                                                    49
national parks have been degazetted and given to private companies to run mines in North-western,
Copperbelt, Lusaka and Eastern Provinces. Besides it is easier and more and convenient for
government to use public land than private land where they will be required to make large monetary
compensation. Public land is taken for free.

When land is acquired, it is transferred to the destined use in a timely manner. Sometimes investors
will start to use public land for commercial purposes before formal approvals are given, then they will
formalize the change in land use later-on. This means that there is no delay in the use of land for
private business when formal transfers are done. E.g. Lumwana, Kalumbila and gem stone mines
where mineral exploration rights were given in protected areas. After mineral deposits were
confirmed, there was little objection to the actual mineral extraction and issuance of surface rights.
However, the threat of land acquisition does lead to some pre-emptive action by private parties
especially by civil society organisations. Public opposition to the establishment of Kangaluwi Copper
mine made government shelve plans to open a copper mine in a game park area in the lower Zambezi.

4.3.5 Timely decisions are made regarding complaints about                          A first instance decision has been reached for more

Compensation, in kind or in cash, is paid for some unrecorded rights (such as possession, occupation,
etc.) even where people have lost rights as a result of land use change outside the acquisition process.
However, not every right is compensated for so that people may not sustain their prior social and
economic status. Those with other unrecorded rights such as grazing, social networks, access, and
gathering forest products are usually not paid. Examples include the loss of grazing rights along the
lower Zambezi River due to establishment of lodges. In Kalumbila, village settlements that were
moved had their houses rebuilt by the mine company but communal grazing lands were not
compensated for. The Company has since fenced off the mine areas and they are no longer accessible
to the local people.

When land is acquired, affected owners are compensated promptly (within a year) by respective
developers and where there are complaints, decisions are reached within a short time. Compensations
are usually carried out swiftly once consensus is reached to avoid changes of political and local
opinions with time. Compensation payments are therefore expeditiously done by respective
developers in order to get this sensitive problem quickly out of the way. Very few cases may be taken
to the Courts of Law; otherwise, many cases are usually approved or not approved by the authorities
within three years. The bulk of the land disputes for the poor are usually arbitrated upon by politicians
or civil servants and respective decisions have usually been given in less than three years.

Independent avenues to lodge a complaint against acquisition exist via courts of law. The challenge
lies in accessing the formal avenues due to legal costs and distance. Local courts, for instance, are not
present in every district. The process for selecting investments based mainly on national benefits is in
place and is adhered to. Environment Impact Assessments (EIAs) are compulsory, but they are
sometimes overlooked as the minister responsible has discretionary powers to overturn
recommendations from the environmental regulatory agency as happened in the cases of the Lusaka
Multi Facility Zone, Kafue Steel, Kalumbila Dam, Kangaluwi Copper Project based in Lower Zambezi
National Park, among others.

The share of public land disposed of in the past 3 years through sale or lease through public auction
or open tender process is less than 50% (Except for equity transfers). Transfers of public lands to
private use are not always transparent as indicated by several incidences of hitherto gazetted forests
being allocated for private use without any information provided to the general public beforehand.
Incidences of corruption involving public officials are routinely reported in land administration at
lower levels. For example, the Livingstone, Kitwe and Ndola City Councils were in January 2016
suspended for illegal land allocations allegedly perpetuated by some of the elected councillors and
officers from the councils (GRZ, 2016). There has not been any national assessment of the total public
land transferred for private use. There is a distinct lack of information on the scale of land investments
involving transfer of public land to private use in Zambia. (Chu, et al., 2015) have shown some of the
large scale acquisitions in Zambia in the mining, agriculture and industrial areas which have displaced
a large number of families (see Table 6). The displacement of families speaks to the issues of how
these families are to be compensated and to the lack of transparency in the whole process. Not all
cases of land transfers go through the Zambia Development Agency.

More than 90% of the total agreed payments are collected from private parties on the lease of public
lands. The Lands Act (1996) states that the President shall not alienate any land without receiving any
consideration, in money for such an alienation and ground rent for such land except where the
alienation is for a public purpose. Exemptions are granted for land meant for government institutions
and public purposes such as clinics, schools, police stations. Payments are demanded upon the lease
of public lands for private use.

The Ministry of Lands, Natural Resources and Environmental Protection has revised the process of title
deed acquisitions for leased land. Hitherto, a’ Letter of Offer’ was availed to the applicant before
payment of statutory fees related to leasing of public land for private use. Currently, an ‘Invitation to
Treat’ is first issued, and the applicant is given 90 days in which to pay all the statutory fees failure to
which the land parcel can be made available to another user. The Letter of Offer is only made available
upon payment of all statutory fees. This revision has increased the rates of payment for title deeds
(Ministry of Lands Official, personal communication). Table 8presents a summary of title deeds paid
for and issued for direct leases.

Only some types of public land are generally divested at market prices in a transparent process
irrespective of the investor’s status (e.g. domestic or foreign) or the purpose for which the land is
assigned. There are differences in the charges payable by Zambian and Non-Zambian investors for the
transfer of public land to private use. For example, when applying for consent from the state to
transfer land to Zambians, the statutory fee is 1112 fee units while the requirement for a Non Zambia
is 2224 fee units or 0.5 per cent of market value (whichever may be greater). For the renewal of leases
for private use of land in the four cities (Lusaka, Livingstone, Kitwe and Livingstone), statutory fees
payable are the same for both Zambians and Non Zambians (Table 7).

Mechanisms to allow the public to capture a significant share of the gains from changing land use are
rarely used and applied in a discretionary manner. It is difficult to state what mechanisms are in place
to allow the public to capture a significant share of the gains from a very wide array of land use
changes. The public benefits from some changes in land use but not from others.

Policy is in place to improve access to and productive use of assets by poor and marginalized groups
but is not enforced. Patriarchal tendencies continue to exist in the land acquisition process, especially
with regards to customary land. These tendencies end up favouring the rich, leaving mostly women
and youths disadvantaged with regards to access and ownership of land (Zambia Land Alliance, 2015).
The gender policy provisions are not followed in the transfer of public land for private use. Youths, by
virtue of their limited economic opportunities are mostly unable to secure land through markets.
Access to land through transfer by local government authorities requires ability to pay the statutory
fees which are beyond the reach of the poor, most of whom are women and unemployed youths.

      practice.


There is no policy in place to identify land to be made available to investors so that any transfers are
based on ad-hoc investor demands. For instance, the Zambia Development Agency (ZDA) acquires land
on behalf of prospective investors or allocates them from its land bank but there is no a priori
assessment of the land potential for different uses. Additionally, not all investors access land from the
ZDA’s land bank. Some directly approach traditional leaders and commence land developments
without any detailed suitability assessments. Some of the land parcels in the ZDA Bank were
transformed from customary to state land by a team led by the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock
that included representatives from local authorities the Ministries of Lands and Energy (Nolte, 2013)
without community consultations. Overall, the Ministry of Lands has limited human capacity to
perform all its land administrative and land management functions such as surveying in a timely
manner. The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock, responsible for conducting suitability assessments
for agriculture does not routinely perform this function.

As part of their investment plans, investors are mandated to describe the employment opportunities
to be created by their investments in the locality. Focus is on developments that benefit the wider
economy and local benefits are marginalized. Although Environment Impact Assessments (EIAs) are
compulsory, they are sometimes overlooked as the minister responsible for the environment has
discretionary powers to overturn recommendations from the environmental regulatory agency as
happened in the cases of the Lusaka Multi Facility Zone, Kafue Steel, Kalumbila Dam, Kangaluwi
Copper Project based in Lower Zambezi National Park, among others. Some projects provide for the
sharing of benefits while others do not. Policy to ensure that investments are selected on economic,
socio-cultural and environmental impacts in an open process is in place but is not always adhered to.
Socio-cultural aspects are not adequately addressed as focus is on economic benefits.

Institutions to make decisions are clearly identified but lack either capacity or incentives in ensuring
socially beneficial outcomes or their decisions are not always implemented. Most public institutions
do not have sufficient resources to carry out their mandates. For instance, by 2013, the Survey
Department only had 29 licensed private land surveyors and 7 licensed surveyors working under the
Surveyor General’s Office (Chileshe & Shamaoma, 2014). Inadequate capacity also hinders monitoring
of compliance.

No policy is in place and decisions on land use and land rights are not coordinated across sectors.
Depending on the nature of the proposed development, inter-ministerial committees are set up
encompassing the relevant ministries and agencies on an ad-hoc basis albeit very rarely. At district
level, inter-departmental committees draw membership from the district offices of the ministries
represented locally but they are poorly coordinated and each department follows its own land use
plans and in-house policies. There seems to be a distinct lack of appreciation of the diversity of land,
and the need for inter-sectoral and inter-disciplinary management.

It was not possible to obtain publicly available information on some projects involving long term leases
of public land by private entities e.g. concessions for management of national park by a private entities
are not easily available to the public. ZEMA is mandated by law to make EIA reports available to the
public and occasionally publicizes lack of compliance involving large scale investors and remedial
actions recommended. ZDA’s functions include monitoring and evaluating the activities, performance

                                                                  54
and development of enterprises operating in multi-facility economic zones and prescribing and
enforcing measures, for the business or activity carried out within a multi-facility economic zone so as
to promote the safety and efficiency of its operations. Compliance reports are not publicly available,
unlike the EIA reports on the ZEMA website. Compliance reports are mostly kept confidential by the
monitoring agencies.

Safeguards (EIA, SIA, etc.) are partly in line with global best practice. The Zambia Environmental
Management Agency is mandated to ensure that EIAs are conducted for all large scale land-related
projects. ZDA utilizes a system of provisional leasehold titles in which it holds the land in trust for the
first 2 to 5 years, giving it oversight over investor performance in a bid to monitor commitments and
minimize land speculation ( (Simwanda, 2011) cited in (German, et al., 2013)). However, the EIA
process is not always followed nor Strategic Environmental Assessments (SEA) frequently conducted.
Mechanisms for ensuring safeguards are implemented are not effective. In addition, ZEMA is only
managed from a few regional offices with limited capacity to monitor development projects for their
environmental effects and compliance to environmental regulations.

Resettlement policy exists (Zambia Daily Mail, 2016), but is only in part of the cases applied. The
Department of Resettlements under the Vice President’s Office is mandated to carry out resettlement
activities. However, inadequate capacity in public institutions, functional centralisation and
inadequate coordination makes the land transfer processes slow and costly. No mechanisms for
comprehensive assessment of land potential exist and it is unclear how much land is still available for
potential investment.

All investment application related documents are reviewed according to a uniform process and receive
a response within 3 months of date of submission. The Zambia Development Agency is mandated to
aid investors in setting up their investments, including the acquisition of land. It follows clear and
uniform processes for the various services it provides to investors. The time taken from receipt to
processing of duly completed application forms for investment licences and permits is two weeks.

Those holding rights to land with potential for investment have incentives to properly negotiate but
their rights are unclear or opportunities to obtain relevant information or assistance do not exist.
There is an information asymmetry between rights holders and investors as investors have access to
relevant and updated information, while local communities do not. Investors can utilize their financial
resources and social capital to obtain information, while right holders, such as rural residents do not
have such an opportunity. Rights to land are not always clearly defined for land held under customary
tenure, as the rights are multiple and may even be conflicting. Opportunities for obtaining relevant
information do not always exist.

There are no requirements for information on benefit sharing in the preparation of land investment
plans. The majority of contractual arrangements do not include information on benefit sharing.
Investors have two ways of obtaining land. They can acquire land directly from the state, for instance
via the Zambia Development Agency or negotiate with local chiefs for customary land, which is
converted to leasehold before a lease can be obtained (Lands Act, 1995). Ideally, local communities
who are the rights holders of customary land are supposed to be represented or consulted but
increasing reports give evidence of chiefs not consulting their communities (Nolte, 2014; (Oakland
Institute, 2011)).

Spatial information and temporal information is available to relevant government institutions but not
accessible on a routine basis by private parties. The Environmental Management Act provides for
public review of EIA documents, and for collection of public comments and concerns relating to the
environment. Project developers are also obliged to seek the views of those to be affected by the
project and describe the socio-economic impacts such as resettlement when preparing an EIA.
Reports however suggest that despite this legislative and institutional framework, the system on the
ground is quite different and marked by a lack of meaningful consultation, no transparency around
EIA processes, and little in the way of protection for small-scale farmers and traditional land users
(Oakland Institute, 2011). There is no provision for post project implementation involvement of
private parties, including the affected communities. Results of environmental audits are only provided
to ZEMA and not to the public. Consultations with affected communities are provided for under the
EIA regulations and happens prior to implementation of proposed projects. There are no mechanisms
for affected communities for formally accessing projects after project implementation.

There is little third-party monitoring of investors' compliance with safeguards and mechanisms to
quickly and effectively ensure adherence are difficult to access for affected communities. There is very
little third-party monitoring of compliance with safeguards by both investors and the state. ZEMA has
limited capacity to effective monitor all large scale land investments regularly.

There is little third-party monitoring of investors' compliance with contractual provisions and
mechanisms to quickly and effectively reach arbitration are difficult to access for affected
communities but work for investors. Third party monitoring is weak and infrequent. A few non-
government organizations such as The Zambia Land Alliance have been consistent in lobbying and
advocacy and dissemination on information on all land matters in Zambia. Spatial and temporal
information may be available to relevant government institutions but is not made available routinely
to interested third parties upon request. It is difficult to access information on concessions/leased
land in protected areas, even though these are on public lands. Most public institutions demand
introductory letters from renowned institutions and its intended use before they can release
information to a member of the public.

3.5.5 Recommendations for Transparent process and Economic Benefit of Transfer of
      Public Land to Private Use

Deficiencies in the transparency involving acquisition of public land for private purposes and
the lack of beneficiation when land is acquired led to the following recommendations

 No.    Policy issue                                              Proposed action

 2      Lack of access to land by women and                    Enforce the gender policy in terms of allocating 30% of
        youths                                                  all public land leased for private use to women .

        leaders for large tracts of land with little            investment in different sectors of development
        community involvement and no                           have Policy on implementation and monitoring
        involvement of ZDA                                     have a comprehensive Integrated Land Use plan for the

 5      Lack of access to spatial and temporal                 Adoption of the access to information bill (Act) to
        information on concessions/leases                       formalize access to public information by the public
        involving public lands by private parties.             Develop mechanisms for post project implementation

The use of non-documentary evidence11 is effectively used to help establish rights only in case of
customary land which is not already recorded. The rights are recognized by use or land improvement
such as growing of trees and construction of dwelling structures and are accepted in local courts. For
already registered land on either customary or state land, the evidence is ignored. Recorded rights
take precedence over un-recorded rights (Lands and Deeds Registry Act, Cap 185).

If the poor possess land legally in either customary land or state land, the law (Lands Act Cap 184)
does not discriminate between rich or poor. The problem for the poor in customary areas may arise
when it comes to fees (survey fees, registration fees, rates and ground rent) connected to conversion
of tenure to leasehold and its maintenance. If land possession by the poor is illegal (squatting), it is
not recognised by any law. However, long term illegal possession is sometimes politically recognized
and formalized. One would find local Members of Parliament being petitioned by illegal settlers or
squatters so that they help them formalise or maintain their status. The end result would be to compel
by force or request the legal owner to sub-divide and surrender the occupied land or seek alternative
land. The formalization in line with local norms can be said to fall short of being effective, consistent
or transparent.


Adverse possession is never recognized and there is no legislation to formalize long-term unchallenged
possession. The Lands Act outlaws illegal possession (squatting) whether unchallenged or not.
However, under the Housing (Statutory and Improvement Areas) Act, there is a provision to formalize
illegal settlements, which (UN-HABITAT, 2012) has described as one of the most innovative laws on
formalizing tenure in informal settlements. In addition, public land that has been encroached may be
degazetted due to public pressure, then planned and allocated to settlers. For instance, between 2004
and 2015 a total of 210,061 hectares of the forest estate was planned to be given out against the
gazettion proposal of only 8,484 hectares (Forestry Department, 2015).

On-demand recording of rights does include proper safeguards to prevent abuse but costs exceed 5%
of the property value. If we take a 30m x 40m plot translating to 1,200 sq. m. and costing K60,000 in
Lusaka’s Chalala area, the cost for cadastral surveying would be about K3,500 and land administration
fees (acceptance, consideration fees, ground rent, etc) would be about K2,500 (Oct. 2015). If this is a
direct offer by the MLNREP, the total fees would be somewhere around K6,000 representing a 10%
cost. If on the other hand it’s a sub-division, one has to add legal fees for assignment and property tax
now at 5%. This would certainly bring the total cost to over 15%. If in Kabwe, the same piece of land
would cost about half, i.e. K30,000 and cadastral fees would be about half as well giving the same
percentage cost, thus confirming that costs are a lot higher than 5%. For a transfer, the fees will include
consent, legal, and administration fees and property tax.

More than 90% of records for privately held land recorded in the registry are readily identifiable in
maps (spatial records). All registration of land requires a survey diagram or sketch plan. Through the
new information system (ZILMIS), the records are linked to corresponding survey diagrams or sketch
plans for 99 or 14 year leases respectively. The recording of land on the basis of a sketch has been
discontinued. ZILMIS system (launched January 2013) has the following features among others:
(http://www.ministryoflands.gov.zm/):
• A GIS (Geographic Information System) integrated module which enables linkage between the
    Geographical (Cadastral) land boundaries and its ownership information;
• Supports the processing and issuance of new leases and title deeds including subsequent
    transactions such as assignments and mortgages;
• Enables easy storage and retrieval of land ownership data in a secure manner;
• Through the Electronic Document Management (EDM) component can to store the archived
    physical documents.

Relevant private encumbrances are recorded consistently and in a reliable fashion and can be verified
at low cost by any interested party. Caveats, mortgages, sub leases, trusts, restrictive covenants, are
all registered in the cadastre/register. The Service Charter12 provides a sample of documents needed
for recording rights in property, types of transactions and fees and time frames to services provided.

Relevant public restrictions or charges are recorded consistently and in a reliable fashion and can be
verified at a low cost by any interested party. The main public restrictions include land use zone,
mineral rights, building permits, and public health restrictions.
The cadastre/register at MLNREP is searchable by both right holder name and parcel and this is made
easier by installation of ZILMIS. Even in the old system, one could still search by parcel or name.
Registers at local authorities are hardly searchable as most of them are manual and therefore difficult
to conduct meaningful searches. On payment of search fees, anyone can get a printout, softcopy, or
view search results from a computer screen. The fees are stipulated in the Service Charter.

Registries at the local governments are not linked or synchronized with those at the MLNREP, although
they maybe over the same property. Local authority registries are in analogue form and data storage
is a big problem. For both agricultural and non-agricultural land, less than 50% of the ownership
information in the register/cadastre is up-to-date and reflects ground reality. According to official
records, there are only about 142,000 registered titles, but surveyed land is well over this number
probably 10 times more. Thus the Lands Registry is so to speak incomplete.

The registry charges almost cost reflective fees in form of consideration and registration fees and
ground rent. However, this money is not retained by the registry as it is channelled to the National
Treasury’s Control 99. A lot of fees have been adjusted to be cost-reflective. Earnings by the registry
are enough to pay for operational costs. However, non-retention of the fees collected makes the
registry non-sustainable. This can be seen in the Annual Report of 2013, 2014 and 2015.

There is a general out cry of inadequate and untimely funding by all the Departments in the Ministry
(MLNREP, 2014). However, this is not to say that “There is little or no investment in capital in the
system to record rights in land”. ZILMIS and the land audit programmes provide examples of
significant investment in the land sector.

The schedule of fees is there and it can easily be seen in the Customer Service Centre and on the
Ministry’s web site (http://www.ministryoflands.gov.zm/index.php/services-and-fees). Fees are
worked out based on fee units which are determined and published by the Central Statistical Office.
This is the general approach for public related fees (The Fees and Fines Act, Cap 45). Revised fee
schedules are published in a Statutory Instrument e.g. SI No.41 of July 2015 which raised the fee unit
from K0.20 to K0.30.

Committee comprising of various stakeholders is constituted to monitor offers when interviews are
conducted. It is difficult to systematically deal with informal payments as most of these happen in
some “dark” corners.

There is a Service Charter on the Ministry’s Web-site and service standards are set out although they
are not fully adhered to or implemented. The Service Charter is quite clear but the actual delivery of
services does not conform to reality. An example would be the lodgement and approval of survey
records which is within 5 -21 days. This rarely is the case. Some jobs take longer owing to the absence
of a first-in, first out protocol. In Annual reports nothing is ever mentioned on the set standards.

3.6.6 Recommendation for public provision of land information

The general reliability of registry data is one that has been cited as problematic in ensuring that
information is provided to the general public. The following recommendations address some of the

3.7 Transparency in Land Valuation and Tax Collection Efficiency
The rating system in Zambia is a municipal tax on property owners and is sometimes referred to as
‘owners’ rates’. The current form of land valuation and taxation was first introduced by the Rating Act
Cap 192 (No. 33 of 1976) which removed the valuation of land following the land reforms of 1977 and
established the Rating Valuation Tribunal. This was repealed in 1997 by the Rating Act No. 12 which
brought back assessment of land in line with the Land Act of 1995; and made the Valuation Rolls more

accessible to public scrutiny and objection. This was subsequently amended by the Rating
(Amendment) Act No. 9 of 1999 to give the Government Valuation Department (GVD) the overall
responsibility of preparing valuation Rolls; broaden the tax base by bringing in common leasehold
units; and plant and machinery; restricting exemptions to public use and agriculture; and removing
commercial/business properties located in customary areas from the customary land exemption; and
extending jurisdiction of the tribunal to approving the proposed rate levy.

The rating law is administered by the Ministry of Local Government and Housing; advised by the
Government Valuation Department (GVD). GVD is responsible for preparing the National Rating
Programme (NRP) including undertaking valuations for all rating authorities in the country.
Assessment of properties for rates is restricted to valuation surveyors certified or registered by the
Valuation Surveyors Registration Board (VSRB). According to the 2014 VSRB register there are 61
registered valuation surveyors 50 of whom are in the private sector while 11 are in public service.
Where valuation work is to be outsourced to a surveyor in private sector, because GVD is unable to
undertake the work, public procurement procedures by the Zambia Public Procurement Authority
(ZPPA) should be followed. The valuation roll once completed is submitted to the Rating Valuation
Tribunal (RVT) for scrutiny, hearing of objections and approval at a public hearing.

7.1.2    Valuation rolls are publicly accessible.          1                  There is a policy that valuation rolls be publicly
                                                                              accessible and this policy is effective for all

Revenue raising through transparent and clear processes can be key to unlocking the funds required
for development-taxes on land can provide that source if funds at the local level. This requires that
valuation rolls are publicly accessible so that property owners do not feel that the tax being paid is
arbitrary.

Process of property valuation
The assessment of land/property for tax or compensation purposes has some relationship to market
prices, but there are 50-75% differences between recorded values and market prices across different
uses or types of users and valuation rolls are not updated.

All updates are recorded as at the date of the main roll. There is a time lag between the date of
appointment of the Valuation Surveyor and the time the roll is inspected, assessed and delivered. This
is anything between six (6) months and two (2) years depending on the size of the roll or Council. On
average, property prices/values rise at about 15 -20% per annum. This would give a differential in
recorded and market values of over 50% for large Councils.

Public access to Valuation rolls
There is a policy that valuation rolls be publicly accessible and this policy is effective for all properties
that are considered for taxation.

Valuation rolls are publicly accessible and their availability is widely publicised by site notices, bill
boards, gazette notices and newspaper advertisement. Council offices make the Rolls open for
inspection for at least four (4) weeks prior to submission to a public hearing of the Rating Valuation

Justification and transparency of exemptions from property taxes
There are limited exemptions to the payment of land/property taxes, and the exemptions that exist
are clearly based on equity or efficiency grounds but are not applied in a transparent and consistent
manner.

Exemptions from rating are justified based on the public good and are publicised in the exempting
statutes and statutory regulation. Statutory Instrument No. 37 of 2005 as amended by SI 112 of 2009
gives particular exemption to named properties mainly schools run by churches, NGOs and other
charities. Over 100 properties have been exempted throughout the country under the following
categories: colleges, schools, hospitals, orphanages, skills training centres and homes for the aged.
Rating Valuation Tribunal (RVT) response to objections based on rate relief is often directed to
applying to Councils. Application for relief must be disposed of within sixty days or it is deemed to
have been granted. Reliefs made by rating authorities are not made under any guidance and are not
publicized.

Most objectors at RVT sittings are retirees and the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to grant or order reliefs
to the aged. Reliefs granted by rating authorities may not be referred to full council because of time
constraint; and replies to applications for relief are not made public, therefore, the process is not
transparent.

Listing of property holders on the tax roll
Between 70% and 80% of property holders liable for land/property tax are listed on the tax roll.

Over eighty percent (80%) of property holders liable to pay owners rates are listed on the Valuation
roll because the process of preparation of a Roll starts with a Lands & Deeds registry Land Roll; and all
properties on the land Roll, whether exempt or not, are listed in the valuation roll. At the time of
compilation the valuation roll may be over 90% complete but this reduces over the time of the
valuation exercise and over the life span of the roll as new properties are surveyed and titled. Other
land taxes do not have this presumption of listing all properties and the circumstances for listing, i.e.
leasing or sale, are not permanent.

Collection of assessed property taxes
Between 70% and 80% of assessed land/ property taxes are collected. For instance in one of the major
cities of Zambia the valuation roll revealed the following total rateable values of different properties
as shown in Table 9. The values are in ZMW as of the time of valuation.

(GTZ, 2006) (Table 5.3 p10) found that amount of assessed land/property taxes collected vary widely
between councils with default rate being higher in larger councils. For instance, in 2005 collection
efficiency was 39% for Lusaka City Council compared with 90% for Petauke District Council and 79%
national (survey sample) average. There is sufficient legal provision for rating authorities to collect
100% rates, however institutional capacity in larger councils, including manning levels, staff training
and logistical support, is not matched with task of dealing with large tax roll.

Receipts and costs of property tax
The amount of property taxes collected is between 3 and 5 times the cost of staff in charge of
collection. Institutional capacity in smaller councils, including manning levels, staff training and
logistical support, is still a challenge in order to improve revenue collection.

This panel focused on one of the main themes in the LGAF process; i.e. Dispute resolution and conflict
management. The objective was to assess whether the land governance structures have proper
dispute resolution. From governance point of view it is important there exists institutions for dispute
resolution and that these are handled in a timely and transparent manner.

In Zambia, land dispute resolution is commonly reached through the judicial system via litigation,
which is initiated through a lawsuit against another. The Constitution poses an obligation to promote
values enshrined in it when resolving disputes at all levels. The performance of the land dispute
resolution bodies and structures require constant assessment to capture and analyse the challenges,
gaps and shortcomings of the system and the barriers that individuals face in accessing justice.

Assignment of responsibility for conflict resolution
There are parallel avenues for dispute resolution but cases cannot be pursued in parallel through
different channels and evidence and rulings may be shared between institutions to minimize the scope
for forum shopping.

Legislation existed which recognized the judicial court system as a platform for conflict resolution as
well as the Chiefs Act as one which enables Traditional leaders to resolve conflicts in traditional areas.
While the Law recognizes these parallel systems the Expert felt that the public was not able to easily
access these institutions due to cost and lack of information.

There are parallel avenues that exist alongside the judicial resolution channel through the courts of
law, i.e. the Lands Tribunal, Traditional Courts and Alternative Dispute Resolution were disputes are
settled outside court. These forums aside from the traditional courts are regulated by pieces of
legislation under which they are established and they provide rules that bind them. These rules
further bring to light the processes and procedures of appeals from one Court to another as such
Courts of law are bound to share rulings and other court documents during appeals and create
responsibilities for both channels that are clear in resolving disputes. The Ministry of Lands, Natural
Resources and Environmental Protection also provide spaces to resolve land related disputes.
Responsibilities of the mentioned channels of dispute resolution are not widely known by members
of the public. Neither, are they acquainted with the processes and procedures on how to bring their
disputes before any of the forums.

                                                                     65
Public accessibility of conflict resolution mechanisms
Institutions for providing a first instance of conflict resolution are accessible at the local level in less
than half of communities but where these are not available informal institutions perform this function
in a way that is locally recognized.

There are 505 Local Courts situated in all the 10 provinces of Zambia. Under the Zambian Justice
system, Local Courts are at the lowest in recognition. However, they remain unlimited to reach the
rural communities that leave in far off areas from where they are situated. One of the challenges rural
communities face hinges on transportation to and from the Local Courts plus legal costs that may be
required. In turn, they resort to accessing traditional courts or other alternative ways of resolving
disputes that are very affordable and convenient. Civil Society Organizations such as Zambia Land
Alliance, National Legal Aid Clinic for Women and the Legal Resources Foundation, have established
paralegal desks /centres in urban/peri urban and rural communities to help promote access to justice
for the poor. These institutions provide legal and paralegal services on land disputes. However, their
ability to provide legal and paralegal services to all the communities in Zambia is limited due to various
barriers such as human resource and financial support. Community members also lack information on
their ability to fight for property and land rights; this is evidenced in many cases that have been taken
up by the above-mentioned civil society institutions.

Encouragement of mutually accepted agreements through informal dispute resolution systems
There is a local, informal dispute resolution system that resolves a significant number of conflicts in
an effective and equitable manner but which is not recognized in the formal judicial or administrative
dispute resolution system. There are informal dispute resolution systems that resolve conflicts at local
level throughout the country which are culturally acceptable, effective, as well as financially and
geographically accessible by the rural poor. These are referred to as traditional courts or Chiefs
councils in certain localities. Traditional courts are interpreted to be recognized by the Local Courts
Act; however, they are not considered as part of the formal/ official judicial dispute resolution system,
although formal dispute forums have in practice accepted rulings of the informal forums as evidence
when brought before the courts. The work of paralegals is also informal; however, they play a key
role in ensuring that local community members access justice. They provide paralegal advice and
resolve disputes in communities by bringing community members together through negotiating
interests of both parties in the dispute with an aim of reaching a resolution. They are also mediators
in the various communities they work in and significant numbers of disputes are resolved at these
levels. Some of these disputes are related to land and property.

Process for appealing disputed rulings
A process exists to appeal rulings on land cases at high cost and the process takes a long time/ the
costs are low but the process takes a long time. A system is in place to appeal rulings on land cases in
the judicial system. For example, if one is unhappy with the decision of the local courts, he/she can
appeal to the Magistrates court, the High Court and finally the Supreme Court. An individual or groups
of individuals can also bring cases before the Lands Tribunal which is equated to the High Court. If one
wishes to appeal a judgment delivered by the Lands Tribunal he/ she can appeal to the Supreme Court.

The process of land disputes being resolved by the Judicial Courts take long at all levels and end up
frustrating parties who bring their disputes before them. The costs that need to be met are equally
high and as such, most people cannot afford the fees of engaging a lawyer or the administrative costs
attached to filing court documents for appeal. The process of appeal is also not friendly to members
of the public who have little/no-legal knowledge. However, Alternative Dispute Resolution exists
alongside the judicial system. Its aim is to ensure that disputes are resolved in a timely, informal and
cost effective manner through arbitration, mediation and negotiation.

Proportion of Land disputes cases in the formal legal system
Land disputes in the formal court system are more than 50% of the total court cases. Zambia has
experienced a wave of illegal land allocations to both foreigners and locals either for investment in
agriculture, mining, urban development or other private use reasons countrywide. Thereby giving rise
to a number of land disputes especially in rural and peri –urban communities. This is evidenced by
the work of Zambia Land Alliance on its project titled Evidence Based Advocacy Around Large Scale
Land Acquisitions.

Timeliness of resolving conflicts in the formal system
It is to be noted that there is insufficient data to conclusively assess the time it takes in resolving land
conflicts. This requires further study but generally it was felt that given the court processes it would
be closer to the truth to indicate that a decision in a land-related conflict is reached in the first instance
court within 2 year or more for 90% of cases. Conflicts in the formal system are usually not resolved
in a timely manner as courts are overburdened with high numbers of cases and ineffective and
unfriendly processes and procedures of bringing about disputes before the courts, of which most cases
take long to finally reach a ruling.

Number of long-standing (> 5 years) land conflicts
It is difficult to assess the number of long-standing land conflicts. It has to be acknowledged, however,
that such cases do exist but what is required is to carry out baseline studies to ascertain the level of
such cases. For this reason it was felt that the share of long-standing land conflicts is greater than 20%
of the total pending land dispute court cases.

Conflicts of interest among public institutions
There is some separation in the roles of Land policy (implied from statutes) formulation, but not
between implementation and arbitration.

The role of the Ministry of Lands Natural Resources and Environment Protection (MLNREP) should
mainly be in the area of policy guidance, but is involved in land surveying and hence competing with
private surveyors. Similarly, the MLNREP is also involved with the Lands Tribunal in dispute resolution
through its mandate to appoint the Registrar. This clearly presents a potential and/or real conflict of
interest in cases where the Ministry is involved as a litigant in land disputes.

Another example of potential conflict of interest arises from how the Land Act is framed. The Lands
Act, Cap 184 vests all land in Zambia absolutely in the President who holds it in perpetuity for and on
behalf of the people of Zambia. The President is empowered to grant or alienate land vested in him in
State land to any Zambian and non- Zambians of certain categories subject to the conditions outlined
under the Lands Act. All land in Zambia is required to be administered and controlled by the President
for the use or common benefit, directly or indirectly of the people of Zambia (GRZ, 1995a). Some of
the stakeholders feel that placing all land including customary land, in the care of the Republican
President gives too much power to one office and makes it difficult to distribute land equally (ZLA,
2005). The great powers vested in the President in matters of land alienation have the potential to
lead to conflicts of interest or are sensitive to abuse in cases of implementation and arbitration. For
instance, in a land dispute between rural communities and leaseholders or investors, the President
can rule in favour of investors at the expense of the local people who may end up being evicted from
their customary land.




                                                                      69
When you deal again with customary land, the Chief13 is the administrator and when it comes to land
conflict arbitration, he is also the arbitrator, which encourages biasness or lacks independence of
judgement.

Co-ordination and co-operation among public institutions
The mandated responsibilities of the various authorities dealing with land administration issues are
defined but the institutions responsible for implementing these various functions of land
administration are many and there is inadequate co-ordination among them. Institutions operate
within their statutory framework, and often without much co-ordination and co-operation and often
with overlapping powers, functions, and jurisdiction.

For example, the Commissioner of Lands relies on surveys by Department for surveying and mapping.
Some decisions on subdivisions come from the Ministry of Local Government and Housing (through
local authorities). Land use planning appraisals are made by the land use planning section of the
Ministry of Agriculture. It is therefore asking too much to expect the various ministries to make
expeditious decisions in a seamless fashion (Mulolwa, 2002); (Sichone, 2011).

Another example which relates to the function of physical planning is that the Department of Physical
Planning, Provincial Planning Authorities, the Agricultural Land Use and Technical Services Unit in the
Ministry of Agriculture and the Planning section in the Department of Resettlement in the Office of
the Vice-President are all engaged in planning. This multiplicity of institutions involved in planning
leads to overlaps and duplication of efforts.

Overlaps between different levels of government in land administration
There is a clear division of land-related responsibilities between the different levels of administration
and government but there are major overlaps which are experienced.

The overlaps involve interference by higher levels of government into the roles of the lower level
institutions. The responsibility is actually with the local level institutions but the higher authorities
may overrule the decisions of the former. For example, in addition to the Ministry of Lands, Natural
Resources and Environmental Protection (MLNREP), other institutions that play a role in the process
of land administration are local authorities. These institutions which include District, Municipal and
City Councils have been given delegated authority to discharge land administration functions on behalf
of the Commissioner of Lands. Local authorities fall under the Ministry of Local Government and
Housing and not the MLNREP. This therefore makes it difficult for the MLNREP to supervise local
authorities. Thus, in the event that local authorities commit a breach, there are no direct sanctions
from the MLNREP. The sanctions can only be taken by the Minister for Local Government on behalf of
the MLNREP under the circumstances. In practice, the MLNREP has been taking sanctions against local
authorities when found at fault by suspending them from administering land or making
recommendations to the Commissioner of Lands in their respective localities. This measure by the
Minister of the MLNREP is however, not legally provided for under any statute, statutory instrument
or regulation (Sichone, 2011); (Mwiche, 2013).

The other practical examples to show the vertical overlap in the execution of duties are:
o Survey Department - Head Quarters (HQ) under MLNREP carries out cadastral survey works and
    the same is done by Regional Survey office under MLNREP.
o Department of Forestry (HQ) under MLNREP executes the same roles or responsibilities as the
    Department of Forestry at District level.

Land Information Management System
The maintenance and accessibility of land rights information in Zambia faces serious financial and
technical challenges. This has led to a poor or inadequate land information management system which
fails to fully meet the needs of various users.

Even though the Ministry of Lands, Natural Resources and Environmental Protection (MLNREP)
recently implemented a computerized land based information system called (Zambia Integrated Land
Management and Information System (ZILMIS), the Ministry still remains dominantly centralized in
Lusaka and still faces problems of poor record keeping and slow processing of title deeds (GRZ, 2014).
The poor record keeping on land has made the information not to be maintained in a uniform way. It
is fragmented, and do not seem to aid decision-making on land based issues. This information is
available to interested institutions at reasonable cost but is likely to be incomplete and data is
maintained in different formats, scales, accuracies, extents, is often damaged or missing (Sichone,
2011). It has been observed that limited and inadequate flow of information and the structural
deficiencies has led to lack of transparency and accountability in the process of land administration.

Overlaps of Rights (based on tenure typology)
There are some overlaps of rights (based on tenure typology) which occur mainly because the Legal
framework and procedures for land-related matters deal with land-related matters very differently
and effective mechanisms for addressing overlap are not in place.

There is no problem with overlapping rights on land because it is normal to have overlapping rights
but the problem may be with the conflicting rights or when overlapping rights cause conflicts. For
example rights on the forests and wildlife, there is a conflict because chiefs or traditional rulers are
administering land (user) rights in the forests but not on the resources (trees and minerals), this is
done by other government departments.

The other good example of such overlaps is the issue of resettlement schemes. Since most
resettlement schemes are established in customary areas, the question of determining whether land
under Resettlement schemes becomes State land, or remains customary land or becomes a hybrid
category has been raised by some chiefs. Some chiefs strongly feel that the land under the
resettlement schemes should remain under their jurisdiction as customary land. In practice,
institutions such as Provincial Planning Authorities, and the Department of Resettlement in the Office
of the Vice President believe that land under Resettlements is State land, while most chiefs contend
that it is customary land. There are no effective mechanisms for addressing this overlap or conflict.
The law is silent on how to resolve problems of land alienation where the interests of the chiefs and
the Department of Resettlement are at variance (Sichone, 2011); (Mwiche, 2013).

Under the Lands Act Cap 188, Land does not convert from customary to State by virtue of having title
to land but simply converts from customary tenure to leasehold tenure (public or private). The same
is true for forests that are gazetted under Customary land holding, the land still remain customary
except probably that the state has control over the resource (trees).

Ambiguities in the mandates of Public Institutions
There are some ambiguities in the institutional mandates of institutions which deal with land-related
matters very differently and effective mechanisms for coordination are not in place.

The administration of land in National Parks and Game Management Areas is regulated by the Zambia
Wildlife Act. However, there is a problem of institutional coordination in the administration of land in
Game Management Areas. This is largely caused by the fact that Game Management Areas are
situated in customary areas and therefore, conflicts between local people, Chiefs and the Zambia
Wildlife Authority often arise. Local authorities also face difficulties in the course of performing land



                                                   71
alienation functions in Game Management Areas, because the governing statutes clearly state that
the management of Game Management Areas is a preserve of the Zambia Wildlife Authority.

The law is silent on how to resolve problems of land administration where the interests of the local
people, the District Council, the chiefs and the Zambia Wildlife Authority are at variance. Very little
progress is usually made in land alienation in some rural districts bordering Game Management Areas
because of lack of clarity as to the jurisdiction and powers of chiefs, the local authority, and the Zambia
Wildlife Authority. There are also uncertainties regarding the boundaries of State land, customary land
and Game Management Areas in some districts.

Nevertheless, the Lands Act, and the Zambia Wildlife Act, requires that whenever land is being
alienated and converted to leasehold tenure in Game Management Areas, the Director General of the
Department of National Parks, Chiefs, and the local authorities concerned or the people who have
occupied land in these areas should be consulted. This approach is legally sound but it has not
addressed the problem where these various interests are in conflict, and which interest should prevail
(Sichone, 2011).

Development of Land Policies and Regulations
Efforts in the recent past have been made to develop land policies and regulations in a participatory
manner involving stakeholders but the process has not been fully consultative because some of the
relevant stakeholders like the poor and women have felt sidelined. Currently, there is no clear land
policy other than a draft which has remained a draft for almost a decade without being sanctioned.
Policy decisions are inferred from existing legislation.

The current land law (Lands Act of 1995) was enacted hurriedly under controversial circumstances
without adequate consultations of stakeholders, particularly chiefs, smallholder farmers, civil society
and ordinary citizens. The Lands Act of 1995 is based on liberalized market principles, which have led
to stiff competition in accessing land. This Land Law offers very little to poor families, and benefits
mainly rich and foreign entities. The law is weak in many respects including its lack of provision for


                                                                     72
sufficient minimum guidelines on the administration of customary land. This, in addition to the
unwritten nature of customary law or practices used to administer customary tenure, leaves room for
manipulation and corruption (ZLA, 2005); (ZLA, 2008).

At the moment, Zambia has no clear land policy. The last draft policy was made available 2006.
However, it still remains in draft and nothing has been agreed upon. Policy decisions are executed
through the existing Lands Act of 1995, Statutory Instruments by the Minister of Lands and ad hoc
pronouncements by the President. Efforts to have a national land policy since the 1990s have not been
successful due to many contentious issues associated with liberalized market policies, which is the
main thrust of the reforms. The process of formulating the land policy has also been taken over by
events such as the National Constitutional reforms that have taken long to complete. The lack of a
clear land policy makes land administration chaotic. The current land administration is characterized
by lengthy procedures of land acquisition, bureaucracy and corruption in land allocation, political
interference, and poor coordination of institutions responsible for various functions in land
administration. This confusion makes it very difficult for poor families to access land, later on to seek
legal justice in cases of land rights violations.

The law that governs the aspect of land administration in State land is contained in several statutes.
Currently, there are not less than ten statutes that have a bearing, directly or indirectly, on the system
of land administration in Zambia. This state of affairs in which there are many statutes dealing with
land alienation is not desirable and makes the system inefficient and ineffective. For instance, in
relation to agricultural land, the Lands Act, the Agricultural Lands Act and the Land Circular No. 1 of
1985, all make reference to the administration of agricultural land in Zambia. But even when one reads
all these statutes, the procedure for acquiring this land is not clear. There is overlap in these pieces of
legislation which creates uncertainty in the minds of the people and the institutions responsible for
land alienation.

Land Policies for Equity and Poverty Reduction.
Land policies in Zambia have tried to address equity and poverty reduction goals but progress towards
these is not regularly and meaningfully monitored by public institutions. Effective monitoring is usually
hampered by financial and human resource constraints in the institutions.

Zambia’s draft land policy makes an attempt to incorporate some equity and poverty objectives. The
draft land policy acknowledges the growing importance of the market in land allocation and it hence
recognizes that certain groups of citizens are sidelined in that process, because they do not have the
financial resources or because they are disadvantaged in some other way. These groups include the
poor, women and those households affected by HIV and AIDS. The Draft Land Policy stipulates that a
provision of a minimum of 30 percent of the available land in Zambia should be set aside for women
and other disadvantaged groups. However, there are no clear guidelines on how to allocate that 30
percent of the land. Further, the 30 percent allocation has been criticized as not being sufficient to
meet the demands for land for women and other disadvantaged groups. Apart from the proposed
land policy, there are other existing policies such as the Gender Policy which address equity and
poverty reduction goals particularly targeting women who are generally disadvantages in access to
resources such as land.

The proposal, that 30 percent of the land be demarcated and allocated to women is difficult to
monitor. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) systems under the various sectoral ministries including the
MLNREP are generally weak due to serious financial and human resource constraints. The M&E
systems are essentially non-functional and therefore do not meaningfully monitor the progress in the
30 percent land allocation to women in the country.

A few lessons from the LGAF can be noted in the country’s land governance system:
 16 out of a total 120 dimensions were scored A. These represent good practices e.g. rural land
    rights recognition
 33 dimensions were scored B and 39 were scored C, representing a total of 72 (60%) out of 120
    dimensions. This suggests that overall, the level of land governance in the country is average and
    that there is still room for further improvement. These improvements might not be urgent but are
    nonetheless required to bring about better land governance.
 25 dimensions were scored D. These represent the worst cases (weaknesses or bad practices) in
    the land governance system, thereby indicating areas that need urgent and immediate attention.
 4 dimensions could not be assessed due to lack of data either because they needed much more
    work to retrieve e.g. types of land disputes or the data was simply not available in the registries.
    2 dimensions could not be assessed because they were not applicable in the Zambian context.

The theme public provision of land information has the highest percentage of dimensions scoring A
(40%) and also has the highest percentage scores of D (35%). The second highest percentage (15%) of
score A is in management of public land followed by land use planning and management with 10%.
The clustering of B and C scores across the themes compares with the national picture apart from
public provision of land information. If we consider scores A and B together public provision of land
information leads with 55% followed by land use planning with 50%. Institutional arrangement and
policies had the lowest score of 15%.

4.2 Strengths of the land governance system
The preliminary assessment found a number of good practices in the Zambian Land governance
system. The strengths arise from the dimensions that were scored A (see Figure 6 for the entire score
sheet and Table 10 for score A
only) and include:                                        Distribution of dimension scores

4.3 Key issues for attention
A number of challenges were identified in the previous sections. This section focuses on the issues
that were scored D in the assessment with a view to identify any potential linkages, and causes and
effects. Based on the understanding that causes rather than symptoms are what should be addressed.
The causes are then used as the basis for formulation of actual recommendations and follow-up
actions.

4.3.1 Synthesis of issues


The diagram below (Figure 7) presents together the various land governance issues as identified

By numbers, the panel topics land tenure recognition and public provision of land information have
the most issues (six) followed by transfer of public land to private use with four. Rights to forests and
common land has three. Dispute resolution and institutional arrangements and policies each have two
issues. Public land management has one issue. It is clear much concern should be on land tenure
recognition and public provision of land information. The main issue for the former topic hinges on
coverage of rights protection and recording and mapping which are estimated at less than 50 %. For
public provision of information, the issues are diverse ranging from (high) cost of recording of rights,
lack of prescription law, non-usage of non-documentary evidence to claim property on already
registered property, to outdated register.

For transfer of public land to private, the issues concern the lack of benefit sharing information in
majority of contracts, the lack of policies on cross-sector coordination and identification of land for
investment, and the inadequate transparency in the disposal of public land. The lack of legal provisions
for co-existence of land rights e.g. with mining rights, and direct recording group rights without
registration of the group first, and the low rate of conversion of land to destined use are the issue for
rights to forest and common lands. The issues for dispute resolution and conflict management relate
to high number of land disputes in formal courts in high duration for resolving disputes in courts. The
lack of mechanisms for addressing overlaps in land rights and institutional coordination are the main
challenges regarding institutional arrangements and policies. The high rate of conversion of public
land to private use is the main concern for public land management.

4.3.2 Cause – effect analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to identify potential linkages between the various issues discussed
above. There are twenty four (24) issues that were identified affecting land governance in Zambia.
These have been grouped into six main categories:
    Inadequate policy, legal, and institutional framework (PLIF),
    Inadequate data management,
    Low coverage of recording and mapping,
    Inadequate land administration process,
    Inadequate disputes resolution, and
    Illegal land transactions.

                                          Figure 8: Problem analysis


From Figure 8 it is clear that challenges in the land governance of Zambia are more structural and
procedural in nature. Under the PLIF are included policy, legal and institutional issues. Under process
are included issues of public land disposal, process costs, conversions and contractual information.
Issues of recording and mapping are under coverage. Use of non-documentary evidence, resolution
of and number of land disputes are dispute resolution. There are potential linkages between the PLIF,
recording and mapping coverage, high illegal transactions and land administration process. We see
that the challenges in coverage may be embedded in the PLIF, while illegal land transactions may be
due to challenges in the process e.g. the high transaction costs for many Zambians. All these challenges
lead to a not so good land governance system, here referred to as “Challenged land governance” from
the perspective of international best practices (LGAF). This analysis then assists in identifying key
points for interventions.


4.4 Recommendations
Arising from the cause – effect analysis above, four intervention areas were identified as indicated by
the four green arrows in Figure 9 below. These refer to the (1) policy, legal and institutional
framework, (2) data management, (3) land administration process and (4) dispute resolution. Under
each intervention area, a number of recommendations are made. Annex 2 provides the full list of
issues and recommendations according to the panel topics.

   4.5 Lessons and next actions
   A few lessons from the LGAF can be noted in the country’s land governance system:
    There are few dimensions that were scored A. These represent good practices e.g. rural land rights
       recognition
    The majority of the dimension assessments are concentrated at scores B and C. This suggests that
       much needs to be done to improve the level of land governance in the country.



                                                      81
   There are several dimensions that were scored D and these represent weaknesses in the land
    governance system, indicating also areas needing urgent attention.
   Some dimensions could not be assessed due to lack of data either because they needed much
    more work to retrieve or the data was simply not being collected in the registries e.g. types of land
    disputes

Some immediate next actions that will be required to address the noted challenges include:
 Data digitalization (local authorities and dispute records) and recording of types of court cases.
   There was a data gap noted in this respect.
 Apart from synchronising and linking public registers, they should be re-structured to ensure that
   they speak to all the indicators and dimensions.
 To address the human capacity issue, a new education program in land governance at
   undergraduate level is required.
 Although the land register/cadastre is searchable by either parcel or person ID, the parcel ID needs
   to be re-designed. Currently, the parcel ID is not tied to location and the length of the ID grows
   with the number of land sub divisions.


5 Conclusions
The LGAF process is an important ingredient in the land governance of the country as it reveals the
strengths and weaknesses in the Zambian land governance system in light of international best
practice. At the same, it identifies the key areas for intervention. These will be inputs in the design of
measures that will be used to reform the land governance system, for instance, the current
consultation process for reviewing the draft land policy. The design stage may generate new policy,
legislation, or new technology.

Zambia currently has a total population of 13.1 million (2010) people rising from about 5.7 million in
1980. About 58.5% live in rural areas and are dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods. The
economy is highly dependent on copper mining industry which accounts for 95% of export earnings.

Zambia is a multi-party state whose supreme law is the constitution which has been amended a
number of times with the latest amendment in 2016. The amended constitution continues to
guarantee land rights and introduces the establishment of the land commission. Further, the
constitution devolves administrative power to local governments. Although there are several policies
related to land, currently Zambia does not have a specific policy on Land. It has been grappling with
drafting the Land Policy for almost three decades. The draft land policy is under public consultation.
In addition there are several pieces of legislation that affect land, the main one being the Lands Act of
1995. To fill the gaps of the Lands Act a Customary Lands Bill is being drafted.

Zambia has a dual tenure system consisting of leasehold (Statutory) and customary tenure. This duality
has persisted since the colonial times. The term of leasehold is limited to a maximum of 99 years.
Other terms of leases include 14 year leases which are provisional, a 30 year leases for resettlement
schemes and a 30 year occupancy licences for housing improvement areas and 10 year land records
which are issued by local authorities. An important form of land holding is land that is reserved for
public use e.g. forests and national parks. This category overlaps leaseholds and customary areas. In
addition to leasehold and customary tenure there is also the unrecognised/ de-facto tenure which
actually constitutes large portion in and around urban areas e.g. in Lusaka it is estimated that over

                                                   82
60% of holdings are informal. It is estimated that 90% of the rural population subsist on customary
tenure.

There are several institutions which play various roles in land governance some of which overlap. The
main institution dealing with land is the MLNREP. The ministry deals with general administration of
land including allocation, surveying and registration. Other key players include the Ministry of
Agriculture, MLGH, the Vice President’s office and Ministry of Tourism and Arts and Ministry of Chiefs
and Traditional Affairs. Chiefs play an important role in the administration of customary land. There
are 4 paramount chiefs, 8 senior chiefs and 240 chiefs country wide.

The preliminary assessment found a number of good practices in the Zambian Land governance
system with regard to international best practices and these include:

   The formal recognition of tenure rights in rural areas (individuals and groups) as specified under
    the Zambian Constitution and Lands Act;
   Possibility of regularising of urban informal settlements as provided by the new Urban and
    Regional Planning Act of 2015. This aspect was also included in the repealed Housing (Statutory
    and Improvement Areas) Act;
   The prompt transfer of acquired land to destined use and timely compensation of owners;
   Collection of most agreed payments from private parties on the lease of public lands;
   A one stop shop for investment applications which is housed at the Zambia Development Agency;
   Searchable public land register/cadastre which are easily accessible with published fee schedules
    and contain private encumbrances, restrictions and spatial records; and
   Valuation rolls which are publicly accessible for all taxable properties

The identified weaknesses (issues) in the land governance system as compared to international best
practices are summarised below:
 Less than 50% land rights are protected in practice or recorded and mapped (including women’s
    rights);
 The cost of on-demand recording of rights and property transfer exceeds 5% of the property value,
    hence illegal transactions are high;
 Less than 50% of public land is not disposed of through open tender and lack benefit sharing
    information;
 There is no policy for prior land identification for investors and for cross sector coordination on
    land use;
 Non-documentary forms of evidence are almost never used (in statutory areas) to obtain
    recognition of claims to property;
 Different public land registers are not synchronized, linked nor regularly updated;
 The formal court system takes too long to dispose of most land related cases;
 There is no effective mechanism for dealing with institutional overlaps in land related matters
