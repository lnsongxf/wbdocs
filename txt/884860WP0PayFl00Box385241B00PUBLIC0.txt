Note
1. See also the emphasis given to employment security and recruitment in the seven human resource management practices identified by Pfeffer (1998a, 1998b) as key
to organizational effectiveness. These have been validated more widely, though an empirical review of the impact of these practices found no direct relationship between
employment insecurity and organizational performance. The review did note that insecurity seemed to hinder development of other useful human resource management practices
with a stronger link to performance (Ahmad and Schroeder 2003).

          In considering the first question, it is important to underscore       They thus play a major part in influencing employee attitudes
          that these are likely to be informal, “between the rules” changes      toward the organization and their jobs (Purcell and Hutchinson

          public sector in the managerial and academic literatures since the     manager’s role in modest modifications to a staff member’s work
          1970s has highlighted that the real tradeoff is between increased      allocation, responding as well as possible to the skills of the

          input-oriented type of governing with accountable scrutiny” (Koch      staff. First, it seems reasonable to assume that putting money

          confirmed by the research in the United Kingdom by Purcel              on PRP. Second, managers will have a heightened awareness of
