     fish-processing plants, ships, and other sources. The quantities of solid waste generated exceed disposal and treatment capacity. In addition, habitat degradation
     threatens marine assets such as coral reefs, while terrestrial threats include timber harvesting and destruction of mangroves. These environmental challenges could
     hamper the country’s economic growth especially if they undermine tourism.

     This project aims to establish a solid waste management system to reduce the risks of contamination associated with accumulated wastes and sea dumping. It also
     seeks to build human and technical capacity for environmental management. The four components of the project are: (i) a regional solid waste management program
     in the North Province, which is under-served by waste management facilities; (ii) capacity building for the country’s environmental agencies and regulators to manage
     the needs of a fragile environment; (iii) technical assistance for strengthened environmental management and monitoring to expand the knowledge base regarding
     critical natural resources; and (iv) project management and communications.

      In February 2014, the Bank approved the government’s request for a one-year extension of the project closing date to end-June 2015, a reallocation of project funds
     among existing disbursement categories and related revisions to certain project aspects. The Board approved additional financing of $3.3 million in April 2015 to
     support some cost overruns and allow the project to meet its objective of establishing and utilizing an integrated regional solid waste management system, with a
     six-month extension to the project closing date. Some of the cost overruns are being borne by the government of Maldives.

     KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED:
     Components 2 and 3 were completed in 2013, including the creation of a cadre of trained civil servants, enhanced access to information from environmental
     monitoring and research to support planning processes, and community participation in environmental management in 100 percent of the targeted islands to exceed
     the project target of 50 percent.
     A waste incinerator has been built on the designated uninhabited island, and the residual waste transfer vessels are expected to be completed by November 2015. A
     consultant to provide hands-on training to Fenaka Corporation, the state-owned entity responsible for managing and operating the regional solid waste management
     system, is expected to be on board by early October 2015.

     The project’s final target for the user fee collection in 50 percent of the participating islands under the original credit was achieved 1.5 years ahead of schedule. Overall,
     62 percent of households in the participating islands are anticipated to pay user fees by end of the project period. Forty percent of the islands are carrying out waste
     segregation and composting.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
This project is being implemented under the multi-donor Maldives CCTF that was established in 2009 to support a climate-resilient economy and society in the
Maldives through adaptation, mitigation, and low-carbon development. The first phase of the CCTF was funded by the European Union (EU) and the Government of
Australia, with a total allocation of $10.3 million. Three projects have been implemented under the CCTF to date, all completed on November 30, 2014:
■■     The Wetlands Conservation and Coral Reef Monitoring for Adaptation to Climate Change Project ($3.8m) supported community-based wetland management
       including ecotourism and drainage management on Hithadhoo island (Addu/Seenu Atoll) and Fuvahmulah island (Gnaviyani Atoll), rainwater harvesting on
       Ukulhas island (North Ari Atoll), coral reef monitoring (North and South Male Atolls), and capacity building for the local government.
■■     The Clean Energy for Climate Mitigation Project ($2.53m) supported solar energy generation, energy conservation and efficiency improvements, and technical
       assistance on G.Dh. Thinadhoo island.
■■     The Ari Atoll Solid Waste Management Pilot Project ($1.33m) supported the development of an island-level integrated solid waste management system in five
       pilot islands of the Ari Atoll and a residual waste transfer system for off-island disposal.
With a supplemental EU contribution of €3.85m, a second phase of the CCTF (CCTF-II) is supporting the Climate Change Adaptation Project, aimed at helping the
government to further implement activities undertaken under the Wetlands Conservation and Ari Atoll projects in the country’s southern-most atolls (Addu and
Gnaviyani). The project aims, more specifically, to: (i) strengthen community wetland advisory boards in terms of formal recognition and institutional consolidation,
and provide a mechanism for their continued involvement and improved capacity; (ii) strengthen the web-enabled database system developed under the first phase of
the CCTF to ensure continued uptake, sustain confidence of tourist resorts in the National Coral Reef Monitoring Framework, and supplement it with a support facility
for resorts; (iii) expand the involvement of tourist resorts beyond coral reef monitoring to mainstreaming climate change into resort management; and (iv) set up a
system for waste management that is locally acceptable and operationally viable.

KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED:
Interventions in wetland management and solid waste management in the Addu and Gnaviyani Atolls are expected to benefit more than 4,800 households through
enhanced tourism, livelihood opportunities, and ecosystem conservation. The coral reef monitoring intervention will directly benefit at least 10 private tourism
operators. Through interventions in capacity building for mainstreaming of climate adaptation in island level planning, the project is expected to benefit all the 20
atoll councils and 66 island councils in the country and the communities serviced by these councils.

KEY DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS:
The Ministry of Environment and Energy, the Ministry of Fisheries and Agriculture, Ministry of Tourism, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Marine Research
Center, Maldives National University, and atoll and island councils.

          *As of August 31, 2015

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The project supports the government of Maldives to develop the education sector, with special focus on primary and secondary education. The operation was prepared
     through a process of consultation and collaboration with a broad range of stakeholders: the Ministry of Education (MoE), MoFT, the atoll education agencies, public
     and private employers, public and private education institutions, academics, and school principals, teachers, parents, and students. Prior to this project, the Bank had
     undertaken rigorous policy and technical analysis through a programmatic series of education-sector reports, whose findings and recommendations were incorporated
     into the project’s design. The project includes three components: (i) national-level education development; (ii) school-level education development; and (iii) project
     management, monitoring and evaluation, and program development.

     It is assisting the government in developing a system of national assessments of learning outcomes to inform education policy, and also conducting regular school-
     level quality assurance reviews to feed into school improvement activities. In addition, the project supports government efforts to develop a network of good quality
     secondary and higher secondary schools, and strengthen the human resource capabilities of education officials in the country’s atolls and the capital, Male’. The project
     is also helping the MOE prepare a master plan for the development of higher education.

     KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED:
     ■■     The survival rate through higher secondary education has achieved the 2015 end target rate (20 percent).
     ■■     Eighty percent of schools in 42 percent of atolls have been trained and are currently engaged in quality assurance school self-evaluation and school-based profes-
            sional development activities.
     ■■     There are 45 MoE staff members who have completed certificate level short-term training courses, and 10 MoE staff who have commenced masters or bachelor
            degrees in education. The MoE has also commenced a set of degree, associate degree and diploma programs for school principals, deputy principals, and leading
            teachers, with 82 candidates currently enrolled in these programs.
     ■■     The enrichment of physical learning environments of secondary schools has made substantial progress, with 23 secondary schools (out of 37 in the country)
            receiving information and communications technology equipment and associated material and software to date.
     ■■     The MoE is scheduled to conduct the national assessment of learning outcomes in September-October 2015.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The project aims to enhance budget credibility, transparency, and financial reporting of central government finances. It will support three activities: (i) strengthening
the public financial management environment by enhancing the legislative and institutional framework, the fiscal framework, and debt and cash management; (ii)
strengthening the public accounting system to improve financial reporting practices and decision-making, as well as internal financial controls, internal auditing, and
procurement management practices; and (iii) providing support for project management within the MoFT.

KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED:
The expected outcomes of the project are: (i) reduced deviation between actual expenditures and the original budget; (ii) increased and timely public access to key
fiscal information; (iii) improved quality of debt data recording and reporting; and (iv) enhanced coverage and quality of the internal audit function.

To date the project has:
■■     Completed an analysis of the legislative framework relevant to PFM, and identified a sequenced plan of revising/amending the laws.
■■     Upgraded the debt recording and reporting system, with the data reconciled; prepared a framework to issue sovereign guarantees, reviewed the draft National
       Debt Strategy with an aim to improving it; designed monthly and annual debt reports and conducted an assessment of the debt division’s internal organization
       structure and made recommendations to strengthen it.
■■     Trained MoFT staff on how to formulate a Medium-Term Macro-Fiscal Framework. Basic training has been delivered on macro-fiscal modeling to officers within and
       outside the MoFT, and a new Macroeconomic Policy Coordinating Committee has been established and an early draft macro-fiscal statement prepared.
■■     Prepared a business blue print on budgeting and a new budget calendar. Budget ceilings have been established for the FY 2016 budget based on the initial
       macro fiscal statement.
■■     Carried out urgent technical and functional upgrades in the public accounting system to closely monitor budget execution. System-generated budget execution
       reports comparing budgets with actual expenditures are being used, and commitments are gradually being captured in the system.
