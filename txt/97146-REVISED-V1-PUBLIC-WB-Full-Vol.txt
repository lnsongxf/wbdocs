Preface
For about ten years, from the early 2000s to 2010, the Ugandan economy grew at an average of 7 percent per annum. This achievement was
accompanied by a dramatic decline in poverty rates (from 68.1 percent in 1992/93 to 33.2 percent in 2012/13, using the international poverty line of
$1.90 [2011 PPP]). Since then, a number of external and domestic factors slowed down the GDP growth rate (3.3 percent in 2013/14) which
rebounded to 5 percent in FY2014/15 and an estimated 4.6 percent in FY2015/16.

Uganda is about to become an oil-producing country, and the Ugandan population hopes that the new resource will accelerate economic growth, reduce
poverty and enable the country to reach its long-term goal of becoming an upper middle income country in less than thirty years. The timing of the
project and its impact will depend on the level of international oil prices, which are extremely low today. However, we have reasons to believe that
the price of oil will rise again and that Uganda’s future oil production will have a major influence on the country’s economic and fiscal performance.

The experience of other countries, in Africa and other parts of the world, shows that large scale production of oil, gas and other mineral resources offers
great opportunities, but also presents major challenges. In Angola, during most of the 2000s, high oil production and high international prices
boosted GDP growth, but a massively expanded and poorly managed public investment program created congestion, inefficiencies and inflationary
pressures, instead of developing - slowly and soundly - the necessary long-term physical and human capital.

A new Uganda Country Economic Memorandum entitled “Economic Diversification and Growth in the Era of Oil and Volatility” has been prepared
by a team of World Bank economists working in close cooperation with a Ugandan Government team. The memorandum discusses the prospects of
oil and mineral production in Uganda and uses the lessons of international experience to propose an agenda of policy and institutional reforms
aimed at maximizing the positive impact of oil production and avoiding the “resource curse” that affected negatively Nigeria, Angola and too many
other new producers of oil, gas and minerals in the world.

We shall not try to summarize the main conclusions of the report but would like to emphasize the following six messages, which - we believe - can
guide future government and donor policies.

First Message. The government views economic diversification as a key component of its strategy. The report fully supports that view. Past experi-
ence shows a strong correlation between diversification and long-term economic success. The report argues that Uganda does not need to remain a
low-productivity economy dominated by agriculture and a mainly informal services sector. A product space analysis shows that Uganda has
potential for the emergence of a modern manufacturing sector focused on agro-processing and light manufacturing, which would serve both the
domestic and the regional markets and would provide substantial export opportunities for a variety of small and medium-sized enterprises.

Second Message. Improved governance and a conducive business environment are essential to promote the type of private sector development that
will make economic diversification possible. However, a sound and well managed public investment program, largely financed by oil-related
government revenue, is equally essential to remove constraints to private sector growth.


x            Uganda Country Economic Memorandum: Economic Diversification and Growth in the Era of Oil and Volatility
Large investments in public infrastructure are urgently needed in the whole country and, in particular, in the underdeveloped and very poor Northern
region. For the long-term, increased public spending in education and health is even more critical. This will offer opportunities to all and also create
the well-trained labor force which a modern manufacturing and services sector will need.

Third Message. The report includes a wealth analysis which shows that oil-producing countries should invest to develop the long-term capital (phys-
ical and human) that will replace non-renewable oil resources when depleted. Quality, however, is more important than speed. A massive increase in
public spending and a poorly designed and implemented public investment program will do more harm than good, stimulating a number of negative
forces (resource curse, Dutch Disease) that will block the development of non-oil economic activities. The report advocates a “sustainable investing
approach” that combines substantial savings with investment and links the size and speed of the public investment program to progress in absorptive
capacity.

Fourth Message. Regional integration already helped Uganda diversify its production and its exports. More important than regional free trade are
measures that will reduce regional transaction costs, notably investments in regional transport and energy infrastructure, and also improvements in
logistics services. More complex is the issue of the creation of a monetary union. The example of the Euro-zone shows how difficult it is for individual
countries in a monetary union to make the necessary macroeconomic and fiscal adjustments to external and domestic shocks. More thinking is essential
before final implementation of the reform.

Fifth Message. More than one third of the Ugandan population remains poor and vulnerable to shocks and recent economic growth did not reduce
income inequality. This is a major problem for many developed and developing countries today. Three types of measures could help reduce poverty
and income inequality in Uganda. First, a significant infrastructure development program in the underdeveloped Northern region. Second,
improved education and health services overall and in particular in the North. Third, the report discusses the feasibility of direct transfers to the
poor linked with behavioral improvements (sending boys and girls to primary school, reducing dropout rates, vaccination and other basic health
services). That type of scheme may be tested on a small scale in the poorest communities.



Sixth Message. The CEM describes in general terms how Uganda can experience long-term growth, fight poverty and meet the challenges that come
with the development of new resources. Much more needs to be done to translate the proposed strategy into specific action plans. This should be the
priority of future economic and sector work for the Ugandan government and for its development partners.

law, which establishes that 70 percent of the benchmark

not really limit spending, since the government can comply
with the saving rule while borrowing for additional expen-

2011, recurrent spending already rose by 10 percent creat-

b. Borrowing dynamics

47. The government may be tempted to spend in advance
some of its future oil revenue through substantial
borrowing on the financial markets. This may generate
short-term benefits through growth of private consumption
but would have negative long-term consequences, as
savings are sacrificed. It might also help to smooth
investment expenditures over time, taking into account the
limited absorptive capacity of the economy. The case of
Ghana is the most recent example that illustrates the need
to establish safeguards. The coming on stream of oil in
late 2010, which coincided with preparations for the 2012
presidential election, fuelled the formation of excessively
optimistic expectations, with negative consequences in
terms of fiscal prudency. Instead of using initial oil revenues
for fiscal consolidation, given Ghana’s high fiscal deficits,
the government raised expenditure and used future oil
revenues as collateral to increase its debt.

An Economic Development and
Diversification Strategy - Main Goals

Part I focuses on the importance of economic diversification for Uganda and on the prospects/challenges of oil and mineral development. It
addresses successively the following three issues: (a) Why diversification is important for economic development. (b) Where Uganda stands
in that area and why it should give a new impetus to its diversification strategy. (c) What are the prospects, possible impact, and challenges
associated with oil and mining development for Uganda’s economy.

It is structured as follows: Chapter 1 provides an overview of the salient features of the Ugandan economy including the country’s development
strategy and economic diversification dynamics. Chapter 2 examines the prospects and impact of oil and other extractives for Uganda.

         Key Messages and Conclusions:

     The report describes two paths to diversification. The
     first one aims at expanding productive capabilities.
     Over the past twenty years, 60 new products
     appeared in Uganda’s export basket, including
     cooking oils, processed fruit and vegetables, fish,
     flowers, wood, minerals, chemicals, high-value
     leather, and construction materials. Accelerating
     Uganda’s economic transformation, however, will also
     require expanding productive knowledge beyond
     existing productive capabilities. The report outlines a
     methodology for the selection of increasingly complex
     products that Uganda may wish to promote in the
     context of a longer-term development strategy.

     Conclusions: Elements of a short- and long-term
     strategy:                                                                             Uganda

wage bill given low unit cost of labor in the sector. The
manufacturing sector accounts for 22 percent of total added

percent) and construction (7 percent); the gradual modern-

construction. With 47 percent of total value added, services

     The PCI measures the complexity of a good based on
     its ubiquity (that is, the number of countries that make
     it) and the diversification of the countries exporting
     that product (that is, the number of other products that
     they make) (Hidalgo and Hausmann, 2009; Hausmann
     et al. 2011). A product that requires significant tacit
     knowledge will be hard to make and hence will be
     produced by few countries. However, if these countries
     have a large stock of tacit knowledge, they should be
     able to use it to make more products and hence should
     be more diversified.

     A product with a high PCI requires more complex know–
     how in order to be produced/exported. The PCI used
     in this paper ranges from 0 to 10 and higher numbers
     reflect greater sophistication. The correlation between
     the two technological sophistication measures is not
     monotonic. On average, primary products have the
     lowest PCI while low-tech products can have a PCI that is
     lower or higher than resource-based products.

     Box 1.4: A Short-term Export Diversification Strategy

     Overall Strategy: Diversify first into those potential manufactured exports (including processed raw materials) that Uganda is capable of exporting (high capabilities). This may not lead to the most
     sophisticated exports in the short term, but it will nurture industrial/manufacturing skills that are a prerequisite for accelerated diversification into more sophisticated products. This strategy will lay
     the foundations for the large-scale development of skills necessary for a larger manufacturing sector. An important part of a similar process in Asia involved skills development through learning by
     exporting factory-produced products. This pattern of diversification was the stepping stone to Asia’s competitive edge in manufacturing today and has helped several Asian countries attain middle-
     income status in record time (for example, Malaysia, China, Vietnam, Sri Lanka)

     Product Focus:

     •	      Three new light manufacturing industries; garments, leather and wood products - are flagged by the PS approach as opportunities for Uganda. Evidence from Asia and sub-Saharan Africa
             (Lesotho, Ethiopia) shows that even landlocked countries can have competitive light manufacturing industries that use imported inputs when domestic ones are unavailable. Uganda has
             local raw materials - hides and skins, and wood - for the leather and wood related manufactured exports listed in these industries.

     •	      Several agriculture-related processing industries including cereals, dairy products, more types of cooking oils, and new sugar products could be strengthened. Some similar ones are already
             being exported in small amounts. Most potential ones are distinct from Uganda’s current new exports because they involve some degree of manufacturing, have reasonably high levels of
             sophistication, and Uganda’s high capabilities in these industries can be instrumental in diversifying in them.

     •	      A few chemicals and metal product industries which have sophistication levels that are lower than many current exports but for which Uganda’s capabilities are higher could, be fostered.
             They could be promising stepping stones to more sophisticated diversification in the longer term.

Box 1.6: Rationale for the Use of Macroeconomic Models in the Uganda CEM


The CEM estimates the potential contribution of oil production to economic growth at the beginning of oil exploitation as well as the resulting
structural economic transformation in the medium and long run.

In so doing, the CEM relies on a macro-modeling framework (MacMod-UG) that uses Uganda macroeconomic and financial data
to project a growth path for the economy. This framework, which belongs to the IS-LM-AS (aggregate supply) models family, takes into
account interrelation between real domestic sectors, government financing, balance of payment, and monetary situation.1 MacMod-UG is a
macro-econometric model, which is mainly characterized by its capacity to estimate the growth rate of each sector by using specific produc-
tion function of each key sector. This allows the model to incorporate the new oil sector comprehensively in the framework although exoge-
nously. In fact, a separate module specific to oil sector provides key macroeconomic information (including value of oil production, investment,
domestic sales, exports, government revenue…), which is captured in the core MacMod-UG. This model also puts in coherence production
sector and government financing. Thus, the framework is adequate for analyzing fiscal rule scenarios related to the efficiency use of extractive
proceeds as well as evaluating the macroeconomic costs of front-loading infrastructure investments as recommended in the second National
Development Plan (NDP 2) under preparation. The MacMod-UG framework also includes the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF)
derived from NDP that is appropriate to assess the optimal impact of an exogenous shock (for example, emerging oil production) on multi-year
government spending.

In addition, the CEM uses a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model to analyze the structural transformation of
the Uganda economy beyond the first flow of oil as well as the impact of various shocks such as commodities price, productivity in each
sector, and fiscal and monetary policies. The DSGE is based on a synthesis of new-keynesian and new neoclassical models. It accounts for the
rational expectations of economic agents.2 To capture adequately the effects of a potential Dutch Disease, the DSGE model, calibrated on
Uganda data, distinguishes three production sectors (traded, non-traded, and oil sector). This model accounts for several important features
that are common in new keynesian model and developing countries, including Dutch disease, investment inefficiencies and weak tax systems.
Moreover, the DSGE compares three alternative policies: (i) the all-saving approach; (ii) the all-investing approach; and (iii) the sustainable
investing approach.

Furthermore, the CEM addresses distributional issues by using a standard Dynamic Recursive Computable General Equilibrium
(CGE MAMS) model. This model uses as baseline the macroeconomic outlook derived from the MacMod_UG and analyzes the impact of
various uses of oil proceeds on economic growth, household income, and MDGs.3

Finally, the impact of policy change and shocks on long-run economic growth (steady state) is examined by the way of an over-
lapping generations (OLG) model calibrated to Uganda macroeconomic and social data. This model emphasizes, among other issues, the
importance of public investment efficiency and improved revenue mobilization performance on long-term growth even before oil production.


1. The MacMod framework shares a number of common features with (i) the family of general equilibrium models which emphasizes intersectoral linkages (for example,
Input-Output and Social Accounting Matrix SAM multiplier models, and CGE models), and (ii) Consistency framework built around the flow of funds (for example, Financial
programming, and RMSM-X). However, it differs from these classes of models on the structure of the database (longitudinal data), and the degree of endogeneity of key
macroeconomic aggregates, including GDP and the general price level.
2. It has been implemented following the influential papers of Christiano, Einchenbaum and Evans (2005), and is now used by many in the analysis of Dutch Disease.
3. Distributional issues were also addressed through partial equilibrium regression analyses. This is the case for the analysis of using oil proceeds to reduce inequality and on
the impact of subsidies.

          Key Messages and Conclusions:
     the oil sector would be in the form of increased public
     investment, notably in three key sectors (infrastructure,
     health, and education). Oil-related government revenue
     would average US$2.   1 billion/year (2/3 of domestic
     revenue in FY2013/14).

     Conclusions:

     •	   The main policy challenge for the government
          will be to avoid/mitigate the resource curse. The
          first aspect of the resource curse is the Dutch
          Disease. The exploitation of oil, and other natural
          resources increases the supply, and drives down
          the price of foreign exchange in the domestic
          market, thus triggering an appreciation of the
          local currency in real terms. Rising currency
          values undermine exports of manufactures, and
          services, and slow down the growth of non-
          resource sectors. In Uganda, it would reduce the
          profitability of agricultural exports, and undermine
          the development of tourism. Another aspect of the
          resource curse is the volatility of oil prices. Volatility
          produces fluctuations in exchange rates, export
          earnings, output, and employment that discourage              Source: International Energy Agency (2012).

          resources may not give enough priority to the
          development of human capital through education,

          and government resource revenue may also crowd
          out non-resource revenue.

production from the largest reserves is unlikely to start
before FY2019/20. Since the construction of the refinery,
and the pipeline will take at least 3–4 years, oil production
from EA3A may start 1 or 2 years before the downstream
capacity (refinery, and pipeline) is in place. The government
indicated that it might use extracted crude oil to generate
electricity, and meet the growing local demand for power.

duction, and the development of the oil sector is provided

      Box 2.2: Basic Assumptions for the Projection of Future Oil Production

      •	      Stock Tank Oil Initially In Place (STOIIP)1 of 6.5 billion barrels, of which 1.3 billion is recoverable (923 million in EA1, 231 million in EA2 and 134 million in EA3A).

      •	      Oil production will begin in FY2017/18 as EA3A comes on stream, followed by EA1 and EA2 in FY2019/20. Production will peak in 2025, decline gradually thereafter and end in
              FY2044/45.

      •	      Total downstream capacity will reach 230,000 barrels/day, including 30,000 barrels/day processed by the refinery (which will begin production in 2019) and 200,000 exported through
              the pipeline.

      •	       Initial production of crude oil will be used for power generation until the downstream capacity is in place.

      •	      Thirty thousand barrels/day will be reserved for the refinery. Surplus production will be exported through the pipeline.

      •	      Total capital expenditures for the development of oil fields will reach US$7.6 billion. The construction of the refinery and the pipeline will cost US$4.5 billion and 3 billion, including a
              government equity contribution of US$2 million to the overall project (field development, refinery, and pipeline).

      •	      The long-term price of oil will average US$90 per barrel, with a 15 percent discount for Uganda’s oil due to high viscosity.

      •	      The pipeline will charge US$ 10.18 for each barrel of oil piped to the Kenyan coastline. This includes a US$0.18 transit fee.

ments concluded by the government, and the oil companies,
and assuming a long-term price of oil of US$90/barrel, 70
percent of the net present value of oil production will go
to the government. This is in line with agreements in other
new oil producing countries. In Ghana, the government’s
share of the net cash flow of offshore oil fields is about 69
percent.3

2.11. Oil production in Uganda is expected to generate
a significant stream of additional revenue for the gov-
ernment, yet the magnitude of this revenue stream will
largely depend on the future price for crude oil. Reve-
nue projections are very sensitive to the assumed oil price
(Figure 2.5). Before oil prices started declining heavily in
mid-2014, the price for one barrel of oil had hovered around
                                                                Source: MacMod Uganda.
the US$100 mark for several years. At this level, oil revenue
for the government would average close to US$2.5 billion
a year between 2017/18, and 2044/45. If the price for one        Figure 2.8: Uganda’s Per Capita GDP (With and Without Oil)
barrel of oil remains at US$50, average oil revenue will
only amount to about US$800 million a year. Furthermore,
the current low barrel price of below US$50 will generate
much lower additional government revenue and growth. In
line with the World Bank Commodity Markets Outlook,
the CEM assumes that oil prices will recover in the medi-
um-term to an average of US$90. In total this would gener-
ate US$57 billion in government revenue between 2017/18
and 2044/45, through the government share of oil profits,
royalties, income taxes, dividends, and interest on the 15
percent government equity in oil fields (see figure 2.6).
Additional government revenue will average US$2.1 bil-
lion/year (two-thirds of domestic revenue in FY2013/14),
and will reach US$4 billion in peak production years.

2.12. The largest contribution of Uganda’s petroleum              Figure 2.9: Uganda’s Trade Balance (With Oil)
will therefore be in the form of additional public invest-
ment in such key sectors as infrastructure, health, and
education. Oil revenue will offer a great opportunity to
meet some of the most important public spending needs,
and ease some of the country’s key economic constraints.
For example, a recent cross-country study based on firm
level data suggests that low productivity in Uganda can
largely be attributed to inadequate infrastructure.4 In addi-
tion, public spending in education, and health (in share of
GDP) declined from around 6.5 percent of GDP in 2003/04
to 4.5 percent in 2012/13. The result is growing pressure
on public services as high population growth rates lead to
overcrowded classrooms, and health facilities in many parts
of the country.
                                                                  Source: MacMod Uganda.

2.13. Consequently, a recent increase in public invest-         Figure 2.10: Uganda’s Nominal and Real Exchange Rate
ment is expected to continue during implementation of
the Second National Development Plan (NDP 2). During
the first National Development Plan (NDP 1), total develop-
ment expenditures rose from 7.7 percent of GDP in 2011/12
to 8.5 percent in 2013/14, mainly thanks to an increase in
domestic development, and investment expenditures aver-
aging 24 percent/year. The same trend is likely to continue
during NDP2. However, the government has to meet the 3
percent fiscal deficit limit (under the East African Monetary
Union convergence criteria that become binding in 2021).
Uganda will therefore need to slow down the growth of pub-
lic investment expenditures, thus allowing oil revenue to be
used for fiscal consolidation rather than to increase invest-
ment. Total public expenditure is thus projected to increase
gradually in line with rising oil revenue from the current 19

2.25. The contribution of the mining sector to the coun-
try’s GDP, exports, and government revenue remains
modest. The growth of the mining sector averaged 9.8 per-
cent in recent years, but its contribution to GDP averaged
only 0.3 percent. Government revenue increased from UGX
134 billion in 2010/11 to UGX 185 billion in FY2012/13
but did not exceed 2–3 percent of total government reve-
nue.7 Mineral exports (mostly gold, iron ore, silver, tin,
tungsten, vermiculite, cobalt and copper) accounted for 1
percent of total exports in 2012/13.8

2.26. Prospects, however, are positive and could be lev-
eraged through the promotion of linkages to the rest of
the economy. Uganda’s rich mineral wealth is virtually
untapped, but political and economic stability in the coun-
try, availability of geo-data, high world prices of minerals
and growing global demand, notably from emerging coun-
tries like China and India, led to significant increases in
FDI for the sector. To harness the exploitation of its miner-
al resources, the government must adopt a comprehensive
development-driven policy, focused on the value of the
derived demand through the mineral value chain. The Afri-
can Union argues that the contribution of the mining indus-
try to broad-based development will improve if the sector
is integrated through linkages into the national and regional
socio-economic fabric.

8. According to Yager (2010), the shares of mineral exports in total value of
exports were 4.4 percent for cement; 3.3 percent for iron ore and steel; 1.9
percent for gold; and 1.1 percent for cobalt.

Policy Priorities Around Four Building Blocks

Part II discusses how Uganda’s oil should be used as a tool to promote further economic diversification. The report proposes an action plan
organized around four building blocks: (i) Measures aimed at strengthening the benefits that the country expects to receive from its untapped
oil and mineral potential by enhancing exploration and negotiating good contracts with investors, while minimizing the negative social and
environmental impacts of oil and mining production. (ii) Macroeconomic and financial policy considerations (savings and consumption trade-
offs, borrowing and volatility concerns). (iii) Public sector management, including allocative and financial efficiency of public expenditure, and
efforts to minimize the possible crowding out of non-resources expenditures and aid. And (iv) Policies to promote private sector development.

Chapter 3 discusses the strategic implications of oil and other extractives in the short and medium term. Chapter 4 highlights the strategic
implications of extractives in the long term.

52            Uganda Country Economic Memorandum: Economic Diversification and Growth in the Era of Oil and Volatility
Box 3.1: Development of Local Industrial Capacity: Malaysia Oilfield Services and Equipment - A Regional Hub Creation Strategy


LCPs in the oil and gas sector are an integral part of Malaysia’s economic transformation plan. In its 2010 Economic Transformation Program, the government of Malaysia laid out a comprehensive package of
measures to transform the nation into a regional hub for oil field services and equipment (OFSE) industry.1 The Asian market for OFSE has been growing by 20 percent a year over the last decade and the sector
outlook is bright. The regional market for OFSE is fragmented, with players setting up operators in Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and Vietnam (unlike Europe and North America, where OFSE operators concen-
trate their activities in a few centers: Aberdeen, Stavanger and Houston). This creates an opportunity for Malaysia, which has a competitive domestic workforce, technically challenging domestic reserves that
drive a growing local demand for OFSE, and geographical proximity to resource-rich countries in Asia and the Middle East. To capitalize on these advantages, the government set out a strategy of complemen-
tary LCPs to incentivize the rationalization of local fabricators and the establishment of joint ventures with OFSE MNCs in critical value-adding activities. The objective is for Malaysia to become a regional hub in
2017. Some of the entry point projects (EPPs) identified by Malaysian government include:

- Attracting MNCs to bring a sizeable share of their global operations to Malaysia. Malaysia’s objective is to attract 10 to 20 major international companies which would bring approximately 10 percent of their
business to the country, thus creating over 20,000 jobs. A government body called Oil Field Services Unit was set up to oversee that development.

- Consolidating domestic fabricators. Domestic fabricators in Malaysia lack scale and are not cost-competitive, compared to major regional players. For example, domestic companies often hire large cranes
because the limited size of the market precludes purchasing them. Therefore, consolidation of major offshore structure fabricators in Malaysia would create around 5,000 jobs and would require PETRONAS to
award licenses to a few domestic fabricators.

- Developing capabilities and capacity through strategic partnerships and joint ventures. At present there are considerable gaps in the domestic OFSE industry. Malaysian companies lack capabilities and experi-
ence particularly in engineering and installation, which limits their ability to gain a strong share in the regional market. The objective is to incentivize domestic companies to form joint ventures with world class
companies to build their capabilities and track records. Malaysia’s ambition is to gain 15 percent of the shallow water and 50 percent of the deep water market in Asia by 2020 and create some 15,000 jobs.

Since the policy goal envisaged for the petroleum sector is to transform Malaysia into a regional hub for OFSE, the measure of local content levels in the OFSE sector would fall short of the government’s
objective. Instead, the following three performance indicators are monitored: (1) the amount of investment made by OFSE multinationals; (2) the number of successful mergers of fabricators; and (3) the number
of JVs between multinationals and local OFSE companies. Previous policies focused on maximizing local content levels and not on value addition, competitive advantage and sustainable growth2. Therefore a
combination of measures building the capacity of local suppliers and attracting FDI is a recipe for success.

Since inception of the program, consolidation of domestic fabricators established three sizeable Malaysian EPC entities out of eight small and medium-sized fabricators. Malaysia will now focus on helping
these companies take on the global stage. Aberdeen Drilling School set up a learning center in Malaysia to provide customized training in drilling practices and technology, cost reduction/unscheduled events
prevention, safety, communication and leadership. Aberdeen’s long-term plan is to use Malaysia as a base for its regional expansion. Several local companies linked JVs with foreign specialists, giving them access
to technology and gaining experience that better position them for future jobs and new markets. To attract more foreign MNCs, plans are underway to present Malaysian OFSE companies at international con-
ferences such as Offshore Europe and the World Gas Conference.3

Following the completion of a competitiveness diagnos-
tic study in 2003, an action plan was prepared to address
competitiveness and capacity gaps. Strategies were designed
taking into consideration the relevance of each subsector of
the oil and gas industry, the level of local production capacity
and the competitiveness of the subsector.

For example: (1) where local supply capacity existed but was
inadequate—such as in marine vessel fabrication, engineer-
ing services—strategies were designed to incentivize foreign
contractors to partner with Brazilian firms; and (2) where
local capacity did not exist or could not be developed – as
in the manufacturing of centrifugal compressors and diesel
engines – international firms were encouraged to establish
subsidiaries in Brazil, bundle together work packages and use

Box 4.2: Angola Case Study

When four decades of civil war ended in 2002, Angola became Africa’s second oil producer and third largest economy. Between 2002 and 2012 Angola’s oil production increased eight fold reaching about 630
million barrels/year in 2012. Increased production, higher crude oil prices, growing oil revenue and additional financing from China - backed by future oil revenues – allowed the government to embark on a
wide-ranging investment program, focused on rebuilding the country’s physical infrastructure devastated by the civil war. Public investment in infrastructure grew from around 5 percent of GDP in 2002 to over 14
percent in 2008 and Angola’s GDP grew by an average of 15 percent every year during that period.

However, the acceleration of public investment spending created inefficiencies. The public investment management system was not ready for such a rapid increase in spending. According to a 2011 World Bank
study, many investment decisions were not optimal. For example, the expansion of generation capacity was not matched by improvements in the transmission and distribution infrastructure that would enable
the network to reach a growing number of people and firms. Poor planning, under execution of budgets, operational deficiencies, and under-pricing of services caused inefficiencies that are estimated at US$1.3
billion annually, almost 5 percent of Angola’s current GDP.
Increased public investment also created congestion problems at the
Port of Luanda, Angola’s main international gateway. Using Luanda’s
facilities became so costly that businesses often reverted to the port of
Walvis Bay in Namibia more than 2000 kilometers away. Moreover, Luan-
da, Angola’s capital, was repeatedly ranked among the most expensive
cities in the world. Inflation fell following the end of the civil war but still
averaged 20 percent every year between 2004 and 2008. The purchasing
power of an Angolan – as compared to a US citizen- fell by 400 percent
between 2002 and 2008. Yet the official exchange rate fell by much less
and the Angolan Kwanza became increasingly overvalued.

All these factors made the country very vulnerable to the global financial
crisis of 2008. As international oil prices started to decline, internation-
al reserves fell by 1/3 in the first half of 2009 prompting the Angolan
authorities to request IMF assistance. A combination of fiscal consolida-
tion and orderly exchange rate adjustment backed by tight monetary
policy helped stabilize the economy, but also caused a forced reduction
in public investment with negative implications for GDP growth. These
lessons encouraged Angola to improve public financial management
systems and review the management of its natural resources. The
collection and reporting of oil revenue became more transparent and
a sovereign wealth fund was established in 2013 to insulate the annual
budget from volatile oil revenue inflows.

Government Actions Necessary to
Address Specific Implementation Issues
Part III discusses the necessary actions to be taken by the policymakers to implement a strategy aimed at maximizing the benefits of oil and
other extractives while minimizing associated risks at the same time. The report argues that these actions will include (a) improving public
sector management (PFM, PIM, public sector incentives); (b) improving the role of the private sector and the civil society; (c) leveraging the
possible impact of regional integration while mitigating associated risks (for instance, in the context of the monetary union); and (d) managing
population expectations.

It is structured as follows: Chapter 5 discusses the importance of strengthening public sector management as a key ingredient of the
Government’s implementation strategy in harnessing the benefits of oil, gas and other extractives. It also discusses issues related to managing
the expectations of the population. Meanwhile, Chapter 6 emphasizes the role of the private sector and Chapter 7 brings forward the role of
regional integration as another key element for the implementation of proposed strategy in the short, medium and long term. An effective
implementation of the government’s strategy will depend on three types of institutions: Uganda’s public sector agencies, private enterprises
operating in the country and EAC institutions. The quality of Uganda’s public sector institutions will be the main factor. However, the private
sector, including large international corporations, and the regional institutions of the East African Community will also influence the final
outcome.

labor mobility is limited in EAC countries. Labor flows are
tightly regulated, and although no overtly discriminatory
regulations are in place, government policies aim more at
restricting rather than facilitating labor movements (World
Bank 2010). Table 7.7 summarizes the labor migration pol-
icies in 4 countries of East Africa. These countries do not
impose nationality or residency requirements on foreign
professionals who provide accounting and auditing services
in their territories. However, Kenya, Tanzania, and Ugan-
da impose quantitative restrictions on foreign professionals
in the form of labor market tests or economic needs tests.
There are limits on the initial length of stay in these three
countries, but extensions or renewals of visa are permitted
(generally on a case-by-case basis).

7.38. Monetary policy should be integrated slowly,
and reversibly, throughout the union using a system
of exchange rate pegs. Uganda has recently had consid-
erable success with its “inflation-targeting lite” regime.
It should build on this success by improving its inflation
forecasting capacity, entrenching central bank indepen-
dence, and promoting the deepening of the financial sec-
tor. The other members of the EAC should move towards
a system of pegged exchange rates with Uganda, ideally by
harmonizing interest rate policy rather than intervening in
foreign currency markets. This system will allow countries
to determine the appropriate level for entering the union,
and should persist at least until commodity expenditure has
stabilized. If imbalances start to accrue then the pegs can
be adjusted. During this period, member countries should
ensure convergence of key criteria such as inflation, long-
term interest rates, fiscal deficits and the level of govern-
ment debt.

           bonds denominated in units of consumption goods, and those in the non-tradable goods sector set nominal wage using
           Calvo’s partial indexation mechanism. No Ponzi game constraints:

Annex 3: Key Features of the Uganda Macroeconometric Model (MacMod-UG)

        Basic Features:

   •	   The structure of the model is composed of three main blocks:

            o	 A macro framework, that projects GDP with its components (uses and sources), national accounts (Government
               Financial System (GFS), Balance of Payments, and Monetary Aggregates); and debt (internal and external) in the
               short and medium-term, ensuring the balance of flows of funds.




                                                                                                                                          Annexes
            o	 A Framework for Medium-Term Expenditure (MTEF), which is connected to the model, allowing to: (i) specify
               the budget allocations to the ministries in line with the guidelines of the (NDP), (ii) fit all expenditures with the
               revenues and overall funding capacity to ensure consistency between the structure of the MTEF spending and the
               GFS.

            o	 A “Poverty / MDGs” module, that projects the indicators of poverty and human development (poverty incidence,
               MDGs, education, and health etc.).

   •	   The GDP includes five major sectors, including agriculture and related rural activities (forestry, animal husbandry and fish
        farming), mining (oil and other mining products), manufacturing, other industrial activities (energy, water, etc.), administra-
        tion and market services. Mining and administration are the main “exogenous”.

   •	   Growth in other sectors is determined by the medium and long-term trends that are based on the factors of production (hu-
        man and physical productive capital), previous exogenous dynamics, the international situation, and the internal environ-
        ment.

        Modeling features:

Annex 4: Key Features of the Uganda Maquette for MDG Simulations (MAMS) Model

Basic Features

The MAMS model1 is used to link education policies, skills achievement and employment outcomes. The MAMS is a recursive-dynamic
Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model developed at the World Bank for analysis of medium- to long-run country strategies for
low- and middle-income countries, including strategies aimed at improving MDG (Millennium Development Goals) outcomes.

Modeling features




                                                                                                                                                              Annexes
Production and commodities

Supply side:

•	   Producers maximize profit given their technology and the prices of inputs and output.
•	   The production technology is a two-step nested structure.
          o	 At the bottom level, primary inputs are combined to produce value-added using a CES (constant elasticity of substitution)
             function.
          o	 At the top level, aggregated value added is then combined with intermediate input within a fixed coefficient (Leontief)
             function to give the output.
•	   Profit maximization provides the demand for intermediate goods, labor and capital demand.
•	   The detailed disaggregation of production activities captures the changing structure of growth.
•	   Domestic output is allocated between exports and domestic sales following the assumption that domestic producers maximize profit
     subject to imperfect transformability between these two alternatives.
•	   The production possibility frontier of the economy is defined by a constant elasticity of transformation (CET) function between
     domestic supply and exports.
Demand side:

•	   A composite commodity is made up of domestic demand and final imports and it is consumed by households, enterprises, and gov-
     ernment.
•	   The Armington assumption is used here to distinguish between domestically produced goods and imports.
          o	 For each good, the model assumes imperfect substitutability (CES function) between imports and the corresponding com-
             posite domestic goods.

 Annexes




          o	 The parameter for CET and CES elasticity used to calibrate the functions used in the CGE model are exogenously determined.
 Institutions
 •	   Three institutions in the model: households, enterprises and government.
          o	 Households receive their income from primary factor payments including labor, capital and land. While they pay income
             taxes as a proportion of their income, they also receive transfers from government and the rest of the world. Savings and total
             consumption are assumed to be a fixed proportion of household’s disposable income (income after income taxes). Consump-

             tion demand is determined by a Linear Expenditure System (LES) function.
          o	 Firms receive their income from remuneration of capital, transfers from government, and the rest of the world, as well as net
             capital transfers from households. Firms pay corporate taxes to government, proportional to their incomes.
          o	 Government revenue includes direct taxes collected from households and firms, indirect taxes on domestic activities, domes-
             tic value added tax, tariff revenue on imports, factor income to the government, and transfers from the rest of the world. The
             government also saves and consumes.
 MDG and Employment Module

          o	 The MAMS model is well suited for the analysis of the MDGs and employment.
          o	 The key MDGs considered in this case include reduction of poverty, primary education attainment, reduction of infant and
             maternal mortality and increased access to water and sanitation.
          o	 This module is critical for this study given the link between employment outcomes and investment in the various stages of
             education by the government.
 Macro closure

          o	 Equilibrium in a CGE model is captured by a set of macro closures in a model.

 •	   Supply-demand balances in products and factor markets are assumed.
 •	   Three macroeconomic balances are specified in the model: (i) fiscal balance, (ii) the external trade balance, and (iii) savings-investment
      balance.
 •	   Fiscal balance: government savings is assumed to adjust to equate the different between government revenue and spending.
 •	   External balance: foreign savings are fixed with exchange rate adjustment to clear foreign exchange markets.
 •	   Savings-investment balance: the model assumes that savings are investment driven and adjust through flexible saving rate for firms.




144         Uganda Country Economic Memorandum: Economic Diversification and Growth in the Era of Oil and Volatility
Recursive dynamics

        o	 Following previous studies on Botswana and South Africa (Lofgren 2005, Thurlow 2007), the dynamics is captured by
           assuming that investments in the current period are used to build new capital stock for the next period.
        o	 The new capital is allocated across sectors according to the profitability of the various sectors.

 Annex 5: Key Features of the Uganda Overlapping Generations (OLG) Model


 Basic features:

      •	   Individuals live for (at most) three periods: childhood (period t-1), adulthood (period t) and retirement (period t+1).

      •	   The economy produces a homogenous market good that can be either consumed in the period it is produced or stored to yield




                                                                                                                                             Annexes
           capital at the beginning of the following period.

      •	   Each individual is endowed with one unit of time in childhood and adulthood, and zero units in old age. In adulthood time is
           allocated inelastically to market work.

 Modeling features:

 Individuals

      •	   At the beginning of adulthood in t, each individual produces nt children, who depend on their parents for consumption and any
           spending associated with schooling and health care.

      •	   Raising a child also involves a cost of       (0,1) of the individual’s net income. Consumption of children is subsumed in the
           individual’s consumption.

      •	   Wages is the only source of income as all individuals work in middle age (second period of life).

      •	   Savings can be held only in the form of physical capital.

      •	   Agents have no other endowments, except for an initial stock of physical capital at t = 0, which is the endowment of an initial
           old generation. Each individual is endowed with et units of human capital. Each unit of human capital earns an effective market
           wage, wt, per unit of time worked.

      •	   Assuming that consumption of children is subsumed in the individual’s consumption, the individual’s utility takes the form

Market Production

     •	    Firms engaged in market production are identical and their number is normalized to unity.

     •	    Each firm i produces a single nonstorable good, using effective labor,        where     is average labor productivity in the
           economy, and              , where    is average human capital, private capital,   , and public infrastructure,   .




1	          Bauer and Chytilová (2007), in a study of Uganda, found a strong negative association between the level of education and individual dis-
count rates; more educated individuals appear to be more patient, even after controlling for other characteristics (age, income group, gender, marital
status, and clan linkage). For simplicity, however, the impact of education on individual patience is ignored.
2	         Note that we abstract from mortality in childhood. As documented by the World Bank (2009, 2011), Uganda has made significant progress
during the past three decades in reducing infant mortality.
3	           To abstract from unintended bequests, the saving left by agents who do not survive to old age is assumed to be confiscated by the government,
which transfers them in lump-sum fashion to surviving members of the same cohort. The rate of return to saving is thus (1 + rt+2)/p, as shown in (3). See Agénor
(2012, p. 73) for a derivation.

          in period t and used in period t+1.

                  private capital stock. This effect captures the importance of infrastructure for education outcomes.6

               o	 Knowledge accumulation depends on average government spending on education per child,                             , where

               o	 Human capital accumulation depends on a parent’s human capital. Because individuals are identical within a generation, a
                  parent’s human capital at t is equal to the average human capital of the previous generation.

Health Status and Productivity

  Government

       •	    The government taxes only the wage income of adults and receives foreign aid. It spends a total of    on infrastructure invest-
             ment,      on education,     on health,     and on unproductive items. All its services are provided free of charge. It cannot
             issue bonds and must therefore run a balanced budget:

                                                         									(13)

                  o	 where X > 0 is the fraction of foreign aid in proportion of tax revenues7.

       •	    Shares of spending are all assumed to be constant fractions of government revenues:

  7	         Given (6), it would make no substantial difference if foreign aid were to be defined as a share of output. Note also that in this specification
  domestic and foreign resources are additive; there is no “moral hazard” effect, that is, the possibility that aid may have an adverse effect on incentives to col-
  lect domestic taxes, as discussed in particular in the partial equilibrium literature on fiscal response models (see McGillivray and Morrissey (2001), as well as
  general equilibrium models (see Agénor et al. (2008)). However, as further discussed below, there is no evidence that aid substituted for domestic revenue
  mobilization in Uganda in recent decades.

Survival Rate and Network Externalities

     •	    Finally, we assume that the relationship between the survival rate and health in adult -A =                       hood takes a concave form:

                 o	

     •	    Network externalities are captured by assuming that the degree of efficiency of infrastructure is positively but nonlinearly related
           to the stock of public capital itself10. Specifically, the network externality variable, qt, is taken to be a logistic function of

                                                        										(19)

10	         This specification follows Agénor (2010, and 2012, Chapter 6). An alternative and more “micro-based” definition of network externalities is in terms
of the effects on a user of a product or service of others using the same product or service; thus, positive externalities arise if the benefits to the user increase
with the number of other users. However, this is more di¢ cult to implement in a macro context.

                     a convex-concave shape, bounded between             . At low initial levels of the public-private capital ratio, im-
                     provements in access to infrastructure generate strong increases in the efficiency of public capital; beyond a certain
                     point, further improvements in access generate decreasing marginal returns. This accords well with the evidence on

             foreign resources, and constant spending shares such that, given initial stocks       > 0 and E0 > 0, initial health statuses
             > 0, individuals maximize utility, firms maximize profits, markets clear, and the government budget is balanced. In equilibrium,

           duce the fertility rate, for standard reasons12. From (21) the public-private capital ratio is also negatively related with the
           savings rate.


      •	   Let                   denote the private capital-effective labor ratio. The model can be condensed into a dynamic system in

Note:
a.	 The first row tests the hypothesis that productivity of exporters is lower than that of non-exporters. The approximate p-value of 0.995 suggests
    that we should reject that hypothesis.
b.	 The second row tests the hypothesis that productivity of exporters is higher than that of non-exporters. The p-value for this is 0.000 which
    allows us to accept that hypothesis.
c.	 The third row is the combined test, which tests productivity differences between exporters and non-exporters. The approximated p-value and
    the correlated p-value is equal to 0.000, which indicates that there are statistically significant differences in firm productivity between export-
    ers and non-exporters.
