Preface
Georgia has made significant progress in reforming its education system and the country has
implemented a range of sweeping reforms targeted at redesigning the Post-Soviet education system
and creating a new system more consistent to a rapidly changing world with complex technical
requirements and increased international competitiveness. Despite of this comprehensive set of
reforms, yet many challenges remain with respect to the quality and equity of education and training
services, including linkages to the labor market.

The government’s new socio-economic development strategy emphasizes high quality of education to
improve human capital. Strategic priorities include increasing labor market relevance of educational
programs to meet workforce requirements, increasing access to preschool education, improving
quality of general education, emphasizing vocational training, and enhancing the attractiveness of the
teaching profession. This document is aligned with the goals set forth by the government in the new
socio-economic development strategy.
For this purpose, the Ministry of Education and Science (MoES) has launched the development of a
new National Education Sector Strategy that will build on current reforms and analysis of
achievements and challenges facing the education and training sector. The new strategy will span
from early childhood education to higher education and other post-secondary training and the key of
this integration will be the notion of life-long learning. The lead responsibility for developing the
Education Sector Strategy lies with the Minister of Education and Science, supported by a Strategy
Development Team.
The World Bank was requested to provide analytical and technical advisory services with the goal of
supporting and building the capacity required at the MoES to develop a comprehensive National
Education Sector Strategy and an Action Plan. This report intends to provide a comprehensive
analytical framework and a series of actionable policy options that the Georgian authorities can use as
a guiding document to the development of such National Education Strategy and its Action Plan. The
present review included all levels of education except for Research and Development given that in-
depth science audit was recently undertaken by the MoES and the findings will be reflected in the
government’s final strategy. The contents of this report are presented in the following main sections:
Part I: Key System –wide Issues. A thorough analysis and recommendations on key sector issues:
student and labor market outcomes, access and equity, governance, strategic management of the
Ministry of Education and Science, public spending in education and cross-cutting issues.
Part II: Priority Sub-sector Issues. Diagnostic and recommendations of the most pressing sub-sector
issues at each level of education: Early Childhood Development (ECD): School Readiness; Teacher
Quality in general education; Strengthening Vocational Education and Training (VET) sector; and
Financing of Higher Education;
Part III: Recommended Interventions for the Education Sector Strategy. A summary of key
recommendations and policy interventions for the government’s ten-year consolidated education
sector strategy (2015-2025).
Part IV: Implementation of Sector Reforms.
This document was prepared by a team led by Nino Kutateladze (Task Team Leader, Education
Operations Officer, ECSH2) comprising Natia Andghuladze (WB Consultant), Sophie Gorgodze (WB
Consultant) and Nelson Stratta (WB Consultant), with additional support from Daniel Kutner (Junior
Professional Associate, ECSH2), Jason Weaver (Education Specialist, ECSH2) and Dandan Chen
(Sector Leader, ECSH2) and administrative and logistical support from Lela Ghongadze. The
contributions of key government counterparts were critical in the preparation of this draft, which also
reflects consultations with government entities held on March, 2014. The team would like to take this
opportunity to thank Minister Tamar Sanikidze as well as the Strategy Development Team, led by Ms.
Medea Akhalkatsi, which she nominated to work with and provide guidance to the Bank team on
these tasks.

Executive Summary

1. The scope and pace of education reforms in Georgia over the last decade are unique in the
region but have not yet yielded the expected improvements in the quality of education. In
particular, reforms of financing and governance of educational institutions, that other countries have
been grappling with for years, have been implemented. The key reforms included: (i) the
decentralization of the management; (ii) the adoption of a “per-student” financing mechanism at all
levels of education; (iii) the creation, under the umbrella of the Ministry of Education and Science, of
new public legal entities responsible for ensuring the quality of reforms; (iv) the adoption of new
standards and outcome-based national curricula in general education along with the development of
new textbooks; and (v) the design of a new national assessment and examination system. These policy
measures were complemented by a greater focus on educational inputs such as investments in
infrastructure and technology, the physical security of schools, and in improving the tuition of
English. Despite the many innovations and important changes to the education sector, reforms have
not yet translated into gains particularly in the quality of education. The majority of students in
Georgia demonstrate below average levels of performance in reading, mathematics and science as
measured by national and international student assessments (such as PISA 2009+, TIMSS & PIRLS
2011).

2. The government has set a clear vision for the future of the education sector as a tool for
human capital development to support economic growth. One of the most important objectives in
the government’s new Socio-Economic Development Strategy of Georgia-2020 is to prepare labor
market-responsive workforce and to strengthen research potential in the education system. The
document identifies certain priorities in terms of development of the education and research sector,
such as improving the quality and accessibility of education; increasing motivation and qualifications
of teachers; increasing participation of stakeholders in preschool and Vocational Education and
Training (VET) sector; improving learning outcomes of students in literacy, exact and natural
sciences; and supporting internationalization of higher education. To achieve the new vision for the
sector’s development, the Government needs to address the remaining challenges both at the system
and sub-sector level.

3. The analysis presented in this report reveals that the major challenge across all levels of
education in Georgia is improving quality and, more specifically, improving student outcomes.
The analysis and policy options outlined in the report emphasize the need to engage in a second wave
of reforms focusing on the quality dimension and improving system’s performance since the country
has already made improvements in the transparency and efficiency of the sector via the reforms
implemented over the last two decades. Creating improvements requires a long-term and sustained
effort as evidenced by the experience of many countries with now advanced education systems.
Georgia can benefit from the experiences and lessons learned from the education reforms of those
countries (e.g. Poland, Finland), who have made impressive gains. The document presents
comparative analysis and brings in relevant examples from other countries and country comparisons
for that purpose.

    Key System-wide issues

4. Learning and Labor market outcomes. Georgia’s prospects to compete in the global economy
will depend on its ability to produce a highly-skilled workforce. This largely depends on the relevance
and quality of the education received by the students. To improve relevance, the education system
needs to be aligned with the requirements of economy and the quality of teaching and learning needs
to be improved. The key challenge is to improve significantly the achievement level of Georgian
students in key domains, such as reading comprehension, mathematics and science. Over 60 percent
of the surveyed 15-year-old Georgian students were found to be three years behind their peers on the
reading scale as compared to OECD average scores. The education outcomes also indicate important
 Georgia: Education Sector Policy Review                                                                   7


differences between students from different socio-economic backgrounds and residence. The low
employment rates among Georgian youth (at about 51 percent) may suggest skills mismatch of
graduates with the labor market needs and relevance problems for education programs apart from
structural unemployment issues. Employer surveys confirm that among Georgian graduates, there is
lack of specific professional skills in demand by the economy. Georgia needs to provide key
competencies to all students and accelerate the creation of highly skilled workforce demanded by the
labor market.

5. Access and Equity. Georgia compares well to comparator countries in Europe and Central Asia
(ECA) region in terms of the enrollment rates at compulsory education level, but there is room for
improving access to other levels of education. Preschool enrolment in Georgia is relatively low by
regional comparisons. However, the enrollment rates showed moderate but promising growth in the
last decade increasing from 46 percent to 57 percent in the last two years. The abolishment of parental
contribution towards pre-school education in September 20013 has resulted in higher coverage, but is
not likely to enhance the quality of the service being provided if no further measures are taken. If
demand for preschool education significantly grows, there will not be enough vacancies in preschool
institutions (in the short-term). The enrolment in compulsory education is almost universal, although,
participation in upper secondary education is low at 73 percent. The demand for VET programs has
been on the rise with enrolments doubling between 2010 and 2012 attributed to the concerted
Government reform efforts during recent years. Nonetheless, participation still remains low due to the
limited geographical coverage and more importantly, due to dead ends and rigid pathways to higher
levels of education after completing the VET programs. Enrolment in Higher Education in Georgia is
low by international standards. In 2012 the gross enrolment ratio in higher education reached 28
percent, which is one of the lowest in the region and significantly lower compared to the average
gross enrolment rate (GER) in Western European and Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) countries.

6. The population from lower economic backgrounds, living in rural areas and from ethnic minority
groups is systematically excluded from the education system. The difference in PISA results between
students that belong to the wealthiest quintile and those that belong to the poorest quintile is over 2
years of education (80 PISA points) in reading and mathematics. The difficulties for these groups are
very similar for all education areas, namely limited access to education and limited or insufficient
financial support. The lack of consolidated social inclusion policy exacerbates the problem. In
addition, most students from these underrepresented groups do not continue into higher education,
perhaps due to their insufficient preparation and ability to obtain tutoring to compete with their peers
for the selection process. The Government’s attempts to provide support for these groups have not
been sufficient.

7. Governance. The remaining challenge for the sector is to shift towards the governance and
accountability paradigm that would support the existing decentralized management in a more
effective manner. The existing accountability mechanisms at all levels of education are concentrated
on controlling for inputs and regulatory norms and less so on monitoring outcomes, which restricts the
MoES capacity to improve the quality of education. These governance constraints are manifested in
different forms at each level of education. At the general education level, the Education Resource
Centers act as mediators between the MoES and schools and are responsible for the monitoring of
schools. Nonetheless, the role of Education Resources Centers remains limited and capacity needs to
be further developed. There is no proper accountability framework between the MoES and schools
and internal quality assurance mechanisms at the school level are weak. Moreover, insufficient
capacity development has been provided to support participation of key actors (e.g. school boards,
principals). The existing accountability mechanisms at VET and higher education levels restrict the
autonomy of institutions and the MoES capacity to improve the quality of education.

8. Strategic Management of the Ministry of Education and Science. Implementation issues
caused the recent reforms not to generate the expected incremental and systemic improvements. The
path of recent reforms shows that large-scale reforms were introduced before gathering a clear
understanding about all their potential consequences. The speed at which these reforms were
introduced in many cases did not leave sufficient time for their proper planning and consultation.
Some of the measures introduced were not in line with existing capacity and management limitations.
 Georgia: Education Sector Policy Review                                                                   8


As a result, in many cases, after the reforms were implemented, several reversals were made. This
happened in key areas (such as school decentralization reform, teacher training provision), producing
a general sense on instability and, at the end of the day, longer periods to consolidate the desired
outcomes of the reforms compared to what a proper introduction would have required.

9. Public Spending in Education. Expenditure in education is low by any international standards.
The average level of education expenditure in Georgia as a percentage of GDP has been oscillating
between 2 percent and 3 percent for a decade. This is much lower than the average for new Member
States in the European Union (over 5 percent) or comparable countries in the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) (around 8 percent). The level of expenditures is much lower than other
countries with similar level of income per capita. Although total education budget substantially
increased since 2006, as a share of total public spending government allocation for education did not
show significant improvement. The highest share of the education budget is allocated for general
education sector. The bulk of current expenditures in general education is spent on teacher salaries,
which represents 75-80 percent of current expenditures. At 8.5 percent, the student to teacher ratio of
general education in Georgia is considerable lower than the OECD or EU21 countries (at 13.6 and 12,
respectively; see figure 2.1) suggesting the need to raise efficiency in the management of teaching
force, although this could be a politically sensitive issue. However, Teacher salaries in Georgia are
among the lowest compared to other countries that participated in PISA 2009. Analyzing 2009 teacher
salaries relative to GDP per capita, teachers with minimum training and 10 years of experience in
Georgia are paid at substantially lower levels compared to other countries. Despite the gradual
increase of teacher salaries in the last decade, they remain below the average national salaries.
According to figures of the National Statistics Office of Georgia the average monthly salary for 2013
(fourth quarter) is of 875 GEL, while the average monthly salary in education is 475 GEL. The low
salary system of the teaching profession makes it a poor career choice in Georgia.

10. Life-long Learning. Georgia does not yet have an integrated national policy and strategy for Life-
long Learning (LLL), nonetheless, the ongoing efforts of MoES to develop a consolidated strategy for
the entire sector in line with the principles of LLL is a major step forward. Georgia’s institutional
capacity would require substantial development to be capable of applying a coherent and integrated
national lifelong learning policy. The scope of LLL policies goes beyond the boundaries of the
education system and demands a coherent public sector response in a variety of areas.

11. Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). Currently there is no coherent policy
framework to ensure meaningful use of ICT to advance teaching and learning. Individual ICT
programs are not integrated and aligned with the curriculum goals. There is no systematic
understanding of the ICT infrastructure gaps in Georgian schools. Nonetheless, the MoES recently
launched concerted efforts to develop an ICT policy paper.

    Priority Sub-sector Issues
12. Apart from the system-wide issues described above, there are pressing challenges specific to
particular sub-sectors of education emerging from the sector analysis. The key areas for priority
attention identified at each level of education are as follows: improving school readiness in preschool
education; improving teaching quality in general education; strengthening Vocational Education and
Training; and improving financing of the Higher Education.

13. Early Childhood Development (ECD) School Readiness. In Georgia, the majority of the
children who attended preschool institutions show very low school readiness. The decentralized
preschool education model has the advantage of being flexible and easy to be shaped to the particular
needs of each region and this is an important virtue. However, the lack of supervision, monitoring,
and quality assurance leads to wide differences in the quality of the service across the country. One of
the major constraints towards improving the quality of preschool education is the lack of the national
preschool education standards and the absence of instruments for their enforcement.

14. Teaching Quality in General Education. Improving teacher quality is one of the most pressing
challenges for the general education sector as well as a top priority given that the long term solutions
    Georgia: Education Sector Policy Review                                                                   9


to address education quality constraints will largely depend on resolving the issue of teaching quality.
The key factors contributing to low teaching quality include the issues of teacher management,
deployment, career path development, compensation, and performance evaluation. More specifically,
low salaries make teaching an unpopular choice. The poor management of supply and demand of
teachers and teacher deployment nationwide has resulted in imbalances between demand and supply
of teachers in some subject areas and geographic locations. The inefficient use of the teaching force
creates negative implications for improving effectiveness of the system. The existing teacher pre-
service and in-service training system does not produce the intended results. The new Teacher
Professional Development Scheme, currently in works, provides an excellent opportunity to address
many of these constraints.

15. Strengthening Vocational Education and Training. The improvement of the quality and
relevance of VET programs could be enhanced with greater participation of employers. Some
progress has been made in establishing coordination mechanisms to engage stakeholders in the VET
sector. However, the engagement of employers and social partners has been still insufficient in sector
planning, management, program development and evaluation, which greatly limits the sector’s
effectiveness.

16. Higher Education Financing. At the higher education level, the existing level of financing and
financial instruments are not conducive to improving quality of teaching and learning, and for
strengthening research capacity. Introducing student state grants was instrumental in increasing
transparency in the allocation of public resources for higher education. However, the student grant is
nearly the main public financing instrument available. There are limited opportunities for competitive
research grants. Also, the capacity of higher education institutions to generate other sources of
revenue has been limited. Therefore, the tuition fees collected from students is the main source of
revenue for the higher education sector. Though the mechanism helps create healthy competition for
students among institutions, it also drives universities to maximize student numbers beyond their
capacity, which negatively affects the quality of teaching. Moreover, the existing financing
arrangement does not support the development of the higher educational institutions’ research
capacity and the integration of research into teaching and learning process. Government should
consider setting up complementary financing mechanisms for supporting research more effectively in
universities.

17. Implementation of Sector Reforms. To succeed in achieving the national education goals,
objectives, and targets, the implementation of the future sector reforms must have a solid foundation.
The development and implementation of a sector-wide Education Strategy will require active
stakeholder engagement, the definition of efficient coordination mechanisms and clear lines of
responsibility, authority and accountability at central as well as at decentralized levels. It is important
to avoid the creation of heavy bureaucratic structures in favor of an efficient usage of the existing
internal structure developing agile working groups supported with appropriate technical assistance.

Key Policy Recommendations
A number of important policy reforms have been identified as follows.

Recommendation 1: Improving Quality of Education as measured by Student and Labor
Market Outcomes1

Researchers can now document that the quality of human resources, as measured by assessment
scores, is closely related to individual earnings, productivity and economic growth. Increasing, policy
makers have shifted attention from inputs in the education system to learning outcomes, what
knowledge, attitudes and skills are obtained by learners as a result of their exposure to schooling and

1The labor market outcomes are assessed by the characteristics of employment status of graduates,
skills content of the job and the occurrence of qualification mismatches.
 Georgia: Education Sector Policy Review                                                                   10


to what extent these competencies are compatible to the needs of the global competitive economy of
the 21st century. The following recommendations are aimed at improving the quality of education as
measured by student and labor market outcomes:

      Focus on the acquisition of key competencies by students in general education through
       curricular improvements. The large majority of students in general education lack basic
       proficiency skill in key learning domains, such as literacy and numeracy, as evidenced by
       existing student assessments. The national curriculum has an important role to guide teachers
       for improving teaching and learning outcomes. However, the changes introduced in the
       curriculum content in 2010 were not based on a comprehensive evaluation of the curriculum
       implementation in the previous years. The 2013 monitoring results of curriculum
       implementation indicate that majority of teachers do not work towards transferring higher-
       order cognitive processes and individual formative assessments described in national
       curriculum. The emphasis should be made on strengthening the curriculum implementation
       process at the school level, namely supporting and strengthening curriculum experts, school
       principals, teachers, actively engaging parents and communities in the process. The future
       curriculum improvements will require strengthening the mechanisms for applying evidence
       (such as national assessments, examinations, feedback from educational institutions, curricula
       based international assessments) in further curriculum development.
      Focus on relevance by shifting to a demand-led approach in which employers’ feedback
       help shape the education system. The low employment and underemployment amongst
       graduates suggest relevance problems for vocational education and training and higher
       education programs. It will be essential to engage business and industry as well as training
       providers in the definition of skills development priorities and design of programs. The
       existing quality assurance system needs to be developed in line with the internationally
       recognized quality assurance frameworks and focus on relevance fostering a demand-led
       approach.

Recommendation 2: Access and Equity

      Develop a Social Inclusion Policy for improving access and equity. Improving access and
       equity is a key strategic objective that requires strategic, sector-wide planning and
       management. Social inclusion standards, targets, measures and tools must be defined at the
       national level and not left to the arbitrary decision of the schools and municipalities. The
       nature of the social inclusion programs and measures cuts across all the educational areas, and
       therefore, their overall monitoring and evaluation requires special ministerial attributions that
       are not today defined at the centralized level. The responsibility for implementing and
       monitoring of many of these policy measures can be delegated to sub-sector area management
       units (pre-school, general, etc.), however there is subject specific knowledge (children with
       disabilities, usage of mother tongues in education, adult education, etc.) that would benefit
       from a more integral understanding of the topics for all education areas.
      Promote gradual expansion of preschool enrolment with a particular attention to
       disadvantaged groups. To address the issue of low preschool enrolment the following
       measures need to be considered: (i) prioritize the five-year old children, in case there are no
       spots for all children. Providing all children with at least one year of preschool education is
       likely to improve school readiness; (ii) encourage the growth of private providers; (iii) build
       public awareness; (iv) phase in free of charge service provision for all, and prioritize the
       disadvantaged socioeconomic groups; (v) improve efficiency in the use of existing preschool
       infrastructure. The government could consider using the facilities of existing, underutilized
       primary schools.
      Eliminate dead-ends and improve the attractiveness of VET programs In Georgia, due to
       the nature and structure of programs, VET graduates have significant difficulties in pursuing
       further education, which hinders career advancement for many people. The 2007 Law on
       Vocational Education institutionally separated vocational education from general education
       removing also general education content from the VET programs. This approach has resulted
       in the so-called educational “dead-ends”. The inclusion of general content in the VET courses
    Georgia: Education Sector Policy Review                                                                   11


          is likely to reduce the content gap between general and VET track graduates. In itself, this
          would make it easier for VET graduates to compete for university admission. A cost-effective
          approach would be to add general content to VET courses that can help reduce “dead ends”
          and improve VET graduates’ chances in case they need to look for a job different than the one
          they studied for.
         Expand the geographical coverage of VET programs in rural areas and smaller towns.
          The present initiatives to increase supply should be slightly refocused to address supply
          deficiencies to provide access to people living in these areas, for which VET would be very
          important. Expanding the existing financing scheme to accommodate indirect costs (living
          expenses) of VET participation can also be considered.
         Improve the existing student grant allocation system in higher education to
          accommodate the needs of underrepresented groups. It is recommended to review the
          usage of the student grants and expansion of existing programs to promote the participation of
          disadvantaged groups. Many of these measures could have an important short-term social
          impact and can be introduced fairly quickly without substantially increasing actual funding
          requirements. These measures include expansion of needs-based grants and introduction of
          flexible study programs.

Recommendation 3: Governance

         Develop a new school performance review and support system that will be focused on
          monitoring school quality and supporting school development. The existing structure of
          the education system (General Education Management and Development Department,
          National Curriculum Department, Education Resource Centers, National Quality
          Enhancement Center, Teachers’ Professional Development Center, National Assessment and
          Examination Center) can provide good foundations for such a system in terms of providing
          the needed expert support, particularly for low performing schools. The new school
          performance review and support system can play a leading role in helping the schools to
          identify their challenges and develop school improvement plans. The ERCs should play a role
          in the capacity development of boards of trustees to avoid one time, costly and sporadic
          trainings and provide more long-term and sustainable support to individual school board
          members. The ERCs should be equipped by centrally developed guidelines and manuals for
          such support.
         Introduce result-based accountability mechanisms at VET and Higher Education levels.
          These accountability mechanisms should be built around measuring performance of these
          institutions according to defined outcomes, which can serve as the major driver for the
          improvement of the quality and output. The performance indicators should be agreed upon
          among key stakeholders and their tracking and verification need to be done by institutions and
          an independent agency respectively. It would be important to ensure that the future reform of
          existing authorization and accreditation system is not in conflict with the principles of
          institutional autonomy.

Recommendation 4: Strategic Management of the Ministry of Education and Science

         Develop the Ministry’s policy and planning capacity, including data management and
          application, to support key strategic management functions and sustain the introduction of
          management by results practices. In particular, developing a comprehensive and evidence and
          data-based long-term sector strategy would create the opportunity to negotiate the necessary
          increases in the medium term financial support for the education sector development. It is
          important that the management system of the Ministry and all relevant agencies and
          institutions is clearly elaborated, including responsibilities, lines of accountability, vertical
          and horizontal communication, monitoring and evaluation systems. Having strong and clear
          management system will be crucial for the implementation of the new strategy and
          achievement of anticipated results in the medium and long-term.
    Georgia: Education Sector Policy Review                                                                  12


Recommendation 5: Public Spending in Education

         Georgia will need to prioritize increasing public investment in education. Government
          spending on education in Georgia is low compared to countries with similar per-capita
          incomes and relative to both the shortage of human capital and the country’s ambitions.
         Georgia could consider prioritizing teacher salary increase over other investments in
          education sector. The teacher salaries in Georgia are one of the lowest as compared to other
          countries and other public employees in Georgia. This creates negative implications for the
          improvement of the quality of teaching and learning across the system. Attracting and
          retaining high-caliber teachers is a challenge worldwide. Specific interventions related to this
          recommendation are discussed in teaching quality part of the document.

Recommendation 6: Life-Long Learning

         Georgia needs to develop a coherent national strategy for integrating LLL principles
          across all education levels. The Government does not have an integrated national policy and
          strategy for LLL which substantially limits the country’s potential for meeting workforce
          development needs. Georgia’s institutional capacity would require substantial development to
          be capable of applying a coherent and integrated national lifelong learning policy. A greater
          focus on educational outcomes will be required from Georgian education policy. The scope
          of the policies to promote lifelong learning goes beyond the boundaries of the education
          system and demands a coherent and integrated public sector response in a variety of areas.


Recommendation 7: Information and Communication Technologies

         Develop a coherent policy framework to ensure meaningful use of ICT to advance
          teaching and learning throughout the education system. This policy framework should
          address how ICT can support the resolution of many of the educational issues that were
          described, such as: (i) major curriculum revisions and shifts in pedagogy and assessment
          changes; (ii) specific curriculum reforms that emphasize higher levels of understanding of
          key concepts within subject areas and aimed to reduce functional illiteracy; (iii) curricular
          reforms aimed to introduce the abovementioned lifelong learning approaches and especially,
          to develop the ability to solve complex, real-world problems (providing key competences)
          that prepare students for the knowledge economy, such as creativity, information
          management, communication, collaboration, and the ability to direct one’s own work and
          learning; (iv) support the pedagogical role of teachers by providing resources and explicitly
          modelling cognitive and social processes and prompting students to take up these practices;
          and (v) the use of technology to efficiently deliver online content and assessments in all areas
          of education and especially to support second chance, adult education.

Recommendation 8: Improving School Readiness

         The state of preschool education would benefit if the MoES played a more active role.
          The decentralized model has the advantage of being flexible and easy to be shaped to the
          particular needs of each region and this is an important virtue. However, the lack of
          supervision, monitoring, and quality assurance leads to wide differences in the quality of the
          service. Given the importance of preschool education, it is important to include this sector in
          the whole continuous education system, particularly it is important to pay attentions to school
          readiness of five-year old children for which MoES could play a pivotal role in setting up
          curricula and quality standards, supporting and monitoring the implementation process.
         Strengthening service quality should be a priority. The expansion of pre-school education
          is mainly justified by its great potential for improving the beneficiaries’ future educational
          development. However, this is not likely going to happen if quality is not achieved. As this
          process will take a long time, initial actions are important. Clear estimations of the costs of
          improving quality are needed, especially to resolve MoES and municipal capacity limitations.

Recommendation 9: Improving Teaching Quality in General Education

         Develop a sustainable school-based professional development model. This will require a
          substantial capacity building at the school level, creating a critical mass of qualified teachers
          to assume the role of a leading teacher, encouragement of peer learning among the teachers
          and trained school principals to focus on instructional leadership. The latter would focus on
          new modalities, such as lesson study, action research and school-based professional
          development teams. These new modalities will allow teachers to collaborate in order to
          identify academic programs, formulate instructional plans, use evidence to develop
          interventions for improvement, observe and reflect on their interventions and thus engage in
          continuous improvement. Continued in-service support to school principals will be also
          critical. Georgia can benefit from the already existing small-scale but successful initiatives
          being implemented in this area by the USAID supported G-Pried project and Ilia State
          University.
         Emphasize the development of new cadre of university teachers equipped with modern
          expertise in the field for strengthening the existing pre-service teacher training system.
         Provide incentives to attract qualified professionals into teaching. It is essential to address
          the issue of lack of competitive compensation for teaching profession. The government may
          consider setting high starting salaries to attract better graduates into teaching. The
          government may consider increasing salaries of the existing teachers complying with the
          quality requirements set by the teacher professional development standards.
         Develop a comprehensive teacher evaluation system, which one hand serves as an
          effective instrument for managing teacher quality and on the other hand, provides a clear path
          and opportunities to teachers for professional growth and career advancement linked to
          financial incentives.
         Improve the management of teacher supply and demand and teacher deployment
          nationwide. In Georgia, there is an overall surplus of teachers in general education, but
          shortages of teachers by teaching subject and by geographic location. The existing
          certification and professional development scheme can play an important role in the
          management of the teaching force. However, the existing instruments should be based on
          profound understanding of teacher supply and demand issues as well as influencing factors.
          Moreover, the expansion and improvement of the existing teacher deployment mechanisms
          would help address teacher shortage issues in remote areas.

Recommendation 10: Strengthening the Vocational Education and Training Sector

         Engage employers and relevant stakeholders to improve quality, relevance and provide
          a demand-led approach for VET supply. The National Qualification Framework and
          professional standards need continued improvement. Significant efforts are being made in this
          area. Its completion would impact the overall system and can be achieved in the short term.
          Priority efforts should be carried out to improve the MoES capacity to properly manage the
          engagement of wider range of stakeholders, particularly the private sector employers. This
          should be staring point as it affects the quality of all subsequent reforms in this area.
         Encourage Public Private Partnerships both in financing and delivery of vocational
          education. This may an important move toward improving the alignment of VET programs
          with labor market needs. The business sector should play an increased role in the design of
          VET curriculum, management and service delivery options, which will serve as incentives for
          the private sector to contribute to the financing of this level of education.

Recommendation 11: Improving Financing of Higher Education

         Increase the level of financing for the higher education sector for improving quality of
          teaching and learning, and strengthening research capacity. Higher education needs
          adequate financial resources allocated in a manner that promotes fair competition but also
          ensures sustainability. Georgia should at least triple its public spending on higher education,
Georgia: Education Sector Policy Review                                                                 14


      up to 1 percent of GDP. Although highly vulnerable to external shifts and inflation risks,
      Georgia’s economy is growing at a steady pace. The Government should be able to maintain
      its current government spending.
     Diversify funding instruments for higher education. The current limited funding
      mechanisms for higher education also lack clear strategic purpose in terms of improving
      efficiency and equity. Funding mechanism need to first align with the sector reform
      objectives. Assuming Georgia increases its public funding to higher education institutions, the
      Government could introduce new funding mechanisms in the system to encourage improved
      institutional performance and support the development of HEIs. After identifying its main
      policy objectives (access, equity, quality, labor market relevance, etc.) for Georgia’s higher
      education system, the Ministry of Education and Science should reassess how its current
      funding model fits or aligns with those objectives. The government could consider
      diversifying the funding mechanisms in line with international best practice in this are to
      facilitate research and innovation, improve the quality of teaching and learning and facilitate
      knowledge transfer. The options of output-based funding formula, performance contracts or
      competitive grants could be considered.

Chapter 1. Key System-wide Issues

1.1      The scope and pace of the Georgian education reform over the last decade are unique in
the region but have not yet yielded the expected improvements in the quality of education. In
particular, reforms of financing and governance of educational institutions, that other countries have
been grappling with for years, have been initiated at a stroke. They introduce the per capita financing
principle of ‘money follows the student’ in general education and decentralizing financing and
management to the school level. A similar formula-funding model for teaching activities has been
introduced for higher education and vocational education and training institutions. A crucial
contribution to reduction in corruption and reform of higher education admission has been made by
the introduction of sophisticated unified entrance examinations, launched in 2005 and administered by
a new National Assessment and Examinations Center (NAEC). Similar agencies have been set up in
areas important to quality assurance and support – Teachers Professional Development Center
(TPDC), National Center for Educational Quality Enhancement (NCEQE), Education Management
Information System (EMIS) and Education and Science Infrastructure Development Agency
(ESIDA). Ambitious programs for computerization and rehabilitation of educational institutions have
also been launched. Other areas of innovation include vocational education, early childhood care and
education and inclusive education (for which development of policy is at a relatively early stage).
The government is also grappling with the particular educational problems of ethnic minorities, the
biggest of which is lack of proficiency in the state language. Despite the many innovations and
important changes to the education sector, reforms have not yet translated into gains in the quality of
education. The majority of students in Georgia demonstrate below average levels of performance in
reading, mathematics and science as measured by national and international assessments.

1.2     The analysis presented in this report reveals that one of the major challenges across all
levels of education in Georgia is improving the quality of education and more explicitly,
improving student outcomes. The analysis and policy options outlined in the report emphasize the
need to engage in a second wave of reforms focusing on quality dimension and improving system’s
performance since the country has already made important improvements in the transparency and
efficiency of the sector via the reforms implemented over the last two decades.

1.3     Creating improvements requires a long-term and sustained effort as demonstrated by
the experience of many countries with now advanced education systems. Georgia can benefit
from the experiences and lessons learned of other advanced school systems, which have made
impressive gains after structural reforms (e.g. Poland, Finland). The report includes a box illustrating
Poland’s reform path to success, which Georgia may find relevant in pursuing future reforms (see box
1 in annex 2). The McKinsey & Company (2010) report - “How the World’s Most Improved School
Systems Keep Getting Better” - examines the reform experiences of twenty school systems that have
achieved significant, sustained and widespread gains as measured by national and international
assessments. According to the same report, successful education reforms have the following
characteristics in common: (i) a vision for the future of the education system and longevity of the
education leadership to sustain the vision over time; (ii) a set of comprehensive, relevant, and
mutually reinforcing interventions; (iii) structural measures to ensure the sustainability of the reforms
implying that these systems are not merely changing the explicit structure and approach of the system
but put considerable effort in transforming teachers’ perceptions about teaching; and (iv)
contextualizing the interventions to navigate their challenges and use their context to their advantage.
The analysis also revealed that all improving school systems appear to adopt a similar set of
interventions, one that is appropriate to their stage of development of the journey. These six
interventions are: (i) revising curriculum and standards, (ii) ensuring an appropriate reward and
remuneration structure for teachers and principals, (iii) building the technical skills of teachers and
principals, (iv) assessing students, (v) establishing data systems, and (vi) facilitating the improvement
journey through the publication of policy documents and implementation of education laws (see the
               Georgia: Education Sector Policy Review                                                                                         16


          table below). The Table shows some of the milestones that systems in different development stages
          should pursue in order to improve. Georgia has already adopted some of the interventions presented in
          the table (decentralization of management, adoption of per student financing scheme to improve
          transparency, adoption of teacher standards and certification system) getting the foundations in place,
          but not all the essential components from the same cluster (putting in place proper accountability
          system to support decentralized management), therefore Georgia will need to finalize and consolidate
          gains from the initial reform efforts, but also move forward into the next stage of development
          emphasizing reform interventions illustrated for transition from “good to great” system, such as
          raising caliber of entering and existing teachers and principals, supporting school-based decision
          making.

1.4 This chapter presents a thorough analysis of the status of the education sector in Georgia in terms
of student learning achievement, labor market outcomes and social inclusion issues. The objective of
this chapter is to provide evidence based background for setting the strategic priorities of the
Education Sector Strategy.



       1.1 Student Learning and Labor Market Outcomes
1.5      Quality of education in Georgia is monitored through diverse instruments, such as
national and international student assessments, monitoring curriculum implementation and
centralized examinations, but not in a systematic manner. Policy makers in all best-performing
education systems resort to various assessment procedures (examinations, national and international
assessments) to obtain information on what knowledge, attitudes and skills are obtained by learners as
a result of their exposure to schooling and to what extent these competencies are compatible to the
needs of the global competitive economy of the 21st century. The interest in assessing student
learning has grown in countries where public services are being reorganized to allow for the use of
decentralized provision of services and in education systems which undergo fundamental reforms.
These changes require putting in place new clear regulations and arrangements for monitoring the
system, compliance with the set goals and for evaluating the performance of actors.

1.6     National assessments have not been carried out on a regular basis and used to inform
policy making. The responsibility for assessment function has shifted many times among three
different education agencies, which affected both the quality and possibility to compare trends over
time. The reasons behind were that each institution had varied capacity and used different
methodologies in each of the assessment round. To date, the most useful source for judging the
quality of student learning outcomes are the results of international assessments. Georgia joined
TIMSS and PIRLS international assessments since 2006 and a PISA assessment was conducted only
once in 20092 . It is important to establish coordinated mechanisms for national assessments and
ensuring the platform to discuss, plan, monitor and use the results effectively. MoES needs to put in
place central advisory council for the elaboration of policy and approaches for national assessments
with wide participation of all important stakeholders.

1.7     Improving student performance is a key challenge facing Georgia. According to the
results achieved in TIMSS and PIRLS 2011, academic performance of Georgian students in key
learning domains (literacy, mathematics and science) remains low as compared to CIS countries, CEE
and Western European countries, as illustrated in Figure 1.1 below.

assessment

1.8      The education system is failing to provide functional literacy to an overwhelming
majority of students. This point is well demonstrated by the Program for International Student
Assessment (PISA 2009 Plus) results. In the PISA 2009 Plus, only a small percentage of the surveyed
Georgian 15 year olds (30% to 40% depending on the subject) scored level 2 or above, the threshold
that is usually referred to as functional literacy. These results are a very important warning sign for
the education system as a whole, as it means that over 60% of the surveyed 15-year-old population in
schools would be considered as functionally illiterate by international standards. The gap between
Georgia and other comparative countries on the reading scale is quite significant and it means a
difference of approximately three years of school (each year accounts for 40 points) compared to
OECD average scores.

1.9    National Curriculum has an important role to guide teachers for improving teaching
and learning outcomes. Georgia has already achieved much through the adoption of the first national

curriculum in 2005 and full-scale implementation across the country since 2006.The underlying
principle for the new curriculum I to ensure modern and outcomes-based teaching. The document is
oriented on students’ personal development and on equipping students with solid, dynamic and
functional education in line with modern challenges and demands. The new curriculum was further
revised in 2010. However, the implementation of the National Curriculum has been a major challenge
due to many institutional changes in the system and given the fact that the changes introduced in the
National Curriculum were not aligned with sufficient capacity building of teachers. The short-term
trainings and the lack of sufficient professional development support at the school level, prevented
teachers to fully internalize the new concepts prompted by the new curriculum and adapt their
classroom practices accordingly. Moreover, changes introduced in the curriculum content in 2010
were not based on the comprehensive evaluation of the curriculum implementation in the previous
years. The absence of the curriculum implementation monitoring system at the classroom level has
limited the potential benefits of improved curriculum. Moving forward, comprehensive evaluation of
the curriculum content and regular monitoring of the National Curriculum implementation at the
classroom level will be critical to identify curriculum improvements needs, modify the curriculum
content, textbooks and support materials, and teacher training accordingly.

1.10     Evidence from different learning measurements shows that there is a clear gap between
students living in urban and rural areas. The results of 2011 PIRLS and TIMSS indicate
significant disparities in the performance of students by residence (urban/rural). More specifically, 4th
grade students in urban areas scored 49, 42 and 40 points higher compared to their peers in remote
and rural areas in reading, mathematics, and sciences respectively. These findings are consistent with
PISA 2009 results. The students in Tbilisi perform 49, 55 and 35 points higher on average in reading,
mathematics, and science respectively compared to students who live in villages (see table 1 in annex
2). These differences are equivalent to 1.6, 1.8, and 1.2 years of schooling. The differences between
rural and urban students remain after controlling for student socio-economic characteristics.

1.11    Education outcomes also indicate important differences between students from different
socio-economic backgrounds. PISA results show that students who performed better are more likely
to come from: (i) the capital or large cities; and (ii) more advantaged families, according to the Home
Educational Resources (HER) Index. This index is based on parents and students’ reports of the
number of books, the number of children’s books, the presence of four educational aids (computer,
study desk for own use, books of their own, and access to a daily newspaper) in the home, and on
parents’ education. Performance differences for students with these socioeconomic bac kgrounds are
quite remarkable.

1.12    The comparison of data trends further highlights the correlation between socio-
economic indicators and student performance. As illustrated in the figure below, performance of
students with higher parental education in TIMSS has improved considerably between 2007 and 2011,
namely by 45 points in science and by 79 points in mathematics. In contrast, performance of students
whose parents have only basic education has deteriorated by 16 and 25 points in science and
mathematics respectively. The reading achievement results from PIRLS also indicate that students
with parents with higher education attainment have improved their performance by 24 points.

 1.13 Employment rates among Georgian youth are low irrespective of their level of
 educational attainment. The differences in employment rates are not significant between upper
 secondary and VET graduates in the age group of 19 to 24, but in the older age group employment
 rates are lower for VET graduates. However, it must be noted that the share of hired professionals is
 much higher for the graduates of VET programs as compared to the graduates of upper secondary
 education in both age groups. The employment rate is higher among higher education graduates aged
 19-24, however, the difference is not significant among the older age group. Young people with
 higher education diplomas are more likely to have higher earnings3 compared to their peers with
 secondary education. Nonetheless, a large share of these young people has the jobs that do not
 require higher education (see tables 1.2 and 1. 3 below).

Education is producing neither cognitive nor social skills. There is a large pool of jobless workers
with tertiary and secondary education, which could suggest that employers should not have problems
finding workers with skills to perform the necessary labor. However, many Georgian employers
complain that hiring workers with required skills is difficult. Importantly, innovative and growing
firms suffer from skill shortages the most. According to the World Bank 2012 Employer Survey, the
largest problem that employers face in Georgia is the skills of their workers. Employers in Georgia
are looking for the professionals with effective social, literacy and numeracy skills, and higher order
cognitive skills, such as solving problems and making presentations. According to Georgian
employers, young workers most often lack foreign language, leadership, creative thinking and
problem solving skills, as reported in Table 1.4. It should be noted that part of the mismatch may be
explained by the fact that employers expect graduates to learn job-specific skills in school and that is
not the objective of the education system. In any case, there are indications that graduates come to the
labor market with severe basic skills gaps. This is also evidenced by PISA 2009 which shows that
upon the completion of compulsory education, the prevailing majority of students do not have the
basic cognitive skills that are needed to successfully engage in further studies or enter the labor
market. This implies that skill shortages, if not addressed, may become an important constraint to the
modernization and growth of the Georgian economy4 .

1.14     High unemployment rates can be partially explained by the lack of specific professional
skills in demand by the economy. The majority of jobs in Georgia are located in the traditional, low-
productivity sectors, while only a minority is in modern, high-productivity sectors. While common to
many countries, this traditional employment structure limits the demand for highly educated workers.5
This is further supported by the World Bank 2012 employers’ survey, which showed that there is a
growing demand for middle-skilled workers, which the education sector is not producing.

1.15     Student choices of study programs are made without adequate knowledge of labor
market needs and existing instruments for making impact on student choices are not effective.
The majority of university students are enrolled in academic fields in social sciences, humanities, arts,
business, and law. However, according to a recent study6, the unemployment rate is higher for the
graduates of social sciences, humanities, and arts programs. Enrolment in these programs in Georgia
is higher compared to European and CIS average. In order for students to make intelligent decisions
on their future career fields, they need to have reliable information on labor market prospects. Starting
from 2010, the Government has been trying to affect the students’ choice through financing. There is
a higher share of grants allocated into sciences, engineering, education compared to law and business
so that students enrolled in business and law can receive the state funding only in case they score high
enough to be eligible for the 100% tuition fee waiver. However, the quality of government estimates
is also not quite reliable as the links with private sector market employers are practically non-existent.
Informed decision making in the process of choosing the profession still represents the significant
challenge for the pupils and potential students. In order to address the need, the MoES started
establishment of professional orientation system, which will be piloted from 2014 in 300 general
education institutions.

Key Recommendations
1.16 A radical improvement of the relevance of education and training is necessary.
Education and training must be relevant to individuals and to the labor market. Recent studies on
Georgia’s workforce development and skill mismatch recommend that substantial progress must be
achieved to enable the MoES to acquire a good understanding of labor market needs and develop the
capability to design and redesign programs so that they fit the needs of employers and the society.

This would require a renewed partnership between the education and training system and the private
sector to close information and knowledge gaps that would allow employers to better communicate
what they expect from education and training sector, and educators to improve quality and to better
assess and certify learning. The education system in Georgia would benefit from regular assessments
of the needs of the labor market, which could help increase the relevance of lifelong learning for both
job seekers and employers. Additionally, regular analysis of vacancies should be also carried out to
guide retraining services. However, this is likely to be an activity which requires coordination of
multiple ministries and stakeholders, not only the MoES. For these purposes, it is important that the
government recognizes employers as strategic partners and formalizes their role, in setting priorities
and in enhancing skills-upgrading for workers7.

1.17      The diagnostic analysis reveals two key challenges facing the general education sector in
Georgia: (i) poor learning outcomes, the education system is failing to provide functional literacy to
an overwhelming majority of students (over 60% of the surveyed 15 year olds are functionally
illiterate); and (ii) Indications of a skills mismatch between what is learned and what the labor market
needs. The key recommendations targeted at improving the quality of education are as follows:

        To address the issue that a large majority of students in general education lacks basic
         proficiency skill in key learning domains, such as literacy and numeracy (applied to analyzing
         and solving problems tested by PISA), as evidenced by the existing student assessments,
         improvements to the quality of education – including curricular improvements- should focus
         on eradicating functional illiteracy and developing key competencies that would prepare
         secondary education graduates to either pursue higher education or succeed in the labor
         market. In its efforts for strengthening competency based curriculum improvements, Georgia
         may benefit from the resources and networking opportunities available through the European
         project Key Competence Network on School Education (KeyCoNET). The latter is a growing
         network of European countries for improving implementation of key competencies in
         education reform.
        It is essential to harmonize other components of the education system with the national
         curriculum changes. This includes alignment of the in-service teacher training and
         professional development, high stakes examinations and school improvement and
         development policies and plans with the curricula modifications and innovations.
        The low Employment and underemployment amongst graduates suggest relevance problems
         for vocational education and training and higher education programs. The Focus on
         relevance by shifting to a demand-led approach in which employers’ feedback help shape the
         education system will be needed. This will require a better understanding of the current
         situation and building consensus among training providers, employers, and key policy
         providers. In the meantime, the existing quality assurance system needs to be developed in
         line with the internationally recognized quality assurance frameworks and focus on relevance
         fostering a demand-led approach.

1.18     Georgian youth need adequate information on the labor market prospects to make informed
study and career choices. This can be achieved by introducing counselling services at educational
institutions or resources centers and web based programs providing information on the employment
rates by study programs and institutions.



        1.2 Access and Equity
1.19   The nature of the social inclusion issues cuts across all the educational levels and is
manifested in major gaps in participation rates. The disadvantaged groups, such as children and youth

from poor socio-economic backgrounds, ethnic minorities, special needs students, face various
challenges related to access and equity at each level of education. While participation issues are
largely attributed to social and cultural issues, lack of consolidated social inclusion policy further
exacerbates the problem.

1.20     Preschool enrolment in Georgia is low by regional standards. Regional comparisons show
that the net enrolment rate in Georgia (46% for 2011/12 of which 40% in public and 4% in private
kindergartens) is higher than Azerbaijan and Armenia but significantly lower than New Member
States (EU) or CIS countries, such as Belarus, Moldova, and Ukraine and far from EU’s or OECD’s
nearly universal coverage (see figure 1.4 below).8

1.21     The enrolment rates showed moderate but promising growth in the last decade.
Preschool enrolment sharply declined following Georgia’s independence and Net Enrollment Rate
(NER) in public kindergartens decreased from 44.6% in 1989/90 to 28.3% in 2001/02. This sharp
decrease was attributed to several factors that affected the country during that period: economic
crises, political destabilization, the Abkhazia War and civil war9. In the early 2000s, it started to
recover, rising from approximately 28% in 2001 to almost 40% in 2006. However, after the
decentralization reform of preschool education was introduced in 2005 this recovery abruptly stopped
and enrolment rates have remained almost stagnant for several years. This can be explained by the
2005 decentralization reform placing the financial burden on municipalities. Many municipalities
were not able to sustain the existing kindergartens due to the lack of resources. Recent signs of
improvement are encouraging, as enrolment rates showed moderate but promising growth during the
last five years from 36.9% in 2008 to 57% in 2013 (figure 1 in annex 2).The growth can be partially
explained by the increase in the municipality budget for preschool institutions.

1.22   Significant enrolment disparities are visible across regions. The recent evolution of gross
enrolment rates by regions shows clear signs of growth in all regions since 2003 (see table 3 in annex
2). However, recent trends also indicate marked enrolment disparities exist across regions. Gross
enrolment rates are over 70% in some regions (Tbilisi and Mtskheta and Tianeti) and less than half of

that in others (31% in Samtskhe and Javakheti).. These disparities among municipalities appear to be
correlated with the intensity of public expenditure after controlling per child expenditures.

1.23     Although recent trends show positive improvement in enrollments, considerable gaps
between various population groups remain. Significant parts of the Georgian society are
underrepresented in their participation in preschool education. Although their enrolment showed
positive signs and increased in the last few years, their relative position is still poor. Table 1.5 shows
the evolution of net enrolment rates for the most important underrepresented groups: people living in
rural areas and people from different economic backgrounds. The gross enrolment ratio among rural
children has increased to 41% from 2010 to 2013. Participation is also increasing steadily among
children from poor backgrounds (from 42% in 2010 to 57% in 2013). The gap between richest and the
poorest quintiles between urban and rural children remain the same.

which could be partially attributed to the variation in the fee exemption policies among municipalities
within the regions.

1.25    Abolishment of parental contribution towards pre-school education in September 20013
has resulted in higher coverage, but is not likely to enhance the quality of the service being
provided if no further measures are taken. The role of the Ministry of Education and Science has
remained limited and there has been no effective enforcement of minimum quality of service delivery
and equal provision across the country. Similar to Georgia, in the majority of countries, preschool
provision is decentralized to the local levels and such arrangement has many strengths. In contrast,
however, the central government tends to play an active role in setting coherent national quality
standards and monitoring service delivery. Given that currently the Ministry is developing a new law
on preschool education and new consolidated educations sector strategy, there is an excellent
opportunity to re-examine the role of MES in preschool education and introduce mechanisms within
the current institutional set up to provide (i) coherent national goals for preschool education; (ii)
coherent preschool education standards and curricula: (iii) viable system to facilitate and monitor the
quality of preschool education service delivery across the country.

1.26    The limited geographical coverage of the preschool network is the most important factor for
enrolment disparities in rural areas. About half of the parents interviewed in 2011 said the reason their
child was not enrolled in a kindergarten was that there was none close to their home or in their village.

As NIHS data suggests, physical access to kindergartens is particularly problematic for ethnic
minority population. Forty-eight percent of parents in rural population and sixty-seven percent of
Azerbaijani parents said there was no kindergarten close to their home or in their village (see Table
1.6).

1.27     Enrolment in compulsory education is almost universal, although, participation in
upper secondary education is low. Georgia has historically enjoyed universal literacy rates and high
value placed on education. Table 1.7 below shows that enrolment is high in compulsory education
achieving NER of 96.9 percent in primary education (Grades 1 through 6) and 85 percent in lower
secondary (Grades 7 through 9). However, enrolment at upper secondary education level is only 73.1
percent.

1.28     The transition from lower to upper secondary education is problematic. A reduction in
enrolment is visible at the end of lower secondary, where dropout rates rapidly escalate from Grades
eight to nine raising from 0.88% to 6.48%. Figure 1.7 below shows that high dropout rates are then
common throughout upper secondary (Grades 10 through 12). A plausible explanation for this
situation points to recent school management practices applied after the introduction of the school
leaving exams in 2011. The low performance of students in school leaving exams was used to fire
principals in several schools, without giving consideration to the complexities pertinent to specific
schools based on their location. This punishment provided incentives to the principals to identify
students at risk of failing the exams early in the process and discourage them to continue studies in
upper grades. This seems to explain the visible effects in the following school year (2012-13) where
many students either repeated the class or dropped out altogether. The situation appears to have
improved since the punishment was not formally repeated in the subsequent years, however, it is still
too early to say that this tendency is definitive as it is not known if school principals continue to apply
these measures informally. This situation is creating a significant early school-leaving situation; this is
a problem that the country will have to address rapidly as early school leaving generates substantial

social costs in the medium term. Prevention is the most important action to address early school
leaving, as the compensation policies that are needed to resolve it are usually very costly.

1.30     Inclusion of special needs students in general education remains a challenge. Initial
efforts to introduce the principles of inclusive education in the education sector were launched in
2004. The inclusive education has been promoted at the general education level. Since 2012, efforts
were launched to provide inclusive education at the vocational education and training level. Neither
vocational nor higher education law has been amended to guarantee the rights of special needs
students. All public schools are required to implement inclusive education, however not all of them
have appropriate facilities. According to MoES, only 249 general education schools are equipped with
ramps and 190 with special resource room. Public schools’ learning environment is not adapted for
the children with sensory disabilities. Currently the education system only provides boarding schools
for children with hearing disability, for visually impaired children and for children with mental
disorders. Approximately 3,450 Special Education Needs (SEN) students are currently involved in
formal education system. The demand from parents to expand opportunities for SEN students has
been growing in recent years, which is a positive trend but much work remains to be done to ensure
adequate learning environment and well trained teachers to accommodate this need.

1.31    Within the reform framework a multidisciplinary team has been introduced at the Ministry of
Education and Science consisting of psychologist, special education teacher and occupational
therapist to assess those children, whose parents require such assessment. Evaluation procedures are
yet to be developed for placement of students in an institution, boarding school or just a regular
classroom. The standard evaluations would need to include IQ, academic, adaptive, social/emotional
and motor skills.

1.32    The Inclusive Education group at the Ministry of Education and Science has developed an
action plan for the development of Inclusive Education 2014-16, which has to following provisions:
elaborating the legal framework, improving the financing mechanism for SEN pupils and students,
ensuring quality inclusive education at all three levels of education (school, vocational, higher) and
developing the mechanism for monitoring SEN pupils and students.

1.33    The new per capita financing system has special provisions of inclusive education.
Namely, if a school has 1 to 7 special needs children, they are staffed with one special education
teacher with the annual funding of 4,200 GEL; schools with 7 to 14 students special needs students

1.34     Following the rise of new private institutions, VET enrolment is growing to approach
the level prior to 2008. According to information gathered by MES and Geostat, enrolment in VET
programs sharply decreased in 2008 with the closure of many vocational education institutions. The
demand has been on the rise with enrolment doubling between 2010 and 2011 and further increasing
in 2012 (Figure 1.8). The increase in participation can be attributed both to positive and somewhat
controversial interventions in recent years. On one hand, the government’s investments in
infrastructure of public institutions, increased focus on improving quality of the programs, and
increasingly important network of private providers might have increased the attractiveness of the
sector. At the same time, many low-performing students were discouraged to continue academic
stream since in 2010 school principals were made accountable for student results in school leaving
exams (discussed previously). Moreover, participation increased at the expense of very short VET
programs, the quality of which, though not formally assessed, is not seen as being high.

The ample majority of students enrolled in VET belongs to the age group of 15-18 (7,800 students)
and the age group of 19-21 (7,160 students), but these figures represent only a fraction of these age
group populations (for example, only 4% of 19-21 age group participate in VET) (Team’s
calculations based on VET 2013 database provided by EMIS).

Currently, there are 34 public and 66 private VET centers, community colleges, and universities that
offer vocational education and training programs. The network of VET programs has grown from 442
to 529 in 2013.12


12The MoES has collected the data on enrollment from public and private VET centers in 2012 and 2013; however, the data
on private enrollments is incomplete. Therefore, it is the dynamics in private enrolments.

1.36     Access to VET remains a challenge in several regions of the country. In some parts of the
country there are no VET centers. Young people from these regions have to move to other cities to
study, which is associated with high cost especially for the poor who represent the major barrier to
VET. From 2012 to 2013 the number of VET centers has increased, but their geographical
distribution is still not addressing these issues fully; .

1.37     Since the approval of the State Professional Education Reform Strategy 2013-2020, one of the
most important initiatives was the development of VET network expansion plan. Throughout 2013,
the MoES also introduced new admission exams specifically designed for VET applicants and
expanded VET applicant registration sites from 3 to 103 centers. On the quality side, the Ministry
through EU and UNDP support updated 75 standards13 based on Dacum methodology, which focuses
on engaging employers in the standard revision process; Moreover, work was launched to revise the
existing Qualification Framework; the Modular Education Concept Note, Validation Guide and other
methodological materials were developed in close consultation with the stakeholders. The strategy for
private sector engagement in VET was also prepared through the support of the Millennium
Challenge Account Georgia. In 2013, inclusive education has been introduced and more than 100
beneficiaries have been enrolled in vocational colleges. The inclusive education specialists and
assistants started working at vocational colleges, training materials are being adapted, the
infrastructure projects are planned according to the principles of universal design.

1.38     Dead ends and rigid pathways to higher levels of education are also constraints of the
current VET system. Prior to the 2005 reform, vocational and technical education was offered at the
secondary level and students enrolled in secondary vocational and technical programs received
secondary education together with vocational and technical education and training. The rationale
behind the 2005 reforms was to create easier paths to employment and to quickly address the existing
skills mismatch, which resulted in the introduction of numerous short and medium (from 3 months to
2 years) vocational education programs for graduates of compulsory lower secondary education
programs (grade 9). Vocational education and training programs became disengaged from secondary
education and students who enroll in vocational programs based on lower secondary education no
longer receive a secondary education diploma and qualifications entitling them for further education
paths. More specifically, these students are not prepared to pass external examinations for obtaining
school diploma, a prerequisite for participation in the university entrance examinations. This has
somewhat decreased the attractiveness of vocational and technical education and is probably related
with a marked reduction in enrolment (from 20% in 1999 to 3% in 2009). An additional problem is
created by the fact that the credits accumulated in VET programs are not recognized in higher and
tertiary education programs creating further dead ends.

13 50 standards were updated by NCEQE, 17 by EU and 8 by UNDP.

1.39    Despite recent progress, dropouts in VET are still generating significant wastage of
resources. According to latest data, the overall dropout rate for VET programs decreased from 20%
to 8% from 2012 to 2013 (EMIS, 2014). This reduction was more marked in public education (from
23% in 2012 to 8% in 2013) than in private and 8% of public VET program students drop out. This
means that more than 1,000 VET students dropped out from the public education system in
2013There is no comprehensive analysis of the reasons explaining the high dropout rates, but several
issues emerged from the available analysis: (i) low academic readiness of students for the selected
program; (ii) the lack of information about the course and the profession (when the decision is made)
and poor counselling; (iii) low quality of some of the programs (such as Gardening, Marketing, Tour
Operator and Restaurant Administrator), which are marked by particularly high dropout rates on
average.

1.40    The first voucher scheme was introduced by the Government in April 2012. The voucher
program was the main source of VET financing for students in Georgia. . The financing for VET
programs levels I to III was provided in the form of student vouchers (both full and partial). The
voucher amount was flat fixed at 1,000 GEL and did not differentiate the costs of the different study
programs. Tuition waiver of 700 GEL was applicable only for priority programs determined by
MoES. Only vulnerable students and students under state care were given full funding as well as the
ones passing specific tests. Programs at levels IV and V had similar financing arrangement as higher
education programs, where financing was provided through student grants based on the results
achieved in the general aptitude test of the university entrance examinations.

1.41    Financing of the VET sector was reformed and the new financing scheme was launched
in November, 2013. Three main financing mechanisms were introduced: (i) differentiated vouchers
based on the number of students taking into account costs of individual study programs and replacing
the previous flat vouchers. These vouchers cover teacher salaries and learning materials; (ii) Program
budget transferred quarterly to VET institutions to cover administrative costs and utilities, the size of
budget support varies depending on the size of VET institutions; and (iii) targeted program financing
to support Ministry’s different priority initiatives. According to the new scheme, vouchers are
awarded to all students who successfully pass the newly introduced VET unified admission exams
and are admitted in public vocational institutions. Despite these positive shifts, some critical problems
regarding financing remain to be addressed. The indirect costs borne by the students are not included
in the voucher. The cost of living expenses pose serious challenges for poor students from rural and
remote areas, because students who wish to enroll in VET programs have to pay for their living
expenses. Because of this reason, the MoES paid rent for VET students in Mestia in 2014.

1.42    Enrolment in Higher Education in Georgia is low by international standards. Currently,
50 private and 18 public research and teaching universities and colleges enroll a total of 146,600
students. In 2012 the gross enrolment ratio in higher education reached 28%, which is one of the
lowest in the region and significantly lower compared to the average GER in Western European and
CEE countries. Compared to other levels of education in Georgia, private enrolment is highest at
higher education level, although it has dropped from 53% in 1999 to 25% in 2011. At pre-primary and
general education levels (Grades 1 to 12), private enrolment constitutes to 10% of total enrolment.
Georgia’s private enrolment at higher education level is high compared to most countries in the region
except for Kazakhstan (50%), Latvia (94%), Estonia (84%), Romania (37%) and Poland (33%).

1.43     Participation rates in Higher Education are particularly low among traditionally
underrepresented groups. Table 1.8 shows that ethnic minorities, youth from rural areas and poor
families are largely underrepresented in higher education. The differences in enrolment are notorious:
rural enrolment accounts for one-third of the national average; enrolment of the poorest quintile is
three times lower than the national average and almost eight times lower than the one from the richest
quintile. Without creating enabling conditions and providing support (financial or otherwise), the
present system is unable to address these inequities.

1.44     Admission to higher education is mostly merit-based creating equity concerns. Students
in Georgia have to pass a high-stakes National Unified Admission Exams, which is the only
determinant used for enrolling students into the higher education. This problem is acute given that the
quality of public general education is not homogenous across the country as evidenced by PISA 2009
results, which shows large disparities in achievement by socio-economic status and residence.

1.45     Wide-spread private tutoring further exacerbates equity issues. Apart from quality
disparities in Georgian schools, students from well off families often resort to private tutoring to
compensate for low quality of schooling and prepare for university admission exams, which is not
affordable for poor families. Some families access private tutoring starting from the primary level but
it is more common at the secondary level. 16Sixteen percent of students at primary level, 37% at a

basic level and 60% of students in the 12th grade take private classes on a regular basis. Private
tutoring differs by place of residence and family income, as shown in table below. As a consequence,
merit-based university admission system further penalizes poor segments of population.

USD$6,424 in private institutions. As a share of GDP per capita, this represents 37% in public
institutions, 94% in private research universities and 51% in private teaching universities. This level
of tuition fees is common to some post-soviet countries (Azerbaijan, Armenia, Kazakhstan) but very
high when compared to countries in Europe and Northern America as well as other developed
countries (Japan, South Korea, Australia). In contrast, tuition fee as a percentage of GDP in these
countries range from 1 to 20 percent in public universities, 2 to 50 percent in private universities. This
puts Georgia among the countries with the highest tuition fees both in public and private tertiary
institutions (see table 4 in annex 2).

1.47    The bulk of the financial support provided to students is in the form of merit-based state
grants, full or partial. Only 6 to 10 percent of the total student grant amount is allocated by means of
need-based support for students from minority language schools, schools in remote areas, students
from conflict zones, orphans and students with several siblings, students eligible for social assistance,
etc. The allocation of the need-based grants also has a merit component in it. The students who apply
for need-based grants are ranked by their test scores within their quota group and the ones with the
highest scores receive the grant. The government does not offer student loans to support students to
bear the costs of higher education (see table 1.10).

1.48     The current system for the allocation of student grants intensifies inequities. Table 1.10
shows that up to 50 percent of all students receive different subsidies from the state. Tertiary
enrolment and grant allocation figures for secondary school graduates in 2010 show clear disparities
in grant allocation by residence (see table 1.11). The share of students who received state student
grant was 13% larger among Tbilisi residents when compared to students living in towns and rural
locations and 8% larger than for students living in other major cities (Kutaisi, Batumi, and Rustavi).
Moreover, students with more educated parents are also more likely to benefit from the current
student support system. A higher education graduate tracer study conducted in 2013 showed that 47%
of students whose both parents had higher education degree received state grant while the share of
state grant beneficiaries was 28% and 16% for students with only one parent with higher education
and none of the parents with higher education respectively.

1.49    The existing higher education programs are rigid and do not meet the needs of students
who need to work on a full or part-time basis. An emerging challenge in TE education is the large
share of undergraduate students being employed full-time. According to 2012 Integrated Household
Survey, 15% of students enrolled in TE institutions have part or full time jobs and almost half of these
students work 40 or more hours a week (see table 5 in annex 2). The students might be working for

financial reasons or for accumulating the experience that would make them more competitive in the
labor market. According to the World Bank Study, employers value previous experience highly.15
These students, however, are not given an option of part-time studies because the law on higher
education does not allow for such option for universities to offer. Irrespective of how many courses a
student takes a semester, s/he has to pay the full tuition. This arrangement makes the university
system highly rigid and forces students into less engagement in their studies. Other options such as
acknowledging progress through a credit system, providing part-time or evening courses are not
available.

Key Recommendations
1.50 Improving access and equity is a key strategic objective that requires strategic, sector-
wide planning and management. Social inclusion standards, targets, measures and tools must be
defined at the national level and not left to the arbitrary decision of the schools and municipalities.
The nature of the social inclusion programs and measures cuts across all the educational areas, and
therefore, their overall monitoring and evaluation requires special ministerial attributions that are not
today defined at the centralized level. The responsibility for implementing and monitoring of many of
these policy measures can be delegated to sub-sector area management units (pre-school, general,
etc.), however there is subject specific knowledge (children with disabilities, usage of mother tongues
in education, adult education, etc.) that would benefit from a more integral understanding of the topics
for all education areas.

1.51     A fundamental issue that needs to be addressed is that the ministry is operating in the
absence of a Social Inclusion Policy that should define the main principles, goals and targets
together with the criteria to guide its implementation. Partial initiatives are already emerging in
this area, (regarding adult education, children with disabilities and dealing with displaced population
and ethnic minorities), but a more integral approach and stronger support is needed to achieve good
educational results.

         To address the issue of low preschool enrolment by regional standards despite moderate
          increase in the last decade, and the exclusion of several groups (ethnic minorities, rural
          children and children leaving in poverty); it is critical to find the most affordable solution
          before starting the preschool network expansion. The expansion should take into account all
          possible means of reducing costs for the provision of new classrooms (including efficiency
          gains, public private partnerships and other) in all areas. Consultation with a wide range of
          stakeholders should be a precondition for any further expansion of the system. The follow
          options can be considered:

          o   Prioritizing the five-year old children, in case there are no spots for all children.
              Providing all children with at least one year of preschool education is likely to improve
              school readiness.

          o   Bringing the private sector in can have beneficial impact. By encouraging the private
              sector to provide preschool education, the Government would (i) allow for different
              options of service delivery, which can be appealing to parents that are willing to pay for
              these differentiated services and (ii) free spots for poorer children in the public system. If
              demand is in place and supply of public institutions is not large enough or parents have
              different preferences with respect to the type of preschool education, private institutions
              with different models will arise. In this scenario, the existence of a body that assures
              quality standards and monitoring preschool institutions is critical.

          o   Building public awareness. The individual benefits of preschool education should be
              underscored as a means of making parents more knowledgeable about preschool
              education and hence more willing enroll their children. There is anecdotal evidence that

15Rutkowski, 2013 based on World Bank employer STEP survey, 2012
Georgia: Education Sector Policy Review                                                                      35


            in many cases, parents are more concerned with food provision rather that the quality of
            teaching and care.

        o   Planning for more inclusive access to existing pre-school services. The measures that are
            being applied somehow worked, but enrolment is not growing fast enough for these
            underrepresented groups. The preparation of a national plan is essential, and it should not
            be a costly exercise. It may take a full calendar year to complete, as it is necessary to
            develop it in consultation with key stakeholders (including samples of the families of
            future users). The plan must offer clear estimations of the costs of resolving financial and
            capacity asymmetries for all municipalities.

        o   Phasing in free of charge service provision for all, and prioritizing the most needy and
            disadvantaged socioeconomic groups would be important. Whenever there is
            oversubscription in public institutions, ensure priority is given to low-income/socio-
            economic status families and ethnic minorities. The possibility of using the existing
            Targeted Social Assistance (TSA) mechanism to support the disadvantaged families
            could be considered. The possibility that rich children – whose parents could pay for this
            service – takes up the place of poor children in free preschool is of important concern..

        o   Improving efficiency in the use of existing preschool infrastructure. The government
            could consider using the facilities of existing, underutilized primary schools.

       To address the issue that the curriculum at upper-secondary education is rigid and not
        tailored for students with different academic backgrounds and aspirations and thus narrow
        enrolment at this level, there is need to diversify education paths at upper secondary level in
        order to accommodate students with various interest, aspirations, and backgrounds. This
        includes introduction of more flexible curriculum to allow students concentrate in the areas of
        interest along with core curriculum.

       To address the issue of dead ends for VET graduates, as well as low attractiveness of VET
        stream, adding general education component to VET programs should be considered. This
        would help to improve the employability of these students and compensate for the fact that
        they are streamed relatively early in their lives, before they get the basic skills. Additional
        general education helps prepare students to adapt to changing labor market circumstances,
        rather than training them for a specific occupation, which raises obstacles for those who
        choose or need to switch professions later in their lives. Alternatively, adding more general
        education content to the vocational track would also contribute to improving permeability of
        the VET system. In Georgia, due to the nature and structure of programs, VET graduates have
        significant difficulties in pursuing further education, which hinders career advancement for
        many people. The inclusion of general content in the VET courses is likely to reduce the
        content gap between general and VET track graduates. In itself, this would make it easier for
        VET graduates to compete for university admission. A cost-effective approach would be to
        add general content to VET courses that can help reduce “dead ends” and improve VET
        graduates’ chances in case they need to look for a job different than the one they studied for .

       To improve the inclusion of special needs student in general education, a good plan for social
        inclusion in general education is necessary. This is not costly, time consuming or difficult
        exercise, but it should be done in consultation with key stakeholders. The plan must offer
        clear estimations of the costs of addressing inclusion. Its final application may be costly, as it
        is could involve voucher-based support or other conditional cash transfers.

       To further expand geographical coverage of VET programs, there in need to re-orient the
        expansion plans of the system to offer better service provision in rural areas and smaller
        towns. The present initiatives to increase supply should be slightly refocused to address
        supply deficiencies to provide access to people living in these areas, for which VET would be
 Georgia: Education Sector Policy Review                                                                     36


         very important. Expand the existing financing scheme to accommodate indirect costs (living
         expenses) of VET participation can also be considered.

        To increase the low participation rates in higher education, particularly among traditionally
         underrepresented groups, there is need to reduce the high cost of higher education and
         improve student grant allocation system. It is recommended to review the usage of the student
         grants and expansion of existing programs to promote the participation of disadvantaged
         groups. Many of these measures could have an important short-term social impact and can be
         introduced fairly quickly without substantially increasing actual funding requirements. These
         measures include expansion of needs-based grants, introduction of subsidized student loans
         and introduction of flexible study programs.


        1.3 Governance
1.52      Georgia’s current education governance system has been shaped by the decentralization
and finance reforms launched in 2005. The Ministry of Education and Science is the dominant
player in education policy-making and has the primary role for the sector oversight and management
for all levels of Education (except for preschool education) in accordance to the sector priorities set by
the Parliament of Georgia through education legislation. The decentralization process was applied to
all levels of education, as part of which, management was decentralized at the institutional level
(except for preschools) and all education institutions were transformed into legal entities of public law
and new structures of internal accountability were created. More specifically, School Boards of
Trustees in schools, Supervisory Councils in VET centers and Academic and Representative Councils
in higher educational institutions. At the preschool education level, the management and financing
have been decentralized to the local government level. The intermediary institutions were set up at
preschool level (Kindergarten Agencies) and general education level (Education Resource Center
across the country). The financing system has also been transformed introducing per capita financing
system in general education and student vouchers in higher education and vocational education and
training. More details about the organizational structure of the education sector and the Ministry of
Education and Science are presented in the Annex 1.

1.53    The remaining challenge for the sector is to shift towards the governance and
accountability paradigm that would support the existing decentralized management in a more
effective manner. The existing accountability mechanisms at all levels of education are concentrated
on controlling for inputs and regulatory norms, which restricts the MoES capacity to improve the
quality of education. These governance constraints are manifested in different forms at each level of
education, as described below.

1.54    At the general education level, the functions of the existing internal audit are limited to
investigating only the compliance with regulatory norms without little attention to school
performance. The new school authorization standards are limited to evaluating only inputs, checking
technicalities related to school mission, human resources and infrastructure. At the school level, the
division of responsibilities between BoTs and Principals lacks clarity. The functions of the newly
created ERCs, originally created to support the implementation of education reforms, came down to
only bureaucratic functions. Eventually the Ministry became closely engaged in the school level
functions (selection of school principal, approving staff plans, etc.

1.55     Internal quality assurance mechanisms are ineffective. At school level, BoTs are supposed
to monitor performance of principals. The evaluation should assess school principal’s standard;
strategic plans of schools; school budgets and annual reports of principals. However, the structure and
quality of baseline documents is poor. Strategic plans of schools are mostly identical; they don’t
contain clearly formulated indicators to provide enough information for monitoring. Insufficient
attention to BoT capacity building in the state policy is also a constraint.
 Georgia: Education Sector Policy Review                                                                    37


1.56     Current mechanisms of evaluation of school performance are mostly based on the
analysis of inputs. There was only one attempt to evaluate school outcomes using the results of
school leaving examinations, but the results were used for punitive measures without proper
consideration of school characteristics that could have contributed to low results. When attempting to
assess outcomes, the MoES adopted a criterion to evaluate principals that was too narrow: principals
were fired if the failure rate for school students in school leaving exams was high. This policy resulted
in negative unintended consequences. Specifically, this gave incentives to the principals to identify at
risk students and discourage them to continue studies. This practice resulted in massive student drop
outs and increased repetition rates in the following years. One alternative is to follow more successful
education systems, which adopt a comprehensive set of outcome based monitoring instruments that
are used as part of the school accountability system, such as student performance as measured by
school based student assessment, parent satisfaction, etc. Assessment results are used to strengthen
and support school performance rather than punish individuals. A more sophisticated metric like this
can be used to assess principals’ performance.

1.57     There was insufficient investment for running the new system. According to the users of
the system, school level strategic planning “makes no sense” as funds are barely enough to pay
salaries of teachers and to cover running costs. Lack of funding put principals under the pressure to
make difficult choices between competing budgetary priorities.

1.58     At VET and Higher Education levels, the absence of effective accountability instruments
is a major obstacle to the improvement of the quality of educational institutions. The excessive
focus on inputs and processes in the present accountability mechanisms, particularly at the higher
education level, deludes the attention from what really matters – the academic results that the
educational institutions seek to achieve. In most parts of the world, educational institutions are held
accountable on various aspects including equity, quality, relevance, the contribution that universities
makes to the local or national development and nation building, internal efficiency and sustainability
of these institutions. In contrast, in Georgia, the Government puts considerable effort into controlling
inputs and processes in the post-secondary education system, which substantially restricts institutional
autonomy. At the same time, the mechanisms for measuring the results achieved by these institutions
are non-existent. Also, the accountability system is highly centralized where the state represents the
only party with little cooperation with employers, alumni, students and other stakeholders. This seems
particularly paradoxical considering that the share of government funding with regard to higher
education and in the entire system in general is very small compared to the household’s contribution.
More successful education systems exercise the accountability mechanisms that concentrate on the
results rather than the operation of HEIs, bring positive incentives rather than punishment, and are
mutually agreed or accepted voluntarily.

Key Recommendations
1.59 Despite the decentralization reform, Georgia has not been able to shift towards the
governance and accountability paradigm that is now part of leading education systems. The existing
school based management system fails to support school improvement. The following factors affect
the effectiveness of the school management system: (i) There is no proper accountability framework
between the MoES and schools; (ii) Internal quality assurance mechanisms are ineffective;(iii)
insufficient capacity development was provided to support participation of key actors;

1.60    Meaningful combination of effective school accountability and support mechanism will be an
important prerequisite to improve the quality of general education. Future quality efforts should be
targeted towards further enhancement of school autonomy through the development of strong school
accountability instruments and school improvement mechanisms. In this regard, successful
educational systems are increasingly resorting to introducing outcomes-based accountability
mechanisms focusing on school development. When introducing new school accountability
instruments, it would be essential to take into consideration the three main principles: (i)
accountability mechanisms should be designed to evaluate schools (including principals and teachers)
and help them improve. Hence, punitive measures should not be the ultimate goal of these
mechanisms, but perhaps an alternative to be used in extraordinary situations; (ii) school performance
 Georgia: Education Sector Policy Review                                                                   38


review should include diverse assessment measures and should not be relying only on standardized
tests for measuring school performance given that tests can only measure part of students’ learning;
(iii) different schools face different challenges. For example, a school with the majority of students
from lower socioeconomic background faces challenges that are very different from a school with
well-off students.

1.61     The following measures should be considered to address these school and education
institution accountability and quality assurance issues in Georgia:

       Developing a new school performance review and support system that will be focused on
        monitoring school quality and supporting school development. Such new system should be a
        part of a school improvement and development policy and tightly linked with the teacher in-
        service training and professional development. The system will also require specialized
        professionals who provide expert advice to schools. The existing structure of the education
        system (Education Resource Centers, National Quality Enhancement Center, Teachers’
        Professional Development Center, National Assessment and Examination Center) can provide
        good foundations for such review in terms of providing the needed expert support,
        particularly for low performing schools. The new school performance review and support
        system can play a leading role in helping the schools to identify their challenges and develop
        school improvement plans. The ERCs should play a role in the capacity development of
        boards of trustees to avoid one time, costly and sporadic trainings and provide more long-
        term and sustainable support to individual school board members. The ERCs should be
        equipped by centrally developed guidelines and manuals for such support.
       At VET and Higher Education levels, introducing result-based accountability mechanisms is
        essential for quality improvement. These accountability mechanisms should be built around
        measuring performance of these institutions according to defined outcomes, which can serve
        as the major driver for the improvement of the quality and output. The performance indicators
        should be agreed upon among key stakeholders and their tracking and verification need to be
        done by institutions and an independent agency respectively. The indicators should be shared
        publicly with all higher education stakeholders (e.g. parents, students, employers, etc) to
        inform both policy and personal decisions. It would be important to ensure that the future
        reform of existing authorization and accreditation system is not in conflict with the principles
        of institutional autonomy.

       1.4 Strategic Management of the Ministry of Education and
          Science
1.62     The path of recent reforms shows some recurrent problems that should be avoided in
the future. Georgia has made significant progress in reforming its education system, however, the
approach used for introducing many of them should be carefully reviewed before addressing large-
scale reforms in the future. These constraints include the following: (i) very important, large-scale
reforms were introduced before gathering a clear understanding about all their potential
consequences; (ii) the speed for the introduction of these reforms in many cases did not leave
sufficient time for their proper planning and consultation. Hence, a substantial degree of
“improvisation on the go” was later required during the implementation phase; (iii) some of the
measures introduced were not in line with existing capacity and management limitations; (iv) in many
cases, after the reforms were implemented, several “back and forth” revisions were made. This
happened in key areas, producing a general sense on instability and, at the end of the day, longer
periods to consolidate the desired outcomes of the reforms compared to what a proper introduction
would have required.

1.63   The scope and quality of the data provided by the Education Management Information
System does not effectively support the implementation of a sector-wide strategy. EMIS
development made important achievements so far and is a good experience to build on. The present
system could be improved by: (i) expanding EMIS coverage from general education to VET and
 Georgia: Education Sector Policy Review                                                                                       39


higher education; in most cases, this data is available but not part of the formal EMIS. (ii) make
access to data easier for all users and information more readily available from different databases
existing in isolation in various education agencies (i.e. EQE, NAEC) into one consolidated EMIS; and
(iii) improving the application of the existing data to support evidence-based policy making. Some
initial steps to address these issues have been launched. The new concept of school score-cards has
been developed, which is aimed to provide unified information on each school based on standardized
criteria.

1.64    The financial planning capacity of the MoES is relatively weak to ensure availability
and consistency of financial support for the implementation of a national education strategy.
More specifically, more developed economic simulation scenarios, to project the financial impact of
population trends and of specific measures that the Ministry may want to introduce or similar
financial planning tool that could substantiate any attempt to improve financial predictability and
long term support (either from the government or the international cooperation partners).

1.65    With the available data, not enough information is produced to support effective
decision-making; the production of knowledge to support strategic management is in great need
of improvement16. In many cases, the data that is available in the EMIS and other systems is not
integrated and collated to produce usable information (general statistics and trends about enrolment,
schools, teachers, social inclusion and other key areas) to support management at the national or
regional levels. The Ministry does not systematically produce all the knowledge and analysis that is
needed to support its decision-making and most of the key analytical studies that are produced are
financed by donors. Moreover, the way in which this knowledge is produced is not helping to develop
the technical capacity of the Ministry and make it self-sustainable in the long term.

Key Recommendations
1.66 The lack of a strategic vision, consistency and contradictions in the introduction of many
reforms are not generating the expected incremental and systemic improvements. “Back and forth”
implementation of radical reform measures generates instability and lack of credibility of all involved
parties about the future of education that will be difficult to overcome. The MoES “navigates blindly”
in some areas as it does not collect the data that would be necessary to appropriately manage the
education process. To address this issue, it is recommended to:

        Develop the Ministry’s policy and planning capacity, including data management and
         application, to support key strategic management functions and sustain the introduction of
         management by results practices. In particular, developing a comprehensive and evidence and
         data-based long-term sector strategy would create the opportunity to negotiate the necessary
         increases in the medium term financial support for the education sector development.

        1.5 Public Spending in Education
1.67     Georgia’s expenditure in Education is low by regional standards. Expenditures as a share
of the country’s GDP have oscillated between 2 and 3 percent since the late 1990s17. Figure 1.11
shows that this level of expenditure is low if compared to countries in the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) and New Member States in the European Union (EU). Public expenditures
in 2012 and 2013 (estimated) have been 2.8% and 2.9%, respectively, including public funding for
preschool education expenditures. The level of expenditures is much lower than other countries with
similar level of income per capita.



16 It is understood here that the strongest contribution of Information technology and systems is to assist primarily with
collecting, collating and analyzing data and information. While technology is a key enabler, it is up to humans to take this
data and information and turn it into knowledge that can be applied in the education management process. Precise definitions
of the meaning of terms “data”, “information” and “knowledge” that used in this section is provided in Annex 3.

1.68     Although total education budget substantially increased since 2006, in relative terms
government allocation for education did not show appreciative improvement. The expansion of
total government expenditure in current values18 accounted to 84% for the period 2006-2013 (see
table 1.12). The budget for education followed a similar trend and, despite some oscillations,
remained stationary around an average value of 8.3% of total government expenditure for the whole
period. The growth rate of the education budget was on average 9.52% for this period and showed
consistency with the exception of two low growth years: a sharp decrease noted during the economic
crisis in 2008 and a slight decrease in 2011 due to the decline in public allocation for preschool
education by 24% with the introduction of parental fees in 201119. The overall size of government
expenditures (total government expenditure as a percentage of GDP) showed a marked contraction in
2011 and recent figures appear to confirm that this tendency will be maintained in the near future.
This does not provide a very optimistic scenario for expecting substantial increases in the share of
education in government expenditure in the near future.

this level of education. Table 1.13 shows that the relative share of education spending for all
educational areas was stable during 2006-2012 with the only exception of VET, which suffered a
marked reduction: from 3.5% of total education expenditure in 2007 to 1.28% in 2012. For all
education levels, the majority of government funding is channeled through the MoES. Preschool
education is the main exception, which is under the responsibility of local government. A small share
of the education budget is also managed by other line ministries, which mostly support programs in
vocational and higher education in technical areas that are related to their area of competence (for

1.70     Current expenditures represent the major economic category in the state education
budget. The majority of routine expenditures is allocated for per capita financing of the general
education schools followed by subsidies and transfers to other education entities, (such as Teacher’s
Professional Development Centre, Education Infrastructure Agency, National Examination Centre) to
implement education programs. The bulk of recurrent expenditures is spent on salaries, which
represents 75-80 percent of current expenditures in general education. Capital expenditures have been
on the rise since 2008 given the increased focus of the government to address the existing investment
needs of the education infrastructure. 20

1.71    The government has also introduced some targeted programs in specific disciplines
although they form a small share of education spending. The largest share of resources is spent on
per capita financing of general education schools. Voucher financing of higher education institutions
and infrastructure programs are a distant second and third. In parallel, over the last few years, the
MoES has initiated relatively small-scale but well-targeted programs (see table 1.15) placing a focus
on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) such as “My First Computer” for first

1.72    On a per student basis, Georgia’s expenditures are lower than that of comparators in all
education levels. In preschool education the unit cost is approximately 12% of the GDP per capita (in
addition to which parents used to pay approximately 30% until 2013) while OECD and EU countries
spend about 20% of the GDP per capita. The unit cost of preschool is approximately 80% of that of
general secondary education, which is similar to the ratios in OECD and EU, however at a lower
absolute level. Expenditures per student in higher education are 30% higher than those of general
secondary education. This is relatively low when compared to the EU and OECD countries, which
spend approximately 60% more per higher education student. Vocational education expenditures in
2012 were particularly high because of heavy capital investment. There are 12,746 students attending
public institutions. In addition to these students, there is a small share of students who receive the
state voucher and attend private institutions.

Georgia. Despite the gradual increase of teacher salaries in the last decade22, they remain below the

only public spending. Vocational education expenditures in 2012 were particularly high because of heavy capital investment
There are 12,746 students attending public institutions, but there are some students who receive the state voucher and
attended private institutions. Due to this, we provide an upper bound for the unit cost (assuming that no students in private
institutions had the voucher).
22 In order to make the profession more attractive, the government introduced changes in the teacher compensation scheme
in January 2013. The base salary of teachers rose from 245 GEL, set in 2009, to 305 GEL. As a result, this change has raised
teachers’ wages in a range of 26 to 60 percent amounting to about 60 -205 GEL.

average national salaries. According to figures of the National Statistics Office of Georgia the average
monthly salary for 2013 (fourth quarter) is of 875 GEL, while the average monthly salary in education
is 475 GEL23. As can be seen in the figure 1.12, the education staff receives the lowest salaries from
all professions. Entry salaries and progressions do not offer great incentives either. Neither the
number of years in service nor the academic degrees determine significant salary increases. For
example, the salary of a BA holder beginner teacher is of 359.90 GEL, the difference with a BA
holder who has 5 to 10 years of experience is only 14 GEL (373.63 GEL). The salary of BA holder
with up to 5 years of experience compared to a teacher who gained an MA degree only increases by
40 GEL (from 359.90 to 394.98 GEL)24.

1.74    Teacher salaries in Georgia are among the lowest compared to other countries that
participated in PISA 2009. Analyzing 2009 teacher salaries relative to GDP per capita, teachers with
minimum training and 10 years of experience in Georgia are paid at substantially lower levels as
compared to other countries (see Figure1.13 below).

1.75     Private sector financing of higher education in Georgia is amongst the highest in the
region. Table 1.16 shows the comparative figures for both private and public expenditure as a
percentage of GDP for a selection of countries. Private expenditure as a share of GDP in Georgia
accounts for 0.75%, this is much higher than Kazakhstan (0.52%), Russian Federation (0.53%),
Belarus (0.40%) and the average values of other European countries (0.35%). Despite of the relevant
share of higher education from the national education budget (11% for 2012), in comparative terms
the contribution of public sector financing in higher education in Georgia is much lower than most of
the reference countries listed in Table 1.17 and to other European countries.

Key Recommendations
1.76 The relationship between education expenditure and sector outcomes is not always linear and
counts after a certain minimum threshold. As evidenced by international studies, increasing level of
financing does not always translate into better learning outcomes unless accompanied with other
structural measures. However, in countries where public spending is below adequate level, increased
investment has substantial impact on the quality. In the meantime, there are still areas that spending
efficiency can be sought. The key issues and recommendations on public spending in Georgia can be
summarized as follows:
  Georgia: Education Sector Policy Review                                                                                              45


             Government spending on education in Georgia is low – compared to countries with similar
              per-capita incomes and relative to both the shortage of human capit al and the country’s
              ambitions. Given continuous increase in the national GDP, Georgia should prioritize
              increasing public investment in education as a proportion of the GDP.

             The teacher salaries in Georgia are one of the lowest as compared to other countries and
              other public employees in Georgia. This creates negative implications for the improvement of
              the quality of teaching and learning across the system. Georgia could consider prioritizing
              teacher salary increase over other investments in education sector. Attracting and retaining
              high-caliber teachers is a challenge worldwide. Many developed countries have dealt with
              this challenge by increasing real wages of teachers. Between 2000 and 2011, OECD and EU
              countries increased teachers’ wages by around 15-20 percent in real terms. Comparator
              countries such as Czech Republic and Estonia experienced dramatic increases: approximately
              100 percent and 60 percent, respectively 25 . Specific interventions related to this
              recommendation are discussed in teaching quality part of the document.

         1.6 Cross-cutting Issues
         1.6.1
1.77    Several factors contribute to the growing importance of lifelong learning policies over
         st
the 21 century. These include an increased demand for a better skilled work force, accelerated
technological changes and shifting demographics. Initial measurements of the European lifelong
learning indicator (ELLI) showed there is a strong correlation between ELLI’s performance and three
important measures of a nation’s wellbeing: global competiti veness, accessibility of healthcare and
reduction of corruption 26 . These are the end results of long chains of causal factors, chains that
invariably begin with learning and human development.

1.78     Georgia does not yet have a consolidated national policy for integrating lifelong learning
(LLL) in the education sector. The existence of a national policy would be helpful to guide a
gradual and consistent introduction of lifelong leaning approaches in Georgia. The notion of lifelong
learning defines a process that involves the development of knowledge, skills and values throughout
all stages of a person’s life from early childhood through adulthood27. This concept of uninterrupted
learning encompasses all forms of learning, conventionally categorized as: formal, non-formal and
informal learning28. A holistic policy approach would be useful in Georgia as it will be necessary to
redefine some aspects of formal education and to develop and integrate to it two important learning
systems: (i) the recognition of workplace learning and the need to value and support learning at
work, which will require addressing many questions about the nature of the curriculum, the relation of
educators to employers, and practical arrangements to locate or connect, and to recognize and
accredit, purposeful learning on as well as for the job and (ii) the recognition and accreditation of
learning that takes place away from the classroom. This integration must be also developed, as it

25 OECD (2013), p. 392.
26 See Annex 3 for more details about these correlations
27 The European Commission defines lifelong learning as: “Lifelong learning embraces all learning activity undertaken
throughout life, with the aim of improving knowledge, skills/competences and/or qualifications for personal, social and/or
professional reason” European Commission 2001
28 (i) Formal learning typically provided by an education or training institution, structured (in terms of learning objectives,
learning time or learning support) and leading to certification. Formal learning is intentional from the learner’s perspectiv e.
(ii) Non-formal learning is embedded in planned activities not explicitly designated as learning, but which contain an
important learning element and structured (in terms of learning objectives, learning time or learning support). It is usually
provided outside public educational institutions and caters to persons of all ages. Non-formal learning is intentional from the
learner's point of view. It normally does not lead to certification. (iii) Informal learning resulting from daily activities related
to work, family or leisure. It is not organised or structured (in terms of objectives, time or learning support). Informal
learning is in most cases unintentional from the learner's perspective and includes self-education, in which the individual
does not test the acquired knowledge. It is not institutionally coordinated and usually it is not systematic. It typically does
not lead to certification See more of this in Annex 3: The notion of Lifelong Learning policies and its relevance
    Georgia: Education Sector Policy Review                                                                     46


should enhance the standing and recognition of informal learning, in its own right and as a way into
more formal education and training.

Key Recommendations
     To tackle the current challenge that the Government does not have an integrated national policy
      and strategy for LLL which substantially limits the country’s potential for meeting workforce
      development needs. Georgia needs to develop a coherent national strategy for integrating LLL
      principles across all education levels. The following points should be considered in the
      development of LLL strategy:
      o   Georgia’s institutional capacity would require substantial development to be capable of
          applying a coherent and integrated national lifelong learning policy. The scope of the
          policies to promote lifelong learning go beyond the boundaries of the education system and
          demand a coherent and integrated public sector response in a variety of areas. Figure 1.14
          above portrays the wide range of these policy areas based on the time-age dimension of its
          beneficiaries (vertical axis) and the type of learning (horizontal axis). The main challenges for
          the Georgian institutional system will be to provide a coordinated government response for, at
          least, the following policy areas:
          (i)      Initial Education: this area (core of Quadrant 1) mainly involves the MoES and the
                  generation of knowledge acquired at primary, secondary and tertiary education
                  institutions.
          (ii)    Continuing Education: This area (Quadrant 2) includes all forms of education or
                  training after initial education or after entry into working life. This includes: full-time
                  and part-time programs for older adults leading to qualifications, courses taken for
                  vocational reasons or leading (but not necessarily) to credits, diplomas and degrees,
                  courses taken by graduates. This area is crucial for supporting the employability of
                  individuals and one of the most challenging in Georgia as it would require coherence
                  in policies domains as: education, labor, ALMP and CVET.
          (iii)   Vocational Learning. Applied skills, closely tied to occupational success, (Quadrants
                  1 and 2); work-related knowledge and skills that may be acquired in educational
                  institutions and/or vocational training institutions (e.g. tertiary or work-oriented post-
                  secondary institutions) or even workplace training. The availability of such type of
                  training, which may or may not be accessible outside the working environment, is
                  key to keeping the country’s workforce competitive. Georgia needs substantial work
                  to articulate recognition, supply and demand.

     o    A greater focus on educational outcomes will be required from Georgian education
          policy. A shift towards effective measurement of the learning of beneficiaries within the
          education system will be required. The lifelong learning approach advocates to monitor
          whether or not learning has actually taken place to shift the emphasis from inputs (teaching,
          training or instruction) to the learner. This should mark a departure from the traditional
          supply-based approaches in Georgian education policy to a learner-centered one. Developing
          skills and knowledge (for example literacy, numeracy and critical thinking) should become
          even more essential outcomes that the Georgian education policy must focus on delivering.
          Such type of skills and knowledge are critical for the preparedness of young people to face
          challenges in life because they determine the capacity for innovative thinking and the
          adaptability required in today’s knowledge-based economy. The need to improve the adaption
          of skills and knowledge to the labor market is a problem that has been recurrently identified
          in several recent studies29.

     o    It will be necessary to focus on ensuring the achievement of functional literacy for a
          much larger part of the student population30 . This is a particularly relevant problem in
          Georgia as according to the international test results, a large proportion of students (over
          60%) are considered functionally illiterate. Functional literacy is a crucial element for
          addressing inequalities in lifelong learning as it affects the ability of people to learn
          effectively. Low levels of functional literacy lead to marginalization of large groups of
          people. This will require substantial improvements in teaching methods and education
          curricula. International experience shows that non-formal learning is also a preferred route for
          those who want to improve their functional literacy, therefore, civic and community
          organizations may have a particularly important contribution to make to its development and
          their work should be considered by the education strategy. Large employers can also be

Unemployment/Labor Market Challenges In Georgia”, WB 2013
30 Usually defined as: “The ability to understand printed information and utilize it in everyday activities, in personal life, in
employment and in the community so that the individual achieves their goals, develops their knowledge and potential.” is
used to denote a broad range of abilities to process information
  Georgia: Education Sector Policy Review                                                                                           48


          important agents to bridge the functional literacy gap by providing on the job training.
          Although their programs are usually labelled differently (report writing, communication, etc.)
          most of them are conducive to the same end. Their integration would require new
          management approaches at the MoES as the institution has demonstrated systematic
          weaknesses to work in partnership with employers and other stakeholders in several areas.

     o    The education system should evolve towards ensuring competence-based learning and
          the provision of key competencies. A complementary challenge for the education system in
          Georgia will be to develop the capacity to assess quality of learning in terms of competences.
          This will require a holistic understanding of the individual and which combine knowledge,
          skills, attitudes and values towards learning. There is a greater need than ever for citizens to
          acquire the knowledge and key competences that are necessary to meet recent changes of the
          modern life work31. The European Qualifications Framework for Lifelong Learning identifies
          eight key competences that the education system should provide 32 even before completion of
          lower secondary. The acquisition of these key competences represents a new standard of
          quality that substantially affects the present conception of educational programs. This new
          requirement should be consistently incorporated both into framework educational programs
          for primary and secondary education and also into the entry requirements for higher
          secondary education levels, as well as into the requirements on final examinations for
          compulsory education.

     o    It is essential to successfully conclude the introduction of effective and internationally
          recognized quality assurance frameworks. Effective systems of standards and accreditation
          that enable students to document what they have learned and employers to identify workers
          with the relevant skills are the core of an LLL system. For this purpose, the education system
          should continue the development of relevant and reliable quality assurance frameworks and
          tools. The final integrated system should include: (i) a National Qualifications Framework
          that covers most occupations and a wide range of skill levels, (ii) a National Classification of
          Occupations that registers all major occupations and identifies the corresponding learning
          outcome-based competencies required for them; (iii) new and robust protocols for assuring
          the credibility of skills testing and certification33; (iv) a professional system of accreditation
          standards that guarantees the quality of training provision; (v) an institutionalized process to
          engage participation of key stakeholders (especially employers) in all these areas. For these
          purposes, it is important for Georgia to continue the path of adopting internationally
          recognized standards 34 and to strengthen the operation of key institutional actors, as for
          example, the NCEQE and Sector Committees to ensure the full alignment of their role and
          responsibilities with the needs of the labor market35.

     o    It will be necessary to develop a more open system for lifelong learning diversifying
          pathways for skills acquisition and adopting new and effective systems to recognize
          prior learning. Recognizing the results of all forms of learning should be promoted,

31 Globalization, development of new technologies, changes in the organization of work and the structure of enterprises
define ever-increasing requirements on the qualifications of employees.
32 These are: (i) communication in the mother tongue; (ii) communication in foreign languages; (iii) mathematical
competence and basic competence in science and technology; (iv) digital competence; (v) learning to learn; (vi)
interpersonal, intercultural, and social competences, together with civic competence (vii) entrepreneurship; and (viii) cultural
expression. In addition, critical thinking, creativity, initiative taking, problem solving, risk assessment, decision making, and
managing feelings constructively are seen as playing a role in all eight key competencies. The EQF identifies the essential
knowledge, skills, and attitudes related to each.
33 These must ensure that skills testing for most occupations follows standard procedures, is competency-based and assesses
both theoretical knowledge and practical skills and provides certificates that are valued by most employers (for more details
see the WB SABER-WfD Analytical Framework)
34 Such as: the alignment of the NQF and the European Qualifications Framework, and the introduction of other
equivalences in areas such as European Credit System for Vocational Education and Training, and the European Quality
Assurance in Vocational Education and Training.

         ensuring that the transitions between education sub-sectors are facilitated and their pathways
         do not lead students to “dead ends”. Recognition of prior learning is also very importa nt to
         demonstrate qualifications required for employment. A broad range of vocational skills
         acquired either on or off the job should be easily recognized by established mechanisms. An
         open systems focus should provide: (i) mechanisms to facilitate the recognition and
         demonstration of qualifications acquired by non-formal and informal training; (ii) flexible
         ways to increase access for adults to primary and lower secondary education studies
         prioritizing the reinsertion of people without primary education; and (iii) more flexible ways
         to increase access of adults to TVET and higher education studies. These reforms will require
         substantial institutional capacity development in a variety of government agencies that go
         beyond the limits of the MoES.

    o    Ensuring effective stakeholder participation is mandatory to ensure effectiveness of
         resources invested in this area. As it was mentioned before in this document, this is one of
         the areas where the MoES has shown important structural weaknesses. Unfortunately,
         stakeholder collaboration is critical for the achievement of increased access and improved
         quality and relevance and other LLL goals. Coordinated efforts are needed of a large number
         of heterogeneous lifelong learning actors, including: government agencies at the central and
         regional levels, employers, trade unions, service providers and NGOs. In particular, private
         sector employers should be encouraged to become active players in the market for LLL, both
         by articulating their needs, partnering with the supply side (education and training providers)
         and by promoting learning in the workplace. Intra governmental, formal “partnerships” are
         also important to assure coherent, structured government coordination and deliver effective
         interventions.


        1.6.2
1.79     Currently there is no coherent policy framework to ensure meaningful use of ICT to
advance teaching and learning. The individual ICT programs are not integrated and aligned with the
curriculum goals. The Ministry runs the “Buki” project for first graders countrywide and all 1st class
pupils receive netbooks (specially designed by Intel Corporation for Georgian schools) with installed
educational programs/games on mathematics, logics, in Georgian and foreign languages. This
program opens the gates for very important transformations and changes in student’s learning
capacities that should be further capitalized with the modernization of the curriculum for primary and
secondary education. An ICT curriculum was developed for the students of Grades V and VI, but it is
designed to develop only general skills of using personal computers (such as MS applications) at the
level of a basic computer user. Existent curriculum should be adapted following current global
standards that aim to equip students to use computational thinking and creativity, and have deep links
with mathematics, science and design. The number of application currently used in Georgian public
schools must be expanded, at present it only includes: (i) Microsoft Windows office products, (ii)
Intel classroom management software, (iii) interactive games (for ISCED6 level I), (iv) Internet
Browsers (Google Chrome, Opera, Mozilla Firefox) and (v) Adobe Products. Out of these, the
interactive games for ISCED Level I are the only applications available in Georgian. Nonetheless, the
MoES recently launched concerted efforts to develop an ICT policy paper.



1.80     The adequacy of the skills and knowledge of ICT teachers at the school level is not
properly assessed. There is still limited awareness among schoolteachers and administrators on ICT
tools to be applied in education. The school curriculum of most subjects does not certify that ICTs are
used by school teachers in delivering classes or presentations in other topics but ICT. The level of
support provided to teachers in integrating ICT in education systems is uneven and greatly depends on
the school leadership. Positive transformations have been recently introduced in the area of ICT
trainings for in-service training of teachers provided by the National Centre for Teachers' Professional
Development (TPDC). The TPDC offers: basic courses, second level courses and primary class tutor's
training sessions. In addition, it provides other training courses related to principles to be applied in
 Georgia: Education Sector Policy Review                                                                     50


education and integration of ICT into the education process and also offers access to online resources
to advance teaching quality in schools. The extension of these services is still limited; NTPDC selects
training participants countrywide to ensure that at least 32% of teachers per school attend ICT
trainings36. However, it is also reported that teachers from the schools located in rural areas, remote
and mountainous regions have very limited access to receive even the initial training in basic
computer skills.

1.81     There is no systematic understanding of the ICT infrastructure gaps in Georgian
schools. EMIS reports that all 2,328 schools in Georgia (2,084 public and 244 private) are provided
with computers and Internet access; however, other evidence also suggests that although Internet is
reported to be available in all regions in Georgia, not all schools have access to it, especially schools
in rural and remote areas37. An important dispersion in connectivity quality is also visible, as high-
speed optic-fiber connection is available but to a very limited number of schools mainly located in the
central regions of the country (capital and nearby cities) 38. Many schools experience problems in
making computer labs equally accessible for students and teachers. The major reason is that some
schools physically allocate all computers in one specific area/room, thus making it difficult to conduct
simultaneous ICT sessions. The EMIS developed a set of internal policies developed for schools, such
as: (i) User's access policy; (ii) External hard/flash drive restriction policy; (iii) Software update
policy; (iv)Users' guideline for maintenance school computers; (v) Internet access restriction policy
and its ICT specialists are in charge of maintaining school infrastructure and software. This might
have worked as a short-term solution, but it is not sustainable in the long run. The main focus area of
the EMIS, should be to continue to improve the quantity and quality of data and information to
support decision making and monitoring and evaluation of the educational process. The development
of the ICT policy, including infrastructure development plans and ICT-related support to schools
belong to a more specialized ICT management unit that is not available right now in the present
organizational structure of the MoES.

Key Recommendations
        To fill the gap of lack of coherent policy framework to ensure meaningful use of ICT,
         such framework needs to be developed to advance teaching and learning throughout the
         education reform. This policy framework should address how ICT can support the
         resolution of many of the educational issues that were described in the previous sections, for
         example: (i) major curriculum revisions and shifts in pedagogy and assessment changes; (ii)
         specific curriculum reforms that emphasize higher levels of understanding of key concepts
         within subject areas and aimed to reduce functional illiteracy; (iii) curricular reforms aimed to
         introduce the abovementioned lifelong learning approaches and especially, to develop the
         ability to solve complex, real-world problems (providing key competences) that prepare
         students for the knowledge economy, such as creativity, information management,
         communication, collaboration, and the ability to direct one’s own work and learning; (iv)
         support the pedagogical role of teachers by providing resources and explicitly modelling
         cognitive and social processes and prompting students to take up these practices; and (v) the
         use of technology to efficiently deliver online content and assessments in all areas of
         education and especially to support second chance, adult education.

Chapter 2. Priority Sub-sector Issues
       2.1 Early Childhood Development: School Readiness
2.1      Apart from the low rates of participation and equity issues in preschool education
examined in chapter 1 more broadly, the quality of preschool education is also a pressing
challenge. There is an accumulating body of evidence39 that shows that investment at an early stage
of life is an effective policy. Research by Nobel laureate in Economics James Heckman praised
investment in disadvantaged young children as “a rare public policy with no equity-efficiency
tradeoff” as it promotes social justice and fairness by reducing inequality and at the same time raises
the productivity of society. It has also been shown that, due to the nature of the skill formation
process, early investments are those with the highest rate of return. Both medical and economics
literature agree that gaps in both cognitive and non-cognitive skills emerge early in life and persist.
Policies to mitigate these gaps later in life have proven very costly.

2.2      Early childhood interventions are very effective at boosting non-cognitive skills. These
are often neglected at the expense of cognitive skills. However, research has found that they are very
important determinants not only of schooling, but also of labor market and behavioral outcomes (such
as participation in criminal activities and teenage pregnancy). Evidence shows that increasing non-
cognitive ability is associated with a reduction both in the probability of being a high school dropout
and in the likelihood of spending time in jail. It is also a good predictor of who will graduate from
college. Moreover, these effects seem to be more pronounced for females and disadvantaged groups.
Estimated benefit-to-cost ratio of increasing enrolment in preschool from 25 percent to 50 percent in
low- and middle-income countries ranges from 6.4 to 17.640.

2.3      In Georgia, the majority of the children who attended preschool institutions show very
low school readiness. Although children who attended preschool institutions on average show higher
school readiness, than those who don’t, there is a large variation in school readiness among children
who attended preschool institutions. In 2011 the National Curriculum and Assessment Center
(NCAC) conducted a school readiness study that evaluated five domains of child development among
children during the early days of their first year of schooling. Only one-third of the children presented
satisfactory school readiness. The share of children, who have relevant cognitive, emotional and
social, and fine motor skills development, is still very low. Only one-third of children who attended
preschool institutions meet cognitive milestones expected of them, which casts doubt on the quality of
preschool education (see Table 2.1).

    2.4      There are marked disparities in the quality of preschool institutions that these groups
    have access to.41 Among children who participate in preschool education, children from rural areas
    show lower school readiness as compared to their peers living in urban areas.42 This is a significant
    bottleneck given that an accumulating body of evidence43 shows that gaps in both cognitive and non-
    cognitive skills that emerge early in life and persist throughout adulthood. Policies to mitigate these
    gaps later in life have proven very costly and investment at an early stage of life is the most effective
    policy. Analysis of Georgia’s performance in PISA 2009 shows that students who attended preschool
    attain significantly higher scores than those who did not. The long-term impact of these inequities is
    hard to quantify as the government does not keep records about children enrolled in pre-school
    education in the EMIS and therefore, has serious limitations to address these fundamental gaps. The
    present de-concentration of the system did not provide support for adequate social inclusion policies
    to address these asymmetries and the resolution of these situations is left to the initiative, capacity and
    willingness of municipal and regional authorities.

    2.5      One of the major constraints towards improving the quality of preschool education is
    the lack of the national preschool education standards and the absence of instruments for their
    enforcement. Preschool education management and service delivery are highly decentralized and
    quality standards are not enforced. Reform of preschool education shifted the responsibility for the
    delivery of preschool education from the MoES to the local governments. Attendance is not
    compulsory and provision and financing are the responsibility of local self-governments
    (municipalities) and the full-day delivery model is the most prevalent. As a consequence of
    decentralization, there is wide variation in service modalities and quality. Financing also varies
    significantly. While exemptions are given in some cases (low-income families, second child, disabled,
    orphans, etc.), local governments usually require parental contributions. The only role played by the
    MoES is that of proposing to local governments a set of standards, which are not enforced often due
    to limited human and financial resource capacities in municipalities. Given the high level of
    decentralization, it is unlikely that the majority of the municipalities have the institutional capacity to
    implement and monitor quality standards proposed by the MoES. Neither has the MoES tools to
    monitor and enforce the standards proposed.

    Key Recommendations
   To address the issue of low school readiness, quality disparities, lack of quality standards and
    capacity for delivering and monitoring these standards, the following needs to be considered:

    42 NCAC (2011), School Readiness Study.
    43 See Heckman and Masterov (2007), Heckman (2006), Cunha and Heckman (2006) and Carneiro and Heckman (2003)
    among others.

o   The state of preschool education would benefit if the MoES played a more active role. The
    decentralized model has the advantage of being flexible and easy to be shaped to the particular needs
    of each region and this is an important virtue. However, the lack of supervision, monitoring, and
    quality assurance leads to wide differences in the quality of the service. Given the importance of
    preschool education, the MoES could play a pivotal role in setting up curricula and quality standards
    for facilities and teachers, and monitoring them.
o   Strengthening service quality should be a priority. The expansion of pre-school education is
    mainly justified by its great potential for improving the beneficiaries’ future educational development.
    However, this is not likely going to happen if quality is not achieved. As this process will take a long
    time, initial actions are important. Clear estimations of the costs of improving quality are needed,
    especially to resolve MoES and municipal capacity limitations.

          2.2 General Education: Teaching Quality
    2.6     Long term solutions to address education quality constraints will largely depend on
    resolving the issue of teaching quality: a more efficient management of the teacher force, the
    introduction of better recruitment policies, a new teacher career regime and salary incentives and
    more effective pre-service and in-service training investments. Ineffectiveness in the utilization of the
    teacher force manifests itself in a variety of symptoms.

    2.7      Capacity limitations, especially for human resource management and forecasting, lead
    to an overall surplus in the quantity of teachers. This problem is expressed by the low national
    averages of the student/ teacher ratios (roughly 8.2 for 2013/14). This surplus is caused by a variety of
    factors, amongst which: (i) the poor capacity of the system to adapt to the general population
    reduction trends that caused a steady decline in student population. In the last decade, the total
    number of students decreased by approximately 23% whereas the teacher to student ratios remained
    almost the same (see Table 2.2); (ii) Additional challenges generated by poor school management
    practices that resulted in the occurrence of massive “forced drop -out of students” in upper secondary
    education. The threat of destitution of school principals, if too many students showed poor
    performance in school leaving exams, create additional idle capacity in the system; (iii) lowered entry
    requirements for new teachers that tended to add quantities of low-skilled new entrants to the teacher
    force. In fact, present rates of teacher to student ratios in Georgia are so low that teaching capacity
    could be virtually doubled with the present number of teachers.

    2.8     Ample variances in the dispersion of the teacher to student/ratios by regions and by type
    of schools suggest that there is room for additional efficiency improvements in teacher
    management. At 8.5 percent, the student to teacher ratio of general education in Georgia is
    considerable lower than the OECD or EU21 countries (at 13.6 and 12, respectively; see figure 2.1).
    Despite the general trend of having a low teacher to student ratio, the ratio significantly differs
    according to location and school size. In big cities it is relatively high while in the regions it is low.
    For example: in Tbilisi it can be as high as 15/1 while in mountainous Adjara or Racha-Lechkumi it
    can be 2.8/144. In larger schools (1,000 student and above) these ratios are more efficient (15,6%)
    while in small size schools can be as low as 2% (see Table 2.3 below). Over 36% of the students in
    Georgia learn in schools with one digit student to teacher ratios.

2.9      Teaching workloads are very low. According to the statutory requirements, a full time
teacher is defined as a teacher who has 18 contact hours and 18 non-teaching hours 45 per week,
primary teachers and science teachers have even less teaching hours (14 and 15 respectively). Based
on an academic year of 36 weeks, the average yearly teaching hours in Georgia accrue to less than
600 while the average teacher in an OECD country teaches 790 hours in primary, 709 in lower-
secondary, and 664 in upper-secondary education. In countries such as the United States and Chile,
these figures go beyond 1,000 hours per year (25 per week)46. Since there is no formal procedure for
monitoring teaching and learning processes and no accountability system, there is no way to assess if
teachers really take non-teaching hours seriously and spend the time for preparing lessons.
Considering the widespread practice of private tutoring in Georgia, many qualified teachers engage in
private teaching after school, which means a significant part of the teacher force may not dedicate
many of the non-teaching hours for other pedagogic purposes.

2.11    As a consequence of the existing management practices, teaching is becoming an aging
profession in Georgia, leaving few opportunities for the youth to join. The average age of the
teacher force is 47 years old. Less than 19% of the teachers are 35 or younger, while almost 20% are
60 and older. It is also exceptional to note that 3.9% of teachers are in the 70-80 age group and 0.3%
are above 80 years old47. A large proportion of the active teachers have already retired (18 % of all
teachers) but despite reaching their retirement age, teachers remain in their teaching position and
continue to teach. This is mainly because pensions are low but especially because the teacher
retirement policy encourages them to stay in school: after reaching the retirement age, teachers
receive both pension and salary. In the last three years the average age of teachers has increased by
one year. Data from EMIS shows that it was 45 in 2011-12, and 46 in 2012-13 and the percentage of
pension age teachers grew from 14.3% to 18.2% in the last three years. The space for young people
entering in the teaching force is quite limited by these practices. However, new entrants are not
precisely quite young either. EMIS figures also show that in the last two years, the average age of new
entrants to the teaching force was of 39 years in 2012-13 and of 40 years old in 2013-14.

2.12    Teaching in not attractive career path in Georgia. The country’s brightest students rarely
choose teaching as their profession. This is evident from the test scores of university entrants where
education students have one of the lowest average scores according to the fields of study48. This is
probably associated to the fact that the low salary system of the teacher profession makes it a poor
career choice in Georgia. A recent teacher Supply and Demand Analysis49 indicated that surveyed
teachers expectations on an acceptable average salary is GEL 771, which is close to the national
average salary and double of the present average teachers level salary. The same research also showed
that from those teachers who declared that they want to leave their jobs in the next ten years, low
salary and pensions are amongst the two primary reasons.

2.13     With the present conditions, the system is incapable of attracting qualified young
candidates. This is alarming information as the poor quality of the TE pool is an important limitation
for in-service training performance. Countries with successful education systems have understood the
importance of having top quality teachers and created mechanisms to attract and retain talent.
Currently there is no motivation for young people to enter teaching, considering the teaching
profession that pays below the average national salary, that does not reward higher qualifications and
the longer commitment to teaching does not mean more benefits. Acting teachers have no motivation
to raise their qualifications; however, they may still be motivated to remain in teaching for longer
periods (as the profession offers more free time, stable conditions, etc.)50. It is possible to conclude
that the current policies contribute to having retaining teachers, as well as not attracting the highest
qualified people into the profession.

2.14     Despite the government’s efforts, only about 25 percent of teachers have been certified
till present. There are few metrics of teachers’ quality in Georgia, one of the criteria employed is
certification examinations administered since 2010. Both new and in-service teachers take two types
of tests to be certified: a subject matter test and a test in pedagogical abilities. However, no
comprehensive teacher evaluation system is in place that would capture actual teacher performance in
the classroom. Certification rates (share of test-takers approved) have been very low. In particular,
subjects such as mathematics, physics and primary education have seen approval rates below 25%,
which cast doubt on the quality of teachers.

2.15    The quality of the pool of pre-service graduates is low. Universities that prepare teachers
have a number of problems impeding sound initial teacher education: (i) from the outset they get the
students, who, on average, have low scores at National University Entrance Examinations; (ii) they
experience a deficit of well-trained professors in modern teaching and learning methods. There are no
incentives to enroll in doctoral programs in education, which is the only way to be able to teach at the
university in teacher education programs (exception applies to some lecturers that can have status of
an invited lecturer, but there is a limit for such invitees); and (iii) universities and schools do not have
incentives to work closely together to provide meaningful practice for student teachers. These
incentives could encompass rewarding teachers for accepting students from the universities for
practice and making it part of their professional development. Identifying best practices of meaningful
cooperation between schools and universities could become example for other schools and
universities. The only comparative measurement on the quality of pre-service teacher education
programs is a Teacher Education Study in Mathematics (TEDS-M) conducted in 2008. The study
showed that competencies of future mathematics teachers near the end of their programs were very

(ISSA, 2012).

low and revealed that teachers in Georgia performed significantly below most of the 16 participating
countries when assessed both in terms of their knowledge of mathematics as well as their knowledge
of how to teach mathematics.

2.16     Teacher in-service development and support systems are also underperforming. In 2004,
the Ministry decided to decentralize the provision of teacher training to eligible accredited training
providers. The objective was to encourage the much-needed competition and stimulate quality
improvements in the delivery of teacher training. The system was implemented for only one year
when the government decided to go back to centralized trainings. Currently the National Teacher
Professional Development Centre (NTPDC) provides all trainings for teachers. This exercise has
diverted the focus of NTPDC from being a major policy planning organization in teacher issues to
becoming a training center. Teachers’ perceptions on the quality of delivered trainings does not vary
for centralized or decentralized model, however; when asked if the training system should be
centralized or centralized, a great majority of teachers prefers a decentralized model as opposed to
27%, who prefer centralized51. Another research on the impact of training decentralization on school
effectiveness shows that, after the programs have been centralized the trainings became less
diversified and their availability has worsened52. Teachers are not required by law to take a certain
number of hours of professional development trainings; however the general requirement of
professional development exists. So far, the government has paid (through vouchers) for the
professional development of teachers, both in centralized and decentralized models but no meaningful
results from these investments were yet obtained.

2.17     The current teacher professional development model is ineffective because its content and
structure provides neither incentives nor mechanisms for teachers to internalize the knowledge
acquired through trainings and use it in the classroom. Limiting teacher professional development to
trainings contradicts basic principles of contemporary learning theories by failing to acknowledge that
learning occurs from experience, reflection, and practice. Short-term trainings where teachers take
up the roles of passive learners do not ensure that the knowledge that is transmitted to teachers
translates into understanding of the concepts and principals of effective teaching and redefining
teaching. Growing evidence shows that traditional teacher professional development modalities are
not effective in changing teaching practices 53 . More effective teacher professional development
modalities give teachers the opportunity to work on academic programs long enough to solve them
and discover causal connections between their instruction and student outcomes.

2.18     Short-term subject matter trainings are not aligned with the teachers’ needs. If the
majority of teachers fail to meet subject matter standard requirements according to teacher
certification results, it is unlikely that short-term trainings are going to address the major knowledge
gap. The relevant agencies should provide a more comprehensive analysis of the areas where teachers
fail to demonstrate sufficient knowledge of their subject. The information should be used to develop
the content, structure, and format of the subject matter courses and modules.

2.19     The lack of qualified inclusive education teachers is also an important concern. Some
progress has been made with the adoption of Special Education Teacher Standards. The National
Curriculum also has a requirement that SEN children should study according to the individualized
education program. However few teachers have the capacity and resources to materialize this
requirement. Teachers Professional Development Center (TPDC) offers in-service trainings for
inclusive education teachers as well as some non-governmental organizations offer such trainings. In
the past, no pre-service training opportunities existed for inclusive education teachers. However, it is
important to note that new programs have been introduced in one of the higher education institutions
in recent years.

2.20    The development of school principals as instructional leaders is also a challenge.
Moreover, insufficient professional development for school principals further limits their leadership
capacity. Main causes for this are: (i) principals in-service training process remains sporadic and less
linked with the overall needs of school leadership workforce development; (ii) the package of training
modules for principals available through MoES and different private providers is considerably smaller
than that for teachers; (iii) an integrated professional development scheme for principals that is linked
with salary hasn’t yet been developed.

2.21    The new Teacher Evaluation and Professional Development Scheme currently under
development provides a good opportunity to improve management of the teaching profession.
The design of the new framework should take into consideration the following factors: (i) teaching is
an aging profession in Georgia and the existing pension policies encourage pension-age teachers
continue teaching leaving limited opportunities for young professionals to enter into the system; (ii)
unemployment rate among young professionals is high, which can be considered as an opportunity
given right policies are in place.

Key Recommendations

       To improve teacher quality, Georgia will need to build a new system for teacher profession
        addressing multiple challenges, which will require a long-term holistic approach addressing
        all the essential components for building the critical mass of professional teachers. The
        specific recommendations outlined below should be viewed as part of one integral vision,
        where recommended policy options reinforce each other to achieve the intended results.

       To improve the effectiveness of teacher in-service training and professional development,
        emphasis should be made on the introduction of a sustainable school-based teacher
        professional development model. This will require a substantial capacity building at the
        school level, creating a critical mass of qualified teachers to assume the role of a leading
        teacher, encouragement of peer learning among the teachers and trained school principals to
        focus on instructional leadership. The latter would focus on new modalities, such as lesson
        study, action research and school-based professional development teams. These new
        modalities will allow teachers to collaborate in order to identify academic programs,
        formulate instructional plans, use evidence to develop interventions for improvement,
        observe and reflect on their interventions and thus engage in continuous improvement.
        Georgia can benefit from the already existing small-scale but successful initiatives being
        implemented in this area by the USAID supported G-Pried project and Ilia State University.

       To improve the performance of teacher pre-service training, emphasis should be given to the
        development of new cadre of university teachers equipped with modern expertise in the field.
        School principal training courses would be particularly important for developing future
        school leaders.

       Provide incentives to attract qualified professionals into teaching. It is essential to address the
        issue of lack of competitive compensation for teaching profession. The government will have
        to consider setting high starting salaries to attract better graduates into teaching. The
        government may consider increasing salaries of the existing teachers complying with the
        quality requirements set by the teacher professional development standards.

       Develop a comprehensive teacher evaluation system, which one hand serves as an effective
        instrument for managing teacher quality and on the other hand, provides a clear path and
        opportunities to teachers for professional growth and career advancement linked to financial
        incentives.

       To correct the overall surplus of teachers in general education, there is need to improve the
        current poor management of supply and demand of teachers nationwide. This will require a

          solid understanding of teacher supply and demand status and influencing factors and
          implementation of targeted policies/measures to respond to emerging trends.

         To address the shortages of teachers by teaching subject and by geographic location, the
          expansion and improvement of the existing teacher deployment programs will be needed.
          Georgia has implemented small-scale programs providing financial incentives to qualified
          candidates to teach in remote and ethnic minority schools and can build on this experience.



         2.3 Strengthening Vocational Education and Training
2.22     In the last few years, Vocational Education and Training (VET) has undergone various
reforms, the pace and scope of which have varied significantly and the system has been adapted
multiple times in response to the political context. Key developments underpinning Georgia’s reforms
in this area are the integration in the Bologna Process in 2005, the adoption of the Law on Vocational
Education in 2007 and the development of the VET strategy for 2009-2012. Much of these efforts
were oriented towards bringing the VET sector closer to the labor market demands and encouraging
private sector participation. In recent years, further amendments were made to the Law on Vocational
Education (2010), and the Law of Georgia on Development of Quality of Education (2010) was
adopted. The reform process involved radical changes and reorganization of the sector including: (i)
optimization and consolidation of vocational education institutions in 2008-2009; (ii) introduction of a
voucher financing system for level I and III programs in May 2012, as part of which eligible students
could use their voucher funding in accredited state educational institutions for level three VET
programs and funding through grants for lever four and five VET programs in accredited state or
private educational institutions offering priority programs set by the government; and (iii) significant
investments were pledged by the government for supporting the VET sector as part of the 2012-2016
program of the previous government, which was targeted on new school infrastructure, launch of
three new vocational colleges, construction of the new technological university in Batumi , and
summer jobs for students.

2.23    However, the reforms in the VET sector were launched without a comprehensive
development plan, full understanding of the skills development needs and potential impact of
the new proposed programs. This translated into a set of rushed and improvised measures. One such
measure was the separation of VET pathways from general education by the 2007 VET law and
introduction of artificially fragmented short-term programs in 2010 (sometimes as short as two
months) to meet the government objective of creating rapid path to employment. Many young
students with compulsory education enrolling in these programs found it difficult to get employment
as the competencies acquired were not sufficient to meet the labor market needs. At the same time,
these changes resulted in dead-ends in the system.

2.24    The improvement of the quality and relevance of VET programs is hindered by the
limited participation of employers. Progress has been made in establishing coordination
mechanisms to align supply with demand, but substantial progress is still needed. One important
instrument for ensuring the relevance of VET programs is the National Qualification Framework and
qualification descriptions. In 2011, the National Centre for Education Quality Enhancement created
14 Subsector committees. The purpose of these committees was to accommodate the needs of the
labor market into the qualifications and competencies described in the National Qualification
Framework. 54 However, the engagement of employers and social partners in these subsector
committees is still minimal. As the subsector committee meeting reports show, the prevailing majority
of the participants are from government agencies, universities and VET centers. Increased

54 Committees were established in the following areas: (1) mining and geological engineering; (2) engineering, technology,
metallurgy and materials science; (3) arts; (4) business administration; (5) tourism; (6) health; (7) marine, railway, air, land
transport; (8) energy and commerce; (9) agricultural sciences; (10) mass media and journalism; (11) construction and
environmental protection; (12) computer science and telecommunications; (13) architecture; and (14) sciences

involvement of the business community would help make the system more responsive to employer
needs, while regular assessments of current and future skills needs could increase the information
available to decision makers.

2.25    VET Teacher professional development is limited and focused on the development of
teaching skills only. While teacher training is conducted annually and several hundred teachers
participate in VET programs participate in them, the trainings were mainly focused on the
development of general skills but not specific occupational skills.

Key Recommendations
        The improvement of the quality and relevance of VET programs is hindered by the limited
         participation of employers. Therefore the follow should be considered:
            o   Greater stakeholder participation is needed to improve quality, relevance and
                provide a demand-led approach for VET supply. The National Qualification
                Framework and professional standards need continued improvement. Significant
                efforts are being made in this area. Its completion would impact the overall system
                and can be achieved in the short term. Priority efforts should be carried out to
                improve the MoES capacity to properly manage the engagement of wider range of
                stakeholders, particularly the private sector employers. This should be staring point
                as it affects the quality of all subsequent reforms in this area.
            o   Public Private Partnerships should be encouraged both in financing and
                delivery of vocational education. This may an important move toward improving
                the alignment of VET programs with labor market needs. The business sector should
                play an increased role in the design of VET curriculum, management and service
                delivery options, which will serve as incentives for the private sector to contribute to
                the financing of this level of education.

        2.4 Higher Education Financing
2.26     The government of Georgia introduced changes in the financing of the sector aimed at
increasing transparency and efficiency in allocating public resources. Direct budgetary allocations
have been gradually substituted by student grants and research grants and lump sum funding has
faded over time. A similar observation can be made about research funding. The state has diminished
traditional (based on historical trends) lump sum funding and substituted it with competitive research
grants.

2.27    The financing of this sub-sector of education remains low . Public spending on higher
education is 0.47 percent of GDP and less than 0.2 percent of GDP on research and development in
2013. Private spending on higher education constitutes 0.75 percent of GDP for the same year. Public
higher education expenditures allocated to institutions as well as per student expenditures is very low
in Georgia as compared to selected ECA countries (see table 2.5).

2.28     While the funding reform was instrumental to increase transparency in the allocation of
public resources for higher education, existing financing instruments fail to support the
improvement of quality of teaching and learning and increasing research capacity. The largest
share of higher education revenues comes from student tuition fees only, which motivates higher
education institutions in Georgia to maximize their enrolment numbers. In 2009, the share of tuition
fees in public higher education institutions was 73 percent of the total revenues. By 2011, the share of
tuition fees in some public universities (Georgian Technical University and Tsereteli State University)
exceeded 80 percent of the total budget. As tuition fees are used to finance not only current
expenditure of higher educational institutions but also capital investments, universities try to make
savings on other costs such as staff salaries.

2.29    The sector’s capacity for generating private sources other than tuitions paid by
households is limited, which is largely attributed to financial autonomy constraints and the
absence of formal incentives for the private sector participation. Georgian universities, in theory,
can generate income from contracts with business sector, philanthropy, services, and international
public funding sources. There are no national data available on revenues raised from these sources.
However, the budget plans (2012) and budget reports (2011) of several leading research universities
as well as small teaching universities show that resource mobilization from private sources other than
students’ fees is low. Research universities like Tbilisi State University, Ilia State University, and
State Medical University generate 20 to 30 percent of their revenues from research contracts, services,
rent, and other research and education grants. However, in other universities funds generated from
these sources are insignificant Philanthropic funding is rare for Georgian universities. Budget reports
of 2010-2012 for 10 Public universities (including the three largest research universities) show only
one case when a local foundation donated money to a higher educational institution 55 (see HEI
income sources in table 6 in annex 2).

Key Recommendations
    Existing financial resources allocated to higher education is insufficient for improving quality
       of teaching and learning, and strengthening research capacity. Higher education needs


55 In 2011 a national foundation established by a Georgian billionaire contributed GEL 0,8 million to Ilia State University
for sustainable development of the Georgian Botanical Garden.
 Georgia: Education Sector Policy Review                                                                           62


         adequate financial resources allocated in a manner that promotes fair competition but also
         ensures sustainability. Georgia should at least triple its public spending on higher education,
         up to 1% of GDP. Although highly vulnerable to external shifts and inflation risks, Georgia’s
         economy is growing at a steady pace56.

        The current limited funding mechanisms for higher education also lack clear strategic
         purpose in terms of improving efficiency and equity. Diversifying funding instruments will be
         essential. Funding mechanism need to first align with the sector reform objectives. Assuming
         Georgia increases its public funding to HEIs, the Government could introduce complementary
         funding mechanisms in the system to encourage improved institutional performance and
         support the development of HEIs. After identifying its main policy objectives (access, equity,
         quality, labor market relevance, etc.) for Georgia’s higher education system, the Ministry of
         Education and Science should reassess how its current funding model fits or aligns with those
         objectives. (Annex 3 describes different financing mechanisms against main policy priorities).
         The government could consider diversifying the funding mechanisms in line with
         international best practice in this are to facilitate research and innovation, improve the quality
         of teaching and learning and facilitate knowledge transfer. The following options could
         complement some form of base funding:
             o    Output-based funding formulae or payment for results: Denmark, Australia,
                  South Africa, and the Netherlands use output-based formula funding to distribute
                  public funds in a transparent way based on mutually agreed output indicators. In this
                  funding modality the amount a university receives is linked to the number of
                  graduates or institutional output indicators. Some systems diversify the amount per
                  student by field of study (Salmi and Hauptman, 2006).
             o    Performance contracts: In France, Finland, Denmark, Spain, Chile, and several U.S.
                  states governments enter into regulatory agreements with institutions to set mutual
                  performance-based objectives. Denmark signs so called development contracts over
                  improvement goals of HEIs (Salmi and Hauptman, 2006).
             o    Competitive funds: The Government of Georgia already has the practice of using
                  competitive funds for financing research projects. This practice could be extended to
                  other development areas in higher education system such as infrastructure
                  development and innovative teaching projects etc. International experience shows
                  that setting clear criteria and procedures are critical factor for ensuring transparency
                  and fairness. Some countries with a relatively small or isolated academic community
                  invite international or transnational reviewers to reduce the danger of complacency
                  and subjective evaluation among a limited group of national colleagues. Scandinavian
                  countries and the Netherlands offer a good example of involving transnational
                  reviewers in the process.

Chapter 3. Recommended Priority Interventions
3.1     Based on the strategic analysis and recommendations presented in the previous sections, a list of priority interventions has been identified for the
government’s consideration as part of the new Education Sector Strategy. This is not an all -encompassing list but a prioritized selection of essential interventions
needed. These programs were selected based on their importance to the sector strategic focus as stated above. Each recommendation is assessed according to
following three criteria: sequencing (short (six months), medium (one year) and long–term (two years) indicating the time taken to start the reform), impact
(high/low impact on improving learning outcomes), and technical complexity (low, medium or high covering cost implications, political sensitivity, and
implementation level risk).

3.2     This matrix presents proposed priority interventions grouped under each “key recommendations” discussed in Chapter 1 and 2 of the report.

Chapter 4. Implementation of Sector Reforms
4.1     Georgia has made significant progress in reforming its education system and adopted
swift reforms in many areas. As the government is ready to implement more large-scale reforms to
advance the education system, this section describes the main overarching areas that should be also
addressed to ensure the appropriate implementation of sector-wide Education Strategy during 2015-
2024. These recommendations pretend to mitigate some of the key issues described in Chapter 1,
Strategic Management of the Ministry of Education and Science: (i) lack of a strategic approach
applied to the overall management of the ministry operations considerably limited the achievement of
the desired outcomes; (ii) lack of consistency and contradictions in the introduction of many reforms
did not generate the expected incremental and systemic improvements or took too long to do it; (iii)
the ministry sometimes “navigates blind” in some areas as current EMIS does not integrate all critical
education data; (iv) with the data available, the ministry does not produce sufficient and periodic
information and knowledge (evaluation studies for example) to feedback and improve the strategic
management of education; (v) social inclusion standards, targets, measures and tools are strategic and
must be defined at the national level and not left to the arbitrary decision of the municipal
governments. The following are the areas that will deserve special attention:

     Addressing Management Challenges: ideas to strengthen the executive management capacity
      and the operational management support structure and mechanisms that will be needed.
     Monitoring and Evaluation Framework: the main elements of the monitoring plan to track the
      progress of program implementation and the achievement of outcomes of the strategic plan.
     Start-up Phase: the implementation of the plan will demand a series of changes and
      modifications and stages to ensure the long-term introduction of this new work approaches.
     Critical Success Factors and Risk Management: the major internal and external factors that may
      affect the overall success of the plan and how to address them.

      4.1 Addressing Executive Management Challenges
4.2      To succeed in achieving the national education goals, objectives, and targets, the
implementation of the plan must have a solid foundation. The effective implementation of a
sector-wide Education Strategy will require the definition of efficient coordination mechanisms and
clear lines of responsibility, authority and accountability at central as well as at decentralized levels.
It is important to avoid the creation of heavy bureaucratic structures and favor an efficient usage of
the existing internal structure developing agile working groups supported with appropriate technical
assistance.

      4.1.1
4.3     The Minister of Education and Science should act as the chief executive officer in managing
the implementation of the sector wide strategy and should provide leadership, ongoing problem-
solving and executive decisions to ensure the smooth operation of the Program Implementation
Teams and their accountability. At the strategic management level, a new coordination mechanism, a
Strategic Plan Coordination Group, could be defined under the coordination of the Minister of
Education and Science. This Group should be responsible for overseeing the entire implementation
process, making sure that the Ministry structure is fully supportive of the achievement of the Strategic
Plan goals and targets. The Coordination Group should receive technical inputs and additional
support from the following ministry functions:

     Finance: provide adequate budgeting financial management support and information systems.
     Legal Advisory: review on a continuing basis the existing rules and regulations to be improved
      and revised as necessary in addition to setting up a supportive, enabling regulatory framework
      for effective implementation of the education reform concepts embedded in the Strategic Plan.
 Georgia: Education Sector Policy Review                                                                   72


     Policy, Planning and EMIS Support: these functions are essential to ensure provision of key
      technical support for managing and monitoring the implementation of the plan and are explained
      in more detail later

4.4     The characteristics of some of the priority programs (especially PP1: Teaching Quality and
PP2: School Accountability and Support Systems) will require the direct involvement of the Minister
and other top management authorities of the ministry. This will be needed to provide the general
coordination, initial orientation and the criteria that will be used to guide the capacity strengthening
support to some of its present capacities or for the creation of new capacities.

      4.1.2
4.5      Changes to the present structure of the MoES are needed to create a special technical unit, a
new Strategy, Policy and Planning Department to develop the technical capacity to support key
strategic management functions and sustain the introduction of management by results practices.
Without adequate management by results, the implementation of sector-wide reforms risks of failure
are increased, as there are too many areas that require horizontal and vertical coordination that will
not be automatically provided by the present structure. This department should also provide (i)
monitoring and evaluation frameworks and (ii) host the development and implementation of cross
cutting policies that involve the whole sector, such as for example, social inclusion, lifelong learning
or early school leaving policies. The strategic planning services provided by this unit should cover the
following main functions:

     Monitoring Framework. A sector-wide monitoring framework should compile for each of the
      desired goals a specific set of key performance indicators, targets and baseline measurement as
      well as the intermediate results and time frames to achieve them. For each of the implementation
      priorities well defined multi annual plans and budgets must also be provided
     Annual Action Planning. Develop methodologies to support national authorities in the
      preparation of Annual Action Plans and Budgets to correctly reflect the specific implementation
      requirements for each priority programs and sector results.
     Management by Results. These MBR tools should combine the traditional, “input-based”
      expenditure monitoring systems with “output-based” project and program monitoring using the
      information contained in the execution calendars established in the Annual Plans. This tool will
      help the Ministry to prepare expenditure plans and avoid administrative bottlenecks but more
      importantly, it will enable to begin to monitor that the resources spent were actually used to
      achieve the desired results.
     Performance Assessment and Evaluation Framework The new department must also provide
      tools to assess the achievement of educational as well as management goals and outcomes stated
      in the strategy and priority programs. For this purpose, systematic and evidence-based studies
      must be carried out to provide regular follow-up of the adequacy and impact of the selected
      policy interventions.

4.6     To monitor and review overall progress of the strategy implementation, the Monitoring
Framework should describe the outcomes to be achieved, the target figures selected for the key
outputs and the ways of measuring their achievement. This list can be divided by year, and
therefore, provide the main elements necessary to monitor progress in the implementation of the
programs. A more detailed framework will be necessary to monitor the implementation of the Annual
Action Plans, as these require a more detailed description of the actions to be performed. Output
planning will have to be readjusted on a yearly basis: after measuring what has been achieved during
the previous year it will be necessary to adjust the plans for the year which follows to ensure the
achievement of the long-term targets.

4.7    The new department could also be instrumental in supporting the development and
implementation of crosscutting policies that require the active intervention of central and
decentralized bodies of the Ministry. A good example could be provided by a top priority: the
development and implementation of a Social Inclusion Policy. The following are the main actions
 Georgia: Education Sector Policy Review                                                                                  73


needed to create an appropriate institutional framework and support system that clearly demarcates
responsibilities at the national municipal and school levels:

     Define and implement a national social inclusion policy to promote the educational success of
      socially marginalized groups 57 ensuring that they gain full access to the same opportunities,
      rights and services that are accessed by the mainstream of society
     Regulate the articulation of national policy definitions and financing for social inclusion
      measures and regional /municipal responsibilities for their implementation
     Develop evidence-based studies to analyze the most vulnerable groups that should receive
      assistance in all education sectors and the best means to support them
     Define general policy criteria to use voucher/grants and other tools for providing financial
      support to stimulate participation of the desired target groups in all education sectors
     Define coherent principles for using mother tongues in all education levels
     Define the scope and quality of the support that the government will be able to provide to
      children with special educational needs
     Establish the extent of the educational support to strengthen the reinsertion of displaced
      populations
     Define the criteria to reduce other problems that hinder enrolment and retention, such as: the
      hidden costs of education, distance to schools, inadequacy of school buildings, violence in
      schools and the perception that families have about the quality and usefulness of the education
      that the children will receive
     Produce regular assessments of the impact of the measures implemented and their cost-
      effectiveness

       4.1.3
4.8      A key element for providing evidence based information for monitoring program
implementation and assessing educational outcomes will be the availability of reliable and
comprehensive data from the EMIS 58 . A comprehensive EMIS should be designed to store,
retrieve, analyze and evaluate raw data on student enrolment, staffing and school infrastructure and
asset inventory at all educational levels (from pre-school to tertiary education). The EMIS could also
be compatible with and integrate valuable data from other internal sources, such as financial
execution data, infrastructures payroll and human resources management, allowing access to a series
of predefined integrated management indicators. It could also provide access to a number of external
databases (national census and population data, general infrastructural databases, poverty maps and
surveys) that would add value not only to the decision-making process but also to the Monitoring and
Evaluation process.

4.9     To fully benefit from the introduction of ICTs and Management Information Systems to
appropriately support education management at the central, municipal and school management levels,
the Ministry should strengthen the following capacities:

     Design and implement systems and procedures to ensure the expansion of EMIS to cover all
      educational areas (including preschool, VET and tertiary education) and extend present EMIS
      information with enrolment information at the classroom level (linking teachers with
      classrooms)
     Fully develop a Human Resource MIS. The system should contain information about all MoES
      administrative employees, schools, and boards of trustees and integrate all available information
      about teachers (personal history, classroom performance, in-service training, etc.)
     Develop a School MIS to include detailed information about students (school attendance,
      assessments, achievements, etc.), history (mobility of students, etc.), electronic journals and

condition, ethnicity, language, race, religion, age, gender, disability, HIV status, migrant status, or where they live

 Georgia: Education Sector Policy Review                                                                     74


       time-table of lessons. The system should allow schools to fully maintain educational process
       online and provide daily information to parents and students (attendance and academic
       achievements, student support systems).
      Develop social inclusion management information support systems to enable schools to better
       manage the situation of children from socially vulnerable families and under-represented groups
       (access to grants, learning and counselling history, etc.)
      Develop a system to support school infrastructure management and accumulate information
       about physical school infrastructure (buildings, school yard, etc.), idle capacity, inventory, etc.
      Develop geo-referenced capabilities of the EMIS to allow it to plot the education outcomes/
       input information on maps to assist macro and micro education planning and inspections based
       on real-time evidence
      Fully integrate all available information in internal databases (human resources, teachers, in-
       service training records, school infrastructure development/assessments, financial) and all
       relevant external databases (census, population relocation, new-born, poverty, infrastructure
       development plans, etc.) into the MIS system
      Develop user-friendly and customizable user interfaces and web access to facilitate the usage of
       available data for all management staff (central, regional or school level)
      Design and implement a comprehensive capacity development program to ensure that all MoES
       management are capable of using these systems to achieve excellence in their managerial duties
      Gradually develop the quality of the ICT infrastructure and access systems (intranet, web based
       access, school connectivity, etc.) to allow efficient access to all potential users

        4.2 Addressing Main Operational Functions
4.10     At the operational level, the implementation can be ensured by the definition of Priority
Program Implementation Teams. The main function of these teams will be: (i) to ensure proper
coordination between the different components and activities of each program; (ii) to prepare and
implement Annual Action Plans with the technical support of the Coordination Group; (iii) to monitor
the implementation of the plan through regular structured meetings; and (iv) to prepare regular reports
on the program implementation. Each implementation team will be composed of the people
responsible for the different education sub-sectors/departments directly involved in carrying out the
corresponding program and will include the technical advisors working in each area. For each team
the following key roles should be established:

      Team Leader. Each program should have only one team leader. This person will be directly
       accountable to a Deputy Minister and responsible for the successful implementation of the
       Priority Program. Team leaders should normally correspond with one Deputy Minister. There
       will be some cross cutting programs (Teaching Quality, Donor Coordination) that may require
       the creation of specific coordination teams. In that case, a team leader will be selected from
       among the heads of the directorates that are mainly responsible for the Program implementation.
      Focal Point. For each program, one technical person should be appointed to facilitate the
       planning and monitoring tasks to be carried out by the implementation team. The Focal Point
       will act as the contact person to define the technical tasks to be performed by the Team, (for
       example: preparing the team’s annual action plans, the data for the management by results
       monitoring tool, and reporting to the Coordination Group). Focal Points will be selected on the
       basis of precise criteria including having: the technical skills to deal with data, information and
       performance indicators; good communication skills, and the ability to coordinate efforts
       regarding the implementation of the plan.

        4.3 Addressing Implementation Start-Up Challenges
4.11   The implementation of the Strategic Plan will start in 2015. A pre-implementation stage
should be defined to make a series of preparatory arrangements and ensure that in 2015 the
implementation is correctly addressed. The early stages of the implementation are of critical
importance, as substantial changes will happen at the same time: (i) new managerial staff in charge;
 Georgia: Education Sector Policy Review                                                                       75


(ii) new managerial practices introduced to implement the plan, (iii) the need to start implementing
calendars that will require significant levels of coordination. The following are the key inputs to
ensure an adequate start for the Pre-Implementation and the early Implementation Phases:

        4.3.1
4.12      During pre-implementation phase, the following issues should be addressed:

      Ministry Structure Review: the present Ministry structure must be analyzed to establish if any
       changes are needed to facilitate the implementation of the Strategy.
      Ensure an appropriate 2015 budget allocation: 2015 should mark a discontinuity point from the
       traditional budgeting for Education. The budgetary proposal to be presented to the Prime
       Minister may require substantial increases from the traditional education budgets. This is not
       going to be achieved overnight, and several rounds of negotiations supported by accurate
       technical documents will be required during 2014
      Define Key Donor Support: it will be necessary to ensure that all necessary support can be
       obtained to implement key priority actions where the Ministry may not have the technical
       expertise or the volume of investment that will be required to start the implementation of the
       plan. It is important to engage all donors as early as possible and start the process of defining all
       necessary proposals to ensure adequacy of their 2014-2020 cooperation support since their
       decision making processes may take substantial time to process the Ministry’s requests.
      Prepare an Adequate Inception for the Strategy Management Teams: all priority program teams
       should undergo an intensive training and induction process by the end of 2014. During this
       period, they should be able to excel in the following areas: (i) general understanding of the
       contents of the Strategy; (ii) in depth analysis on the priority program that they have to
       implement; (iii) understand management by results monitoring and reporting principles and
       tools; (iv) preparation of annual budgets and plans (v) engage in the preparation of the 2015
       Annual Action Plans

        4.3.2
4.13    The initiation of the Implementation Phase will require addressing the following issues on a
one-off basis:

      Baseline and Performance Assessment Framework: it is important to define the indicators that
       will be used to monitor performance and the starting point data that will be used to compare to.
       This is an activity that needs to be developed as soon as possible.
      Donor Coordination: close donor coordination is important to ensure smooth implementation
       from the outset.
      Coordination with the Government: new mechanisms should be established to ensure
       participation of the Prime Minister’s office and the Ministry of Finance in the initial steps of
       starting up the implementation of the Strategy. There will be a significant number of situations
       that will benefit from their participation. It will also help to initiate a new, and more coordinated
       way of working with all other executive branches of the government and regional governments.
      Significant managerial leadership will be required to ensure that the Implementation of the
       Strategy starts on the right track and to anticipate and avoid initial coordination and management
       problems. This will no longer be a “business as usual” situation and a critical success factor will
       be an engaged and focused leadership from the Minister and key Directors.

4.14    Several critical success factors to ensure the success of the implementation of the overall
strategy:

      An important shift in the allocation of public financial resources to education will be required to
       ensure the various aspects of the strategy can be realized.
 Georgia: Education Sector Policy Review                                                                    76


      Careful and results-oriented management of the public resources, ensuring that annual spending
       is coherent with the implementation needs emerging from the monitoring and evaluation system
       will be needed.
      An ongoing and well-managed capacity building plan will be indispensable for the sustainability
       of the outcomes stated in the Strategy
      A sector-wide approach to coordinate the support of all development partners is needed to make
       possible the smooth implementation of all the targets of the plan, as well as their sustainability
      It will be also critical to achieve an effective dissemination of the plan to enable learners,
       teachers, parents, and, indeed, all Georgians, to realize the importance of the proposed changes
      Maintaining a good degree of flexibility and developing the ability to adapt to change will also
       be crucial in light of Georgia’s ever-changing circumstances

4.15     The achievement of project objectives is always subject to influences beyond the direct
control of the MoES management. It will also be important to monitor this ‘external’ environment
to identify whether or not the assumptions that have already been made are likely to hold true, what
new risks may be emerging, and to take action to manage or mitigate these risks where possible. A
Risk Analysis and Management Matrix should be built once the main characteristics of the priority
programs of the strategy are fully defined.

Annexes
Annex 1: The structure and institutional setup of the education
system
Georgia’s National Qualifications Framework59 consolidates and defines qualifications at all
levels of the education system. General education system consists of non-compulsory pre-school
education (2-5/6 years60), compulsory education (9 years: 6-12 years/grades 1-6 for primary education
and 12-15 years for lower secondary education/grades 7-9) and upper secondary education (15-18
years/grades 10-12). After completing the compulsory basic education, students can choose to enroll
in vocational education (levels1 to three according to the European Qualifications Framework), 15-18
years). Students completing the third level of VET can choose to continue studies in the subsequent
levels (levels 4 and 5). For some programs, the occupational standards require to have general
education diploma in order to enroll in VET programs 4 and 5. Higher education consists of
Bachelor’s Degree (4 years), Master’s Degree (two years) and PhD (3 to 6 years). Students are
required to successfully pass the unified university entrance examinations (UEE) for progression to
the academic stream of higher education.

The Ministry of Education and Science (MES) has the overall responsibility for education policy
formulation and control over its execution while some of the key implementation functions are
assigned to the Legal Entities of Public Law (LEPL). The MES has the primary responsibility for
the policy and management of the education sector in Georgia. Nonetheless, some of the core
functions such as examinations and assessment, teachers’ professional development, quality
assurance, educational infrastructure development, science development, education statistics are
implemented by the specialized semi-autonomous LEPLs under the umbrella of the Ministry, as
presented in Figure 2 and Figure 3 below. These institutions receive financing from the state budget
but also generate revenues through their activities. The National Examination Center (NAEC) is

59 Adopted by the Ministry of Education and Science (MES) Decree N120/N on December 10, 2010.

   Poland
   In 2012, Poland was among the top performers across the whole world in the PISA survey, which assesses
   15-years-old students. Poland’s average score (across reading, mathematics and science) was 520 points,
   above both the OECD average and also that of most countries in the EU. It is also more than 40 points
   above the country’s average score in 2000, when PISA’s first wave was conducted. This unprecedented
   leap in education quality is equivalent to the knowledge acquired in one extra year of education.
   In 1989, when Poland started its transition towards a market economy, no one could have predicted it
   would become one of the greatest examples of successful education reforms. Prior to that, the system had
   been focused on preparing youth for jobs. Vocational education was considered a safe, stable path to life-
   long employment, in particular for the disadvantaged. Students were streamed into different types of
   schools at the age of 14 or 15 (after 8 years of general education). The track was defined by a stringent
   placement exam and the streams were (i) two-year basic vocational schools run by sector industries, (ii)
   two-year technical schools, or (iii) three-year general secondary lyceum. After 1989, many of the industries
   stopped funding vocational schools, as a result of which some vocational schools were converted in
   general or technical schools. Moreover, in the 1990s the importance of teaching basic, general skills had
   already been recognized and a four-year technical lyceum, that included general and technical education,
   was introduced.
   In the late 1990s, a concerted effort to promote structural reforms led to a major education reform. Its
   objectives were to: (i) increase secondary and higher education qualifications, (ii) ensure equal education
   opportunities and (iii) improve the quality of education. In order to accomplish these goals, the structure of
   the education system was changed to ensure that students would attend at least 9 years of general education
   (6 years in primary and 3 years in lower secondary) before being streamed into 3 additional years of
   academic or vocational education. This provided all students with an additional year of academic studies.
   In addition, a new core curriculum for lower secondary education was introduced to raise the level of
   education and expectations (previously, most students were expected to go to basic vocational education).
   Curricular standards were set at the national level, but curriculum development was decentralized to the
   local level, engaging teachers and helping to change the teaching philosophy and culture of schools.
   Finally, an accountability system to monitor results was put in place. External examinations at the end of
   primary, lower secondary and upper secondary education were introduced.

   The results are impressive and came about quickly. Poland’s PISA score jumped from an average of 479 to
   497 between 2000 and 2003(The students tested in 2000 had already been streamed in different types of
   schools while after that most students were still in lower secondary). Very importantly, the results were not
   concentrated among the top performers although they also improved. In 2003, 21.4 percent of the Polish
   had not acquired the basic mathematical skills by the age of 15. In 2012, this figure had dropped to 13.8
   percent. At the same time, only 8.1 percent were considered top performers in 2003 while 15.4 percent
   reached that level in 2012.
   The story of Poland provides an invaluable example of how smart reforms, if well implemented, can lead
   to positive outcomes in the medium term.

Annex 3: Review of Higher Education Financing Options and
Accountability Instruments

Financing Mechanisms

After identifying its main policy objectives (access, equity, quality, labor market relevance, etc.) for
Georgia’s higher education system, the Ministry of Education and Science should reassess how its
current funding model fits or aligns with those objectives. Specifically, the MoES may want to
consider diversifying its financing methods to serve as policy instruments to help steer the higher
education sector towards the national priorities in higher education. The table below shows different
financing mechanisms, none of which are mutually exclusive) that could be used, for example, to
facilitate research and innovation, improve the quality of teaching and learning, facilitate knowledge
transfer, and make universities more socially inclusive. These financing instruments are:

     Competitive grants: Well-designed competitive funds can greatly stimulate the performance of
      higher education institutions and can be powerful vehicles for their transformation and innovation
      – all while still respecting the diverse profiles of institutions within the system. Competitive funds
      are typically established for the purposes of improving quality and relevance, promoting
      innovation, and fostering better management. 61 Competitive grants can be used to facilitate
      research and innovation and improve the quality of teaching and learning. According to Salmi and
      Hauptmann, one way of improving quality through competitive research grants is to use quality
      improvement as a criterion in evaluating proposals and selecting recipients. In Georgia,
      competitive grants can also be used to encourage cooperation between more resourceful
      universities in Tbilisi with universities in the regions, or cooperation with foreign universities to
      develop and deliver joint programs and conduct joint research.
     Priority based funding formula: The traditional way for funding relevance occurs when central
      bodies determine which programs to fund based on their determination of relevance. The Ministry
      introduced priority based funding in 2013: priority programs identified by the Ministry receive
      state funding based on the number of students enrolled. This financing instrument can be effective
      in increasing the relevance of TE programs. Together with priority fields (such as engineering,
      education, etc), the government could use the funding instrument to increase the attractiveness of
      tertiary level type B programs. However, identification of priority programs should be based on
      valid criteria and reliable labor market data.
     Performance contracts: This financing mechanism is aimed to articulate explicitly the agreement
      between the government and universities. The mutually-agreed upon contract details the
      expectations (degrees awarded, research output, etc.) the government has for the institution
      receiving state funding. While there may be financial incentives for exceeding expectations, there
      should also be financial penalties for failing to meet expectations. This funding instrument can be
      used together with competitive grants to reward the universities with high performance on
      research and innovation or knowledge transfer.
     Needs based grants are used to remove financial barrier for poor students. Currently Georgia
      provides partial and full needs based grants for some 4 percent of the student population. Existing
      poverty assessment infrastructure provides a good opportunity for Georgia to identify the target
      population: potential beneficiaries can apply for assessing their need and based on the assessment,
      students will become eligible for the means tested state grant.
     Subsidized student loans: The experience with student loans has been mixed. Some student loan
      schemes have been successful in meeting its goals and also maintaining high repayment and
      recovery rations. Georgia has the experience of offering subsidized student loans. In 2008, the

61Salmi and Hauptman, 2006
    Georgia: Education Sector Policy Review                                                                    85


      Government introduced “Tsodnis Kari” program. The program offered subsidized student loans
      for Georgian citizens to study in graduate programs abroad. The program awarded 54 loans
      through five commercial banks. The recovery rate of the loans has not been investigated and it is
      hard to judge about the effectiveness of the program. The issue of subsidized loans needs to be
      further investigated in terms its potential for lifting financial budget for some groups of students.
      Traditionally, student loans schemes were designed for poor students. In Georgia, however,
      subsidized student loans can also be targeted towards non-poor students enrolled in programs that
      have potentially high individual rate of return. This way the scheme will target the students who
      are more likely to be able to pay for the loans after graduation.
     Portable student grants: the principle of portability is to give students the freedom to take the
      grant or scholarship to the institutions of his/her choice. This has indirect impact on the quality of
      teaching and learning because it gives the students the voting power in favor of the universities
      that offer better quality education. Georgia’s student grants scheme is based on this principal.
      However, in order for the principal to be realized, applicants and students should have reliable
      information on the quality of teaching and learning in Georgian universities.

     Merit based scholarships: The scholarships that reward students for good performance at
      university have positive effect on students’ engagement in education. Georgia introduced merit -
      based scholarships in 2009. Students are ranked according to GPA and the students with the
      highest GPAs receive scholarships. Unlike merit based grants, merit based universities administer
      the scholarships: the Ministry distributes a certain amount among universities based on the size of
      their undergraduate student population. However, this instrument is effective only if students’
      learning is assessed in a reliable and objective way and motivates students to perform well. This
      aspect of the Georgian merit based scholarships needs further investigation. Embedding the
      scholarship recipients’ success in the labor market and further education as well as students’
      attitudes towards the university policy in awarding the scholarships as indicators in TE
      accountability instrument would help inform universities and improve their assessment practices.

Accountability Instruments

Accountability mechanisms that are developed through consensus among the major stakeholders and
are concentrated on measuring HEIs according their outcomes can serve as the major driver for the
improvement of the quality, equity, effectiveness, efficiency, and relevance of HEIs. The HEI
outcome indicators should be related to the role the TE system should play in national development.
The indicators should be built and modified with participation of stakeholders and the performance of
higher education institutions should be measured by an independent agency.
Recently developed European classification and ranking instruments provide a very good example for
Georgia as well as the opportunity to join this initiative. In 2005, researchers at the Center for Higher
Education Policy Studies (CHEPS) piloted their first European classification of tertiary education
institutions – the U-MAP, which groups universities in homogenous groups according to indicators in
6 dimensions. In 2010, U-Multirank was developed which ranks universities according 5 of the 6 U-
MAP’s dimension indicators. U-Multirank ranks universities according to the following indicators
under the dimensions of teaching and learning, research, knowledge transfer, regional engagement
and general indicators such as percentage of online programs, size of an institution etc.

Joining U-Multirank initiative would serve multiple purposes for diverse audiences - HEIs, students,
employers, policy-makers, and researchers - in the following way:
     Higher Education Institutions will be better able to develop and communicate their missions,
        to show their profiles to stakeholders and to engage more effectively in partnerships,
        benchmarking and networking.
     Students will be better able to identify their preferred higher education institutions and make
        better choices regarding their study programs and labor market perspectives.
     Business and industry: the classification reveals which types  of institutions are of particular
        interest for them, facilitating easier creation of mutual partnerships and stronger relationships.
     Policy-makers in governmental and other contexts will benefit from a deeper insight into
        institutional diversity. National and European policies for higher education cannot be based
        on a ‘one size fits all’ approach. Instead, policies need to be attuned to diversity in such a way
        that they can be made to work most effectively.
     Researchers and analysts: A classification serves as a methodological tool for researchers. It
        will provide analysts and other  experts with more insight into institutional diversity both
        methodologically and analytically which will assist them in policy analyses, international
        comparative studies, and institutional benchmarking studies (van Vaught et al 2010).

U-Map and U-Multrirank choose universities as data providers. The reason, as the authors explain
(2010), is that international databases comprising comparable data at the institutional level do not
exist or cover only a very limited part of the data needed. In many countries national databases exist
but they are not comprehensive and, even more importantly, are seldom disaggregated to the
institutional level, which makes their use problematic. This implies that the higher education
institution is the central source of information for the classification tool (CHEPS, 2010).

The main instrument to collect data from the higher education institutions is the on-line questionnaire
for higher education institutions. The questions in the new version of the U-Map questionnaire are
organized around seven sections.

     General information: name and contact; public/private character and age of the institution
     Students: numbers; modes and age; international
     Graduates: level of degrees awarded; subjects; orientation; graduates in the region
     Staff data: FTE and headcount; international
     Income: total; sources of income 
     Expenditure: total; by cost center; use of full cost accounting 
     Research and knowledge exchange: publications; patents; concerts and exhibitions; start-ups

Together with the U-Multirank indicators, Georgia should use other indicators that are essential in
measuring HEIs effectiveness, efficiency, relevance and equity. These indicators may include the
share of various vulnerable groups in an institution, student engagement i ndex, students’ engagement
in research, graduate employment and graduate satisfaction indicators etc. (see table 3).
