 Unfair Trading                         Unfair Trading Practices (UTP) is associated with contractual
 Practices                        relationship between businesses where larger companies abuse
                                  their better negotiating position to diminish the ability of smaller
                                  companies to negotiatiate mutually acceptable contractual terms.
                                  Imposing contractual terms and conditions on busness partners
                                  becomes ‘unfair’ when the party with the ‘weaker’ bargaining
                                  position cannot afford to reject the imposed terms.* Examples
                                  include introducing different contractual terms and conditions to
                                  suppliers for essentially the same transaction; or impose additional,
                                  unrelated obligations as a condition to conclude a contract, or require
                                  payment of unrelated fees and charges for services, enforce contract
                                  changes retroactively, etc.
 Market Dominance                       Market dominance, a well-defined concept under EU
                                  competition law: “is the ability [of a company] to prevent effective
                                  competition being maintained on the market and to act to an appreciable
                                  extent independently of other players.”**At the core of the analysis is
                                  finding out how a company interacts with other market players
                                  when it holds a substantially better position in the relevant market
                                  compared to its competitors. The EC considers that dominance may
                                  be presumed if a company controls a 50 percent share and its rivals
                                  have significantly smaller shares.
 Economic                               Economic dependence, as a concept under competition law,
 Dependence                       allows the enforcing the rules on market dominance in cases of
                                  abuse even if dominance is not present. By leveraging the concept
                                  of economic dependence, a powerful market player is treated the
                                  same as a dominant market player who abuses its position.
 Significant Market                     Significant Market Power (SMP), similar to dominance,
 Power                            assesses a company’s ability to influence competition in a
                                  particular market. It is a concept developed and defined in the
                                  context of regulated markets, where a company is considered
                                  to have SMP if "it enjoys a position equivalent to dominance, that is
                                  to say a position of economic strength affording it the power to behave
                                  to an appreciable extent independently of competitors, customers and
                                  ultimately consumers."***




* - Businesses with a ‘weaker’ bargaining position agree to unfavorable terms for various reasons. Overall, the motivation is led by
the perception, or certainty, that the relationship with such a “stronger” party, despite being built upon unfavorable and unballanced
contractual terms, is the precondition for pursuing a business opportunity or for entering a new market and in certain cases even for
staying in business.

ADDRESSING UNFAIR TRADING PRACTICES IN BULGARIA




                                            EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


        Relations between buyers and suppliers have changed enormously over the past
twenty-five years. Large buyers now source products from a global market and take advantage
of the cost reductions that come from economies of scale. Economies of scale have increased
market concentration, which, in turn, has changed contractual relations between buyers
(retailers) and their suppliers. Some large buyers appear to have considerable negotiating
power to bring down prices paid to their suppliers and also extract other discounts. More
harmfully, some claim that buyers can unilaterally set the terms of contracts with suppliers.
       As consolidation gains momentum, the Government of Bulgaria is concerned that
large buyers could impose increasingly unfair contract terms on their local suppliers. The
Government is already hearing from suppliers that unfair trading practices are being used
by buyers to impose contract terms. Unfair trading practices are contrary to good faith and
dealing and at times unlawful. These are typically imposed by a stronger party on a weaker
one and can exist from any side of the contractual relationship between businesses. Large
buyers can refuse to cover supplier costs, pass on a disproportionally high share of market
risk, unexpectedly, unilaterally, and sometimes retroactively, change or cancel contracts
and/or pass on costs to suppliers that were not initially agreed to, just to name a few.1 These
are the types of complaints that the Government receives from suppliers, prompting it to
act.
       The Government’s concerns with unfair trading practices have translated into a
proposal to amend the competition policy framework. More specifically, the Government
is considering introducing the concept of ’significant market power’ in the competition
law. The Government recognizes that retail markets have many large players, but no one
dominant player. These large buyers can substantially affect the fortunes of their suppliers
when they threaten not to buy or to reduce their purchases. When threatened this way,
suppliers have few options to negotiate a fair deal.

        The Government frames unfair trading practices as a competition policy issue. In
contrast, this could be seen as an issue of commercial law, sector regulation, or business
conduct. These are approaches used in other EU Member States. Recognizing that large
buyers do not hold a dominant position in retail markets, the Government contends that
the large buyers’ ‘superior bargaining position’ is a form of market power. In addition, the
Government argues that if the practice of unfairly squeezing suppliers is prevalent and
persistent, it could, on one hand drive suppliers out of business; and on the other hand, it
could it will incentivize more consolidation of the retail market, which could negatively
affect consumer choice.
       However, the decision to seek a policy solution to unfair trading practices in the
competition policy framework is not obvious and could present downside risks. The case
in favor of using competition policy may be difficult to support when the welfare implications
of the proposed remedies are unclear. Indeed, to the extent that bargaining power exercised


1 In particular, the European Commission identifies what it considers to be seven common unfair trading practices that are apparent
across European Union Member States; namely, ambiguous contract terms, lack of written contracts, unfair variations, unfair transfer
of commercial risk, unfair use of information, unfair termination and territorial supply restrictions.
                                                                10
                                                                       EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

by buyers is offset by the market power of suppliers, it may result in improving the welfare
of consumers in the retail market. Large buyers are often more efficient and can offer lower
priced goods and improved services to consumers.
        Recognizing the challenges of amending the competition law to address unfair
trading practices, the Government asked the World Bank for technical support. The
Government is aware of initiatives of other EU Member States to adapt their competition
legislation to address the same issues. The Government asked the World Bank to help
identify and present the benefits and of the lessons learned from the collective experiences
of fellow Member States. In response, the World Bank organized a technical workshop, titled
“Significant Market Power and Unfair Trading Practices: Issues and Challenges” in collaboration
with the office of the Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Development and the Bulgarian
Commission for Protection of Competition. The event took place on January 28th, 2014 in
Sofia and gathered competition experts from the Organization of Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD), United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD),
academics and the experts from the national competition authorities from the Czech
Republic, Italy, and Hungary. The event was also attended by experts from the Bulgarian
government and a local think tank.
       The workshop presented the mixed success of international practices in addressing
unfair trading practices. At the event, experts from the Czech Republic, Hungary and
Italy presented their experiences with national competition laws designed to protect
the weaker parties. All of these countries have modified the approach to unfair trading
practices, following several years of enforcement. All competition authorities confronted the
serious issue in deciding when and under what criteria they should intervene to rebalance
contracting relations. The difficult issue of false positives, intervening when they should not
have, was left unaddressed. Finally, and most importantly, the central issue of economic
welfare implications from protecting suppliers against buyers’ drive to bring down prices
was left an open.
       During the workshop, representatives of OECD and UNCTAD provided their
perspective from governments that tried to address unfair trading practices through
competition policy and through other means. Based on several cases from across the globe,
the UNCTAD representative expressed a pessimistic view about the likelihood of success
in using competition policy to address unfair trading practices. The OECD representative
argued that changing the focus of the nation’s competition agency in this way may be
counterproductive. They both cautioned the Government to proceed in the proposed
direction with care. In sum, the technical workshop discussions concluded that challenging
but surmountable implementation and enforcement issues are apparent in using competition
policy to address unfair trading practices. Uncertainty about the benefits of these efforts also
remains.
       In addition to the workshop, the World Bank provided a review of the approaches of
EU Member State in addressing unfair trading practices. The EU competition rules formed
the basis for this review. Stricter national competition rules than those provided by the EU
were adopted in Austria, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Latvia,
Portugal, Romania, Spain and the United Kingdom, among others. The review highlights
distinct approaches, ranging from the least interventionist approach, such as adopting code
of business conduct, to the most interventionist approach, introducing significant market
power, which is being considered by the Bulgarian Government.

practices against the following criteria: effectiveness, alignment with economic principles,
adaptability, efficiency and timeliness, and analytically based, dependent, transparent,
contestable and reversible practice with due process.
       Based on these criteria, the World Bank proposes six options for Bulgaria, ordered
by suitability:
      Option 1: Enrich the commercial law with specific provisions, prohibiting unfair trading
practices in business-to-business relations. Unfair trading practices in business-to-business
relations are defined in the legislation on commercial contracts and the Commission for
Protection of Competition is tasked with enforcing these provisions in cases where business
conduct affects overall competition.
      Option 2: Amend the competition law to introduce the concept of ‘economic dependence’.
With this option, the Commission for Protection of Competition could apply provisions on
‘abuse of market dominance’, even in cases where the dominance test is not met, by finding
that ‘economic dependence’ exists in buyer-supplier relations. However, addressing unfair
trading practices through antitrust law enforcement is associated with risks that the work
of the Commission for Protection of Competition is politicized and the impartiality of the
competition authority is questioned. Also, it is likely that the competition authority would
be overburdened by a large number of cases requesting the attention to the practices of
‘abusive’ large buyers. This could ultimately backlog the system and hamper enforcement.
       Option 3: Enhance the authority of the Commission for Protection of Competition to apply
legal instruments on unfair competition practices. Implementing this option would be associated
with significant reform efforts, in terms of associated changes of both, competition and
consumer protection laws, and in terms of enhancing the capacity of the Commission for
Protection of Competition in the consumer protection area.
     Option 4: Promote codes of conduct applicable to trading relations of businesses. This is the
option implemented in the United Kingdom, where voluntary codes of business conduct,
aimed at tackling imbalances in the supply chain, favor suppliers and prevent retailers from
unduly shifting costs and risks onto suppliers.
      Option 5: Adopt national rules aligned with the debated EU-level rules on unfair trading
practices. Such an option, however, would delay significantly designing a solution to address
unfair trading practices in business relations in Bulgaria as it is unclear when (and whether)
such EU-wide rules would be adopted.
      Option 6: Adopt sector specific legislation to introduce the concept of ‘significant market power’.
The Commission for Protection of Competition could be tasked with enforcing sector rules
that introduce the concept of ‘significant market power’ in business-to-business relations. It
is important to note that this ‘least preferred’ option, albeit endorsing the introduction of the
concept of ‘significant market power’ in Bulgaria, is distinctly different from the approach
proposed in the draft bill for amending the Law on the Protection of Competition submitted
to Parliament by a group of Members of Parliament on March 7, 2014. Under the draft bill
‘significant market power’ is proposed as a general competition law instrument applicable
to all sectors and markets. In the Czech and Hungarian cases ‘significant market power’
is introduced through sector legislation on the agriculture and food retail sectors, and
the competition authority, as in the Czech case, is tasked with enforcement of such sector
legislation. In the Hungarian case, a separate agency is tasked with enforcement. A draft
bill recently submitted to the Bulgarian parliament proposes an approach that will likely
put a significant strain on the Commission for Protection of Competition, both in terms of
capacity and resources.

       Additionally, the World Bank provided an economic assessment of how
implementable and effective the significant market power would be to address unfair
trading practices using competition policy. This assessment is based on the economic
principles proposed by the European Commission guidelines,2 i.e. take corrective action
when abusive behavior harms consumers, not competitors. In other words, a market
assessment must show that the actions of a buyer with significant market power must
negatively affect consumers, present and future, before the application of competition policy
sanctions and remedies are justified. It is unclear how SMP would meet this test other than
in the narrowest of circumstances. In addition, this type of abusive practice is unlikely to
occur repeatedly between the same pair of buyers and suppliers unless specific barriers to
entry or expansion exist in this market.
       The economic analysis concluded that the introduction of significant market
power to address unfair trading practices will likely result in substantial uncertainty
in the market. This conclusion reinforces the findings of the review of EU Member State
experiences. For example, unfairness is not a well-defined economic concept and it is
certainly outside the scope of most competition policy frameworks. The issue of economic
dependence on the buyer’s continued purchases is argued to be the root of what make
suppliers weak in bargaining but it is also unclear in economic theory. Finally, lowering the
market power threshold, from dominant to significant, to address the abusive conduct of
non-dominant undertakings increases the chances of false positives. In sum, the economic
principles defined in the competition policy framework are important to abide by because
they guide competition authorities to act only when economic welfare is being negatively
affected. This is also important because remedies found in any competition policy framework
can be powerful, but when misapplied, damaging.
         Based on these analyses, the World Bank established that addressing unfair
trading practices through commercial courts was likely the most viable and effective
option for Bulgaria. First, unfair trading practices mainly result from an imbalance in
bargaining power between two parties. In addition, the bilateral relationship between buyer
and supplier is governed by a contract. Commercial law was designed exactly for disputes
between parties over breach of contract or unfair dealings. In comparison, competition
policy is primarily concerned with remedies to behavior that affect the whole market—not
a handful of market players. The body of commercial law is likely comprised of good, legal
precedent on which practices deviate from good commercial conduct. Furthermore, the
application of competition policy remedies are based on evidence of damage to consumer or
overall economic welfare. The damages that may be caused by unfair trading practices are
likely to be incurred by a few suppliers and are not clearly apparent to consumers. Finally,
if terms of the contract are fair to some, but seem unfair to others, the courts can determine
if this is so because of differences in the efficiency of the operations of the seemingly injured
party. By rejecting claims of damage from the least productive suppliers, the courts would
be helping the market sustain the lowest cost suppliers and improving market efficiency.
It is unclear that the more blunt remedies available to a competition authority would be so
discriminating and lead to these kind of efficiencies. Attempting to adapt the compeition
policy framework to address these bilateral contractual issues would have to appeal to a
new set of concepts in the Bulgaria jurisprudence. Doing so will mean it will take some time
before these untested concepts can be pinned down and provide the kind of certainty that
market competition requires.

2 Article 102 (formerly Article 82) of Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union is a fundamental part of the competition
policy framework dealing with abuses of market power. The European Union’s top enforcement authority, the European Commission,
issued a guidance paper on how to implement and enforce provisions under Article 102. The EC Guidance Paper (2008) places
significant emphasis on an ‘effects-based approach’ to identify which unilateral actions from dominant entities should be of concern to
the competition authorities.

                                                  INTRODUCTION

       The Government of Bulgaria is concerned that large retail chains may be using their
superior bargaining position to dictate the terms of contractual relations with their suppliers.
The Government believes that this constitutes unfair trading practices (UTP) and remedies
should be found in the nation’s competition policy framework. However, the European
Union (EU) competition legislation, itself, is silent on the relations between businesses even
if these are based on unfair terms. At the same time, EU law does allow Member States,
like Bulgaria, to set national rules if they want to address unfair practices resulting from
abuse of barganing power.3 Using this authority to amend its competition framework, the
Government of Bulgaria (GoB) is considering the introduction of the concept of ‘significant
market power’ (SMP) into the competition legislation.

       Expansion of the CPC’s mandate to address UTP through the application of SMP
as a competition law instrument raises questions about enforcement. How will the CPC
enforce this broader authority to protect against consumer harm and at the same time avoid
the risk of deterring pro-competitive conduct through arbitrary enforcement? Avoiding
arbitrary enforcement of this new authority requires setting clear, objective criteria and
standards when the CPC can apply sanctions and remedies based on the competition policy
framework. Questions remain unaddressed about whether the constraints, specificity and
methods of a competition policy framework would allow designing effective remedies

        To address the UTP issues in business to business (B2B) relations in the buyer-
supplier relations, the Minister of Finance of the GoB asked the World Bank in end-October
2013 for technical support in the area of competition. The Deputy Prime Minister (DPM)
for Economic Development was appointed as the designated key counterpart. In November
2013, the task was further specified and the GoB asked the World Bank to explore how
and whether the SMP concept, anchored in the competition policy framework, would
effectively address UTP in B2B relations. In follow up meetings, the CPC expressed interest
in collaborating as well, sending a formal communication in December 2013.

        In response, the World Bank convened, in cooperation with the Bulgarian
counterparts, experts from the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD), United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), national
competition authorities from EU member states, academics as well as key experts from the
Bulgarian government and the CPC to address the SMP design and implementation issues
in a technical workshop on Significant Market Power and Unfair Business Practices: Issues
and Challenges.

       Chapter one is a summary of the discusions during the workshop that took place
on January 28 2014 at the Boyana Residence in Sofia (Agenda and List of participants are
available in Annex 1-2).




3 Article 3 of EC Regulation 1/2003, in addressing the relationship between national competition laws and the EU competition
rules, states that where national competition authorities or courts apply both European and national competition law in parallel, the
application of the latter is subject to an obligation of convergence contained in Article 3(2).
                                                                15
ADDRESSING UNFAIR TRADING PRACTICES IN BULGARIA

                               WELCOMING REMARKS

       H.E. Daniela Bobeva, DPM for Economic Development

      The DPM for Economic Development welcomed the audience and confirmed at
the outset that a priority of the GoB’s program is countering UTP in the chain: supplier
– processor – distributor retailer – consumer. The DPM noted that in recent years there is
the emergence of small number of relatively strong participants in the supply chain of the
food and non-food retail sector that exercise pressures during the negotiations with their
suppliers, in certain cases leading to UTP.

       UTP have been identified in all EU member states, as the DPM noted, and the
European Commission (EC) has taken an active part in addressing the issue. For example,
it published in 2013 the Green Paper on UTP in the B2B relations which identified the
following types of UTP: (i) unfair contractual conditions; (ii) lack of written agreements; (iii)
retroactive amendment of agreements; (iv) unfair transfer of trade risk; (v) inappropriate
use of information; (vi) unfair termination of trade relations; and (vii) territorial limitations
of deliveries. Moreover, EC also published a study on the economic and legal aspects
pertaining to illegal use, appropriation and court disputes regarding confidentiality of trade
information and secrets.

        The DPM emphasized that the case of Bulgaria mirrors the same issues raised in
the Green paper. Non-written contracts are offered to suppliers by retailers, who impose
also other unfavorable conditions (e.g. transfer of trade risk to suppliers/producers; six-
month delay in payments, among others). These create a spiral of issues with suppliers
and producers, who have to postpone payment of salaries to their workers, social security
payments, etc. The process also contributes to the increased inter-firm indebtedness and
affects trust in the system. Issues related to sharing confidential information among retail
chains is also present, as the DPM noted.

       To respond to the 2013 protests of suppliers, the GoB decided to introduce changes
in the competition framework that will address UTP in B2B relations. The draft Law on
Amendments and Supplements to the Law on Protection of Competition, noted the DPM,
aims at complementing existent regulations by creating conditions for the conduct of a
consistent policy for protection of national markets, production, delivery and distribution
of goods and services, to ensure conditions of equal standing in negotiating during the
implementation of trade deals and prevent UTP.

      The DPM emphasized at the end that the draft bill is prepared on the basis of German
and Czech legislation and is largely based on the findings of the EC’s 2013 Green Paper.

      Mr. Markus Repnik, World Bank Country Manager for Bulgaria, Czech Rep. and
Slovakia

       Mr. Repnik began his speech stating that competition is at the heart of the market
economy and a driving force behind product and service innovation. He stressed the linkages
between competition and business environment – the ability to enforce contracts - is crucial
for a competitive environment, and vice versa. Strong and fair competition contributes to a
better business environment serving as a guarantee that all companies operate on an “even
playing field” regardless of size and economic power.

        The speaker noted that the GoB has requested the World Bank support Bulgaria’s
efforts to strengthen competition through an advisory partnership that will aim to strengthen
all aspects of the business environment. Then, Mr. Repnik clarified the World Bank is not
present to promote a specific methodology or approach but would like to encourage a
technical expert discussion about the ways to strengthen competition. Thus, the workshop
could provide a space for open technical discussions by bringing together Bulgarian and
international experts; to harvest collective expertise and experience; and to identify options
how to address noncompetitive behavior, address unfair B2B trading practices. Identifying
the options will help better understand the choices and tradeoffs and the respective costs
and benefits, concluded Mr. Repnik.

    Mr. Petko Nikolov, Chair of the Bulgarian Commission for Protection of
Competition

        The CPC Chairman began by pointing out that the issue of market power and contract
business practices has been in discussion for quite some time. Hence, the importance of the
workshop’s topic. The past several years have witnessed both CPC and the GoB aiming
to better understand the relationship between local suppliers and retail chains in the food
sector.

      Local suppliers allege abusive practices in the distribution chain (e.g. the imbalance of
bargaining power allows supermarkets to impose pressures, costs and risks upon suppliers).
Concerns about the trading relationships between suppliers and retailers are not unique for
Bulgaria, Mr. Petkov clarified. Many countries in Europe and around the world face the
same problem and there are a number of approaches to address these.

        In Bulgaria, several ways to deal with the issue of UTP have been already offered,
including self-regulation by business and legislative amendments to the Law for Protection
of Competition to incorporate the SMP concept. However, Mr. Petkov noted that the SMP
intervention, in particular, is broad enough to cover every industry and business in Bulgaria.
Thus, in practice this is not a special but universal prohibition which can impact any market.
In that line of thought, CPC has voiced several times concerns in the past few years and has
undertaken a number of initiatives in the food sector, including advocacy instruments, anti-
trust investigations, and sector inquires to address the issues in the sector and improve its
capacity.

ADDRESSING UNFAIR TRADING PRACTICES IN BULGARIA

                                      PANEL I: SETTING THE STAGE

      The first panel of the workshop focused on setting the stage for the discussion. The
moderator, Mr. Darin Stankov, representative of the Bulgarian CPC, opened the panel with
the proposal that there is a need to outline the problematic before there is a search for a
reasonable solution. Mr. Alvaro Gonzalez from the World Bank outlined the key goals of
the workshop, as follows:

       (i) Provide information. The World Bank called this a technical workshop because
the Bulgarian Government is dealing with a highly complex issue laden with a gigantic
amount of intricate technical details with several points and counterpoints. A team of
technical experts has been assembled that have scoured through this sizeable amount of
detail and complexity and can provide the workshop audience with the kind of clarity that
can only come from deep experience.

       (ii) Identify and understand the choices and tradeoffs. The options available to the
Government of Bulgaria are numerous.  The calculus of costs and benefits for each option,
while not always easily providing the clarity of a single number to guide government policy,
is nonetheless a useful exercise.

      (iii) Initiate a useful process. The technical workshop may be useful to the
representatives of the Government of Bulgaria and all other participants. Whatever the
Government decides to do—or not to do—it is hoped that the process of consultations
within and across governments and international organizations is worth replicating.

                                       Contributions from the World Bank

       The first presentation in the panel was offered by Mr. Evgeni Evgeniev from the
World Bank on “Issues in B2B relationship in the Food Supply Chain: The case of Bulgaria”.
He firstly noted that the EU retail services contribute €454 billion to the EU value added,
which accounts for 4.3 percent of total EU value added and employ no less than 18.6 million
citizens. In fact, Europe has witnessed the emergence of big retail chains in the last two
                                                                          4
decades (e.g. there have been 430 mergers between 2004 and 2011, only).

      Large retailers have the highest bargaining power vis-à-vis many small producers and
suppliers. This gives them the power to set unilateral terms and conditions on other players
down the supply chain – producers and suppliers. The presenter recalled that the focus
on the food sector at the EU level has been intensified since the food price crisis broke out
in 2007. From mid-2007 to mid-2008, agricultural commodity prices rose sharply, which
resulted in increased consumer prices. Since then, prices of many commodities have come
down to levels even lower than 2007 but consumer food prices have continued to increase
and only started declining in mid-2009. This raised concerns about the functioning of the
food supply chain. In particular, some retail chains have set unilateral terms and conditions
on business partners. Hence, allegations and accusations of unfair trading practices started
to come out in EU member states.

      As a result, the EC was given a mandate to improve its knowledge of how food retail
markets function. To that end, the EC set up a Task Force to analyze the functioning of the
European food supply chain. Questions arose about the competitive structure of the food
4 Today, top 4 retailers in the UK account for over 60 % of the market. Finish top 2 retailers (over 70 %), Latvia top 2 (60 %), Dutch
top 3 (over 80 %), Slovenia (top 3 for over 60 %).
                                                                 18
                                                                                         PANEL I: SETTING THE STAGE

supply chain. The Directorate General (DG) for Competition carried out a survey through
a series of informal discussions in 2009 with different associations in the sector to discuss
the European food supply chain. The outcome of the consultations is best expressed in the
following conclusion: “Competition at the retail level is fierce and margins are low, which results
in better prices for consumers”.

      Given the emerging debates on the nature of B2B relations in the food supply chain,
the European Competition Network initiated a number of its own investigations, between
2004 and 2011. The result is that overall 180 antitrust investigations, 1,300 merger control
                                                                              5
proceedings and more than 100 market monitoring actions were undertaken.

      In terms of types of infringements, the presentation specified that competition
authorities have focused on horizontal agreements among competitors, which account for
                                           6
about half of all cases investigated (49%).

       Authorities have also been engaged in extensive general market monitoring, so as
to understand how food markets are working. The practices that result from the imbalance
in bargaining power that exists between the parties in the supply chain are a recurring
concern. The competition authorities have usually found that these practices fall outside
the jurisdiction of competition law. For that reason, several EU countries have sought
to address this problem through other solutions, such as laws addressing UTP (Austria,
Belgium, France, Germany, Portugal, Slovakia) or codes of good practice (Czech Rep., UK,
Hungary, Portugal, Spain).

      The Supply Chain initiative, launched in end-2011, was also presented. As of today,
31 multinationals and 267 of their subsidiaries throughout the EU have signed the Principles
of Good Practices. These were endorsed by few food retailers that operate in Bulgaria as well
(example, METRO, LIDL). Mr. Evgeniev echoed the DPM’s words in mentioning the EC’s
2013 Green Paper, launched by DG Internal Market, which was based on over 300 expert
opinions. These opinions, unfortunately, comprised conflicting messages, which confused
even more the debate on which tools could be used to address UTP.

       The presentation of the Bulgarian case followed. The speaker noted that the retail
market has witnessed high competition in the past few years, similar to the European
context. Currently, there are 1,900 hypermarkets, supermarkets and drugstores, which is
400 percent more than in 2005, and this number is projected to rise by 6-7 percent per year,
                       7
reaching 2,600 in 2016. The market share of retail chains in Bulgaria stands at 35 percent at
present and is expected to reach 50 percent in 2014.




5 The largest number of cases in the period 2004-2011 concerned the processing level (28%), retail (25%) and manufacturing
(18 %). With respect to specific food sectors, the largest number of cases concerned cereals; then milk and dairy; followed by fruits/
vegetables, meat, poultry and eggs.
6 Competition authorities have detected horizontal infringements in the form of price fixing, market and customer sharing and
exchanges of confidential information at most levels and for most products investigated, in particular in cereals (processing and
manufacturing) and meat, poultry and eggs (primary production). In practice, this means that authorities have imposed sanctions in
respect of more than 50 cartels in the food industry and are investigating more than 30 further potential cartels.
7 The reasons for the retail market expansion may be: (i) the rising disposable incomes of Bulgarians (growing urban population)
seeking choice and (ii) low prices offered by foreign/domestic chains.
                                                                 19
ADDRESSING UNFAIR TRADING PRACTICES IN BULGARIA

       The presenter emphasized on the three key issues claimed by government authorities
in the debate on UTP in B2B relations, namely:

          yy Small local independent food retailers and local suppliers have not equally
             gained from the expansion as prices have been pushed down.

          yy Large food chain retailers are bargaining hard against small domestic
             producers and suppliers.

          yy That savings from the tough bargaining appear not to be passed on to
             consumers as claimed.

       The CPC has undertaken recently three sector inquiries (dairy products market,
sunflower seed and sunflower oil markets, and wheat and flour markets) to respond to the
issues in the food supply chain. The results:

          yy A cartel was fined for price agreements in the sectors of production and
             distribution of sunflower seeds, processing of seeds, and production and
             trade of sunflower oil.

          yy Bread and pastry producers associations were fined in July 2008 for coordinating
             the pricing policies of their members from 2002 to 2007. In addition to price
             fixing, the practices involved the exchange of sensitive business information,
             namely the collection of data on retail prices, which were disseminated among
             their members with instructions on their respective pricing policies.

          yy Similarly, in Bulgaria, the members of a buyer cartel of dairy processors were
             fined on the basis of national legislation in 2008. In the context of this cartel,
             lasting between 2002 and 2007, associations of processors had agreed on
             purchasing prices for raw milk and exchanged information thereupon. The
             anti-competitive conduct also encompassed the setting of minimum prices for
             white cheese and the exchange of sensitive business information within the
             associations.

      Furthermore, two antitrust cases, related to food retail chains, were launched by the
CPC. After thorough investigation, the following conclusions were made:

          yy Case No.1: Competition law violations for fixing of prices and other commercial
             conditions by some of the largest food retail chains. The authority did not act
             as no dominant position was found.

          yy Case No.2: Some of the major retail chains were implementing common
             mechanisms for coordination of trade policy on the market for the supply of
             goods and of common marketing policy in terms of promotions (violation of
             Art. 15 (1) LPC). The commitment decision obliged the retailers to remove
             some of the clauses in the contracts with their suppliers in order to eliminate
             the existing competition concerns.

       Finally, the CPC found that incidents of UTP are contracting issues that cannot be
addressed from a competition law perspective under existing legislation, unless there is a
finding of dominance. EU and Bulgarian competition legislation provide no remedies to
address such UTP, unless there is a finding of abuse of dominant market position. However,


                                             20
                                                                  PANEL I: SETTING THE STAGE

EU Member States could address instances of UTP through stricter national rules and
the Bulgarian Government chose to introduce rules on “significant market power” in the
national competition legislation.

       After consultations with key stakeholders, conducting a survey, expert opinions
from government institutions and an expert analysis, introducing SMP in the national
competition framework was the recommended option under the Ex Ante Impact
Assessment, commissioned by the Ministry of Economy and Energy in 2011-12. Due to
its superior bargaining power from having relatively large market shares, retailers in the
Bulgarian market, as emphasized by the Ex-Ante Impact Assessment, may impose certain
conditions on suppliers. For example, suppliers, especially of fast-moving consumer goods,
are required to provide certain commercial discounts when delivering goods, accompanied
by numerous other expenses such as extra fees, bonuses, rebates, sanctions, forfeits and
others.

       Retailers often offer relatively low market prices. These lower prices could improve the
economic welfare of the end-consumer. It can also have a positive impact on the suppliers/
producers, motivating them to become more efficient. On the other hand, as the Impact
Assessment claims, pressure in the food supply chain by the retailers could be harmful to
the whole supply chain due to the inability of suppliers and producers to restructure and
optimize in order to respond to the new requirements. In addition, imposing hard bargains
by retailers could drive suppliers and producers out of the market, harming the competitive
environment.

        The Impact Assessment also claims that the local suppliers are treated differently
compared to foreign suppliers. The contracts between retailers and local suppliers for fast-
moving consumer goods are signed for one year only and they involve high entry fees
for inclusion in the list of suppliers. The contracts are individual. There are over 100 fees,
sanctions, bonuses, premiums and others that are imposed by the retailer on the local
producer/supplier. In cases in which the local supplier/producer does not have any control
on the pricing policies of different retailers, they are still subject to sanctions by the retailer
(e.g. suppliers/producers are sanctioned if another retail store has a lower sales price of
their product).

        Finally, the speaker explained that the Ministry of Economy and Energy proposed
in 2012 a draft bill to amend the Law on Protection of Competition. This amendment
introduced the concept of SMP (definition, specification of types of abuses and proposal to
introduce a methodology to assess significant market power). New draft bill was proposed
to the national parliament on March 7, 2014. It is a result of discussions about using the SMP
as a tool to address UTP, which were resumed in mid-2013 under the championship of the
DPM for Economic Development.

ADDRESSING UNFAIR TRADING PRACTICES IN BULGARIA

                                      Contributions from the World Bank

       In this presentation on “Options for Bulgaria in addressing unfair trading practices”, Mr.
Christian Filipov from the World Bank firstly discussed the use of established legal solutions
                                                                              8
to address unfair trading practices (dominance, economic dependence). Then, he spoke
about SMP as the novel solution to address UTP. As in the case of dominance, the SMP
of a company is the ability to influence market competition. However, SMP is not a well-
established instrument under competition law. Moreover, the concept focuses on future
market developments and it is an instrument that is appropriate in sector-specific solutions.

           The following options for Bulgaria were identified during the workshop:

    (i)	     Amend commercial law/sector specific laws: Introduce specific rules prohibiting
           UTP in general commercial and/or sector specific legislation to prevent a buyer from
           threatening or ruining its supplier - for example, impose discriminatory prices, delays
           in payments, or other conditions of sale or purchase. Based on existing EU Directives,
           requirements on standard supplier agreements can be introduced, prescribing
           uniform supplier conditions, delivery and payment terms.

    (ii)	 Opt for market regulation based on SMP analysis: Introduce market regulations
         based on an SMP economic analysis of a specific sector confirming that unrestricted
         competition in the market in question would not be possible due to the presence
         of players with SMP that would behave as dominant players. This was highlighted
         solely to advance the discussion as to the sector-specific nature of SMP solution.

    (iii)	Amend competition law to introduce ‘economic dependence’: Amend competition
          law allow the CPC to apply rules on ‘abuse of market dominance’, in cases where
          dominance is not present, by leveraging the concept of ‘economic dependence’ in
          contractual relations between larger and smaller companies, to treat a firm that
          abuses its superior bargaining position the same as a dominant player who abuses
          its market position. The presenter noted that this is the direction taken by most other
          Member States.

    (iv)	Amend sector-specific laws to introduce ‘SMP’: Amend competition law
         framework to prohibit abuse of SMP based on stricter national rules applicable to
         unilateral conduct of companies. This option requires, as specified by the presenter,
         the competition authority to monitor the market in question, conduct regular sector
         inquiries and collect relevant information concerning supplier-retailer relationships
         etc. (forces the competition authority to act as a quasi-sector regulator). It was clarified
         that implementation is difficult, as SMP is not well defined as a competition law
         instrument at the EU level and internationally.




8 Instruments under dominance - when a firm could behave independently of competitors, suppliers and customers. Instruments under
economic dependence - when one firm is economically dependent on another; allows the application of ‘abuse of market dominance’
in cases where a player that abuses bargaining power does not hold a dominant position in the market. (The concept is applied in
many European countries to non-dominant players with the ability to exercise market power towards SME suppliers, purchasers or
competitors companies).
                                                              22
                                                               PANEL I: SETTING THE STAGE

                                Summary of the Discussion

       Antitrust cases in Bulgaria, related to the food supply chain, underwent a rigorous
analysis for the assessment of non-dominance position. Furthermore, it was specified
during the discussion that market share is the least indicator in the analysis. The discussants
concluded that there is a need to talk about the product and the relevant market when the
relationship between suppliers and retailers is in the focus.

       Then, the debate focused on differences between contractual law and competition law
and also the point was raised that the SMP concept is indeed difficult to define. The following
key question arose; namely, which of the problems can be addressed by contractual law and
what solutions can be addressed by competition law?

       The DPM for Economic Development posed a question on whether there is an
existing trend that more countries have introduced legal interventions to address UTP. Prof.
Kokkoris from the University of Reading (UK) responded that indeed all EU member states
have addressed the issue, either from contractual or from competition perspective. Ms.
Sabine Zigelski, OECD representative, mentioned however, that legal interventions face
also additional problems. The case of Germany is relevant in this respect. The application of
the economic dependence concept has been hardly effective there at all.

       During the discussion, the DPM raised the issue that producers often complain and
show evidence of contracts, which look like an obvious abuse on the side of commercial
chains. And, the suppliers are afraid to submit a complaint at CPC because they will be
pushed back from any contractual relationships with the retail chains.

        At the end of the panel, Mr. Alvaro Gonzalez from the World Bank offered the
economic perspective. He specified that there is a need to focus on the issue of assessment
of market power. More specifically, market power on the negotiating side of the market.
However, the SMP tool is used on the retailer side, not the negotiation side between supplier
and retailer. He pointed out to the case of exercise of the market power between two agents
and that when one does not know anything about the relationship with other suppliers and
retailers, then it should not be deemed as a competition issue. The reason is that competition
works across sectors and it does not solve a contractual relationship between a supplier
and a retailer. This does not mean, however, that the issue should not be addressed, Mr.
Gonzalez specified. But, it means that there may be other tools that can be used to solve the
specific issue.

ADDRESSING UNFAIR TRADING PRACTICES IN BULGARIA

                         PANEL II: EUROPEAN PRACTICES

        The second panel was opened by the moderator, Mr. Kiril Pangelov, representative
of the Bulgarian CPC. He noted that obviously there are problems on the market, connected
to the retailers and their suppliers. How to define the problem and how to design the public
policy to address this problem in the best possible way seems to be still the key issue. If the
issue is not addressed correctly through appropriate measure, then money and resources of
the government will be lost, the moderator pointed out.

        Mr. Pangelov re-emphasized that unfair B2B trading practices is debated in Europe
and most EU countries faced the issue. Some fellow EU Member States adopted specific
legislation, others amended their competition acts, and still others made several further
changes in the legislation. Some other countries are still discussing non-legislative approaches
to address the issues, like self-regulation or information campaigns. The EC also dealt with
this issue, as mentioned earlier. However, the 2009 EC Communication specifically noted
that the unequal bargaining power and the imposition of UTP conditions for food supply
did not necessarily constitute a problem of abuse of buyer power under the competition
law.

       The EC insisted specifically, as the moderator noted, to make a strict separation
between the two concepts. On the one hand, the problem of unequal bargaining position
between private actors is an inter-parties issue. On the other hand, the abuse of superior
bargaining position could be qualified as competition infringement provided that this
behavior affects the very functioning of the market and the consumer’s welfare. So, the EC
recommends that the problems related to B2B practices to be addressed not by the means
of competition law or other law or other means – contract law, commercial law, common
agricultural policies, laws on unfair commercial practices, non-legislative approaches,
appointments of ombudsman, etc.

       The European Competition Network also dealt with the problem of unfair B2B trading
practices. They published a report in May 2012, which found that varying approaches
were applied in Member States but with different degree of effectiveness. Therefore, it was
suggested that further legislative or other outcome of this discussion may have a relevance
to the policies of the EU’s Internal Market and not the Competition policies per se. This was
recognized also by the responses to the EC’s Green paper, which recognized a lot of issues
with the proposed approaches to overcome unfair b2b practices.

        Leading international organizations in the sphere of competition policies –
International Competition Network (ICN), OECD, and UNCTAD also dealt with UTP, as
the moderator clarified. In 2008, the ICN published a report on abuse of superior bargaining
position and concluded that the existing rules are quite different among member states,
depending on their jurisdictions. OECD and UNCTAD drafted several peer reviews of
legislations and assessed the effectiveness of the tools that address unfair B2B practices.
Therefore, two key tasks for the panel were proposed: i) there is a need to clearly define the
problem; ii) there is a need to gather best approaches that exist in other countries.

                                                                                  PANEL II: EUROPEAN PRACTICES

                                           Italian Competition Authority

       To what extent or whether competition agencies should be involved in assessment of
purely contractual issues between actors which is not usual? The response of Mr. Gianluca
Sepe (representative of the Italian Competition Authority) was that, competition authorities
are able and should deal with contractual issues between actors.

        In Italy, the issue of unfair B2B practices has been a key political concern. The Italian
Competition Authority (ICA) undertook a sectoral inquiry to identify and understand
whether if buyers (retail chains) might have market power over their suppliers. Economic
literature defines buyer power as “the ability of a buyer to get from its suppliers better conditions
than those applied to its competitors or expected in a competitive environment.”

         Mr. Sepe posed two key questions in this regard:

              yy What are the effects of buyer power on competition?

              yy What is the role of competition agencies?

        Three elements which strengthen the bargaining position of distributors vis-à-vis
their suppliers were identified, namely: i) Increasing levels of concentration on the demand
side; ii) Buying alliances; iii) The success of private label.

      Comparing short-term positive effects and long-run potential restrictions makes
the competitive assessment of buyer power somewhat ambiguous and difficult, explicitly
pointed out by the presenter. Then, he discussed the antitrust instruments of the ICA. He
concluded that the prosecution of anticompetitive unilateral conduct flowing from buyer
power may prove problematic because:
              yy First of all, one should assess whether the buyer is dominant;
              yy If dominance cannot be established, vertical restraints agreed with suppliers
                 might be assessed under the rules on anticompetitive agreements; and

              yy However, some behavior may not be caught by the scope of application of
                 competition rules.

        Then, the presenter moved on to discussing the ‘abuse of economic dependence’
                               9
concept in the case of Italy. Economic dependence is assessed taking into account; inter
alia, the effective possibility for the aggrieved party to find satisfactory alternatives on
the market. The abuse of economic dependence may also consist in a refusal to deal, the
imposition of unfair or discriminatory trading conditions, or the unlawful breaking off of
existing contractual relations. The ICA may only intervene, as Mr. Sepe pointed out, when
the abuse of economic dependence may have a significant impact on competition and the
market.

      The presenter also shared his views on the ad hoc rules in the food sector which were
introduced in Italy as of January 2012. In all B2B contractual relations the following shall be
prohibited:
              yy Imposing – directly or indirectly – unfair trading conditions, as well as non-
                 contractual retroactive conditions;
9 Economic dependence is defined in Italian law as the situation where an undertaking is able to determine an excessive imbalance of
rights and obligations in its dealings with another undertaking.
                                                                25
ADDRESSING UNFAIR TRADING PRACTICES IN BULGARIA

               yy Applying dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions;

               yy Making the conclusion and the performance of contracts subject to acceptance
                  by the other parties of supplementary obligations which, by their nature or
                  according to commercial usage, have no connection with the subject of such
                  contracts;

               yy Requesting the unilateral performance of additional obligations, not justified
                  by the nature or the content of the relevant contractual relations;

               yy Adopting any other unfair trading conduct.

       According to the presenter, the law brings about a dual system of control, whereby
the ICA’s intervention does not exclude the ability of private parties to bring their claims
before civil courts. Finally, Mr. Sepe spoke about the implementation of new rules. While
the law is silent on this issue, implementing regulations clarify that the new provisions are
meant to be applied in contractual relations where a significant imbalance exists between
the bargaining positions of the parties, as their rationale is the protection of the weaker
party. Such interpretation brings the new rules closer to the abuse of economic dependence,
which also stems from the unlawful exploitation of a superior bargaining position.

       Competition agencies may prove well-equipped to enforce rules against contractual
abuses, as they are most likely to ensure the proper balancing of the public interest to the
correct functioning of the market which underpins such provisions, with the competition
principles. This conclusion may hold true in particular when competition agencies are
already called to enforce diverse sets of legislation, including consumer protection or unfair
competition laws, such as in the case of the Italian Competition Authority.

                                Czech Office for the Protection of Competition

       The representative of the Czech Competition Office, Mr. Petr Gajdusek, started his
presentation going back to the early 1990s with the opening of the economy and the first
economic reforms, which enabled the entry of many retail chains. He further explained
that supermarkets and hypermarkets that prevail today in the Czech Republic started a
                                              10
fierce competition sometimes in mid-1990s. He noted also that a Price Act is available
in the Czech context since early 1990s that regulates the prices on the market. The rapid
development of retail chains have caused a lot of complaints, submitted by suppliers for
unfair B2B trading practices. No retail chain has a dominant position in the Czech Republic
and no ‘middle ground’ to solve the issue existed.

        The debate on including provisions in the Act on Protection of Competition started
in late 1990s. However, no provisions were adopted, although there were several concrete
proposals. In 2009, a new sector law was enacted, introducing SMP in the sale of agricultural
and food products. The Czech Competition Office (CCO) was not involved in the debates
which followed the adoption of the SMP. It was approved and came into force in 2010.
The Act regulates so many retail chains in the Czech Republic but leaves the supply side
completely deregulated The CCO was mandated to enforce SMP, besides other standard
competition responsibilities.

10 The definition of supermarket in the Czech law is as follows: a store with a retail space of up to 2,500 sq.m. Hypermarket is a store
which exceeds this. Currently, the Czech rep. is the largest retail space in terms of per capita. 26 hypermarkets are available on each 1
million inhabitants.
                                                                  26
                                                                                     PANEL II: EUROPEAN PRACTICES

        The presenter pointed out that the CCO does not analyze each and every relationship
between the retailer and suppliers but takes an absolute position. That is to say, they define
a retailer to have an SMP position and they focus at the absolute level. The reason is that
they could not analyze all interactions in the food supply chain. The authority introduced
also a list of prohibited abusive practices under the SMP Act. The CCO has also developed
a methodology how to assess SMP.

       In February 2010, the first sector inquiry was initiated. The CCO examined the
relationship between retailers and suppliers, terms and conditions, and system of rebates,
among others. The inquiry concluded that the retail chains abused their SMP towards their
suppliers in the negotiating terms of conditions with the suppliers. For example, a problem
was identified - retailers asked for fees for which they provided no services and they also set
too long periods of payment between 60 and 90 days, without any reason.

       The adoption of the SMP Act led to removal of some UTP. In 2011, the Czech
Government decided to amend competition legislation based on the SMP Act. There was a
huge debate in the competition office for the introduction of new provisions in the competition
law framework. The result is that the CCO was mandated to draft the amendments to the
Act on Protection of Competition, and drafting work is still ongoing.

         At the end of the presentation, Mr. Gajdusek spoke about other instruments used
under the SMP Act, like advocacy tools and dynamic discussions that focus on prevention. He
also mentioned about the LIDL case, which demonstrated a typical abuse. LIDL prolonged
the payment period from 60 to 90 days without explanation. The suppliers argued that there
is an infringement of the contractual freedom, which invokes constitutional issues. The case
is still subject to proceedings.

                                         Hungarian Competition Authority

        Dr. Marton Kocsis, Case Handler, Antitrust Section, Hungarian Competition
Authority, made a presentation on “Buyer Power – Legal Background and Case Law in
Hungary”. He gave Hungary’s legal background pointing to the regular competition rules
                         12
in the Competition Act.11 The presenter echoed the most relevant question - not how the
legislation was developed but whether it worked effectively.

       The Hungarian representative said that Hungary has experienced similar problems
as in Bulgaria, regarding relationship between foreign retailers and local suppliers. On the
one hand, the entry of large retail chains led to the reduction of the end-price for consumers.
On the other hand, this meant difficulties for producers/suppliers but also for starting
farmers who are a very important group in Hungary.

        SMP was introduced in the Act on Trade in 2005. The legal text was drafted by the
legislator, the Competition Authority was also involved during the drafting. SMP was
introduced because the retail chains at the time did not have a dominant position (Art. 102),
but are still too strong players.13


11 Art. 21. equivalent of Art. 102 TFEU; the Act CLXIV of 2005 on Trade.
12 Art. 21. equivalent of Art. 102 TFEU; the Act CLXIV of 2005 on Trade.
13 A lower threshold than dominance was introduced in the Hungarian case: „Significant buyer power vis-á-vis suppliers exists where
the consolidated net turnover derived from commercial activities of the group of undertakings in question, including all the parent
companies and subsidiaries under Act C of 2000 on Accounting or, for the case of joint purchasing, all the undertakings establishing the
purchasing association in the previous year (hereinafter: “the consolidated net turnover”) was higher than HUF 100 billion.”
                                                                  27
ADDRESSING UNFAIR TRADING PRACTICES IN BULGARIA

      All retail chains, as a result of the threshold, were caught within the SMP threshold,
which identified several practices of abuse14.

        As related to the procedure, the Hungarian representative pointed out that it is
regulated by the rules of the Hungarian Competition Act on the prohibition on the abuse
of dominant position. Moreover, pursuant to Article 75 of the Hungarian Competition Act,
commitments binding on the parties are offered. Mr. Kocsis confirmed that the commitment
tool is a very useful one.

       The presenter conveyed the following two examples of case law for abuse of market
power, which were initiated due to several complaints from suppliers. All undertakings
concerned offered a commitment to modify, and bring in compliance with the Competition
Act and the Act on Trade, their respective supplier contracts. The second case he offered
was the SPAR case. In 2010, the Competition authority initiated an investigation to find out
whether SPAR has breached Article 7 of the Act on Trade, when it forced its bonus system
on suppliers in its contracts. The conclusion was that SPAR only distributed products, when
the suppliers have agreed to pay a bonus to SPAR. However, the Competition Authority
ascertained that SPAR has abused its market power when it enforced the bonus-system
(unilaterally and without any benefit for the supplier) on its suppliers, and therefore
infringed the Act on Trade. The fine was 50.000.000 HUF (ca. 170.000 €) and SPAR had to
change their contracts with suppliers. However the case is still pending before the courts,
after SPAR decided to apply against the decision of the Competition Authority.

       The presenter reviewed also the 2009 Unfair Distribution Practices Act. Some sector-
specific rules (e.g. prohibition of verbal contract, the right to unilaterally change the contract
in favor of the retailer, etc.) were introduced in Hungary and the enforcer became the
National Food Chain Safety Office (NFCSO), applicable to food and agriculture products.
Thus, clear separation was made, as de facto, the NFCSO has to suspend its investigation
when the Competition authority launches proceeding based on the Competition Act or on
                    15
the Act on Trade.




14 An abuse, in particular, consist in:
a) unjustifiably discriminating against suppliers.
b) unjustifiably restricting suppliers access to sales opportunities.
c) imposing unfair conditions on suppliers, which result in a distribution of risks one-sidedly benefiting the dealer (devaluate the costs
of the retailer to the supplier).
d) unjustifiably altering contract terms, to the detriment of the suppliers, after 	 concluding the contract.
e) subjecting future business relations of the dealer with the suppliers to conditions, in particular stipulating or retrospectively enforcing
the application of a most-favorable-conditions clause.
f) charging fees one-sidedly to suppliers (especially to get into the assortment of the retailer).
g) threatening with termination of the agreement (delisting) with the intention to enforce one-sidedly beneficial contractual terms.
h) unjustifiably forcing suppliers to avail themselves of third persons as suppliers or of an own service provider of the dealer
i) applying sales prices, in cases in which the dealer is not the owner of the goods, which are lower than the invoice prices determined
in its contracts.
15 From 1st of August 2012, the Act on Trade can only be enforced in the non-food sector by the Competition Authority. Regarding

                                 Summary of the Discussion

        The panel discussion evolved around the SMP criterion. According to the
representative of the Italian Competition Authority, it creates more problems than it solves.
It was discussed that in the Czech case, absolute terms are used, which does not seem to be
favorable because one applies rules to prevent practices of future market position that may
not create a balance today, but may do so in the mid-term. In this case, no fairness issues
are treated in the case of LIDL that was given as an example by the Czech representative.
For example, the Italian representative stressed that payment delays by retailers could be
viewed as a form of discount offered by suppliers. The supplier is obliged or willingly
colludes with the buyer. Some suppliers would argue that this is fine with them because it
provides competitive leverage against competitors - other suppliers. Those suppliers that
are strong on the market can provide discounts to retailers in the case of prolonged payment.
An unclear assessment of SMP risks creating more problems and may result in distorting
competition. Therefore, it is best to clearly specify criteria for assessment of UTP.

      The panel discussion can be summarized as follows: firstly, all presenter countries offer
a set of rules, adapted to address unfair B2B practices. Secondly, all rules are not regarded as
stricter national competition laws, but some they come from other branches of the national
law i.e., commercial or sector specific legislation. Thirdly, all rules are designed to protect the
weaker parties in the contract relationship, but the competition authority has a mandate to
intervene in cases where there is sufficient public interest affected by the respective behavior,
(which results in very few examples of successful case law) and these rules do not seem to be
effective at the national level. Fourthly, the drafting of the legislation related to UTP was not
in the hands of competition authorities in Italy and the Czech Republic. Still, they took part
in the drafting of secondary legislation (in the case of Italy), while the Czech Competition
Office is engaged in drafting the amendments to the competition law framework. Finally,
competition agencies may be better placed to respond to contractual relationships. Their
intervention would allow for more harmonious enforcement of the rules on competition.
However, a competition agency cannot apply the law in each and every case where there is
unequal bargaining position.

ADDRESSING UNFAIR TRADING PRACTICES IN BULGARIA

           PANEL III: THE LEGAL AND ECONOMIC ARGUMENTS

       The final panel presented the legal and economic arguments that would support the
use of the SMP concept in the competition policy framework of Bulgaria. It was moderated
by Ms. Boryana Shotekova, representative of the Bulgarian CPC. She introduced the issues
related to legal and economic arguments. The contribution from UNCTAD was included in
this panel.

                              Contributions from UNCTAD

       The representative from UNCTAD, Mr. Hasan Qaqaya, Head of Competition and
Customer Policies, pointed out the need to understand the nature of the public policy problem
that is the aim of this initiative. He noted the conflation of terms between competition,
competitiveness, dominance, unfair bargaining, trading practices and abuse.

        The emphasis on the importance of good public policy definition was made with a
series of examples from around the world where good intentions lead to poor results. The
case of Armenia seemed to be the most pertinent where, like in Bulgaria, the government
used the competition policy framework to address unfair trading practices in cases where
buyers use their superior bargaining position to extract unfair deals from their suppliers.
Effectively, the implementation of the policy in Armenia turned the competition authority
into a price regulator, examining the details of contracts between buyers deemed, and listed,
to have significant market power and their supplier. In addition, to adding a mandate not
in line with its previous responsibilities, this policy distracted the Armenian competition
authority from the more impactful work of mergers and antitrust enforcement.

                              Contributions from the OECD

        The participant from the OECD, Ms. Sabine Zigelski, emphasized that implementation
of competition law instruments always faces difficult theoretical and practical obstacles that
are general to all competition policy issues, but are particularly ‘thorny’ with respect to
the new concept of ‘significant market power’. She introduced old and new concepts used
to determine the definition of markets, market power, and abuse, noting that even in the
best of circumstances it is hard to interpret findings unequivocally. Detection, measurement
and remedying harm to competition all pose serious challenges. The OECD emphasized
damages which competition authorities could do in applying remedies to firms and markets
that either the market would better address in the longer-term, or could be features of an
evolving market or could be demonstrating more complex market adaptations that need
closer scrutiny.

       After demonstrating difficulties in the application and interpretation of the concepts
that are part and parcel of the competition policy framework, the OECD representative
addressed the particular issues surrounding the assessment of buyer power. This category
of market power is even harder to assess and markets with large buyers have to be examined
very carefully from all sides and cannot be unambiguously interpreted as anti-competitive.

                                      PANEL III: THE LEGAL AND ECONOMIC ARGUMENTS

               Contribution from a professor at the University of Reading

        Prof. Ioannis Kokkoris, legal expert and professor of law from the University of
Reading (UK), presented arguments in support of the use of the SMP concept to remedy UTP
stemming from the abuse of superior bargaining position of non-dominant firms. In addition,
the professor presented a series of concerns about changes to priorities, effectiveness and
resource requirements that would need to be addressed to make the competition authority
effective if given the authority to address UTP.

     Principles set out the factors that must be taken into consideration in deciding
whether to take a case forward; namely:

   •	 Impact: what would be the likely effect (direct or indirect) on consumer welfare in
      the market or sector where intervention takes place?

   •	 Strategic significance: does the work tie-in with the Competition Authority strategy
      as set out in the annual plan and/or with other objectives?

   •	 Risks: what is the likelihood of a successful outcome?

   •	 Resources: what are the resource implications to the Competition Authority of doing
      the work?

       Using the examples of other countries, such as the France, Germany and the UK, the
professor answered each of these questions. In Germany, where the competition authority
has been most explicit about remedying unfair bargaining practices of large buyers against
small companies, the number of cases has been limited. However, the cases have been
substantial. Most importantly, all of these countries have made it a priority to address these
cases, putting together the requisite legal framework, as well as staff and resources as to not
distract the competition authorities from their core functions.

       Lastly, the professor stressed the need to provide resources for new mandates. He
stressed the need not to distract the competition authority from its core functions and not to
stretch current resources, but the need to add to these resources if new responsibilities were
going to be added to the authority’s portfolio.

                            Contribution from the World Bank

        Mr. Alvaro Gonzalez from the World Bank pointed out in his presentation that
the strength of the competition policy framework is its specificity. At the same time, the
framework’s specificity means that it can be unwieldy if it is used to address policy issues
outside of its scope. For this reason, careful consideration about the appropriateness of
this framework to the public policy concern is recommended. One test of how well the
competition policy framework can address the issue of concern is to use the direction the EC
provided on the use of economic theory to guide how competition policy assessments should
be carried out. More specifically, the presenter questioned whether SMP could effectively
and clearly address UTP considering that when buyers are alleged to use their superior
bargaining position to extract unfair deals from their weaker placed suppliers corresponds
to economic theory.

ADDRESSING UNFAIR TRADING PRACTICES IN BULGARIA

        The World Bank emphasized the EC 2008 Guidance Paper on how to implement
                                           16
and enforce provisions under Article 102. The Paper places significant emphasis on an
‘effects-based approach’ to identify which unilateral actions from dominant entities should
be of concern to the competition authorities. The effects-based approach stresses the need
for corrective action when abusive action harms consumers; however, if unilateral action
is deemed to harm competitors, this may not be sufficient grounds on which to apply
corrective measures.

        The World Bank contribution pointed out that the GoB’s proposal to amend the
competition policy framework presents serious conceptual challenges. It first relies on the
concept of SMP which needs to be clear, predictable and objective if enforcement is to be
effective. Distinctions between ‘significant’ and other levels of market power need to be
clarified, for example. In addition, in buyer-seller relations, it is unclear how market power
in the downstream market is leveraged in the upstream market—where the alleged abuse is
taking place. The terms ‘abuse’, ‘unfair’, and ‘superior bargaining position’, among others,
also require greater clarity. Based on the guidance from the EC, clarification of these terms
and concepts would be best if they are based on sound economic theory. Economic theory
would support these concepts in cases that are extremely narrow and specific—specific
enough to conclude that the case of public policy interest in Bulgaria would likely not apply.

                                           Summary of the Discussion

        The UNCTAD representative emphasized the need for careful thought to guarantee
that the proposed instrument of intervention would fit the nature of the problem that
legitimately concerns the GoB, whereas the OECD encouraged the government to proceed
with great care and to be cognizant of the fact that the remedies found in any competition
policy framework can be powerful, but when misapplied, damaging. The professor of
law from the University of Reading stressed that the GoB has legal authority to address
UTP under Article 102 of the TFEU. Moreover, he argued that some of the methodological
issues that had been mentioned by others were being addressed by many other EU member
states. Bulgaria was not alone in this. Finally, the World Bank summarized the messages
of implementation challenges that the OECD intervention emphasized and the need for
problem definition that the UNCTAD contribution stressed.

                                                  INTRODUCTION

       The Government of Bulgaria is concerned that large buyers may be using their
size and superior bargaining position to dictate the terms of contractual relations with
their suppliers. The Government argues that because some of these terms are onerous to
suppliers, this constitutes unfair trading practices (UTP).

       These concerns have translated into a proposal to address these unfair trading
practices by amending the competition policy framework. The rationale for addressing UTP
from a competition law perspective is that the prevalence of such practices could potentially
harm competition in a specific market, as well have negative impact on consumers.

      There are some issues to address before this proposal can be implemented.
European Union (EU) competition legislation, does not address contractual relations between
businesses even if these are based on unfair terms. At the same time, EU law does allow
Member States, like Bulgaria, to set national rules. Using this authority, the Government
of Bulgaria (GoB) is considering to introduce the concept of ‘significant market power’
(SMP) into the competition legislation. However, any proposal to change the competition
framework would be best aligned to the principles and guidelines provided by the EU on
how to enforce competition policy.

       The Bulgarian Commission for Protection of Competition (CPC) has reservations
about introducing SMP to the Law on Protection of Competition (LPC). The CPC does
not endorse the introduction of the SMP as proposed in the draft bill (see Annex 3).17
The key arguments expressed by the CPC against this proposal are that: (i) the tools and
methodologies to survey and assess market power of in the context of dominance in the
relevant market are not appropriate for assessing SMP; (ii) the concept of SMP needs to be
understood and implemented under the notion of ’economic dependence’, rather than a
concept similar to market dominance; and (iii) the forms of abuse that are identified in the
draft bill are not aligned with CPC’s capabilities to assess market dynamics.

       Recognizing the need to address the unresolved issues, the GoB asked the World
Bank to provide analytical services to better indentify available policy options. The Deputy
Prime Minister (DPM) for Economic Development, who championed the discussions since
mid-2013, asked the World Bank to provide knowledge and advisory support to review
European policy and legal practices and clarify the technical issues in the area of UTP and
the possible application of SMP within the competition policy framework.

       In response, the World Bank is providing a review of approaches applied by fellow
EU Member States to address UTPs within and outside the competition policy framework.
The GoB could consider these in designing its own proposals to address UTP. Section I,
presents the EU context and the European Commission (EC) initiatives, whereas Section
II looks at the Bulgarian context and how it is aligned with EC policy. Emphasis is placed
on particular issues in the B2B relationships that are of primary concern to Government
authorities.



17 The Bulgarian CPC opposed to the introduction of the SMP concept in the way as it was presented in the draft bill, prepared under
the mandate of the previous government. Several official CPC decisions have identified the key constraints of the draft proposal, see
Decisions No.495/04.05.2010, No.815/13.07.2010, No.338/18.03.2011, No.716/27.06.2012, and No.1090/25.09.2012. CPC came out
with a Decision 386/19.03.2014 as a result of a bill, submitted to parliament on 7.03.2014.
                                                                35
ADDRESSING UNFAIR TRADING PRACTICES IN BULGARIA

        Section III offers a review of selected EU policies that address UTP by focusing first on
EU rules through the prism of the competition law concepts of ‘dominant market position’,
‘significant market power’ and ‘economic dependence'. Then, the approaches used to
address UTP practices in Germany, France, Italy, Czech Republic, and Hungary among
others, are discussed. Based on these examples, Section VI offers a ‘menu’ of six options
for Bulgaria. Finally, the paper concludes that solutions to address UTP would need to
be designed comprehensively, leveraging simultaneously government policies, economic
analysis and legal tools.

                                                          EU RULES

       There is a public policy debate across EU on UTP in the local buyer-supplier
relationship. EU Member States have taken different policy actions to protect against
UTP in the local buyer-supplier relationship at the national level.18 Most Member States
adopted special sector legislation while others put in place codes of conduct.19 There is also
a difference in the scope of interventions, as some EU Member States applied these rules
across all sectors.20

         Recent regulatory efforts at the EU level address this topic as well, but specifically
in the retail food sector. The EC issued a communication on “A Better Functioning of
Food Supply Chain in Europe” (COM 2009/591).21 In this communication, the EC states
“contractual imbalances associated with unequal bargaining power have a negative impact on the
competitiveness of the food supply chain as smaller but efficient actors may be obliged to operate
under reduced profitability, limiting their ability and incentives to invest in improved product
quality and innovation of production processes.” Moreover, the EC’s Directorate General (DG)
for Competition carried out a survey through a series of informal discussions in 2009 with
different associations in the sector to discuss the European food supply chain. The outcome
of the consultations is best expressed in the following conclusion: “Competition at the retail
level is fierce and margins are low, which results in better prices for consumers”.

        Given that food supply chains are national in nature, the EC started working
closely with national competition authorities to understand better how they function.
The EC collaboration with the national competition authorities is carried out within the
framework of the European Competition Network (ECN). National competition authorities
launched investigations (case by case) of actors in the food supply chain and conducted
inquiries regarding the food markets.22 On July 5, 2010, the EC adopted a Retail Market
Monitoring report (IP/10/885) that identifies key issues that potentially hamper more
efficient and fairer retail services within the Internal Market. On July 30 2010, the EC also set
up a High Level Forum for a Better Functioning Food Supply Chain. In 2011, the European
Parliament adopted a resolution on a more efficient and fairer retail market (2010/2109/
INI), (see Box 1).




18 The focus on the food sector at the EU level has been intensified since the food price crisis broke out in 2007. From mid-2007
to mid-2008, agricultural commodity prices rose sharply, which resulted in increased consumer prices. Since then, prices of many
commodities have come down to levels even lower than 2007 but consumer food prices have continued to increase and only started
declining in mid-2009. This raised concerns about the functioning of the food supply chain. In particular, some retail chains have set
unilateral terms and conditions on business partners. Hence, allegations and accusations of UTP started to come out in EU member
states.
19 Czech Republic, Hungary, and Italy adopted laws that cover UTP in the agro-food sector, for instance. Ireland, Germany, Romania
and Hungary have taken initiatives as well.
20 In France, provisions of the commercial law address UTP across the board to all B2B relations. It is relevant to note that there is
a distinction between the use of competition law and laws aimed at preventing unfair trading practices. For instance, it is claimed that
unfair trading rules regulate the contractual relationship between companies, see Regulation 1/2003 of the implementation of the rules
on competition laid down in Art.101 and Art.102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) formerly Art. 81 and
Art. 82 of the EC Treaty.

Box 1: Concerns of the European Parliament about dominance by bigger actors in the food supply
chain
 The European Parliament resolution…
 26. Reaffirms that free and fair competition, freedom of contract and proper enforcement
 of relevant legislation are key to a well-functioning retail market;
 27. Recognizes that companies have different market power, that they need to act in an
 economically sound way and that the EU needs economic champions to compete glob-
 ally;
 28. Stresses, however, that there is widespread concern about market dominance by big-
 ger actors, who are often perceived to impose unfair terms on weaker suppliers and re-
 tailers, for instance through unjustified mechanisms of selective distribution, geographi-
 cal segmentation, price control, delisting without notice, and other restrictive practices,
 thereby distorting competition; underlines that the entire retail supply chain is affected
 by such practices; denounces practices that misuse power imbalance between economic
 actors and affect true freedom of contract; stresses that raising all actors’ awareness of
 their contractual rights, especially [small and medium enterprises] SMEs, would contrib-
 ute to preventing these practices.

       Principles of Good Practices have been proposed for B2B relationships. In end-2011,
principles of Good Practices have been proposed by the core group of the B2B platform on
“Vertical Relationships in the Food Supply Chain”, which contributes also to the High Level
Forum for a Better Functioning Food Supply Chain. 23 Among these principles, one finds
that imposing general terms and conditions that contain unfair clauses is not acceptable, as
well as unilateral termination of a commercial relationship without notice, or subject to an
unreasonably short notice period and without an objectively justified reason (for example,
on the grounds that unilateral sales targets are not reached).

       Food Task Force and Green Paper on UTP were launched as well. Food Task Force
was set up January 2012 within DG Competition to better focus on the developments in the
agri-food industry. Furthermore, the EC published a Green Paper on UTP in the B2B food
and non-food supply chain in Europe in end-January 2013.24 In this context, the EC conducted
over 200 consultations with business associations, government agencies, competition
authorities, consultancy groups, academia and experts, which were made public.25

                                             BULGARIAN CONTEXT

       An ex ante Impact Assessment on the proposed amendments to the LPC was
prepared in 2012.26 Consultations with key stakeholders, a survey, a collection of expert
opinions from government institutions, and expert analysis were basis of the conducting
an ex-ante Impact Assessment of the proposed amendments to the LPC. The Ministry of
Economy and Energy (MEE) championed this work with the support of a local consultancy
firm.

       The Impact Assessment identified problem areas in the buyer-supplier relationships
in Bulgaria. Due to its superior bargaining power, stemming from their relatively large
market shares, some large buyers in the Bulgarian market can unilaterally impose contractual
obligations on their suppliers. For example, some suppliers may be required to provide
certain commercial discounts when delivering goods in addition to incurring extra fees,
bonuses, rebates, sanctions, forfeits and other expenses.

       Large buyers often offer relatively low market prices but these may come at a cost
to competition. On one hand, lower prices could lead to better conditions for the consumer
and could have a positive impact on the suppliers/producers, by motivating them to
become more efficient. On the other hand, as the Impact Assessment claims, the pressure
by the large buyers could be harmful to the whole supply chain. Suppliers and producers
may be unable to restructure and optimize in such a short time frame to respond to the new
requirements. In addition, imposing hard bargains by retailers could drive suppliers and
producers out of the market, harming competition in the supplier market.

        In sum, the Impact Assessment found a number of UTP by large buyers in Bulgaria.
The CPC, in their own review, found that some contracts between retailers and local suppliers
for fast-moving consumer goods are signed for one year only and are associated with high
entry fees for inclusion in the list of suppliers. Among the identified problems are delays in
payments by the retailers, supplementary discounts are required, fees for TV commercials,
branding, birthday, opening of new site, reconstruction of site and merchandizing are
imposed.27 Also even though local supplier/producers do not have control on the pricing
policies of different retailers, they have been sanctioned by the retailer if another retail store
has a lower sales price for their product.

        In light of these findings, the Government of Bulgaria decided to act. Its policy aim
is to balance the relationship between local suppliers/producers and large buyers. A solution
was designed in 2012 under the leadership of MEE. This solution introduced SMP, to be
applied across all sectors, by amending the LPC. A corresponding draft bill was submitted
to Parliament on March 7, 2014, introducing significant changes to the competition policy
framework and to the responsibilities of the CPC (Annex 3) and defining SMP as follows:
“Significant market power has an undertaking which is not dominant, but in consideration of its
market share, financial resources, opportunities for market access, technological development and
commercial relations with other undertakings, could prevent competition on the respective market,
when its supplier or customers are dependent on it.”

27 In fact, there are over 100 fees, sanctions, bonuses, premiums and others that are imposed by the retailer on the local producer/
supplier.

                                                       European Union
       There is no straightforward answer to the question which is the most appropriate
legal instrument to address UTP.28 It is a complex matter as unfair practices are essentially
an issue of contract negotiation between businesses. Any attempt to balance the relationship
between buyers and suppliers through legal means could limit the contracting freedom of
the parties. Furthermore, the economic welfare outcomes of balancing this relationship are
unclear. Large buyers may in fact be pushing the most costly and least innovative suppliers
out of business and creating a more efficient supply chain. Improving these efficiencies will
ultimately benefit consumers. For that reason, public policy would do well not to block this
competitive dynamic.

       The decision to frame UTP as a competition policy issue is not obvious. There is
a myriad of available options for designing legal instruments to address UTP, including
through market regulation of a specific sector,29 as a commercial law instrument, or
alternatively as instruments under the competition law framework. Competition law also
does not provide a direct answer as to the most appropriate instrument: there are arguments
in support of addressing UTP from both the anticompetitive, as well as from the unfair
competition perspectives; also there are various options for addressing UTP under either
perspective.

        The EU has yet to provide guidance on how to frame this issue. The EU may
provide guidance by adopting EU-wide rules on UTP in B2B relations in the near future:
“It is understood that there are other commercial practices which, although not harming consumers,
may hurt competitors and business customers. The European Commission should carefully examine
the need for Community action in the field of unfair competition and, if necessary, make a legislative
proposal to cover these other aspects of unfair competition.”30 However, such overarching rules
have not been adopted so far.

        The lack of uniform EU rules addressing UTP in B2B relations adds to the
complexity of the issue. Exsiting EU competition rules are not justified31 unless there is a
direct negative impact on the fuctioning of the Internal Market or affect consumers.32 EU
competition law addresses some instances of UTP,33 but “on the whole, a company confronted
with unfair trading practices by a business partner is not able to benefit from consistent protection
across the EU.”34
28 UTP should not be confused with unfair competition practices i.e., practices such as fraud, bribery, espionage, misrepresentation,
etc. These are not necessarily related to the existence of a dominant position of a business in a certain market.
29 Market regulation is noted solely as a theoretical construct. Free market competition is a simple and efficient means of guaranteeing
consumers the best choice in terms of quality and price of goods and services, and also forces firms to strive for economic efficiency
and innovation. For a detailed discussion, see EC (2012).
30 Directive 2005/29/EC, Recital 8a
31 The EU level rules on anticompetitive practices must be differentiated from competition rules that could address business to
business practices under competition law. Many EU countries, including Austria, have adopted rules in their competition framework
that defines dominance in a situation where a company has a superior position on the market vis-à-vis its suppliers or customers. Such
national rules apply when affected suppliers or customers are dependent on the maintenance of business relations with this company
in order to avoid very heavy financial losses (See Art. 4 (3) Austrian Cartel Act and discussion further in this Note on examples from
Germany, Italy etc.). These competition rules explicitly incorporate the concept of economic dependence in its definition of a dominant
market position and in different Member State jurisdictions that apply to various sides of the market (suppliers/customer or both), which
allows Competition Authorities to address “abuse of superior bargaining position” in B2B relations as an abuse of dominant position.
32 These rules, as defined under the Articles 101 and 102 of the TFEU, apply only to agreements between businesses that “are capable
of having an appreciable effect on trade between Member States.” See, EC (2012).
33 For this reason the European Commission is addressing unfair trading practices on a sector by sector basis, for example the dairy
sector, fisheries and aquaculture sector.

                                                                  40

        To fill this gap, several EU Member States adopted national legislation addressing
instances of UTP as abuse of buyer power. They have done so by taking advantage of EU
law,35 allowing stricter rules at the national level. The adopted rules leverage concepts such
as ‘economic dependence’or abuse of ‘significant market power’ in B2B relations.36

      A review of the national legislation adopted by other EU Member States to address
UTP in B2B relations is provided in this document. The aim of this review is to provide the
Bulgarian Government a ‘menu of options’ to be considered in designing their own specific
national rules on this matter.

                                                  Unfair Trading Practices

       UTP diminishes a company’s ability to negotiatiate mutually acceptable contractual
terms. These practices also erode the foundation for fair and constructive business
partnerships and market efficiency.37 ‘Big buyers’ at times introduce different contractual
terms and conditions to suppliers for essentially the same transaction; or impose additional,
unrelated obligations as a condition to conclude a contract, or require payment of unrelated
fees and charges for services, enforce contract changes retroactively, etc. (see, Box 2). For this
reason the abusive behavior of ‘big buyers’ towards suppliers is debated in many countries
across the globe.

       At the same time, unrestrained competition rewards the most efficient and
innovative companies. When commercially successful, companies grow into powerful
market players or the leaders of markets. Based on the innovative products and services
that they create, they gain market share and market power. Becoming a powerful market
player38 also gives a company the ability to influence competition or to use its ‘buyer power’
to shape business relationships in its favor. Policy makers must keep in mind that some of
that market power has been gained by being successfully responding to consumer needs. As
long as consumers benefit, caution would best govern interventions into that process. The
balance is delicate and fragile.




35 Art. 3, Regulation 1/2003.
36 For detailed discussion see, Kokkoris, I. (2010).
37 In 2011, the EC proposed a Common European Sales Law (COM (2011) 635); one of its aims is protecting SME against unilaterally
imposed unfavourable conditions and imposes mandatory provisions to ensure a fair balance between the interests of both businesses,
such as the duty to act in good faith and fair dealing; not individually negotiated contract terms are to be considered unfair if these are
significantly different from good commercial practices; if prices are set by one party only, and these are grossly unreasonable, then
payable would be prices normally charged in smilar transactions. For details see, EC (2013b).
38 Market power provides one party with a favourable bargaining position and opens the possibility for it to behave unfairly. Some
companies, however, have only “limited” or “transitory” market power and can only exert their influence over short periods of time or
in specific product segments. But when the economic power of a company within a certain market endures over time, this market power
could be significant enough to allow the company to maintain prices above the competitive level, and/or restrict output or quality below
competitive levels without the associated reductions in sales or losses in profitability.
                                                                   41
ADDRESSING UNFAIR TRADING PRACTICES IN BULGARIA

Box 2: Market Power

       In perfect competition, firms are price-takers and the profit acquired by them is
 normal profit, which just about ensures a rate of return on investment commensurate
 with the risks taken. No economic profit is earned in this situation; normal profits are the
 maximum these firms are able to achieve and these are determined by the market price.
 In contrast, the perfect monopolist is able to set its price level and will choose to raise it
 so as to maximize its profits. A monopolist’s profit exceeds that earned by sellers in a
 perfectly competitive market, and includes economic profit in addition to normal profit.
 In this context, the ability to raise price above competitive levels is of key importance; it is
 known as market power. Market power is a firm’s ability not to reject the market price, and
 instead set its prices above the competitive benchmark. To be more precise, a firm with
 market power is able to maintain a price that is substantially higher than the competitive
 price, on a long-term basis, without making losses.
 Source: Hungarian Competition Authority, May, 2007.


       Imposing contractual terms and conditions on busness partners becomes ‘unfair’
when the party with the ‘weaker’ bargaining position cannot afford to reject the imposed
terms.39 This is most often the case when small businesses have no other outside options and
are forced to accept unilaterally imposed terms. Sometimes even larger suppliers cannot
afford to switch over to another business partner (demand or supply substitution) 40 due
to high costs asociated with switching-over or in cases where switching-over is not an
alternative at all.41

       Agreements containing terms42 typically assocated with UTP violate EU rules
on anti-competitive practices. These specifically prohibit all agreements that “apply
dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with other trading parties, thereby placing them
at a competitive disadvantage;” or “make the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the
other parties of supplementary obligations which, by their nature or according to commercial usage,
have no connection with the subject of such contracts.”43 Prohibited also are ‘abuse of superior
bargaining position’ in contract negotiations, imposing contract terms retroactively.




39 Businesses with a ‘weaker’ bargaining position agree to unfavorable terms for various reasons. Overall, the motivation is led by
the perception, or certainty, that the relationship with such a “stronger” party, despite being built upon unfavorable and unballanced
contractual terms, is the precondition for pursuing a business opportunity or for entering a new market and in certain cases even for
staying in business.
40 The inability to switch to another business partner and to terminate the existing relationship is one of the core concerns associated
with UTP, specifically when the ‘weaker’ party has no alternative than to deal with an ‘abusive’ partner. The matter is further complicated
as the ‘weaker’ party in the equation often fears that the commercial relationship could be terminated in the event of a complaint on its
part. This ‘fear factor’ makes such complaints significantly less likely and is therefore one of the most important issues to be examined
when assessing the appropriateness of an enforcement mechanism. See EC (2013b).
41 This places the other party in a favourable bargaining position and opens the possibility for it to behave unfairly. The inability to
switch to another business partner and to terminate the existing relationship is a key factor in the development of UTP. In addition,
the weaker party often fears that the commercial relationship could be terminated in the event of a complaint on its part. This ‘fear
factor’ makes such complaints significantly less likely to occur and is therefore one of the most important issues to be examined when
assessing the appropriateness of an enforcement mechanism (See, EC 2013b).
42 Generally, contracts do not cover all aspects of the parties’ behaviour in the phase of the execution of the contract or are so complex
that the parties do not fully understand what the terms imply in practice. Moreover, parties might not have the same level of information
about the transaction, which may lead to unfair conduct by the stronger party towards a weaker counterpart. For detailed discussions
see, EC (2013).

     To approach UTP, a contractual issue, from a competition law perspective fellow
Member States leveraged concepts, such as ‘dominant market position’, ‘significant
market power’ and ‘economic dependence.’

                              The Concept of Dominant Market Position

       The application of competition rules on abuse of dominant position is relevant in
the context of abuse of superior bargaining position (See, box 3), specifically, with respect to
potential abusive behavior of large buyers towards smaller, economically weaker suppliers.
However, as the finding of market dominance is a condition precedent to applying the rules
on abuse of dominant position within the market, rules on abuse cannot be enforced against
‘abusive’ market players with a market share or turnover below the threshold for a finding
of dominance.

Box 3: The Concept of Abuse of Superior Bargaining Position

      Abuse of superior bargaining position is when a party makes use of its bargaining
power relative to another party with whom it maintains a continuous business relationship
to take any act such as to unjustly, in light of normal business practices, cause the other
party to provide money, service or other economic benefits.

      Austria, France, Germany, Italy, and the Slovak Republic employ this concept to
address abusive behavior of large buyers towards suppliers with whom they have an
economic dependent relationship. For example, Germany has leveraged this concept to
address economically dependent business relationships in its competition legislation;
Austria used the concept in legislation designed to protect local suppliers in rural areas;
France leverages the concept in its commercial contract legislation; Italy’s legislation allows
addressing abuse of superior bargaining position in economically dependent business
relationships under a private civil remedy statute; while the concept is introduced in the
Slovak Republic in an administrative regulation of retail chains.

       The concept is embraced in countries outside of Europe as well. For example in Japan,
abuse of superior bargaining position addresses the parties’ comparative bargaining
positions, not their overall dominance in the market. Superiority is analyzed based on the
level to which the weaker party is dependent on the allegedly superior party’s business,
i.e., the weaker party’s sales to the stronger party as a percentage of the weaker party’s
total sales; the superior party’s position in the market - market share; the weaker party’s
ability to change customers and the scope of the weaker party’s investment in its business
relationship with the superior party; as well as other factors, including the monetary
value of their business relationship, the growth prospects of the superior party, and the
difference in the sizes of the parties’ businesses. The Japan Fair Trade Commission issued
Guidelines Concerning Abuse of Superior Bargaining Position under the Antimonopoly
Act as of October 30, 2010.

ADDRESSING UNFAIR TRADING PRACTICES IN BULGARIA

        Dominant market position under EU law44 is a prerequisite for ‘abuse of dominant
position’. 45 However, a “finding of a dominant position does not preclude some competition
in the market. It only enables the undertaking that enjoys such a position, if not to determine, at
least to have an appreciable effect on the conditions under which that competition will develop, and
in any case to act in disregard of any such competitive constraint so long as such conduct does
not operate to its detriment.”46 In essence, a company is dominant in a certain market when
because of its economic power it could prevent competition in this market and could behave
independently of competitors, suppliers and customers.
        Dominance is defined by three interlinked elements: “(a) there must be a position
of economic strength on a market, which (b) enables the undertaking(s) in question to
prevent effective competition being maintained on that market by (c) affording it the power
to behave independently to an appreciable extent.”47 So in the context of EU competition
law “dominance is the ability to prevent effective competition being maintained on the market and to
act to an appreciable extent independently of other players.”48
        Dominance is well defined both at the EU level and under Bulgarian competition
law. The definition is centered on the ability of a dominant company to act independently
      49

from its competitors, suppliers and customers. This independence is established by assessing
the competitive constraints on the particular company. In other words, the assessment to
determine market dominance is designed to reveal whether a company, or companies, has
sufficient economic power in the relevant market to influence prices and output levels. If it
does, the company is considered to have dominance due to “substantial market power”.50

                                        The Concept of Significant Market Power

       The assessment of market power for SMP exploits different concepts from those
used to determine dominance. SMP is a concept developed in the context of regulated
markets and to address sector-specific issues. It is not a concept from competition policy.
In regulated markets, analyzing SMP follows the same methodology as the analysis of
dominance; however, the market power analysis does not focus as much on the current
situation on the particular market. Instead, the focus is on the future development of the
market and the likely impact of a company (or companies) that have SMP in a market to
affect downstream markets and on competition in the future. SMP analysis is used as the
basis for decisions to regulate a market for the benefit of consumers.

        However, similarly to dominance, SMP reflects the market player’s ability to
influence competition in a particular market: "An undertaking shall be deemed to have
significant market power if, either individually or jointly with others, it enjoys a position equivalent
to dominance, that is to say a position of economic strength affording it the power to behave to an
appreciable extent independently of competitors, customers and ultimately consumers."51
44 Article 102 (formerly Article 82 TEC) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (consolidated version) C 326/88 EN
Official Journal of the European Union 26.10.2012.
45 As noted dominance is a prerequisite for abuse but both are not placed on equal footing. The determination that a company has
sufficient economic power to prevent competition, influence prices etc., does not translate automatically to abuse.
46 See, EC (2002).
47 EC (2005, p.8).
48 EC (2005, p.10).
49 The EC considers that dominance may be presumed if a company controls a 50 percent share and its rivals have significantly
smaller shares. For the lower market shares, shares in the range between 40 and 50 percent are more likely to be associated with a
dominant position than shares below 40 percent. Market shares of 25 percent or less are usually not associated with a dominant position.
50 The reference ‘substantial’ addresses market power that is likely to be enduring over time, and should not be confused with the
concept of ‘significant market power”.

                                                                  44
                                                                  REVIEW OF SELECTED EUROPEAN POLICIES

       With difficulty and some ambiguity, SMP has been adapted to address UTP as a
competition law tool. As a concept ‘borrowed’ from regulated markets, SMP analysis is
appropriate to address sector-specific problems. Competition policy is not sector-specific.
The SMP concept worked well as a regulatory tool because regulatory policy is sector-
specific and based on the assumption that a competitive equilibrium cannot be achieved
without the continuous application of regulations and rules. In comparison, competition
policy is sector neutral and assumes that by addressing a particular behavior a competitive
equilibrium can be achieved.

       Competition policy, as opposed to regulation, is applied in markets in which the
competitive process is viable in principle, and only occasionally endangered by actions of
individual firms or groups of firms. In addition, SMP incorporates forward looking approach52
and requires that markets are monitored on a regular basis. This is most appropriate as a
regulatory activity. Sector regulators in markets such as telecommunications, energy, and
banking are required to conduct market reviews to determine whether a particular market
has players with SMP to prevent future anti-competitive pressures.53 Also, the similarities
between the concepts of SMP and dominance, create confusion and for this reason many
Member States do not address UTP through SMP as a general competition law instrument,
but rather apply established legal doctrines, such as dominance, leveraging the concept of
‘economic dependence’ to apply the rules on ‘abuse of dominant market position.’54

                                          The Concept of Economic Dependence

       Many countries in Europe have employed the concept of ‘economic dependence’
in their national competition legislation to address behavior that appears to be abuse of
dominance within a certain market but falls short of the definition of dominance. Focusing
on economic dependence due to imbalace in bargaining position is a direction taken in more
advanced interpretations of Article 102 Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union
(TFEU) since EU competition law on the abuse of economic dependence defines a more lax
regime than Member States’ own legislation. Member States could adopt “stricter national
laws which prohibit or sanction unilateral conduct engaged in by undertakings”55 to “prohibit or
impose sanctions on abusive behavior toward economically dependent undertakings.” 56

      While approaches across Member States vary, all define economic dependence
when a supplier is economically dependent on a buyer or vice versa. The concept enables
competition authorities to enforce the rules on abuse of dominant market position in cases
where the dominance test is not met. By leveraging the concept of economic dependence, the
national competition authority could treat an ‘abusive’ large buyer the same as a dominant
market player who abuses its position. The concept was embraced by more countries in the

52 See EC (2002).
53 This is a reference to a regulated market, outside of the scope of general competition law. For example, in the telecommunications
sector, there should be reasonable certainty that entrants will be able to compete. This would require to ensure that the SMP player
does not have an unmatchable advantages by virtue of its economies of scale and scope, especially if derived from its presence in the
market, in order (i) to prohibit the SMP player from discriminating in favor of its own group of business (price or non-price basis),
(ii) to provide an effective deterrent element and to ensure that the policies adopted by the SMP player towards commissioning new
infrastructure allows all market players the same opportunity to compete. These rules should be ensured under regulatory supervision
of a sector regulator. (See also ERG (07) 54 final 080331)
54 Linking economic dependence with rules on abuse of dominant position is a solution applied by the vast majority of EU Member
States; it is however, a concept from the 1970s and there are discussions to introduce a more modern concept. Several EU Member
States, most notable Hungary and the Czech Republic, have introduced SMP is sector-specific legislation and entrusted their competition
authorities with enforcement of these rules; while Latvia defined ‘abuse of dominance in retail’ in its competition law to address UTP.

ADDRESSING UNFAIR TRADING PRACTICES IN BULGARIA

EU recently in light of higher industry concentrations over the past years and the resulting
harm caused on small businesses by the practices of larger corporations.57

       The concept of economic dependence is related to the essential facilities doctrine.
The essential facilities doctrine defines as anticompetitive the practice of market players
denying potential competitors access to ‘bottleneck’ facilities to prevent their entry. In
the context of the doctrine, a facility is essential (or infrastructure) to serve customers
or to enable competitors to carry out their business where its duplication is impossible,
impractical or extremely difficult due to physical, geographical, legal or economic reasons.
The doctrine is best illustrated in cases where the duplication of infrastructure required by
all market players to reach consumers is impractical and all depend on access to the existing
infrastructure, and in the EU competition law context elevates a company to position within
a market that effectively exceeds dominant market position.

        The essential facilities doctrine originates from the United States but it has been
adopted with some modification in the European Union.58 Under EU law59, the development
of the essential facilities doctrine has been based on Article 102 of the TFEU, prohibiting
abuses of dominant position within the common market. Denying access to an essential
facility may be considered an abuse of a dominant position by the company controlling it,
in particular where it prevents competition in a downstream market. In essence, under EU
law, the refusal to deal could be construed as an abuse of dominant position under Article
102.60

                                    Review of Fellow Member States’ Practice

        Historically, the concept of ‘abuse of economic dependence’ based on a ‘superior
bargaining position’ has been applied to address the noncompetitive behavior of big
retailers against suppliers with a weak bargaining position.61 It is applied in many
European countries to non-dominant undertakings that have the ability to exercise market
power in relation to SME suppliers, purchasers or competitors companies. Although the
ability of Member States to apply stricter rules compared to Article 102 is acknowledged in
Regulation 1/2003, the EC does not apply such rules. Thus, the gap in the application of the
dominance in ‘economic dependence’ relations between buyers and suppliers is hidden in
the traditional test of dominance.62




57 For detailed discussion see, Këllezi, Pranvera (2008).
58 The doctrine originates from the judgment of the Supreme Court in United States vs. Terminal Railroad Association, where an
association was set up by 14 out of 24 rail companies that were serving the St. Louis Railway Station to set-up a joint venture to
manage the infrastructure required to access the railway station, which included a bridge that was technically impossible to duplicate.
The Supreme Court imposed a duty on owners of essential facilities to deal with competitors and ruled that the joint venture set up by
the association excluded the other rail companies from using the necessary infrastructure to access the St. Louis Station and in effect
restricted their market access. For detailed discussion see Hatzopoulos, V. (2006).
59 It is important to note that there is a difference in the interpretation of essential facility in the U.S and in the EU: In the EU
‘essential facility’ is viewed as position exceeding market dominance, in effect defining the market player(s) as more-than-dominant
in the market.
60 The Court of Justice restricts the scope of the essential facilities doctrine by limiting its application to situations in which the owner
of a facility holds more than a dominant position and requires that a facility is indispensable. For detailed discussion see, E. Sebastien,
2004.

                                                REVIEW OF SELECTED EUROPEAN POLICIES

       Counterbalancing the relationship between big buyers and their smaller suppliers
gained prominence in Western Europe in the early 1970s. Germany was the first country
in Europe to amend its competition law to allow applying the rules on abuse of market
dominance to economic dependent relationships between buyers and suppliers. France
also developed an approach to UTP; however, French law allows addressing UTP both
as a commercial contract issue under competition law and affords broader enforcement
responsibilities authorities to the French competition authority in this respect.
       Most Member States apply rules on abuse of dominance to cases of ‘economic
dependence’ in B2B relations. Austria, Cyprus, Hungary (see box 4), Italy, Portugal,
Romania, Slovakia, and Spain, to name a few, extended the concepts in this way to address the
balance in economic relations between larger and smaller companies. A similar approach is
taken in Latvia, which introduces a unique prohibition on the abuse of ‘superior bargaining
position by retailers’ to “addresses both the abuse of economic dependence of smaller suppliers or
producers as well as abuse of superior bargaining power by retailers”.63

Box 4: Addressing SMP from a commercial law perspective in Hungary

        UTP in Hungary are addressed in several pieces of legislation – the Commercial Act,
 the Trade Act, the Unfair Distributional Practices Act; and these are enforced by two bodies
 – the Hungarian Competition Authority (HCA) and the National Food Chain Safety Office
 (NFCSO).
        Hungary’s competition legislation does not contain specific rules on buying power or
 economic dependency; however, Hungary’s commercial legislation – the Trade Act; defines
 the notion of SMP as the equivalent of “buying power”. According to the definition set out in
 Article 2 of the Trade Act “the term “significant market power” refers to a market situation
 as a consequence of which the dealer becomes or has become a contracting partner for the
 supplier which the latter is unable to reasonably evade at forwarding its goods and services
 to the customers and which is able, due to the size of its share in the turnover, to influence
 regionally or all over the country market access of a product or a group of products”. (Article
 2 of the Trade Act) The SMP threshold is defined as follows: “significant buyer power vis-
 à-vis suppliers exists where the consolidated net turnover derived from the commercial
 activities of the group of undertakings in question, including all the parent companies and
 subsidiaries under Act C of 2000 on Accounting, or in the case of joint purchasing, all the
 undertakings establishing the purchasing association in the previous year was higher than
 100 billion HUF” (approximately EUR 332 million). (Article 7 (3) and (4) Trade Act)
        In Hungary the provisions of the Trade Act prohibiting abuse of SMP are applicable
 to all traders having SMP, whereas the Unfair Distributional Practices Act’s provisions are
 only applicable to traders active in the agricultural and food industry, regardless of the
 market power.
        Rules on suppliers’ relations with large scale food retail chains, regulated under
 special legislation, are enforced by NFCSO, which limits the authority of the HCA to
 engage in enforcement action in the food retail sector, unless conducting an investigation
 whether a retail chain has a dominant position in the market. But the HCA has authority
 to conduct proceedings against retailers for cases of abuse with SMP. If an unfair business
 conduct falls under the Unfair Distributional Practices Act, the Trade Act cannot be
 applied. However, if the HCA conducts investigations in accordance with the abuse of
 dominance provision of the Competition Act, NFCSO has to suspend its proceedings
 which are related to the same conduct. (Continued on next page)

ADDRESSING UNFAIR TRADING PRACTICES IN BULGARIA


        The Trade Act provides a list of unfair business practices which qualify as abuses
 of SMP: unjustifiably discriminating against suppliers; unjustifiably restricting suppliers
 access to sales opportunities; imposing unfair conditions on suppliers; unjustifiably
 altering contractual terms to the detriment of suppliers; subjecting the future business
 relations of the dealer with the suppliers to conditions; charging fees one-sidedly to
 suppliers; threatening with delisting; unjustifiably forcing suppliers to avail themselves
 of third persons as suppliers or of an own service provider of the dealer; applying sales
 prices which are lower than the invoice prices determined in its contracts in cases in which
 the dealer is not the owner of the goods.
        The Unfair Distributional Practices Act was adopted in 2010 following unsuccessful
 implementation of a non-binding code of conduct on the big retail chains. The Act covers
 all retailers and all types of food and agricultural product suppliers regardless of their size
 or bargaining power. The Act places additional requirements on traders whose annual net
 sales revenues exceeded 20 billion HUF (approximately EUR 67.1 million) in the preceding
 business year. Such larger traders are obliged to prepare and publish their business rules
 and submit them to the NFCSO. The rules must cover the services offered by the trader;
 the terms and conditions governing the provision of the services; the maximum prices
 that may be charged for the services; the calculation method used to set the prices; and the
 conditions of inclusion in and exclusion from the trader’s suppliers list. Prohibited under
 the Act are unfair distribution practices such as: one-sided risk sharing to the detriment of
 suppliers; the application of contractual provisions which place a repurchase obligations
 on suppliers; cost externalisation towards suppliers; applying shelf prices, listing charges
 and extra charges for services not rendered; provisions containing payment deadlines
 exceeding 30 days; excluding interest for late payment, or penalty payment; a requirement
 regarding exclusive supply of suppliers without proportionate payment; an unjustified
 unilateral contract amendment by the trader; below cost pricing by the trader; applying
 discriminative customer prices with regard to equivalent products depending on the
 country of origin.
        Under the Unfair Distributional Practices Act traders whose annual net sales revenues
 exceeded 20 billion HUF (approximately EUR 67.1 million) must publish their business
 rules and submit them to the NFCSO. These rules must cover the services offered by the
 trader; the terms and conditions governing the provision of the services; the maximum
 prices that may be charged for the services; the calculation method used to set the prices;
 and the conditions of inclusion in and exclusion from the trader’s suppliers list.

	       The underlying rationale for adopting specific rules on the ‘abuse of economic
dependence’ in Germany64 was to prevent big oil corporations from discriminating against
small independent oil stations during the oil crisis and to protect other retailers from
dependence on strong brands and the dependence that resulted from long-standing business
relations. 65 In effect, the German approach is that dominance is present when large companies
that have contracts with SMEs, hence abuse of superior bargaining position equates abuse of
dominance:“ Paragraph 1 [dominance] shall also apply to undertakings and associations of undertakings
insofar as small or medium-sized enterprises as suppliers or purchasers of certain kinds of goods or
commercial services depend on them in such a way that sufficient and reasonable possibility of resorting
to other undertakings does not exist. A supplier of a certain kind of goods or commercial services shall be



64 Abuse of ‘economic dependence’ is a competition law concept from the late 1970s and early 1980s. It refers to the imposition of
unfair purchase or selling prices/unfair trading conditions, limitation of production, markets, technical development to the prejudice
of consumers, applying dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions, making the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by
other parties of supplementary obligations, etc. And for this reason it fully mirrors the rules under Art. 102 TFTU (Formerly Art. 82
EC Treaty.)

presumed to depend on a purchaser within the meaning of sentence 1 if this purchaser regularly
obtains from this supplier, in addition to discounts customary in the trade or other remuneration,
special benefits which are not granted to similar purchasers.” 66

        Germany is a special case, as its national policies on establishing a “social
market economy” have influenced the alignment of competition law and the political
responsibility. The distinctive, characteristic features of Germany’s competition law system
include a clear prohibition against horizontal cartels, moderated by rules that accommodate
efficient co-operation, applied through legal analysis rather than administrative discretion,
coupled with strong merger control and protection of small business interests (see, box 5).67
Box 5: Use of abuse of economic dependence concept to protect smaller firms in Germany

      Germany was among the first in Europe to adopt and develop the concept of abuse
 of economic dependence to protect smaller firms in their dealing with large customers
 and suppliers. German competition law pays special attention to protecting smaller firms
 against dominance in a bargaining relationship and to sales below cost as an abuse of
 superior market power in relation to SMEs. The enforcement record against abuse of
 dominance has been limited and mixed, perhaps because the German Competition
 Authority has concentrated more on the “cartel” issues that defined its original mission.
 A high priority now is network utility monopolies, as recent amendments eliminated
 exemptions and added a specific rule about access to essential facilities. In electric power,
 there have been dozens of investigations about network access charges. But enforcement
 against typical abuses in these industries has proved difficult. Methods developed for ex
 post enforcement through a quasi-judicial process against particular misconduct are not
 adapted for continuous administration based on detailed cost analysis in order to change
 sector-wide practices and conditions.
 Source: OECD (2004).


         France also extends the definition of abuse of dominant position to address
economic dependence (see, box 6). The origin of the French rule on economic dependence
is to be found in the development and the concentration of retail distribution. French law,
conforming to EU competition rules under Article 102 TFEU, prohibits unilateral conduct:
“The abuse by an undertaking or group of undertakings of a dominant position . . . . shall be prohibited
. . . These abuses may in particular consist of refusals to sell, linked sales or discriminatory conditions
of sale and the severance of established commercial relations solely because the partner refuses to
submit to unjustified commercial conditions.”68

        French law allows addressing UTP under both commercial law and competition
law. Though French commercial law includes specific provisions on ‘abuse of superior
bargaining position’, the French Competition Commission requested in 1985 the adoption
of competition rules that would empower it to control the discriminatory behavior of
firms imposing obligatory trading terms on suppliers or producers, even if they do not
hold a dominant position in the market:69 “Also prohibited, whenever it is susceptible to affect
the functioning or structure of competition, is the abusive exploitation, by a company or group
of companies, of the condition of economic dependence in which a customer company or supplier
finds itself vis-à-vis such company. These abuses may consist of the refusal of sale, tied sales or the
discriminatory practices mentioned in article L 442-6.”70

ADDRESSING UNFAIR TRADING PRACTICES IN BULGARIA

Box 6: Combining economic dependence with commercial law in France

       Under French competition law economic dependence is described in terms of a
 buyer’s ability to threaten or ruin its supplier, where the buyer represents more than a
 critical threshold of the supplier’s business. Law based on this concept is designed to
 control consolidation in the distribution chain, to handicap large distributors and protect
 smaller retailers and suppliers. In 2001 the competition law was reformed to improve
 the processes of investigation, including defining in greater detail the rules related to
 the concept of abuse of economic dependence and aligning the treatment of “restrictive”
 with “anti-competitive” practices. Practices that “restrict” competition often have little
 effect on markets, though they could affect particular competitors’ positions. For example,
 discrimination in price, delay in payment, or other conditions of sale or purchase that are
 listed in the part of the statute about unfair practices are all considered abuses of economic
 dependence if they have the requisite general effect on market competition. Economic
 dependence is no longer defined as a situation in which the customer or supplier has
 no equivalent alternative, but dependence is defined as relationship specific: whether a
 firm has enough coercive power to make its suppliers or customers vulnerable depends
 on how important the firm is to their business. There are 7 specific prohibitions against
 discrimination and extortion of unfair advantage, also prohibited as abuse of economic
 dependence if there is an adverse effect on market competition. The first is a general
 prohibition against granting or receiving discriminatory prices, payment terms, or
 conditions, if discrimination is not justified by compensation actually received and it creates
 a competitive advantage or disadvantage. The second, which was added in 2001, targets
 hidden rebates and discriminations involving promotional allowances or services. Other
 abuses that are specifically prohibited include obtaining or seeking unwritten advantages
 as a condition for transmitting orders, using the threat of termination to seek or obtain
 prices or terms that are “manifestly exceptional to general conditions of sale,” terminating
 an established commercial relationship without prior written warning (except for breach
 of contract or force majeure), selling outside a contractually restricted distribution system
 (if the system is legal under the competition law), and abusive payment terms. Contracts
 may not envision retroactive benefit from rebates or discounts, demand payment for shelf-
 space access before transmitting orders, or prevent transferring bills due to third parties
 for collection. These practices affect the relative bargaining positions of buyers and sellers,
 and some may lead to secondary-line effects on rivalry.

       Other Member States prohibiting abuse of dominant position in relations based on
economic dependence, including Italy (see, box 7), Portugal, Romania, Slovakia and Spain.
For example Italian law prohibits “… any agreement between parties in commercial relation,
which would determine an abuse of one party’s economic dependence defines as excessive imbalance
between the duties and obligations of the parties arising from that commercial relation.”71

Box 7: Using economic dependence to apply rules on dominance in Italy

        Italian Competition Law mirrors the EU rules on prohibited agreements and
 practices in restraint of competition, and abuses of market power, with the exception of
 the premise that these should have “effect on trade between Member States” (Article 102
 TFEU). Protection of smaller undertakings is not a concern specifically addressed by the
 Competition Law; however, rules aimed at prohibiting abuses of dominant positions and
 anticompetitive mergers that result in the creation or strengthening of market dominance
 are normally addressed to large undertakings that enjoy significant market power.
 Accordingly, enforcement of those rules may indirectly result in the protection of smaller
 businesses. “Economic dependence” is defined by as “the situation in which an undertaking
 has the power to determine, in its commercial relationship with another undertaking, an
 excessive imbalance in the parties’ rights and obligations.” In implementing the rule Italian
 civil courts have noted that concept of economic dependence introduces a broader notion
 of abuse, under which a dominant position in the relevant market is not required for the
 prohibition to apply. Also civil courts have noted that although the language of economic
 dependence emphasizes the “excessive imbalance in the parties’ rights and obligations,”
 a situation of “economic dependence” (or “hold up” situation) exists, primarily, when an
 undertaking is the “mandatory” partner of another undertaking - that is, when the latter
 is forced to deal with the former where no satisfactory alternative commercial partner is
 available. (See, e.g., Medical Sys. v. Eastman Chemical Italia, 5 Jan. 2004 (Court of Catania),
 available at www.ilFallimento.it/giurisprudenza/117.htm; see also Petrosino v. Marini
 Bobini, Danno e Responsabilità, 6 May 2002 (Court of Bari). Law No. 57/2001 introduced
 a new rule providing that any agreement resulting in an abuse of “economic dependence”
 is void and entrusted the Italian Competition Authority with the power to investigate any
 alleged violation of the rules on abuses of economic dependence and where necessary to
 impose fines.

        The Czech and Hungarian competition authorities address UTP by enforcing
sector-specific legislation on agriculture and food product retail that introduce the concept
of ‘significant market power’ in B2B relations. Under Czech law (see box 8) SMP is defined
as follows: “Significant market power shall be deemed to be a relation between a buyer and a supplier
… and in which the buyer may impose unilaterally beneficial trade conditions on the supplier”.72




72 Art. 3(2) Act No. 395/2009 SMP in the Sale of Agricultural and Food Products.
                                                              51
ADDRESSING UNFAIR TRADING PRACTICES IN BULGARIA

Box 8: Introducing SMP through sector-specific legislation in the Czech Republic

        In 2010 the Czech Republic adopted a special Act on Significant Market Power
 in Sale of Agricultural Products and Abuse thereof. This new Act introduced stricter
 national rules applicable to unilateral conduct in the food sector which go beyond the
 classical dominance test foreseen under Article 102 TFEU. Since 2010, the Competition
 Authority has also been enforcing the Act and has been engaged in monitoring the market
 of agricultural and food products, which includes conducting regular sector inquiries
 and collecting relevant information concerning supplier-retailer relationships and the
 process of negotiating delivery terms within the agricultural and food supply chain. The
 Act defines the concept of the significant market power and its abuse for the purposes of
 the protection of competition and to set up tools for assessment and avoidance of such
 behavior. The Act is applicable in cases concerning sale of agricultural products when an
 undertaking as a buyer abuses its significant market power towards other undertakings –
 its suppliers. SMP is defined by the Act as “the position of the buyer towards the supplier,
 whereas the supplier becomes dependent on the buyer in relation to delivery of goods
 to the customers as a result of the market situation and the market power enables the
 buyer to enforce unilaterally preferential terms”. There is a rebuttable presumption of
 SMP if the net turnover of the buyer exceeds 5 b. CZK (approx. EUR 200 m.) in the last
 accounting period in the region of the Czech Republic. It is prohibited to abuse the SMP to
 the detriment of suppliers; the abuse is to be understood as a systematic conduct which has
 as its object or effect significant distortion of competition in the relevant market. There is a
 list of conducts considered to be abusive in five annexes to the Act. The fines for breaching
 the Act can be imposed in amount of up to 10 m. CZK or up to 10 % of the net turnover.
 The application of the Act has been complicated since the beginning because of several
 ambiguous terms and definitions (including the term SMP) that were broadly criticized
 by law practitioners as well as stakeholders. In 2011, the Czech Government decided that
 the law should be abolished and some of its parts transferred to the Competition Act and
 to the Price Act. The Office has been entrusted with the task to draw an amendment in
 this respect. However, the discussions about the amended continued during 2012 and the
 overall concept has not been drafted.*

73 It is important to note that modern competition rules focus on the prohibition of ‘abuse of dominant position’ practices, while
‘significant market power’ holds an economic meaning and refers to the ability of a company to set the prices of its products
independently above competitive levels
                                                               52
                                                                                              OPTIONS FOR BULGARIA

                                          OPTIONS FOR BULGARIA

       The World Bank analyzed EU Member State policies in addressing unfair trading
practices against the following criteria: effectiveness, alignment with economic principles,
adaptability, efficiency and timeliness, and analytically based, dependent, transparent,
contestable and reversible practice with due process. Based on these criteria, the World
Bank proposes six options, ordered by suitability:

   The first and recommended option is to enrich Bulgaria’s current commercial law
with specific rules prohibiting UTP, following the French and Hungarian examples, where
specific provisions addressing UTP in B2B relations are defined in legislation on commercial
contracts and the CPC is tasked with enforcing these provisions in cases where business
conduct affects competition.74

       The second preferred option would be to adopt national rules addressing UTP
following the spirit of the curent EU law and the experience of most other fellow Member
States.75 Implementation would entail amending the competition law framework to extend
the authority of the CPC to apply the rules on ‘abuse of market dominance’, even in cases
where dominance is not present, by leveraging the concept of ‘economic dependence’ in
B2B relations, following the example of most other fellow Member States, spearheaded by
Germany.76 Under this option the CPC would be able to treat a large buyer that abuses its
‘superior bargaining position’ vis a vis economically dependent suppliers and producers the
same as a dominant market player who abuses its position.

       Addressing UTP through antitrust law enforcement is associated with significant
risks that the work of the CPC would be politicized and may discredit the impartiality of
the authority as it is likely that the CPC will be overburdened by a large number of cases
requesting the attention of the authority to the practices ‘abusive’ large buyers that could
backlog the systems and hamper enforcement.

        The third option would be to enhance the authority of the CPC to apply available
legal instruments on unfair competition practices.77 Implementing this option would
likely be associated with significant reform efforts, both in terms of associated legislative
changes and in terms of enhancing the capacity of the CPC in the consumer protection area.
In general, Bulgarian competition law provides recourse for unfair B2B practices; however,
while the CPC has authority to address unfair competition practices that affect consumers, it
is not directly tasked with consumer protection. Competition authorities in many countries
have studied the competition conditions in the supply chain and have concluded that, in
general, new rules are not necessary to address B2B relations from a consumer protection
perspective; applying and strengthening ‘unfair competition’ rules would be enough. In the


74 Amending general commercial law to address UTP could include for example requirements on standardizing supplier agreements,
prescription of uniform supplier conditions, uniform delivery and payment terms, etc.
75 For detailed discussion see, EC (2013 b) and European Competition Network (2012) .
76 And to a certain extent Latvia, which introduced the concept of ‘dominance in retail’ which is a ‘variation’ of the concept of
applying the rules on abuse of dominance specifically tailored to cases of economic dependence in retailer-supplier relations.
77 Mr. Gianluca Sepe (Italian Competition Authority), strongly suggested expanding the authority of the CPC in the consumer
protection area during the discussions of the Technical Workshop “Significant Market Power and Unfair Business Practices: Issues
and Challenges” held in Sofia on January 28 2014. Mr. Sepe, as a competition expert, noted that the CPC could take advantage of
the ‘unfair competition’ authority under the current competition framework, and that even if the CPC oversteps its mandate and
encroaches on the authority of the Consumer Protection Agency in related actions, the CPC would be the ‘best possible authority’
capable of addressing unfair competition from a consumer protection perspective. Such comments reflect a long lasting debate whether
competition authorities should be tasked with consumer protection.
                                                                53
ADDRESSING UNFAIR TRADING PRACTICES IN BULGARIA

Bulgarian context, however, such a discussion would require comprehensive analysis of
CPC’s authority vis a vis the Consumer Protection Commission.

       The fourth option would be to promote codes of conduct applicable to B2B relations.
Many jurisdictions, most notably the United Kingdom in Europe, have developed codes of
conduct aimed at tackling imbalances in the supply chain, where the rules favor suppliers
and prevent retailers from unduly shifting costs and risks onto suppliers. In general, the
codes of conduct are voluntary and therefore, adhesion to the code by retailers/suppliers is
required to ensure success of the instrument.78

       The fifth option for Bulgaria is to adopt national rules aligned with the debated
EU-level rules on UTP. Such an option, however, would delay significantly designing a
solution to address UTP in B2B relations in Bulgaria as it is unclear when (and whether)
such EU-wide rules on UTP in B2B relations would be adopted.79

        The last, sixth option, also refers to adopting national rules following fellow
Member State experience. Implementing this option would require adopting sector-specific
legislation to task the CPC with enforcement of sector rules that introduce the concept of
SMP in B2B relations, following the examples of the Czech Republic and Hungary.80 It is
important to note that this option, albeit introducing SMP, is distinctly different from the
approach taken in Bulgaria. In the Bulgarian case, SMP is introduced as a competition law
instrument applicable to all sectors and markets; while in the Czech and Hungarian cases
SMP is introduced through sector legislation and the respective competition authorities
enforcement role.

      Introducing SMP through amendments to the LPC would be not only a unique
application of the SMP concept in Europe, but will likely put significant strain on the
CPC, both in terms of capacity and resources.




78 Such Codes include broad principles of business conduct or standards of behavior that should be followed by adhered firms. (see
A. Tallontire, 2007, pp. 775-791). It is important also to note that examples of successfully addressing UTP through codes of business
conduct come from the common law traditions such as Australia, UK, etc.
79 The issue is debated at the EU-level since 2005 when EU rules specifically addressing unfair commercial practices, i.e., business
to consumer; were adopted
80 A key difference between the proposed amendments of the LPC in Bulgaria and the Czech and Hungarian examples is that the GoB
contemplates introducing SMP in competition law, rather than in sector-specific legislation and entrusting the competition authority
with enforcement.
                                                                 54
                                                                                 CONCLUSION

                                      CONCLUSION

       UTP in business relations negatively impacts the abilities of some companies to
invest, innovate, grow and export. For this reason solutions to address UTP would need
to be designed more comprehensively, leveraging simultaneously government policies,
econometric and legal tools. Legislation, adressing UTP could be an effective tool for limiting
the abilities of companies for restricting competition and winning over customers through
noncompetitive means.
        Protecting consumers is the overarching rationale behind competition legislation.
An underperforming market would have negative impact on consumers as competition
within the supply chain has direct impact on them: “suppliers (producers, traders) offer goods or
services on the market in an endeavor to meet demand (from intermediate customers or consumers).
Demand seeks the best combination of quality and price for the products it requires. Competition
between suppliers leads to the most efficient response to demand.”(EC, 2012).
       Restricting opportunities for UTP in business relations would be best achieved
through targeted amendments to general commercial law and allowing for parallel
enforcement by the CPC in cases where business conduct harms competition. This
can be achieved for example, through new provisions in commercial legislation defining
requirements for standard agreements and uniform supplier conditions applicable for
selected sectors, prescription of uniform delivery and payment terms, etc. This approach
should allow unilateral actions on contractual issues through the courts, as well as affording
the CPC enforcement responsibilities of commercial law provisions addressing UTP in cases
where their prevalence could harm competition in the market.
      Addressing UTP from a competition law perspective would require an in-depth
discussion as to which legal instruments available under the EU competition doctrine
would be most appropriate and successful in Bulgaria.
       Most fellow Member States adopted provisions allowing the application of
the rules on abuse of market dominance (in cases where dominance is not present) by
leveraging the concept of ‘economic dependence.’ This approach allows the competition
authority to treat an ‘abusive’ big buyer the same as a dominant market player who abuses
its position.
        An option that requires significant reform efforts is to expand the authorities of the
CPC in the consumer protection area. This would require amending respective legislation
governing consumer protection and competition, as well as significant reform efforts in
terms of staffing and capacity building of the CPC. Such an approach, apart from requiring
significant reform efforts, would likely overburden the CPC and remove its focus on core
antitrust activities.
      A ‘minority’ approach, taken by the Czech Republic and Hungary, is to expand
the authority of the competition authority to enforce sector-specific legislation that
defines SMP and prohibits its abuse. The proposed amendments to the Bulgarian LPC,
does not follow this approach. The draft bill proposes SMP concept as generally applicable
competition law instrument, not only applied to the food retail sector as in Hungary and the
Czech Republic.
       Treating UTP in the context of antitrust law enforcement or consumer protection
could politicize the CPC and discredit it as an impartial agency. Given the large proportion
of SMEs in Bulgaria, such approach would also likely overburden the CPC to review a large
number of endless cases requesting the attention of the authority to the practices ‘abusive’
large buyers as well as complaints by consumers.

                                                  INTRODUCTION

        The Government of Bulgaria is concerned that large retailers may be using their
superior bargaining position to dictate the terms of contractual relations with their suppliers.
The Bulgarian Commission on Protection of Competition (CPC) found some of these
practices to seem unfair, but that it had no authority to fully address them under existing
competition legislation. This lack of authority to act is based on the fact that European Union
(EU) competition legislation, itself, is silent on the relations between businesses even if these
are based on unfair terms. However, EU law does allow Member States, like Bulgaria to set
national rules if they want to address unfair practices resulting from abuse of bargaining
power.81 Using this authority to amend its competition framework, the Government of
Bulgaria plans to introduce the concept of ‘significant market power’ in the competition
legislation.

                                                    Purpose and scope

       This chapter identifies and discusses some of the methods, data and analysis that
The Bulgarian Commission on Protection of Competition could use to assess the existence
of significant market power (SMP) in market assessments. Before introducing a discussion
of these methods and analyses, the difficult issues that arise in making coherent economic
arguments that would justify significant market power findings are discussed. The framework
of the debate over these issues is provided by economic theory. Economic theory and an
understanding of market competition are emphasized as an essential part of all competition
policy market assessments in the guidelines provided to competition authorities of Member
States by the European Commission (EC).82

       The EC Guidelines include a number of criteria that may be used in assessing market
power. However, the Guidelines are not exhaustive. In fact, the EC Guidelines do not
specifically mention how to assess SMP as opposed to dominance. To make an assessment
of SMP, other criteria are considered.83

       This chapter is divided into three sections:
         •	 Section I contains an introduction, background and a discussion of EC guidance
            on concepts of market power;
         •	 Section II covers a discussion of the methodological issues that the CPC may want
            to address in identifying relevant markets, assessing the existence of SMP and
            barriers to entry in the retail sector; and
         •	 Section III identifies data and market indicators that can inform market assessments
            in the retail sector.

81 Article 3 of EC Regulation 1/2003, in addressing the relationship between national competition laws and the EU competition
rules, states that where national competition authorities or courts apply both European and national competition law in parallel, the
application of the latter is subject to an obligation of convergence contained in Article 3(2).

83 It is important to note that the EC Guidelines referred to here only address abusive exclusionary conduct from dominant
undertakings. These guidelines are meant to address conduct that impairs genuine undistorted competition. Exclusionary conduct is
when an undertaking with dominant position excludes its competitors by other means than on the merits of the products or services
they provide. A dominant position may be held by one undertaking (single dominance) or by two or more undertakings (collective
dominance). The document only relates to abuses committed by an undertaking holding a single dominant position.

ADDRESSING UNFAIR TRADING PRACTICES IN BULGARIA

       Finally, the arguments and concepts used throughout this chapter address and are
organized around the policy issue of most immediate concern to the authorities in Bulgaria;
namely, instances of unfair trading practices in the retail sector. In addition, while there is
a discussion of the economic arguments that may be used to identify ‘superior bargaining
power’, ‘unfair trading practices’ and ‘economic dependence’, all terms associated with SMP
in buyer-supplier economic relations, there is no discussion on how to identify, empirically,
these terms.

                                 GUIDANCE, CONCEPTS AND ISSUES

       The Government’s proposal to amend the competition policy framework presents a
few challenges. It first relies on the concept of ‘significant market power’. This term is not
consistently well defined, especially within competition policy frameworks. Distinctions
between ‘significant’ and other levels of market power need clarification if the concept is to
be used in a non-arbitrary manner.

        In addition, there are other concepts used to distinguish this type of market power
significant market power from monopoly or dominance; namely essential facilities,84
economic dependence and superior bargaining power. The task is also to ground all of
these concepts in economic theory. The goal of this section is to provide some clarity to the
following terms and concepts used to distinguish ‘significant market power’ from other
market power concepts:

          •	 Significant market power;
          •	 Essential facility, economic dependence and superior bargaining power; and
          •	 Unfair trading practices.
       Rather than providing a definition for each, the section discusses the issues and
challenges in clarifying the following term. For ‘superior bargaining power’, ‘unfair trading
practices’ and ‘economic dependence’, discussion is theoretical in nature. There is no
discussion here on how to identify these terms empirically.

        Finally, the Government of Bulgaria is particularly interested in using the SMP
concept, within the competition policy framework, to address sector-specific issues in the
retail sector. This runs against the grain of sector-neutrality of competition policy. Sector
neutrality is one of the tenets that of competition policy that distinguishes it from (sector-
specific) regulation. So while discussions centered on changes to the competition policy
framework are best kept independent of specific sector considerations, the particulars of
the retail sector make it difficult to manage and organize a concise and coherent discussion
of the SMP authority without confining it to the retail sector. In sum, to respond to the
Government’s interest in the retail sector, the discussion contained here is not generally
applicable to sectors outside of retail.

       The nature of competition and certain aspects of retail markets are not shared by
many other sectors. For this reason, recommendations on the nature of analysis for this
sector are adapted to fit these differences. For example, in retail markets location matters to
a level of granularity that may not be the case for many other sectors. Being a corner store
may put an undertaking in a different market than a supermarket with a large parking
lot down the block. The type of retail establishment matters as well since some may offer
the same products, but a different level of service, product selection, etc. Even operating
hours of retail establishments may be of great importance since midnight shoppers may
have different demand characteristics than ones that shop during the day.

84 While essential facilities issues do arise in purely private, unregulated contexts, there is a tendency for them to arise more commonly
in contexts where the owner/controller of the essential facility is subject to economic regulation or is State-owned or otherwise
State-related. Hence, there is often a public policy choice to be made between the extension of economic regulation and an essential
facilities concept under the competition laws. Further, the fact of regulation of pricing through economic regulation, State-control, or a
prohibition of ‘excessive pricing’ in the competition law, has implications for the nature of an essential facilities concept. The US has
increasingly restricted the concept to monopolies, while the EU is more liberal with the term and is prone to applying it in different
market structures other than monopoly.
                                                                   59
ADDRESSING UNFAIR TRADING PRACTICES IN BULGARIA

       In sum, the discussion throughout this chapter is grounded on the guidance provided
by the European Commission. EC guidance, however, does not address many of these
concepts directly so these must be adapted to fit the purposes of the Government’s policy
goals. These guidelines are discussed next.

                                                    EC Guidance

       Article 102 (formerly Article 82) of Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union
is a fundamental part of the competition policy framework dealing with abuses of market
power. This article, however, is silent on the conduct of entities that are non-dominant
since these undertakings are not likely to have the capacity to ‘behave independently of
customers, and competitors and adopt conducts which will induce consumer harm.’

      The European Union’s top enforcement authority, the European Commission, issued
a guidance paper on how to implement and enforce provisions under Article 102.85 The EC
Guidance Paper (2008) places significant emphasis on an ‘effects-based approach’ to identify
which unilateral actions from dominant entities should be of concern to the competition
authorities.

       The effects-based approach emphasizes corrective action when abusive behavior
harms consumers, not competitors. If a unilateral action is deemed to harm competitors, this
may not be sufficient grounds on which to apply corrective measures. The analysis of harm
must also show that this unilateral action negatively affects consumers, present and future,
before the application of sanctions and remedies are justified.

                                                    Market power

        The European Commission defines dominance but not significant market power.
SMP is a market power threshold that is lower than and different from dominance. SMP is
often seen as a case in which a firm is one of a handful of firms ‘big enough’ to independently
affect the market and is ‘unaffected’ by the threat of competition from one of the other ‘big’
firms. As this informal definition illustrates, there are a set of not so well defined terms and
many of these are similar to those used to define dominance. The issue, therefore, is how
dominance and SMP are different. What economic theory and assumptions can competition
authorities appeal to in order to support meaningful distinctions between the two concepts?

                                                          Dominance

        Article 102 adopts an economic definition of dominance as an undertaking ”…capable
of profitably increasing prices above the competitive level for a significant period of time does not
face sufficiently effective competitive constraints...” The Commission does not refer to a certain
market share above which (or below which) dominance will be presumed (or excluded),
but lists a number of factors that it will consider in its dominance assessment, including
the presence of “constraints imposed by the existing supplies from, and the position on the market
of, actual competitors (the market position of the dominant undertaking and its competitors);
constraints imposed by the credible threat of future expansion by actual competitors or entry by
potential competitors (expansion and entry); constraints imposed by the bargaining strength of the
undertaking’s customers (countervailing buyer power).” Dominance exists when the undertaking
is not be subject to competitive constraints.

       The EC’s definition of dominance represents efforts to define that concept by
behaviors and their consequences to consumer welfare rather than by market structure.
The Economic Advisory Group on Competition, which influenced the design of the
European Commission’s competition policy framework,86 argued that the traditional means
of establishing dominance by estimating market shares would only lead to proxies for
the determination of dominance. Assessments of market structures provide information
only about the ability and opportunity to exert power and impose abusive behavior on
other market participants,87 but are not evidence of abusive behavior itself. The Economic
Advisory Group recommends additional evaluations of the alleged competitive harm on
the basis of how competition in the particular market actually works. Most importantly, this
approach argues that a determination of what the practice in question harms consumers is
what matters most.88

                                               Significant market power

        Based on the dominance definition that the Commission does provide, however, it
can be argued that SMP is meant to refer to an entity’s capacity in a manner that is to some
extent more sensitive to the reactions of its existing and potential competitors. Also, if the
definition of SMP is a lighter variation of dominance, the ability to ‘substantially’ increase
prices for a ‘significant’ period of time would be another reasonable area of inquiry. Would
an entity with SMP raise prices, but not so ‘substantially’ as a dominant firm? Alternatively,
would an SMP undertaking raise prices of a period of time that is something less than
‘significant’? In sum, as something less than dominant, an undertaking deemed to have SMP
may imply that the competitive constraints are not completely ineffective over some period
of time. This is problematic since even in dominance cases it is difficult to pin down what a
‘small but significant and nontransitory price increase’. Basing a less stringent definition of
market power on what that is already difficult to define will unlikely lead to greater clarity.

87 See Economic Advisory Group on Competition Policy Report, page 14.
88 The OECD policy brief on Substantial Market Power and Competition argued that single firm conduct provisions should also apply
to firms with a high degree of market power. While there is no single, clear economic test that distinguishes between the market power
of concern in unilateral conduct cases and the lesser degree of market power that should not be of concern, market power that may be
harmful depends on the ability of undertakings to adversely influence competition. Thus, it is clear that non-dominant firms can also
have an adverse impact on consumer welfare through unilateral acts. However, the dominance minimizes the probability of prohibiting
procompetitive unilateral practices and thus reduces Type I errors (i.e. prohibiting conduct that is procompetitive).
                                                                 61
ADDRESSING UNFAIR TRADING PRACTICES IN BULGARIA

        Instead of conduct-based definitions, such as pricing behavior, the term ‘significant
market power’ appears and is defined in the EC’s framework but it is a definition based on
market structure, technological constraints and very particular cost functions (high fixed
costs, economies of scale, and network effects). In the EC’s framework the term ‘significant
market power’ is defined for the regulation of electronic communications networks and
services.89

       To use a structurally-based definition of the SMP concept presents substantial
challenges in its application to the competition policy. SMP is a regulatory concept not one
commonly used in competition policy. It is used by regulators to regulate sectors characterized
by network architectures. The structure of costs, the technological specificities, the large fixed
costs which are sunk once assets are deployed, the large economies of scale and dynamic
circumstances are not shared by many other industries outside of those for which SMP is
used to regulate. Of course, the SMP concept may be applied without much problem within
competition policy framework to sectors that share the particular characteristics. However,
unregulated sectors with these characteristics are rare.

       Irrespective of these challenges in implementation, proponents of amending
competition policy frameworks to include SMP authority argue that some markets, in which
no dominant firm is apparent, still have features similar to those where regulation under
SMP has been applied.90 Most importantly, features similar to essential facilities lead to
market relations of dependence—some agents depend on access that another market entity
controls. Economic dependence exposes the weaker agent to the dictates of the undertaking
that controls the facility. This control leads to abuse and unfair trade practices. To address
and remedy these abuses, SMP authority belongs within the competition policy framework.

        Following this logic, it is important, therefore, to determine if an essential facility
exists or some feature of the infrastructure in the market that is under inquiry. If such a
facility or feature exists, does one market agent control or own it? Does another undertaking,
which does not control that feature, depend on access to that facility or some aspect of the
market infrastructure in a way that it has no other options than to have access to it?

       While this chapter stops at these questions. However, it is important to point out that
the competition authority is not done if it answers affirmatively to these questions before
it should it act and apply remedies to rectify this abuse. The competition agency must also
ask and answer whether the undertaking controlling that facility leverage that control to
dictate ‘unfair’ terms of trade? Finally, if it is so, are these ‘unfair’ terms negatively affecting
consumer welfare? If the answer to all of these is unequivocally yes, then the competition
authority has grounds to act.

                                                    Economic dependence

       Some point out that controlling a large share of the market, or simply being big, may
not be the only way to wield market power. If an undertaking had control of a crucial feature
of a market, say infrastructure, which all other undertakings needed in order to participate
in that market, the control of that feature may temp that undertaking to bargain hard with

power under the Community regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services.’ (2002/C165/03).

(Last accessed January 12, 2014).
90 More specifically, proponents point to the fact that the term ‘significant market power’ is associated to issues of ‘essential facilities’
and the leveraging of market power through the control of this type of facility to other related markets.
                                                                    62

others over the use of that infrastructure to prevent them from competing too hard against
him. More generally, what if a firm, not necessarily dominant, built contractual relations
with another undertaking to an extent that the latter undertaking becomes dependent on the
first firm. Would the imbalance in economic dependence not likely lead to abusive behavior
and unfair trading practices? These scenarios are only meant to highlight that market power
may not necessarily be associated with having a large share of a market. Rather control of
something essential for others to participate in the market or economic dependence can also
bestow superior bargaining power even on a non-dominant entity.

Figure 1: The blue monopolist controls an upstream market, essential facility and competes against the
green company for customers in the downstream market.




       An assessment of whether an undertaking is abusing its superior bargaining power
may want to consider the features of a market described in the scenarios as well. This means
going beyond the dominance test provided by the EC; namely, finding increases in prices
above the competitive level for a significant period of time. What follows is a discussion of
the theoretical basis for these concepts of superior bargaining position, abuse and even the
‘unfair’ in the term unfair trading practices. However, these are discussed in this section
though issues of how to empirically identify these features of a market are not addressed
here.

        There are cases, of interest and study to economists, where agents have no (short-
term) option other than to undertake a transaction with another particular agent; usually
a monopolist. Knowing that no substitute exists; the monopolist can either extract a very
high price for agreement or refuse to deal altogether. This may be considered to be an abuse
of dominance which leads to unfair trading practices (dictating the terms of contract or
refusing to deal). In this case, some economists argue that government intervention may be
justified otherwise consumers would be harmed by a lack of choices, feeble competition and
the resulting higher prices. It is instructive to understand the conditions in which this type
of transaction can exist to ascertain whether similar conditions exists in other markets and
economic arguments can be made to justify government intervention there as well.

                                         Essential facility

       The clearest example where agents have no option other than to undertake a
transaction is when one market agent owns or controls an essential facility or aspect of
the market infrastructure required to operate in that market. The price charged for the
use of that essential facility or the refusal to allow access to it altogether distorts market
competition. The term ‘essential facility’ is a regulatory term, not one that comes from
competition policy. Under the essential facilities doctrine (EFD), governments set prices
for access and compel the owner(s) of an ‘essential’ or ‘bottleneck’ facility to provide access
to that facility. For example, such a doctrine may specify when a railroad must be made

                                                 63
ADDRESSING UNFAIR TRADING PRACTICES IN BULGARIA

available on reasonable terms to a rival rail company or an electricity transmission grid
to a rival electricity generator. The concept of essential facilities requires there to be two
markets, often expressed as an upstream market and a downstream market. Typically, one
firm is active in both markets and other firms are active or wish to become active in the
downstream market. A downstream competitor wishes to buy an input from the integrated
firm, but is refused. An EFD defines those conditions under which the integrated firm will
be mandated to supply access to the bottleneck facility.

        Government intervention is justified in that it is believed that the owner of that
bottleneck facility has superior bargaining power and will not negotiate in good faith.
Furthermore, since the agent soliciting access to that facility is ‘economically dependent’ on
its use, they may be willing to accept bargains that are economically unjustifiable and thwart
their ability to compete on even footing with the undertaking that controls that facility.

       While the arguments in favor of government intervention under the EFD are
compelling, it is important to understand the narrow set of conditions that must exist
before a facility is considered ‘essential’ and therefore justifies this intervention. Were a
competition authority to justify application of remedies and sanctions based on control of an
essential facility, or something like it, non-arbitrary enforcement under EFD would compel
the authority to discover the following conditions:

     •	 Control of a facility by an undertaking;

     •	 Others cannot practically or reasonably duplicate this facility;

     •	 The undertaking denies facility access to others; and

     •	 Facility access to others is technically and economically feasible.

                                              Superior bargaining power

        The conditions listed above, to base non-arbitrary findings of an essential facility, are precise
and unlikely to exist in many unregulated markets. The question then is: Can competition
authorities justify findings of unfair trading practices based on essential facilities arguments?
This is not straightforward. It is unclear that anyone has attempted to make an essential
facilities argument as the basis for abuse and unfair trading practices to characterize
economic relations between retailers with market power and their suppliers. However,
rather viewing the issue of unfair trading practices stemming from abuse of the superior
bargaining position control of an essential facility provides, arguments compelling access or
contractual relations have been made by appealing to a doctrine of ‘economic dependence’
and superior bargaining power.

        In the case of buyer-supplier relations, the main criterion for the finding of a
situation of economic dependence consists in the absence, for the dependent undertaking,
of alternative solutions to sell or to purchase its products in the market—in this way, the
use of economic dependence is associated with ‘essential facility. The impossibility to find
other sales outlets indicates that the undertaking is dependent on the buyer.91 The economic
dependence in this case derives either from the high concentration of the market or from the
special features of the bilateral relation between the undertaking and the buyer.

91 Of course, under franchise agreements, this is exactly what takes place, but the franchise is granted benefits for agreeing to this
exclusivity and enters the contract voluntarily.
                                                                 64
                                                         GUIDANCE, CONCEPTS AND ISSUES

       It must be noted that the existence of a dominant undertaking does not preclude
other undertakings from being competitive and offering alternative deals to the dominant
undertaking’s customers or suppliers. In the absence of specific factors, be they contractual
or technical, that impede the customer or supplier from switching, the former can replace
the dominant firm as a business partner. It confirms the idea that economic dependence
relates to a bilateral relationship between contractual parties.

        If the dependence results only from the specificities of the relationship between the
contracting parties, finding of economic dependence during market assessments does not
relate to the market structure, or to the level of competition within a relevant market. Other
factors are responsible for the economic dependence, such as the existence of specialized
assets, lock-in and other forms of high switching costs.

        However, switching costs are a short-term issue and possibly an issue of imperfect
information. Once a deal has been struck and the cost of switching has been revealed, it
is difficult to understand why an undertaking can be economically dependent on another
in the long-term. These are issues that must be resolved before the concept of ‘economic
dependence’ makes sense from an economics perspective. Economic dependence is based
on the assertion that the buyer or supplier cannot be easily substituted or avoided. However,
given a sufficiently long time horizon, it may be possible to avoid that economic relation and
develop others. Once the door to this argument is opened, the standard of whether economic
dependence exists no longer a matter of answering a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ question. Now, the answer
may also have to include caveats such as ‘it depends’ and incorporate considerations about
how long these economic relations have existed and how have they changed, if at all.

        This insight is instructive. It can be reasonably argued that changing contracts with
little notice can be seen as abusive and contract law does indeed address remedies to this
when parties are subject to such unilateral behavior. A bargain which has been accepted
by both parties, but when revealed is more costly than beneficial to one party is likely to
only happen once (a one-shot deal). Alternatively, if a party, time and time again, enters
a negotiation and accepts to bargain with an agent that they have previously considered
abusive may be evidence that this is in fact not the case. The losing agent will either leave
the bargaining table or refuse to even approach the table in the first place. The other agent’s
refusal to agree or to even bargain is unlikely to be a good long-term strategy for the agent
that received all of the benefits and fewer of the costs in the previous round. The desire of
wanting to negotiate in a subsequent round reveals that the ‘winning’ agent would benefit
from what the ‘losing’ agent has to offer. In other words, competition authorities will have
to address internally consistent models of abuse of superior bargaining power, from the
perspective of the party in the superior position, in cases where the ‘dependent’ party loses,
economically, as a result of the deal struck and agreed to. The competition authority, as
well, will have to address the issue of why the ‘dependent’ or losing party continues to
engage in bargaining with the agent with superior bargaining power more than once.

       Taking an example from a monopsony buyer striking bargains with many competing
suppliers, the ability of the buyer to reduce prices below a supplier’s normal selling price, or
more generally the ability to obtain terms of supply more favorable than a supplier’s normal
terms may seem to be an appealing way to define superior bargaining power, but calls into
question the level of competition that existed in the retailer’s market before the concession.
The normal selling price, in turn, is defined as the supplier’s profit-maximizing price in the
absence of buyer power. In the case where there is perfect competition among suppliers, the
normal selling price of a supplier is the competitive price. In a perfectly competitive market,
                                              65

firms set prices equal to marginal costs. Prices lower than that are unacceptable and the
firm exits the market. A deal that is accepted with a party abusing its superior bargaining
position means that the buyer monopsonist is pushing supplier prices closer to competitive
levels. If this is the case, it would be difficult to build an economically sensible model of
this bargaining behavior in a way that elaborates how this conduct harms competition and
consumers.

        Unexpected losses is one instance where bargaining theory and concerns about superior
bargaining power and dependence can be consistent with continual dealings between parties
rather than a one-shot deal. In addition, unexpected losses may signal bargains about who
takes on the risk when negative events take place. Rather than bargaining over price, the
nature of bargains over risk can be an issue of concern to government authorities. The issue
of public policy concern is most apparent if one party (the one with superior bargaining
power) has better information about the likelihood of negative events and/or can affect the
probability of these events but does not reveal or share that information to the ‘dependent’
party and this affects their willingness to agree on how to share that risk—favorably for the
firm that has the information and unfavorably for the firm that does not. The manifestations
of risk transference can be many. Delaying payments can be one. Cost sharing arrangements
between parties for advertising can be another.

        In sum, the term significant market power is a regulatory term based on the existence of
an essential facility. Governments have extended that term into the area of competition policy
and used it to describe bilateral relations of economic dependence and superior bargaining
power. The concept of economic dependence makes sense as a short-term phenomenon
but it is difficult to square as a long-term problem. Superior bargaining power can indeed
explain the deals that are made once between an economically more powerful undertakings
against less powerful ones. However, it would be an unlikely explanation for a continuous,
long-term pattern of poor bargains in the view of the losing undertaking. Finally, the issue
of economic dependence is based on the absence of no outside options. For suppliers, this
means that they are forced to deal with the buyer with whom they established economic
relations. To buttress arguments of economic dependence and superior bargaining power,
however, the competition authority has to go beyond findings of ‘significant market power’
but also show that there are sufficient barriers to entry for an outside option to emerge.
These are the issues discussed in the next section.

                                                      GUIDANCE, CONCEPTS AND ISSUES

                                       Conclusions

        Significant market power is a concept that defines market power at a lower threshold
than that of dominance. Significant market power characterizes situations several firms
are big enough to affect market outcomes and act as if they were dominant players in the
market. In presenting this concept as a way to address market power issues in the retail
sector, many important questions are raised.

       To address some of these open questions, some have proposed that significant market
power in retail markets is exercised through the economic dependence suppliers have on
large retailers. Large players can substantially affect the fortunes of their suppliers when
they threaten not to buy or to reduce their purchases. When threatened this way, suppliers
have few options other than to accept the terms dictated by these retailers. This superior
bargaining position that results from economic dependence can be abused and lead to the
unfair trading practices that the Government of Bulgaria aims to address.

       While the introduction of these concepts of economic dependence and superior
bargaining power fill in the gaps of how SMP authority may address unfair trading practices,
these concepts are difficult to square with the EC Guideline emphasis on applying remedies
where there is sufficient evidence of consumer, not supplier harm. Mapping SMP, economic
dominance and superior bargaining power into the framework that the EC Guidelines
provide is the task of the next section.

                                      ASSESSING SMP

       Appropriate, non-arbitrary enforcement of the SMP concept requires first a clear
definition of the ‘relevant market’ in which market power can be exercised. One step ahead
of that, however, is the need to understand the market and behavior of concern. In the
case of public policy concern in Bulgaria, the issue is over unfair practices in the upstream
market—the market in which the retailer buys from suppliers. However, the EC Guidelines
emphasize harm to consumers, in the downstream market where the retailer sells in the
downstream market. It is therefore unclear in which market the market power assessment
is to be carried out. For the purposes of the discussion here, the downstream market will
be assessed. It is assumed that if market power exists in the retail market, the retailer can
‘leverage’ that power into the upstream market. When pursuing a case, however, the
competition authority will have to make and empirically support this argument explicitly.

Figure 2: Harm takes place in the downstream market but abuse allegedly takes place in the upstream
market. Where to do the market power assessment?




       Once the public policy questions establish the market and behavior in question,
defining the relevant market begins by identifying the products and undertakings which are
directly competing against each other. Once the relevant market is defined, the assessment
of market power is confined within each market.

       At present, the policy interest in Bulgaria is on assessing SMP in buyer-supplier
relations in the retail sector. For this reason, these particular relations are the focus of the
discussion here. However, for application of SMP in the competition policy framework
should be market and sector neutral. The discussion here is not neutral in this way, and
would have to be adapted for other sectors and markets.

       With respect to buyer-supplier relations, the exercise of market power happens
in the upstream market, where abuse is based on superior bargain position or economic
dependence in that (upstream) market. The supposition is that market power is exercised
by the buyer because the supplier has no option other than to deal with the buyer. However,
the buyer is deemed to have significant market power in the retail (downstream) market but
leverages that market power in another market; the upstream market against her suppliers.
In the case of buyer-supplier relations, the alleged abuse takes place in a market different
from the one in which an undertaking is deemed to have SMP.

       An assessment of dominance or SMP must take into account the competitive structure
of the market, and in particular the following factors:

       •	 Constraints imposed by the existing supplies from, and the position on the market
          of, actual competitors (the market position of the dominant undertaking and its
          competitors);

       •	 Constraints imposed by the credible threat of future expansion by actual
          competitors or entry by potential competitors (expansion and entry); and

       •	 Constraints imposed by the bargaining strength of the undertaking's customers
          (countervailing buyer power).

                                       Relevant market

       Market definition in retailing tends to be more complicated than it is in manufacturing.
The standard economic test for defining the ‘relevant economic market’ for a given product
revolves around the ability of a ‘hypothetical monopolist’ to raise the price of that product
by a small but significant amount, without losing so much custom to other products to make
the move unprofitable. The general principle is that those substitute goods to which the
consumers would switch, in the face of a price rise, should be considered part of the same
economic market.

       When examining competition in retailing considering the ‘physical product’
dimension is only part of the picture. For most categories of consumer goods, the retailing
activity is also very important and is a constituent part of the end-product which consumers
purchase. This means that retailer markets need to be defined in terms of both dimensions:
the physical product and the retailing activity.

        An additional difficulty exists in applying the standard market definition because
retailers compete in many different dimensions, and not just price. This means that to
focus on price alone distorts market definition, especially if the various economies of scale
and scope that are common in retailing mean that competition between retailers occurs at
different levels for the different dimensions of competition (or even at different levels at the
same time for a single dimension of competition).

       This section discusses these problems in some detail, and suggests some possible
solutions. It is crucial to consider in any enquiry exactly what aspect of competition is
important, and in what way competition is threatened by the behavior of the firms under
scrutiny. It is best not to take market definitions in a vacuum. Indeed, there may be several
possible market definitions, each of which is valid for looking at a particular issue.

        The next section summarizes a well-used market definition methodology. Following
that, comments on the nature of retail end-product suggest that it is important to consider
market definition with respect to the retailing activity involved as well as the physical
product. The discussion points out the need for more rigorous application the relevant
market definition methodology to the retail sector, taking into account both the physical
product dimension and the retailing activity dimension. Adding dimensions to the definition
of what constitutes a relevant market is one way to address concerns about rigor.

                                         Market definition

       The most used methodology for defining the relevant economic market is based on
the United States Department of Justice ‘small but significant and non-transitory increase
in price’ (or SSNIP) test. Essentially, it defines the market by asking the following question:

        Starting from prevailing price levels, what is the smallest set of goods or services and
geographical area such that if the supply of these goods or services in this geographical area were to be
in the hands of a single firm (or ‘hypothetical monopolist’) then they would be susceptible to a ‘small
but significant and non-transitory increase in price’ (or SSNIP)?

       The above is similar to the European Commission’s market analysis procedure:

       •	 Tentatively define the product market by determining whether two products
          belong in the same market.

       •	 Tentatively define the geographic market in terms of competitors’ market shares,
          prices, and price differentials.

       •	 Conduct a more detailed analysis of demand-side and supply-side substitutability.

       •	 Determine whether customers can switch to an alternate product or supplier in
          response to a small (5-10 percent) increase in price; the small but significant and
          non-transitory price increase” (SSNIP) test. If they can, the market definition is
          widened to include the alternatives.

       •	 Determine whether other suppliers can readily switch to providing the alternate
          product in the relevant market.

       •	 Further investigate the conditions in which competing firms operate. This may
          entail exploring the recent past activities of those firms, consumer behavior
          and preferences (through demand elasticities and other studies), regulatory or
          market barriers to entry, market segmentation and the viability of efficient price
          discrimination.

       •	 Use consultations with firms and consumers and on-the-spot inspections to
          further inform and refine the market definition analysis.

        A relevant market must be measured in terms of its participants and concentration.
Participants include firms currently producing or selling the market's products in the
market's geographic area. In addition, participants may include other firms depending on
their likely supply responses to a SSNIP. A firm is viewed as a participant if, in response
to SSNIP, it likely would enter rapidly into production or sale of a market product in the
market's area, without incurring significant sunk costs of entry and exit. Firms likely to make
any of these supply responses are considered to be "uncommitted" entrants because their
supply response would create new production or sale in the relevant market and because
that production or sale could be quickly terminated without significant loss. Uncommitted
entrants are capable of making such quick and uncommitted supply responses that they
likely influenced the market premerger, would influence it post-merger, and accordingly
are considered as market participants at both times. This analysis of market definition and
market measurement applies equally to foreign and domestic firms.

       Finally, for the purposes of identifying the ‘relevant market’ in which a firm or
undertaking exercises SMP, it worth pointing out the Commission’s emphasis on consumer
harm. To the point, if an undertaking is found to have SMP and the exercise of its market
power damages competitors, not competition and not consumers, then the Commission
advises that respective competition authorities proceed with caution. Alternatively, it would
be best to show that the exercise of market power damages competition and in this way
harms consumers, or more directly, that there is a straight line from the exercise of market
power to consumer harm. The case of buyer-supplier relations that concerns policymakers
in Bulgaria at present, it is not clear that this argument about consumer harm and its relation
to the relevant market can be made directly. In fact, this requires arguments about the
leveraging of market power in one market to affect the other market, where consumers
interact with the entity with market power.

        This methodology (both the US and EC) is now accepted by most competition
authorities and it is well-known and used by the Bulgarian competition authority. However,
there are some issues that are likely to make its application more difficult in the retail sector.
Namely; (i) the methodology for market definition is product-, as opposed to activity-,
based; (ii) the methodology is price-, as opposed to other dimensions of competition, based;
and (iii) it takes insufficient account of the strategic and competitive behavior of companies
in the face of economies of scale and scope across economic markets. These problems are not
unique to retailing, but they are particularly prevalent in this sector.
       Because this methodology for defining markets was designed with manufacturing
industries in mind, it focuses on the physical product. In retailing, however, this can lead
to problems. Two identical physical products may be defined as being in different retailer
markets, because of differences in retail service, geographical location, time of purchase,
product (even brand) selection or other differences in competitive strategy.
        Within retailing, therefore, it is important to define markets both in terms of the
physical product and in terms of the associated retailing activity. A more rigorous analysis
of the retailing activity offered by each type of retailer may want to consider both:
       •	 the transactions costs attached for the consumer of making the purchase (which
          must be considered part of the total cost of the purchase); and
       •	 The nature of the buying decision which may render a particular channel
          inherently more suitable for selling certain products to certain consumers.
       Because of these issues, it is particularly important to expand the dimensions by
which a market is defined as one retail market. In retail, brand, service, the time of purchase,
locations, choices, etc. are all important. These dimensions suggest that retail market may
need to be defined with more dimensions than what would be appropriate for other sectors.
New Zealand’s competition authority defines markets in terms of five dimensions (see
Figure 3, below):
   •	 The goods or services supplied and purchased (the product dimension);
   •	 The geographic area from which the goods or services are obtained, or within which
      the goods or services are supplied (the geographic dimension);
   •	 The level in the production or distribution chain (the functional dimension);
   •	 The time frame or timing within which the market operates, where relevant (the
      temporal dimension); and
   •	 The different customer types within a market, where relevant (the customer
      dimension).

                                Assessment of barriers to entry

       Retail consumers tend to be relatively small, their search is costly and that costly
search often leaves them imperfectly informed about prices, options, brands, quality, etc.
This couple with the complex vertical nature of economic relations between retailers and
their suppliers translates into markets that are unlikely to work perfectly and thus have
some competition problems. However, the detrimental effects of such competition problems
will depend on the size of the barriers to entry into the retail markets. If entry is easy, then
the potential for retailers to exploit market imperfections will be limited. The assessment
of barriers to entry in retailing is of particular importance when assessing the potential
exercise of market power, since the ability of a dominant retailer to exploit its power will be
strongly dependent on the height of barriers to entry into the market.

       Identification of barriers to expansion or entry is important in determining whether
market power can be exercised. As the EC states, “(b)arriers to expansion or entry can take
various forms. They may be legal barriers, such as tariffs or quotas, or they may take the
form of advantages specifically enjoyed by the dominant undertaking, such as economies
of scale and scope, privileged access to essential inputs or natural resources, important
technologies or an established distribution and sales network. They may also include costs
and other impediments, for instance resulting from network effects, faced by customers
in switching to a new supplier. The dominant undertaking's own conduct may also create
barriers to entry, for example where it has made significant investments which entrants or
competitors would have to match, or where it has concluded long-term contracts with its
customers that have appreciable foreclosing effects. Persistently high market shares may be
indicative of the existence of barriers to entry and expansion.”

      No analysis of a market or industry; and in particular an assessment of market
power and entry barriers, can avoid an analysis of strategic competition, because it is this
that determines entrants’ expectations of the profitability of entry, and ultimately their
entry decisions. The analysis of strategic interaction is necessary to an understanding of
industry structure and concentration, and in particular analysis of post-entry competition is
fundamental to an assessment of entry conditions.

       The strategic interaction between agents is likely to be market specific; i.e., the
characteristics of the market, technology, cost functions, customers and particulars of the
products will largely determine the nature of competition. Since this document is concerned
with the issues of identification of market power in the retail sector, it is best to limit the
focus to that sector. The economic characteristics of retailing are sufficiently different to
likely warrant a different approach by competition authorities where the importance of
geographical location, product range, and retailer services/image (brand) is prominent.
On the consumer side, issues of consumer information, search costs, and the quality of
advertising and pricing are key and likely to be different from other sectors.

       How is the issue of barriers to entry and/or expansion relevant to the issues of SMP
and abuse of superior bargaining power that lead to unfair trading practices? The issue
of economic dependence, the basis on which proponents of expanding SMP authority in
competition policy frameworks, is based on the notion that the dependent entity has no
option other than the deal or bargain presented to it by the agent with superior bargaining
power. The notion of ‘no other option’ can only exist if there are barriers to entry which
prevent that alternative option from emerging. Note that the entry can come from the
weaker party itself into the market that the agent with superior bargaining power serves.
In the case of buyer and supplier relations, the wholesaler would enter the retail market in
response to the poor option that its current buyer presents it.

                                             Barriers to entry considerations

       In this section, the methodology developed by Harbord and Hoehn (1994)92 to assess
barriers to entry is discussed. Where necessary, this methodology is adapted to address the
particular issues of barriers to entry likely to be prominent in the retail sector.

      The Harbord and Hoehn divide barriers to entry into a number of groups. Firstly,
between:
          •	 Entry barriers (which prevent entry); and
          •	 Entry impediments (which delay entry).
          Within the category of entry barriers, the methodology distinguishes between:
          •	 Absolute advantages; and
          •	 Strategic (first mover) advantages.93

      Within strategic (first mover) advantages, the authors distinguish five categories.
These can be recast for the purposes of retailing as:
          •	 Economies of scale and scope;
          •	 Advertising and product/retailer differentiation
          •	 Switching costs;
          •	 Capital requirements;
          •	 Vertical foreclosure and exclusion; and
          •	 Predatory pricing.




92 Harbord, D. and T Hoehn (1994) ‘Barriers to entry and exit in European competition policy,’ International Review of Law and
Economics, 14, 411-435.
93 Bain (1956) thought it appropriate to distinguish between blocked and deterred entry. Blocked entry occurs where the incumbents
behave exactly as they would if there were no threat of entry, but where, even so, the market is not attractive to entrants. Deterred entry,
by contrast, involves the incumbent retailers modifying their behavior in order to thwart entry. This distinction is not followed here.
                                                                    73
ADDRESSING UNFAIR TRADING PRACTICES IN BULGARIA

       Altogether, Harbord and Hoehn distinguish seven categories of entry barriers/
impediments, each of which must be examined in any competition enquiry.94 For the
purposes of this paper, predatory pricing and vertical issues are not considered since they
are squarely competition issues.

                                           Economies of scale and scope

        Economies of scale and scope in retailing are rather different from those which exist
in production, but they can act as barriers to entry in exactly the same way. This requires
that investments, once deployed, are sunk. If investments are not sunk, an incumbent
retailer faces a pre-commitment problem: it wants ex ante to threaten to compete vigorously
to maintain its current sales levels after entry, in order to make entry seem unprofitable;
but ex post, in the face of actual entry, it may have an incentive to accept lower sales and
not fight. Fixed costs (economies of scale) per se are not enough to commit the incumbent
to behaving aggressively post-entry (shops can be sold, for example). However, if these
costs are sunk, the story changes. Because the costs are sunk, and not recoupable, it may
be profitable, even ex post, for the incumbent to fight to maintain sales, and this means that
entry can be deterred.

       Examples of economies of scale and scope which may act as barriers to entry in retailing
include:

         •	 Economies of scope in floor space: The importance of one-stop shopping has
            increased the importance to retailers in some markets of stocking wide product
            ranges, which generally requires significant floor space;

         •	 Economies of scale in logistics: There are many of these, from minimum delivery
            orders, to the ability to use sales staff efficiently, and to the ability to reduce
            inventories (as a proportion of turnover);

         •	 Economies of scope in distribution: For some sorts of retailing (especially where
            fast and efficient delivery is crucial as with fresh foods and newspapers), it is
            important for retailers to control their own distribution networks. There may be
            significant sunk costs and economies of scale in establishing distribution systems.
            However, once a distribution system is set up, it can supply extra stores and extra
            products at minimal incremental cost;

         •	 Economies of scope due to store networks: In some retail markets, consumers
            prefer to buy from chain stores, on the grounds that they know what to expect
            and sometimes because they can exchange inappropriate purchases (and gift
            tokens) elsewhere in the country; and

         •	 Economies of scale due to retailer bargaining power: Larger retailers may be able
            to obtain better deals from upstream manufacturers than smaller retailers can.

       In order to assess whether economies of scale and scope of these sorts provide a
barrier to entry into any particular retail market, it is first necessary to determine the degree
to which costs are sunk, which will in turn determine what would happen post-entry.

94 Harbord and Hoehn (1994) also provide a seven step method of analyzing entry barriers, which groups together three of the above
categories (economies of scale and scope; advertising, goodwill and market positioning; and capital requirements). However, for the
purposes of this document, these various categories are kept separate.
                                                               74

       After determining the extent to which fixed costs are sunk, it is necessary to compare
these sunk costs with the size of the retailer market. In this regard, retailing has two important
characteristics. On the one hand, the importance of geographical location means that many
economic markets are relatively local, and thus fairly small. Thus, sunk costs need not be
especially high in order to restrict entry. In fact, the sunk costs involved in setting up a
single local retailer tend to be relatively low, and entry is relatively easy at the local level.

        On the other hand, economies of scale and scope mean that many strategic markets
are national (or at least regional), covering a number of local economic markets. Strategic
retailer markets may also include a number of different economic product markets. The
sunk costs involved in entering these strategic markets may be extremely high.

                              Strategic (first mover) advantages

       The sunk costs involved in advertising, goodwill, and retailer differentiation provide
a further source of barriers to entry in retailing, which work by shrinking the residual
demand that a potential entrant would face, or by raising the sunk costs of entry.

     Advertising
       A retailer’s image is important. In many retail markets, it is crucial. But retailer image
can be promoted in other – generally less costly – ways than above-the-line advertising.
Rather, the most important factors in promoting retailer image are product range and prices,
store design and atmosphere, and the quality of service. These may act as barriers to entry,
but given that they are part and parcel of the retailing activity, they are unlikely to keep out
any retailers that stand to be successful.

        The need to acquire a strong retailer image may deter some types of entry more easily
than others. Firstly, economies of scale in advertising mean that, in those retail markets
where advertising is important, effective small-scale entry may be difficult, with entry
only possible by large entrants which can exploit these economies of scale, and which have
sufficient capital to carry out large advertising campaigns.

       Secondly, while the need to achieve a strong retailer image can clearly be a strong
barrier to pure new entry, it may not prevent entry into a retail market by retailers from other
markets, which already have a strong brand name in those markets (as long as the brand
name is appropriate to the new market and is transferable). Indeed, strong retailer brand
name can also allow them to enter into upstream product markets, as direct competition
against branded manufacturers.

     Switching costs
       Switching costs cover a number of different costs which consumers may face in
changing from one retailer to another. Some of these costs are natural in the sense that may
stem from the desire not to travel, the familiarity with a particular store’s layout, or from the
accumulated goodwill of the retailer. Alternatively, they can be strategic in the sense that
they are based on free gift schemes, customer loyalty cards or bundling. In either case, they
can be important barriers to entry.

       To the extent that switching costs are natural, there may be little that the competition
authorities can do to reduce them. Indeed, it is anyway not obvious that it would be desirable
to reduce such switching costs.

                                    Capital requirements

       There is some debate about whether capital requirements really constitute barriers
to entry. However, they can certainly be important in slowing entry. To the extent that
large incumbent multiple retailers are able to raise capital more easily than subsequent
entrants, this may be important. However, it is not clear that capital market imperfections
are particularly problematic in the retail sector.

     Entry impediments
       Entry impediments are any factors which delay the process of entry into a market
without increasing the (sunk) costs of entry, or creating an asymmetry between incumbents
and entrants. They are not entry barriers, but they may be important to antitrust decisions,
because they influence the amount of time that incumbents may exercise market power
before entry occurs.

       Good examples of entry impediments are licensing, certification or product
registration requirements which involve little or no actual costs, but take significant amounts
of time to satisfy. Other examples include the time required to obtain contracts (i.e. where
the market’s products are sold via long-term contracts) or gain a market share large enough
to significantly influence the behavior of incumbents.

      Certification requirements are only important in a few retail markets (pharmacies, for
example). Planning permission may be more important as an entry impediment. However,
the most important entry impediment in the retail sector is probably the time it takes for a
new retailer to establish itself with customers, particularly if reputation is important

                                        Conclusions

       This section listed and reviewed the economic arguments that would support a
finding of significant market power in a competition policy market assessment of the retail
sector. Using the concepts that are often used to explain how significant market power is
exercised—namely, through a superior bargaining position that stems from sufficiently
large size in the relevant market—and what features markets would exhibit that supports
this exercise of market power—namely, economic dependence, the task was to formulate
coherent arguments that are in line with the EC Guidelines.

        This review revealed that coherent and economically consistent arguments to tie
these concepts together can be formulated for an extremely narrow set of circumstances;
narrow with respect to the unlikelihood to exist for every bilateral relation between retailer
and supplier, narrow in that the circumstances in which these circumstances can exist,
and, finally, narrow in the window of opportunity in time that a retailer can continuously
exploits supplier in the same way. With respect to the latter, the circumstances that would
grant the chance to exploit a supplier, it is difficult to understand why suppliers would not
shift strategies to change unfavorable conditions to ones that are more advantageous to
them. Indeed, it is hard to see the advantage the retailers gain from running their suppliers
out of business unless they are comparatively inefficient to other suppliers.

      Based on this narrow and ephemeral set of circumstances that may provide retailers
the opportunity to unfairly trade with their suppliers, the next section addresses the data,
and some of the analyses, needed to discover if these circumstances do indeed exist.

                                           INDICATORS AND DATA

       The proposed changes to the competition policy were prompted by concerns with
the functioning of retail markets in Bulgaria. While market power evaluations should not be
sector-specific, the focus and discussion of the data and the techniques to analyze these data
are based on the special features of retail markets; namely, the ready availability of retail
and wholesale price data. Price data can be used to define the ‘relevant market’ and provide
indications of possible market power by examination of pass-through between wholesale
and retail markets.

                                     Relevant market and price correlations

       One important body of antitrust literature relies on the law of one price to develop
price co-movement tests for market definition. Price elasticity estimates are the preferred
tools for antitrust market definition as they provide direct evidence of market power. In
many practical settings data and time constraints prevent estimation of price elasticity
and force competition analysts to rely on less sophisticated tools. Tools for the analysis
of price co-movement represent one such a set of alternative tools. Stigler and Sherwin
(1985) represent an early attempt at formally investigating the use of the law of one price in
delineating antitrust markets. The law of one price posits that prices within a single market
should converge, allowing for some variability related to transport cost. Some authors
applying the law of one price have argued for relative price convergence rather than the
more stringent absolute price convergence as condition for market singularity: it is not that
prices in two regions of the same market should be equal, but that price adjustments in
one region should affect price adjustments in another region (Haldrup 2003). Regardless of
the type of convergence, analysts have questioned whether a market defined by reference
to prices and their statistical features is consistent with the concept of an antitrust market.
However, the econometric tools used to define markets through the use of price correlation
should be understood as exploratory tools not dispositive.

       As discussed above, the relevant market is defined by the cross elasticity of demand
or cross-price elasticity of demand. The elasticities measure the responsiveness of the
demand for a good to a change in the price of another good.95 To make the relevant market
determination, however, consumption data are needed. Since it is assumed that this type of
detailed consumption data are difficult to obtain, the proposed analysis make use of readily
available retail and wholesale price data that governments are likely to already be collecting.




95 It is measured as the percentage change in demand for the first good that occurs in response to a percentage change in price of the
second good.
                                                                 77

      To determine the boundaries of the relevant market using a time series of price data,
the following example is provide looking at Retailer A, B, C and D all selling exactly the
same product. The data are presented and graphed in Table 1. The goal is to determine the
relative time series correlation of price across these retailers. The correlation between price
movements in Retailer A and Retailer B is approximately 0.75. This is a fairly high correlation,
indicating that price movements are not independent of each other. In comparison, Retailer
A and Retailer C have a time series correlation of -0.07 and Retailer B and Retailer C a
correlation of 0.03, suggesting that prices move independently of each other. It is important
to know the relatively high time series correlation between Retailer C and Retailer D. As
Table 1 (above) indicates, the price of the good in Retailer D is consistently higher than the
price of the same good in Retailer C. Retailer D prices are also closer in level to prices in
Retailer A and B most of the time in this series. Yet, the correlation is relatively higher for
Retailers C and D. This demonstrates for estimating correlations of price movements across
the price levels do not matter. Changes in prices across time, not levels, is what matters.

                                                                                                     INDICATORS AND DATA

       Economists, therefore, demarcate the boundaries of markets by studying the patterns
of consumers’ choices. One way to determine if two retailers are competing in the same
market is to examine consumer choices between products when prices change. Two or
more goods are said to be in the same market when the substitutability of each good is
perfect or near perfect. That satisfies the homogenous goods criteria mentioned above and
is based on the zero cost of information and transaction assumptions. When this is the case,
prices for one retailer’s goods will move in tandem with the prices of another retailer’s
prices. As discussed above, if this were not the case, the retailer charging the higher price
will lose all customers.

       Whenever the prices of two retailers do not move in tandem, economist can assume
that the retailers are in different markets. This is how markets are demarcated using
prices. It is expected that much of the market segmentation that exists when examining the
movement of prices across locations is likely the result of physical barriers. Because larger
markets are likely to be more efficient, eliminating market segmentation that is caused by
physical isolation is a good policy objective. But there are few if any competition policy
issues to address.

       But not all retailers are within reach of all consumers. There are costs to getting to
different retailers and to transacting (bargaining) with different vendors. Furthermore, these
costs can vary by consumer, location or time in which a transaction is made. Consumers
will go to retailers where they can minimize these costs as long as prices are sufficiently
comparable across vendors. But market segmentation, also known as price discrimination,
can be the result of anti-competitive behavior as well. Because all retailers are not as equally
convenient to all consumers and because consumers’ willingness to pay for the same good
may varies as well, there are boundaries to markets.

        However, the proposed analysis does exploit behaviors across commodities to
identify where different goods, say rice compared to sugar, do exhibit different patterns
of market segmentation. One would not expect that patterns of price movements between
three retailers of sugar, whose prices behave in ways that lead to the conclusion that they
are in different markets, would differ when looking at prices for rice. The physical barriers
for rice and sugar should be the same across commodities. This expectation is explored to
understand if some goods markets exhibit more market segmentation than others.

                                           Pass-through and market power

       Pass-through refers to that change in price that occurs in response to a change in
wholesale price of a product. Conventional wisdom holds that increases in wholesale prices
are passed through to retail prices. This is generally correct. However, the timing of the
pass-through, from the time costs change to the time these changes are reflected in the retail
price, nor about the extent of that pass-through; how much of these changes in costs are
passed on to the consumer.

       More importantly of interest to competition economists are interested in knowing
whether a greater proportion of rising wholesale prices are passed on to the retail price than
the proportion of costs reflected in retail prices when costs go down—what economists call
asymmetric pass-through. These asymmetries may suggest some market power or collusion
when prices indicate proportionately greater and earlier increases than decreases.96
96 The prices established will satisfy the equation p(1 + (l/η)) = MR = MC, where p = price, MR is marginal revenue, MC represents
marginal costs and η = the elasticity of demand for the product in question. If elasticity is a constant, observing the change in marginal
                                                                   79

        Industrial organization research has been useful in examining the relationship
between cost or quantity adjustments and retail prices paid (Sumner (1981); Bulow and
Pfleiderer (1983); and Sullivan (1985)). If the pass-through of increasing producer or
wholesale prices to the retail level is far from incomplete and associated with notable
lags, this may be indicative of retailer buyer power and the likelihood of muted consumer
harm.97 However, these empirical tests, on their own, are not enough for any competition
authority to use without any other supporting evidence. As always, caution and non-hasty
conclusions are counseled before acting.

                                    Extent of pass-through and market power

        The timing and extent of this type of price pass-through can be another indication
of market power. A market characterized with perfect price competition means that any
exogenous change in the cost or wholesale price of a retail product, for example, will be passed
on to the customer dollar for dollar, euro for euro, or lev for lev.98 Because an individual
retailer in a competitive market cannot affect the price by increasing or decreasing supply for
goods it sells, it is said to face a horizontal, or perfectly elastic, demand curve.99 A perfectly
elastic demand curve means that if a retailer tries to raise its prices, even infinitesimally,
all demand for that retailer’s goods will shift to any retailer with lower prices. However, if
changes in costs are felt by all retailers at the same time to the same extent, all retailers will
pass on those costs to their buyers. In technical terms, because each retailer in a competitive
market faces an infinitely elastic demand curve, 100 percent (and not more) of a change in
costs will effectively be passed on to the price. For the case of a price increase, for example,
if increases in the costs of a good are not fully reflected in the retail price, the market was not
fully competitive to begin with. Retailers in a competitive market operate where economic
profits are zero. If they do not pass on 100 percent of the cost increase to the consumer, it
implies that retailers absorbed these costs increases, prices were therefore set above marginal
costs before the cost increase; violating the definition of a purely competitive market since
prices were above marginal costs, even if infinitesimally so.

       However, and unfortunately, there are markets in which a monopolist passes on 100
percent of the changes in costs to their customers. In comparison, in market where there is
no price competition and one retailer monopolizes the market, only 50 percent of any cost
increase is passed on to the customer.100

      Unfortunately, a 100 percent rate of pass-through may also be the case for a monopoly,
the opposite of a competitive market.


cost and the change in price enables one to infer the elasticity of demand perceived by the firm. Elasticity could then be used as a proxy
for the firm’s market power. But this technique turns out to be of very limited applicability, however, because it is extremely sensitive
to the functional form assumed for the demand curve (see Bulow, J.I and P. Pfleiderer (1983) “A note on the effect of cost changes on
prices”, Journal of Political Economy, Vol. 91, No. 1: pp. 182-185.
97 An assessment of consumer welfare effects is rather complicated. Favorable effects can be the countervailing of upstream market
power, the pass-through of the achieved cost reductions to the end consumers, the increasing of the price elasticity of demand due to
stronger incentives to provide wider scope of products and to pursue intensive advertising by the buyer or the stronger incentives for
suppliers and/or competitors to adopt more efficient methods. There can be negative effects as well, but these are not so straightforward
and are harder to prove. First, if the buyer power raised the barriers to entry and/or to expansion, the incentives to improve quality and
to innovate can be diminished. Second, the asymmetric distribution of downstream market power can weaken the above mentioned
pass-through effect.
98 In a competitive market, each retailer faces an infinitely elastic demand curve. This means that all changes in the cost of the product
to the retailer will be passed on to the consumer.
99 A monopolist’s markup at its profit-maximizing price always equals the reciprocal of the elasticity of demand, times negative one.
100 This level of pass-through assumes a linear demand schedule.
                                                                   80

       Admittedly, in rare cases will a change in price of the wholesale or international
price be reflected 100 percent in a change in price, so economists will rarely face the issue
of indeterminacy between a competitive or monopolistic market based on analysis of pass-
through. However, this issue illustrates the point that demand and supply elasticities
determine the rate of pass-through and it is important to demonstrate how this is the case.101

        The point of the above exercise was to rigorously demonstrate how the nature of the
demand and supply curves will affect the amount of pass-through to retail prices that may
result from change in wholesale or international prices.

                                 Timing of pass-through and market power

        Theory would lead us to expect that price changes in one retailer would be met with
an instantaneous response in the same direction by competitors. This is not always so. In fact,
price reductions and price increases that result from changes in wholesale prices may signal
market power. Questions about when changes in wholesale price of products are reflected
in retail prices gets at issues of market power; specifically when there is asymmetry—price
increases are consistently reflected in retail prices faster than price reductions. When retail
outlets are fierce competitors, the prices charged for the same good sold across retailers will
be expected to move together over time through arbitrage or substitution or both.102

                                 Asymmetric price responses and market power

       Asymmetric price responses—when upward price response are less immediate than
the downward price response103 —has been used as a measure of market power as well.
However, the phenomenon has been many explanations so care is counseled in making
conclusions too quickly with this type of measure. Whereas some have claimed that this
phenomenon is more likely to be observed amongst firms with market power, recent
theoretical literature has shown that search costs may explain this occurrence in competitive
environments as well. These developments in theory and empirics have proposed and
tested three explanations for the asymmetry: namely, (i) oligopolistic market power and
coordination; (ii) the production and inventory cost of adjustment; and (iii) costly search
theory imperfect information and monopolistic competition.

       Other explanations for asymmetric price changes include the cost of adjustment
of production and inventory that cause the asymmetric response in retail prices. Other
explanations point to the fact that search models with Bayesian updating can generate
asymmetric price responses. According to this theory, an increase in the retail price raises
incentives to search for a lower priced retail outlet, while a decrease in the price lowers the
incentive to search. Different search rules of consumers influence the elasticity of a retailer’s
demand and this leads to the asymmetric response of retail prices. Others argue that market
power is not responsible for the asymmetry in price response. Any effect of market power
attributed to search costs and locational advantages may be viewed as the costs of product
differentiation under monopolistic competition.




101 See the Annex 4 for a technical explanation of why this is so.
102 From an econometric point of view, this would imply that prices of the commodity should be cointegrated.
103 There has been a lot of attention to the asymmetric response of prices to changes in input or wholesale prices—mostly in the
gasoline and agricultural product markets.
                                                              81

       Competition authority may want to see if the observed asymmetric response to prices
as a possible exercise of market that harms consumers. The econometric issues required to do
so are difficult. But while the analytical techniques have grown in complexity, they have also
improved in quality. An analysis of asymmetric can be an effective way to identify market
power, but caution is counseled in drawing quick conclusions. The econometric literature
is wide and developing on these techniques. A competition authority wanting to use these
types of price responses to detect the exercise of market power will require high levels of
specialized expertise in time series econometrics to do so. Finally, it is recommended that
this analysis is confirmed by other features of the market and that competition authorities
not rely solely on this evidence to act; no matter how robust the results of the analysis may
be.

                                                             Data

       The proposed analysis is based on data of retail and wholesale prices at the
establishment level. Geographic data elements are added to these monthly price data and
so is information on the type of outlet from where these prices are collected. Analyzing
the functioning of markets through time by outlet, location-specific and commodity
characteristics yield important patterns and clues about how much competition there is in
markets.

        Retail and wholesale price data are central to this diagnostic work. In order to carry
out the analysis, a database of several months of time series retail and wholesale price data
is best. The goal is to have a database that contains the data elements listed below.

      Commodity. The five digit class and subclass central product classification number
for the product. One example of this is provided by the United Nations, United Nations
Statistics Division, Central Product Classification, Ver.2.104 For best results, the commodity
must be classified in the Group, Class, and Subclass level (5-digit CPC).

     In addition to the purchase price of each good by establishment, the data must also
have the following elements:
                   •	        Quantity. The quantity of the good observed or purchased is required.
               •	      Unit of measurement. The unit of measurement used and the quantity
         observed. It can be a unit of volume like liters or quarts, of weight or mass such as
         pounds (lbs.) or grams, or a count such as 1, 2 or 10 bolts.
               •	     Date. The day, month and year in which the price data was collected.
         The periodicity of the data collection is important. Breaks in data are important to
         document and compensate for in the analysis.
               •	      GPS coordinate. The geographic location of the retailer/establishment
         from which the price was obtained can often be found and then recorded using a
         Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinate code. For example, this field will contain
         coordinate information to at least three digit second; for example; N 23043’691”, E 920
         28’376”.

              •	    Retailer. It is important to have coding for type of point of sale
       establishment from which the price point was received. With respect to the type of
       establishment, the list could include the following:

              ◦◦ Department store;

              ◦◦ Supermarket;

              ◦◦ Wholesale store;

              ◦◦ Discount store;

              ◦◦ Mini-market;

              ◦◦ Service station shop;

              ◦◦ Kiosk;

              ◦◦ Neighborhood shop;

              ◦◦ Market;

              ◦◦ Specialty shop;

              ◦◦ Publicly-owned shop; or

              ◦◦ Household.

      Goods that are commonly traded, where markets are thick with numerous consumers
and retailers, will be easier to analysis with more robust and conclusive results than
commodities that are not traded often.

        The market assessment must be aware of the complication of non-linear prices and
pro-competitive price discrimination and compensate for these. The market assessment
must also be cognizant of non-linearities such as increasing returns to scale, network effects
(the utility of each consumer increases as more consumers demand the same good or service)
or a high degree of good differentiation to avoid biases and inconsistencies in the results of
the calculated margins (these could be higher not because of collusion or market power but
because of economies scale, fixed costs and branding).

       Finally, there will be a need to consider consumer search costs in the empirical strategy
if the commodity has quality variations that are not easily discernible to the consumer.
Alternatively, even in commodities with few quality variations, if the search costs are
substantial in comparison to the cost of the final good (gasoline, is a good example), then
this must also be considered in the market assessment. Where search costs are high, there is
competition (monopolistic competition) for the market but not in the market.

                                         Conclusions

       The data and analysis presented in this section are most appropriate to assess market
power issues for the retail sector. The concept of significant market power, as applied
through the competition policy framework, presents some difficult conceptual and empirical
challenges. Overall, the refined economic analysis that this concept will require is likely to
lead to indeterminacy and indicative, not conclusive, evidence.

ADDRESSING UNFAIR TRADING PRACTICES IN BULGARIA

                                                    CONCLUSION

        Discussions during a technical workshop held in January 2014 revealed that
EU Member States apply different approaches to address UTP. Some Member States
address Unfair Trading Practices (UTP) outside their competition framework. In some,
commercial law or sector-specific legislation was designed to protect the weaker parties in
the contractual relationship105. In these cases, national competition authorities are given a
mandate to intervene in cases where sufficient public interest is affected by the respective
behavior of abusive market players. Other Member States do address UTP within the
competition policy framework, but not by introducing Significant Market Power (SMP),
but rather by applying the rules on ‘abuse of dominant market position’ to ‘economically
dependent’ relationships between buyers and their suppliers. It is unclear whether this way
of addressing UTP forces competition authorities to forgo addressing more compelling and
damaging competition issues. In the case of Bulgaria, however, treating UTP in the context
of antitrust law enforcement could politicize the work of the CPC, discredit it as an impartial
agency and would likely overburden it.

       UTP may be best understood and addressed as a contractual issue, requiring
targeted changes to commercial laws. Amending commercial laws, viewing UTP as
violation of contracts, and having the courts settle these would likely be a more effective
and direct remedy and would allow the Commission for Protection of Competition (CPC)
to focus on enforcement only in cases where the prevalence of UTP harms competition in
the market. In comparison, addressing UTP through the competition law framework leaves
unclear which legal instruments would be available to Bulgarian authorities and in line with
EU competition directives.

        The SMP concept, as applied through the competition policy framework, presents
some difficult conceptual and empirical challenges. Overall, the refined economic analysis
that this concept will require is likely to lead to indeterminacy and indicative, not conclusive,
evidence. While the introduction of the concept of ‘economic dependence’ and ‘superior
bargaining power’ fill in the gaps of how to employ the SMP concept to address UTP, these
concepts are difficult to square with the EC Guideline emphasis on applying remedies
where there is sufficient evidence of consumer, not supplier harm. The task was to formulate
coherent arguments that are in line with the EC Guidelines using the concepts to explain how
SMP is exercised, namely, through a superior bargaining position. It stems from sufficiently
large size in the relevant market—and what features markets would exhibit to support such
exercise of market power i.e., economic dependence. Coherent and economically consistent
arguments to tie these concepts together can be formulated only for an extremely narrow
set of circumstances, meaning, narrow with respect to the low probability to exist for every
bilateral relation between retailer and supplier; narrow in the sense that these circumstances
are unlikely to exist; and, finally, narrow in the window of opportunity in time that a retailer
can continuously exploit a supplier in the same way.




105 The Czech Republic and Hungary adopted sector-specific legislation that defines SMP and prohibits its abuse, granting certain
enforcement authorities to their national competition agencies. The proposed amendments to the Bulgarian Law on Protection of
Competition does not follow this approach. The draft bill proposes SMP concept as generally applicable competition law instrument,
not only applied to the food retail sector as in Hungary and the Czech Republic.
