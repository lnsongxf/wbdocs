Healthcare Market Assessment
EAST ASIA | 2016




IN PARTNERSHIP WITH:
ABOUT THE STUDY
This study was commissioned under the Private Sector Development Research & Analysis Platform, a partnership established in
June 2015 between the Government of Australia, represented by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), and the
International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, which supports private sector growth and poverty
reduction in the Asia Pacific region.

Given the rapid economic and demographic changes in Asia, the partnership aims to find smarter ways to encourage private
investment into areas of impact and growth within the private health sector to benefit overall healthcare systems and delivery, and
ultimately, health outcomes for poor people. The private sector can also influence the provision and financing of health services
through Public Private Partnerships.

The Australian government and IFC recognize the need to further understand the role of the private sector in priority health
markets within Asia and to identify opportunities to support private sector projects, or private sector participation in public sector
projects. This study builds on the growing partnership and contributes to a better understanding of East Asian health markets and
the forces that drive them.

With a focus on five countries—Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Myanmar, and the Philippines—this publication summarizes the
findings of a study aimed at providing tools and analysis for the partnership to better engage with these markets and their private
sector players for improved health outcomes. It explores the problems that public health systems face, and the opportunities for the
private sector.

POPULATION TRENDS


The demand for healthcare in Southeast Asia is growing and the five countries included in this study—Cambodia,
Indonesia, Myanmar, the Philippines, and Vietnam—are no exception. Growing and aging populations, and rising
rates of non-communicable diseases like diabetes and cancer are driving the demand for greater healthcare
services, products, and infrastructure. Rising middle-class incomes, as a result of economic growth and urbanization,
are sustaining this demand.

MARKET TRENDS AND OPPORTUNITIES
Healthcare resource capacity, government healthcare spending, government initiatives, and technology adoption are also
having an impact on supply and demand in each country, as well as the access, quality, and affordability of healthcare
services and products.




          Lack of skilled healthcare workers—The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a skilled
          health worker (physicians, nurses, midwives) threshold of 2.28 per 1,000 people to achieve high coverage
          for essential healthcare interventions. The Philippines was the only country in the study that met this
          target due to the excess supply of nurses in the country. Building up the healthcare workforce and
          improving the training of current workers is a priority as demand increases. Additionally, there are
          opportunities to better leverage community health workers and traditional birth attendants to expand
          capacity and geographic reach.

          Low bed count—A severe bed shortage in these countries is overcrowding urban public hospitals and
          prolonging wait times. The countries in the study have 0.7-2.5 beds per 1,000 people, whereas the
          recommended WHO target is more than 3.5 beds per 1,000. The healthcare systems in these countries
          have historically been designed to provide the acute care needed to respond to infectious diseases. With
          the rising incidence of chronic diseases, the demand on healthcare systems ill-equipped to deal with
          these diseases could become unmanageable. Not only is there a need for additional health infrastructure
          and modernization of facilities to diagnose and treat non-communicable diseases, but improved patient
          flow management, resource allocation, and information technology solutions (such as electronic health
          records) may help ease some of the current issues.

          High out-of-pocket expenditures—Indonesia, Vietnam, and the Philippines are implementing
          universal health coverage plans, but out-of-pocket spending remains high due to low reimbursement
          for over-the-counter and patented drugs, and inadequate insurance coverage of services. Myanmar
          and Cambodia currently do not have universal health coverage or established health insurance services.
          Instead, the poor are reliant on healthcare provided by nongovernmental organizations or at no cost at
          public facilities.

          Telemedicine and mobile health applications—A boost in internet connectivity and mobile and
          smartphone usage has improved prospects for telemedicine, especially in terms of bridging the widening
          supply-and-demand gap in health services between urban and rural regions without physically shifting
          resources. The private sector is leading the way in developing solutions that offer medical referrals
          through telemedicine, mobile applications for disease education or management and remote patient
          monitoring, and information technology plans to improve management practices.

          Increasing healthcare spending—Healthcare is a priority sector across the Association of Southeast
          Asian Nations (ASEAN), with universal health coverage being implemented in Indonesia, Vietnam, and
          the Philippines. Governments have been steadily increasing healthcare budgets to meet the needs of a

HEALTHCARE SUBSECTORS
The healthcare market assessment in this study focused on            services or products. The study broadly prioritized
five subsectors with the objective of better understanding           opportunities based on sector maturity and commercial
market needs and potential opportunities for the private             potential. The table below summarizes trends related to
sector to address gaps. The study identifies potential needs         access, affordability and quality for each subsector.

CONCLUSION

The driving forces behind the healthcare markets in
Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Myanmar, and the
Philippines highlight the depth and breadth of opportunities                 Vietnam
for private health players, and the importance of
collaboration between the public and private sectors to
                                                                 Myanmar
meet the healthcare needs of this population. Traditional                                       Philippines
solutions for improving healthcare access, quality, and
affordability need to be augmented with innovative and
dynamic new services to achieve the goal of improving
the health and wellbeing of the poor. The opportunities                    Cambodia

identified in the study provide a starting point to engage
local, regional, and multinational private health players into
areas that will be of impact and growth that will benefit the
overall healthcare system.
