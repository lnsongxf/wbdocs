I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
       Assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in
        Bangladesh perceive the World Bank;
       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Bangladesh regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Bangladesh;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank in Bangladesh;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank’s effectiveness and results,
               project/program related issues, knowledge work and activities, and
               communication and information sharing in Bangladesh; and
            Perceptions of the World Bank’s future role in Bangladesh.
       Use data to help inform Bangladesh country team’s strategy.


II. Methodology
From July to September 2013, 701 stakeholders of the World Bank in Bangladesh were invited
to provide their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country
survey. Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of the President or Prime
Minister; the office of a Minister; the office of a Parliamentarian; employees of a ministry,
ministerial department, or implementation agency; consultants/contractors working on World
Bank-supported projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing
implementation of a project; local government officials or staff; bilateral agencies; multilateral
agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks;
NGOs; community-based organizations (CBOs); the media; independent government
institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; and the
judiciary branch. A total of 366 stakeholders participated in the country survey (52% response
rate).
Respondents either completed questionnaires with a representative of the fielding agency or they
received the questionnaire via courier or email and returned it accordingly. Respondents were
asked about: general issues facing Bangladesh; their overall attitudes toward the World Bank; the
World Bank’s effectiveness and results; the World Bank’s knowledge work and activities;
working with the World Bank; the Bank’s future role in Bangladesh; and the Bank’s
communication and information sharing in Bangladesh.
Every country that engages in the Country Survey must include specific indicator questions that
will be aggregated for the World Bank’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions are
identified throughout the survey report.

A. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their exposure
   to the Bank in Bangladesh, and their geographic location.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. General Issues Facing Bangladesh: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Bangladesh
   is headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important
   development priorities and which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty.
C. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with the World Bank, the Bank’s effectiveness in Bangladesh, Bank staff preparedness to
   help Bangladesh solve its development challenges, the Bank’s investigation of corruption
   allegations under the Padma Bridge Project, their agreement with various statements
   regarding the Bank’s work, and the extent to which the Bank is an effective development
   partner. Respondents were also asked to indicate the sectoral areas on which it would be most
   productive for the Bank to focus its resources, the Bank’s greatest values and greatest
   weaknesses, and with which stakeholder groups the Bank should collaborate more.
D. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which
   the Bank’s work helps achieve development results in Bangladesh, the extent to which the
   Bank meets Bangladesh’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments, and the
   Bank’s level of effectiveness across twenty-eight development areas, such as education.
E. The World Bank’s Knowledge Work and Activities: Respondents were asked to indicate
   how frequently they consult Bank knowledge work and activities and to rate the effectiveness
   and quality of the Bank’s knowledge work and activities, including how significant of a
   contribution it makes to development results and its technical quality.
F. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
   a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as working with the World
   Bank increasing Bangladesh’s institutional capacity.
G. The Future Role of the World Bank in Bangladesh: Respondents were asked to rate how
   significant a role the Bank should play in Bangladesh’s development in the near future and to
   indicate what the Bank should do to make itself of greater value in Bangladesh, the two areas
   related to corruption that the Bank should give greater attention, and the extent to which
   respondents want to see more World Bank involvement in areas related to corruption.
H. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the Bank, their Internet access, and their usage and evaluation of the
   Bank’s websites, Facebook page, and PICs. Respondents were asked about their awareness
   of the Bank’s Access to Information policy, past information requests from the Bank, and
   their level of agreement that they use more data from the World Bank as a result of the
   Bank’s Open Data policy. Respondents were also asked to evaluate the Bank’s information
   accessibility, responsiveness to information requests, aspects of the Bank’s public
   communications, and communications specific to the Padma Bridge case.
In addition, when possible, responses from respondents completing this year’s country survey
were compared to responses from the 334 respondents (58% response rate) who completed the
survey in FY 2010 and the 417 respondents (57% response rate) who completed the country
survey in FY 2004. Notations and/or charts are included when these comparisons were possible.

        combined with consultants working on Bank-supported projects; the few respondents
        from the financial sector/private banks were combined with those from the private sector;
        and the few respondents from local government and bilateral agencies were included in
        the “Other” category.

Specific Areas of Effectiveness (continued)

       There were statistically significant stakeholder group differences eight of these twenty-
        eight areas of development. Those areas with significant stakeholder group differences
        were:
             Consultants working on Bank-supported projects/PMUs and respondents from
              private foundations gave the highest ratings for the World Bank’s effectiveness at
              “Transport” and “Agricultural development” whereas respondents from the
              judiciary branch gave significantly lower ratings;
             Respondents from other organizations gave the highest ratings for the World
              Bank’s effectiveness at “Urban development” whereas respondents from the
              judiciary branch gave significantly lower ratings;
             Employees of ministries and consultants working on Bank-supported
              projects/PMUs gave the highest ratings for the World Bank’s effectiveness at
              “Education” whereas respondents from the office of the Preside nt/Prime
              Minister/Minister gave significantly lower ratings;
             Employees of ministries and respondents from independent government
              institutions and other organizations gave the highest ratings for the World Bank’s
              effectiveness at “Gender equity” whereas respondents from the judiciary branch
              gave significantly lower ratings;
             Employees of ministries, consultants working on Bank-supported projects/PMUs
              and respondents from NGOs gave the highest ratings for the World Bank’s
              effectiveness at “Job creation/employment” whereas respondents from the office
              of the President/Prime Minister/Minister and the judiciary branch gave
              significantly lower ratings;
             Respondents from private foundations and other organizations gave the highest
              ratings for the World Bank’s effectiveness at “Rural development” whereas
              respondents from the judiciary branch gave significantly lower ratings; and
             Employees of ministries and consultants working on Bank-supported projects/
              PMUs and respondents from independent government institutions gave the
              highest ratings for the World Bank’s effectiveness at “Climate change and natural
              disaster preparedness” whereas respondents from academia gave significantly
              lower ratings.

Specific Areas of Effectiveness (continued)
       For those areas of development that could be compared, respondents in this year’s
        country survey tended to give higher ratings for the Bank’s effectiveness in most areas,
        but lower ratings in some, compared to respondents from the FY ’04 and FY ’10 surveys.
        Those differences that reached statistical significance are noted in the chart.

Drivers of Effectiveness

To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Bangladesh, bivariate correlational
analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twenty-eight specific areas of
effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development result s increase.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Bangladesh. The areas

        Bank’s ability to help achieve development results in Bangladesh, suggesting that ratings
        of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
             The Bank’s effectiveness at economic growth; and

As part of its continuous effort to improve its development effectiveness, the World Bank is interested in
gauging the views of clients and partners who are either involved in development in Bangladesh or who are
observers of the country’s social and economic development. The following survey is meant to give the World
Bank’s team that works on Bangladesh, greater insight into how the Bank’s work is perceived. This is one tool
the World Bank uses to assess the views of key stakeholders. With this understanding, the World Bank hopes to
develop more effective strategies, outreach and programs that support development in Bangladesh. The World
Bank commissioned an independent firm to oversee the logistics of this effort in Bangladesh. This ensures
anonymity and confidentiality of respondents. We hope you’ll be candid. To complete the survey, please
circle/check the response that most accurately reflects your opinion. If you prefer not to answer a question,
please leave it blank.
