sumption per capita is among the lowest in the world. Two-thirds of the population is not connected to the national
electricity grid, and 84 percent of rural households lack access to electricity. The lack of affordable and reliable
power is a key constraint to the delivery of vital services such as health, education and finance for rural populations,
and for private sector development and job creation more broadly. Also, access to modern fuels for cooking (such
as liquefied petroleum gas) is limited to urban areas. Consequently, traditional biomass (wood and animal dung)
is widely used and accounts for about 70 percent of primary energy consumption. The Government’s National
Electrification Plan aims to electrify more than 7 million households and achieve access to electricity for 36 million
people by 2030. Achieving this objective (which is also the UN SDG7 in Myanmar) is vital to poverty reduction and
shared prosperity.




 Context and opportunities for reform

The power sector in Myanmar has the opportunity
to scale-up access to affordable, reliable and
sustainable electricity. In 2013, Myanmar’s electricity
utilities connected about 200,000 residential customers
to the power grid. At this rate, it would take nearly
40 years to achieve universal access and connect
7.2 million households presently without access to
affordable and reliable electricity. To achieve universal
access by 2030, as stated in the National Electrification
Plan (NEP), the electrification rate should increase to
500,000 new connections per year by 2020, and stay at
least at that level for another ten years.

Investments in the power sector will need to more
than double. The total cost of NEP, including invest-
ments in power generation, transmission and distri-
bution required to meet new demand, is estimated at              Tariffs below cost recovery should be reviewed

in the early years, local governments and consumers
also contributed significantly. In Indonesia, the 1997

of the power company (PLN) and made it difficult for
the government to provide funds. As a result, the

secured financial viability of PLN through a subsidy
scheme.
