             This rapid assessment of the socioeconomic impacts of the recent flooding in
             Honiara and Guadalcanal would not have been possible without the dedication
             and support of Solomon Islands ministries and departments and their staff, who
             contributed both time and expertise. The drive and dedication of these individuals
             underpins the government-led approach to disaster risk management and is a
             model for improved coordination of efforts to promote a more resilient Solomon
             Islands.

A    slow-moving tropical depression caused persistent heavy rains in the Solomon Islands between
     April 1 and April 4, 2014. The highest recorded daily rainfall associated with this event was
318mm in Honiara on April 3. The rains caused flash flooding in Honiara, Guadalcanal, Isabel, Malaita,
and Makira-Ulawa. More than 732mm of rain was recorded over four days at the Honiara rain gauge,
although heavier rainfall was reported inland. On April 5, as the system moved away from the Solomon
Islands, it was upgraded to Tropical Cyclone Ita.

               The largest impact on revenue comes from the closure of the
               Gold Ridge mine. The closure is likely to result in revenue losses of
               around SI$120 million (US$16 million) in fiscal year 2014. Additional
               revenue losses will arise from the loss of output for businesses supplying
               the mine, and from disruption of business activity and lost profits outside
               the mining sector.

               Ignoring any positive impact from reconstruction, growth for 2014 could
               be expected to decline from baseline projection to negative 1.1 percent.

A forensic examination of the recent disaster suggests       may reflect traditional building styles, there is little

impacts) in future flooding events, but a broader review     flood-prone locations. Over recent years, development

Hazard assessment (mapping)
Mapping of floods and floodplains is foundational for
understanding and managing flood risk. To date, mapping

Risk assessment

consequences of flooding is essential for quantifying        Warning/education
