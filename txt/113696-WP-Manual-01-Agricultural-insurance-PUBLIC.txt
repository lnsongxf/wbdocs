    Preface and Acknowledgements
    Five manuals were prepared by IFC for the development of agri-insurance markets where the public and
    private sectors work together in a partnership (PPP). The manuals are designed to strengthen the capacity
    of the government and market players to effectively design agri-insurance products, both traditional
    indemnity and index, introduce them to the market, and build sales. The manuals are designed to be
    succinct yet at the same time sufficient to create the technical and administrative foundation for a modern
    agri-insurance system, and to allow programs in early stages of development to properly plan the required
    system. Finally the manuals are designed to train practitioners, to build local capacity for skills that are
    required to start the program, and to enable the program to grow over time.

    The principle author of the manuals is Professor Myles Watts, University Professor, Lead Actuary at Watts
    & Associates, Member of the Board at the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, and 5th Generation
    Montana Farmer. Watts and Associates designed and launched numerable agri-insurance products in
    North America, frequently consults for the major reinsurers, and supports insurance programs around the
    world. They have established their own index insurance company, eWeatherRisk. The manuals incorporate
    practical lessons learned over the past 40 years.

    The development of the manuals was a joint activity of the Ukraine Agri-Insurance Project (2007-2015),
    IFC’s Global Agri-Finance Team, and the Global Index Insurance Facility (GIIF) (2009 to present). Dr. Gary
    Reusche led the Ukrainian project, served as a technical specialist on the global agri-ﬁnance team, and as
    a member of the GIIF technical committee and core management team. Agri-insurance development is
    closely linked to agricultural ﬁnance and value chains and they are effectively developed in unison.

    The manuals result from training workshops developed by the agri-insurance project in Ukraine and globally
    by GIIF technical experts. The entire agri-insurance team in Ukraine made practical contributions to the
    manuals, with special recognition due to Victoria Yakubovich for collecting, organizing and preparing the
    initial drafts and Andrey Zaripov a member of the GIIF team for helping to develop the reinsurance and cash
    ﬂow models. The project team included experts from the Alberta (Canada) provincial agri-insurance program,
    in particular Richard McConnell, who contributed his experience and expertise to the training activities.

Part 1: Introduction and Background
1.0.       Introduction
This manual introduces and discusses agricultural insurance and provides
tools for the development, management, operation, and maintenance
of such programs. Agricultural insurance includes a variety of product
types, including property, causality, life, and health insurance. Throughout
the manual, the term “agricultural insurance” refers to crop (and in some
cases livestock) insurance programs.

Successful agricultural insurance programs must be thoughtfully
constructed before their introduction and tailored to the unique
circumstances of individual countries and regions; poorly designed
insurance programs will fail and generate losses for invested parties while
creating distrust among producers and the public. Successful programs
must inspire a high degree of conﬁdence among all stakeholders.

Transparency is of particular importance to developing and maintaining
conﬁdence in agricultural insurance programs. Achieving this
transparency is only possible when all stakeholders participate in open
debate and understand the insurance process. Clear communication
allows stakeholders to develop programs that meet the needs of their
users and help prevent long-term complications. Throughout this
document, emphasis is placed on transparency at all levels, from farmers
through private insurers and government agencies that support and
regulate programs.

Using examples from the United States and Canada, this document
addresses a wide range of issues, including program structure,
participation incentives, the role of insurance and reinsurance companies,
and the role of government agencies in the provision and support of crop
insurance programs and subsidies.




8       INTRODUCTION TO AGRICULTURAL INSURANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT
2.0.       Beneﬁts of Crop Insurance
The provision of credit to agriculture producers differs substantially from
other types of business lending. The most notable difference occurs
in the seasonality of cash inﬂows into many agricultural operations.
Although cash outﬂows generally occur throughout a year on most
agricultural operations, cash inﬂows may appear only a few times (and
often, only once) in any given year. The usual intermittent cash inﬂows
that occur in production agriculture create the need for operating lines
of credit. Consequently, crop insurance may be an important component
of obtaining and accessing credit. In addition, because many assets
require large initial outlays that are expected to yield beneﬁts over many
years, the need for intermediate-term ﬁnancing for breeding livestock,
machinery, and buildings is often high. Given that cash inﬂows often
occur only sporadically within a given year, a crop failure can result in an
immediate risk of default. A common commercial lending practice is to
“classify” loans that have not fully made payments in the past 90 days
as contractually speciﬁed. In agriculture, however, a single missed loan
payment results in the loan being “classiﬁed”. In most other business
lending situations, however, cash inﬂows are more regular and so failure
to receive a single cash inﬂow does not as dramatically affect the loan
payment. Although an agricultural production operation might be
proﬁtable over the long run, a single year in which extreme weather
or low market prices occur can cause credit default. Consequently,
agricultural production often represents a high short-term credit risk
because of the combination of high ﬁxed costs, weather and disease
variability, and variations in cash receipts.

Governments are often involved in many aspects of providing agricultural
insurance. In addition to reducing the variability of farm incomes, other
social issues are often cited as reasons for government involvement.
For example, social unrest in many developing countries is often
associated with low production and incomes – especially for subsistence
farmers. Many developing countries depend on a healthy farm economy
as a means for generating revenues through agricultural exports.
Furthermore, many social issues are exacerbated by emigration from rural
areas into urban regions. This migration increases in years of low farm
production. Many rural areas would beneﬁt from the adoption of modern
technologies. However, it takes time and ﬁnancial resources to adopt
and learn new technologies. In the absence of income levels that are
guaranteed by crop insurance, risky new technologies are seldom adopted
even if these technologies would improve producer well-being. Finally,
many countries encourage high participation in agriculture insurance to
reduce the need for ad hoc disaster programs which tend to be expensive,
ineffective, and inefficient.

3.0.         Introduction to Agricultural Risk
Agricultural producers face a variety of risks and considerable uncertainty.
This section identiﬁes and deﬁnes sources and types of agricultural risks
as well as tools available to manage those risks.

3.1.        Sources of Risk
Agricultural producers face a variety of risks including production (yield),
output price, and input price risk. Some of these risks are managed
through production and ﬁnancial decision-making while others are
simply accepted as costs of doing business. Some risks can be managed
thorough a variety of contractual and insurance-related products. In
many cases, however, some risks are difficult to ameliorate such as those
associated with interpersonal relationships that can generate personal
physical, emotional, and ﬁnancial stress among farm families and their
employees. This section discusses sources of agricultural risk.

3.1.1. Production and Technical Risk are primarily caused by disease
and extreme climate conditions including drought or low precipitation,
excessive rainfall or ﬂooding at planting time (prevented planting),
precipitation or frost at or just before harvest (delayed harvest, sprouting),
wind, insects, or hail. Unlike many other production situations, the use
of speciﬁc quantities and qualities of inputs in an agricultural production
process can result in different outcomes depending upon weather, insects,
weeds, and a wide variety of interactions among these and other factors.
Changes in technology represent another aspect of technical risk. The
adoption of a new technology itself is inherently risky, but failing to adopt
emerging and successful technologies also generates the risk of not being
competitive in a global economy.

3.1.2. Output and Input Price Risk is substantial in agricultural
markets because of worldwide supply and demand factors. Prices
of agricultural commodities that are widely traded among countries
are particularly subject to world market conditions. Changes in
transportation, storage, and input costs also add to local price variability.


  Example: In the last eight years, ﬂuctuations in world wheat production levels
  has caused the price of wheat to vary between $100 per ton and $300 per ton.


Input Price Risk occurs because the prices of agricultural inputs
often vary substantially over time. Fuel, fertilizer, and agricultural
chemical prices ﬂuctuate as a result of changes in demand for use in
both agricultural and non-agricultural uses and because of variations in
exchange rates and world production.


  Example: The price of diesel fuel doubled over twelve months (October 2007
  – October 2008) in the United States. Over the same period, the price of
  fertilizer increased by 250%. The price of crude oil inﬂuences diesel fuel prices
  while the price of natural gas inﬂuences nitrogen fertilizer prices. Price increases
  for these primary inputs inﬂuences proﬁtability among agricultural producers.




10       INTRODUCTION TO AGRICULTURAL INSURANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT
3.1.3. Financial Risk generally refers to the variability of net farm revenue over a speciﬁc period of time (often
one year or a production cycle) and is a major concern for agricultural producers, suppliers, and agribusinesses.
On average, annual net farm revenues may be sufficient for agricultural producers to realize proﬁts, but revenue
variability may cause some agricultural producers to fail. If net farm revenue is small or negative in a given
year, a producer will likely face ﬁnancial difficulties. Volatile net farm revenue is particular difficult for farmers.
Financial risk management is especially important for agricultural producers who acquire either short-term or
long-term ﬁnancing that requires scheduled interest and principal payments.

3.1.4. Political Risk stems from changing regulatory and government actions as they relate to environmental
concerns, business practices, ﬁnancial issues, international trade relationships, and government support
programs. Such issues are relevant even within stable, well-established political systems.

3.1.5. Legal Risk is relevant to multiple aspects of agricultural production. For example, agricultural
production ﬁrms may be subject to various liabilities resulting from environmental degradation, noise and air
pollution, wrongful termination, injury, contract fulﬁlment, and property rights.

3.1.6. Personal Risk includes the threat of injury, illness, or death among managers or employees. Production
agriculture is an inherently dangerous and hazardous occupation. Divorce and other personal relationship
deteriorations can also cause ﬁnancial distress.

3.2.       Risk Management Tools
Agricultural producers use a variety of techniques to manage the variability of net farm revenues. In general,
agricultural input costs and usage are much more stable from year to year than commodity prices and yields.
Attempts to reduce net income variability, therefore, tend to focus on production (yield) and output price risk.

Agricultural producers employ a variety of strategies to manage ﬁnancial risks including investments in lower
risk enterprises, enterprise diversiﬁcation, maintaining relatively low debt-to-asset ratios and adequate ﬁnancial
reserves, and developing off-farm income sources.




                                                                                                   MANUAL 1           11
3.2.1. Low Risk Investments represent an approach to managing risk. That is, risk can be mitigated by
avoiding high risk endeavors. Investments in low risk activities, however, are usually correlated with relatively
low average returns compared to higher risk investments.

3.2.2. Enterprise Diversiﬁcation is a risk management technique that involves investing in a variety of less
than perfectly correlated investments within a portfolio. Combining less-than-perfectly correlated investments
reduces variability of returns and may allow mean returns to be maintained. Many farmers produce a variety of
crop and livestock products as a means of diversiﬁcation; many of these diversiﬁcation techniques also produce
added beneﬁts through improving soil characteristics, reducing weeds, and limiting insect infestations. The
prices of many agricultural commodities are often positively correlated, which limits diversiﬁcation beneﬁts from
producing multiple crops. In addition, yields tend to be positively correlated across crops which limit the value
of crop diversiﬁcation. For these reasons, many agricultural producers diversify across both livestock and crop
commodities.

3.2.3. Excess Debt Capacity. Agricultural producers generally maintain relatively low debt-to-asset ratios
as a means of mitigating ﬁnancial risk; the average farmer in the United States maintains a debt-to-asset ratio
of approximately 10% which is a much lower ratio than other agribusinesses. Low debt-to-asset ratios are
necessary because of high ﬁxed costs (costs that do not vary with output) and revenue seasonality. Much of
the ﬁnancial risk involved in production agriculture is a result of the seasonal nature of production and, hence,
revenue generation.

3.2.4. Liquid Financial Reserves. Many agricultural producers maintain substantial ﬁnancial reserves or
liquid assets to help mitigate seasonality effects and reduce ﬁnancial risk including the risk of crop failures.

3.2.5. Off-farm Income. Agricultural producers and their family members are often employed in off-farm
jobs. Nine of every ten farm families in the United States have some off-farm employment income that provides
a more stable and, potentially, non-seasonal source of income. These employment opportunities can provide
additional beneﬁts including access to group health and life insurance.

3.2.6. Shared Ownership or Leasing of productive assets occurs in several ways. In general, someone other
than the farm/ranch manager may own all or a percentage of a farm’s productive assets. Land, buildings,
livestock, and machinery may be partly or wholly owned by someone other than the farm/ranch manager. In
many cases, these assets are leased to a farm operator which reduces that operator’s ﬁnancial risk because of
decreased capital investment and lower debt needs.

3.2.7. Risk Transfer can shift some of the risk associated with agricultural production away from producers,
but is not without its own costs. Agricultural producers transfer risk to other parties in a variety of ways
including the use of formal insurance markets, futures and options markets, and contracts .

3.2.7.1. Insurance Products help reduce risk. For example, formal property insurance markets transfer risk
from producers to others with respect to ﬁre, wind, theft, and other perils on buildings, machinery, and livestock.
Furthermore, health and life insurance products are used to manage personal risk. Premiums paid to insurance
companies for the transfer of this risk represent the costs of risk transfer. In addition, yield insurance can off set
production risk and revenue insurance can off set combinations of yield and price risk.

3.2.7.2. Contracts. Some producers forward contract the delivery of their crops and livestock to various
agribusiness entities. In most cases, forward contracts stipulate speciﬁc prices to be paid upon delivery of the
commodity. Contracts often include a variety of quality speciﬁcations and are legally enforceable. In addition,
producers may forward contract for agricultural inputs.

3.2.7.3. Hedging and Options Markets. Formal commodity futures markets provide input and output price
risk management opportunities. Much like forward contracting, commodity futures markets can be used to
establish selling prices. Unlike forward contracting, basis risk (the difference between prices at a commodity
futures market and local prices) can alter net sales prices, but basis variability is generally much less than
commodity price variability.

In the case of Put Options, commodity options markets provide another type of price insurance by establishing
a price ﬂoor (in exchange for a premium payment) without placing a limit on potential price increases. Call
Options establish a price ceiling for input prices without limiting gains that can be obtained by price declines.
Put and Call Options are generally traded for commodities for which futures markets exist.


12      INTRODUCTION TO AGRICULTURAL INSURANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT
4.0.       Government Risk Management
           Programs
In many developed countries, a variety of government programs provide
ﬁnancial risk protection for agricultural producers. In some countries,
such as Japan, programs establish minimum prices for agricultural
commodities. In the United States, countercyclical program payments are
available to producers to off set periods of low prices. Given recent high
commodity prices worldwide, countercyclical programs have not been
implemented in the past several years (except for cotton).

Agricultural Price and Income Support Programs affect producers’
incentives to participate in agricultural insurance. These programs
provide minimum price guarantees and a variety of farm income support
for producers of some commodities. Programs that provide minimum
price supports or countercyclical payments for speciﬁc commodities
reduce ﬁnancial risk by reducing price variability and provide direct
payments that increase producers’ ﬁnancial reserves. At the margin,
these risk reduction programs reduce incentives for producers to purchase
crop insurance. To maintain participation rates, some governments
require that producers purchase crop insurance as a prerequisite
to obtaining income support beneﬁts. In addition, participation in
agricultural insurance programs may increase access to credit because of
related decreases in default risk.

Many countries provide ad hoc Disaster Aid programs that off set losses
caused by catastrophic weather events. Government emergency or
disaster relief programs provide assistance to agricultural producers in
response to catastrophic events such as widespread ﬂooding, drought,
hurricanes, or tornados. Considerable research has been conducted on
the effect of disaster programs on farmers’ willingness to purchase crop
insurance. In general, agricultural producers who are relatively certain
that their government will provide ﬁnancial aid after a natural disaster
tend to be more reluctant to purchase crop insurance. Ad hoc programs
often incur substantial administrative costs because each new disaster
may require the building of administrative and operation structures.




                                                                             MANUAL 1   13
5.0.       Agriculture Crop Insurance
The primary difference between crop insurance and other types of
property insurance involves monitoring and rating. Because of weather
and biological effects, crop losses are much more costly to monitor than
most other forms of property insurance. Furthermore, prices that are
used to indemnify losses are subject to signiﬁcant temporal and spatial
variability. Substantial amounts of high-quality data are needed to set
actuarially sound premium rates. The wide variety of crop insurance
products, triggering mechanisms, and public policy issues complicates
crop insurance programs.

5.1.       Deﬁnitions
Several crop insurance terms must be deﬁned in order to understand
issues related to the provision of crop insurance programs. An Insurance
Provider is an entity that is willing to provide insurance coverage in
exchange for a fee (or premium). Insurance providers include both issuing
agencies and reinsurers. Issuing agencies, sometimes referred to as
primary insurers, market and manage insurance contracts to the insured.
Reinsurers are usually very large insurance companies (or is some cases,
governments) that are well-diversiﬁed across space, sector, and types
of insurance and that have substantial ﬁnancial reserves that provide
capacity to pay indemnities.

Premiums represent the price that an insurance purchaser pays to an
issuing agency to obtain an insurance policy. The market transaction in
which an insurance provider is willing to accept risk through the provision
of an insurance contract (in exchange for a fee) is a risk transfer
mechanism. Rating refers to the process of establishing actuarially sound
insurance premiums. Actuarial soundness implies that, over time, the
collection of premiums is sufficient to offset the provision of indemnities
along with allowances for risk acceptance and insurance provider costs.

Coverage is one minus the deductible.

Deductibles are a proportion of a loss that is not covered by an insurance
contract. In general, deductibles are established to reduce moral hazard
behaviour. Moral hazard occurs when insurance purchasers increase
risky behaviour simply because they have purchased insurance against
losses. Indemnities are payments made by an insurance provider to
an insurance purchaser to off set losses in excess of pre-determined
deductibles due to insured perils.

These concepts are relevant for most property insurance situations, but
agricultural insurance requires additional deﬁnitions. For example, single-
peril crop insurance products refer to insurance purchased against a
speciﬁc peril. The provision of hail insurance is an example of a single-peril
product. The purchaser of hail insurance will receive an indemnity if hail
causes a crop loss in excess of an established deductible. However, if a crop
loss were caused by a non-hail event such as drought, then an indemnity is
not paid. Multiple-peril products, however, provide indemnities for losses
caused by virtually any peril other than speciﬁcally-excluded perils.




14      INTRODUCTION TO AGRICULTURAL INSURANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT
Insurable perils are those that allow insurers to develop actuarial assessments, obtain sufficient volume of
insurance activity, and monitor outcomes. Non-insurable perils usually include:
      • Yield and revenue reductions resulting from poor production practices (e.g., failure to irrigate or harvest);
      • Fraud (e.g., under-reporting of actual yield);
      • Changes in public policy or government regulations.
5.2.           Issues Related to Product Development and Delivery
Private agricultural insurance companies have generally offered only speciﬁc-peril products because the costs
of determining losses and indemnity payments are much smaller than for multiple perils. Single-peril insurance
coverage tends to limit fraudulent activity by producers.

More recently, private companies have begun to develop insurance products that are based on proxies for
growing conditions such as temperature and rainfall measurements. Such measurements are somewhat
attractive to private companies because producers are unable to manipulate the thresholds used to trigger
indemnities.

Multiple-peril insurance products involve larger costs for monitoring production practices and fraudulent
activities. Governments desiring to provide safety nets for agricultural producers in the form of crop insurance
usually provide premium or other subsidies for multiple-peril insurance products.

A wide variety of subsidized multiple-peril products have been developed and implemented worldwide.
These products provide different levels of risk management, premiums, and program costs depending on the
mechanisms used to determine expected yields, trigger levels, and valuation of losses.

5.2.1. Product Delivery. Successful delivery of crop insurance products depends on program integrity,
accurate rating and underwriting procedures, loss veriﬁcation, efficient business operation, data

5.2.2. Factors Affecting Participation. Several factors inﬂuence producer participation in crop insurance
programs including product design, transparency, applicability, premium rates, deductibles, and integrity of
insurance providers.

5.2.2.1. Premium Rates affect participation because insurance premiums represent the price of purchasing an
insurance product. Consequently, lower premiums encourage producers to purchase more insurance.

    Example: Prior to 2000, approximately 30% of crop insurance premiums were subsidized by the U.S. government; at that
    time, about 40% of corn and wheat acreage was insured.2 After 2000, U.S. subsidies increased to 60% and approximately
    80% of corn and wheat acreage was insured.
                                                                                                                                        1



5.2.2.2. Deductibles/Coverage. Like most insurance products, crop insurance requires participants to select
a deductible. Crop insurance deductibles represent the difference between an expected yield or revenue and
an indemnity trigger yield or revenue. Deductibles are an important element of insurance products because
they reduce moral hazard which is the decision by an individual to increase risky behaviour simply because they
have purchased insurance against losses. Higher deductibles reduce risk and lower costs for insurance providers
because of moral hazard reductions and lower likelihoods of indemnities.

5.2.3. Potential Operating Structures. Crop insurance programs operate within various organizational
structures including government agencies, private insurance providers, and combinations of the two.

5.2.3.1. Government Agencies. In some cases, government agencies manage all aspects of agricultural
insurance programs in that they establish premium rates, sell and service products, market products, conduct
loss adjustments, and issue indemnities. They collect and maintain all data necessary to manage and improve
crop insurance programs in addition to subsidizing premiums.




1
    In the United States, participation is measured as the area of insured land relative to the total land area planted with a crop.

                                                                                                                         MANUAL 1      15
5.2.3.2. Private Companies. Some systems allow the private sector to provide most agricultural insurance
products. In such cases, private companies establish premium rates, sell and service products, market products,
conduct loss adjustments, and issue indemnities. They collect and maintain all data necessary to manage and
improve crop insurance programs. This is especially the case for single-peril products.

5.2.3.3. Mixed Systems are those in which government agencies and private companies share operational
elements of the program. These elements may include shared data management functions (e.g., the collection
and storage of data) or issuance of indemnity checks.

Private companies are responsible for product delivery, receive premiums, pay indemnities and have most of the
producer contact.

For multiple-peril offerings, however, governments are often involved in the provision of crop insurance.
Premiums may be government subsidized through compensation to private companies or delivered to
agricultural producers. Even within such systems, however, government agencies often provide oversight and
reviews of private company operations, product offerings, efficiency, participant equity, ﬁnancial viability, fraud
prevention, and dispute resolution. The United States has a mixed system.

Relationships among government agencies and private companies in providing crop insurance services may be
complex. Regardless of the nature of these relationships, the responsibilities and obligations of each party must
be clearly deﬁned. In addition, all systems must be transparent in terms of ﬂow of funds and dispute resolution.
Decision-making and accountability must be clearly delineated.

5.3.       Types of Insurance Products
A wide array of crop insurance products have been developed and implemented. In general, insurance products
can be divided into individual, area-based, and proxy products.

5.3.1. Individual Insurance Products are those for which indemnity triggers and premiums are speciﬁc to
yield histories and production outcomes for each individual farm operation.

5.3.1.1. Individual Yield-Based Insurance Products rely on historical production data from individual farms
to determine expected yields. Indemnities are triggered when individual farm yields decline below a trigger
point which is based on individual producers’ coverage selections. Indemnities are based on the difference
between actual yields and indemnity triggers and valued at a predetermined price for the commodity as
speciﬁed when the insurance contract was established.

5.3.1.2. Individual Revenue-Based Insurance Products are similar to yield-based products in that they use
individual historical farm production data to determine expected yields. In addition, expected harvest prices are
established when an insurance contract is purchased. Producers select a coverage level based on expected per-
acre revenues (i.e., the product of expected yield and expected harvest price). An indemnity is paid at harvest if
per-hectare revenues fall below the indemnity trigger regardless if the cause of loss is a lower price, lower yield,
or a combination of the two. In some cases, options exist that allow the indemnity trigger revenue level to be
adjusted upwards if commodity prices increase between the establishment of the insurance contract and harvest.

5.3.2. Proxy Index Products. Unlike individual products, proxy index product indemnity triggers and
premiums are determined by area or regional histories and production outcomes.

Area-Based Yield Insurance products are a variation on individual yield insurance products. The primary
difference is the mechanism used to determine expected yields and actual yields. Area-based yield insurance
products use data from a region (e.g., a county or province) to establish expected yields and indemnity triggers.
Producers who have established insurance contracts are indemniﬁed whenever regional yields fall below a
producer’s coverage selection of expected regional yields. One advantage of this product type is that it does
not require data on a speciﬁc farm’s historical or actual production, but information regarding acreages, legal
descriptions, and crops insured is necessary.




16      INTRODUCTION TO AGRICULTURAL INSURANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT
                                                                                                     c
One disadvantage of this insurance type is that an individual farm’s production may be only weakly correlated
                                                                                                      ld were
with regional production. A producer could have above average yields in a year in which regional yields
                                                                                                       ld harvest
low (or vice versa), allowing that producer to receive an indemnity. Conversely, a single producer could
below average yields in a year for which regional yields were above average; this producer would not receive
                                                                                                        e
an indemnity even though their production was below average. For this reason, area-based yield insurance a
generally offers less protection than individual yield insurance products. However, rating and monitoring g costs
are much lower relative to individual yield-based insurance products.

Area-Based Revenue Insurance products are a variant of individual revenue-based insurance products. Area-
based revenue insurance products combine the process used to establish expected yields in area-based yield
insurance products with those used to determine expected harvest prices in individual revenue-based insurance
products. Indemnities are based on area-wide revenue outcomes.

5.3.2.1. Other Index Products use various proxy indicators for growing conditions to trigger indemnity
payments. Two weather index products have been developed to date. The ﬁrst uses precipitation and/or
temperature as a proxy for growing conditions within a region. The second product bases indemnity payments
on measures of vegetative growth. This product uses satellite imagery to trigger indemnity payments.

Proxy index products have advantages over area-based products because regions can be more narrowly deﬁned.
These products also have advantages over individual-based products in that individual producers do not have
incentives to inﬂuence actual yields or the ability to manipulate indemnity triggers.

5.4.       Stakeholders
Producers, insurance providers, government agencies, and reinsurers are all stakeholders in the provision of crop
insurance products. Each group of stakeholders has different objectives and building conﬁdence in a program
requires that all participants understand these competing goals.

5.4.1. Producers. Producers are interested in reducing risk, increasing proﬁts, and improving credit access.
Because of the complexity and multiple details associated with crop insurance products, the primary purpose of
crop insurance—to provide agricultural producers with insurance products that help them manage risk—is often
overlooked. Failure to focus on consumer needs often results in poor participation rates which can exacerbate
adverse selection, increase premium rates, and reduce proﬁtability.

5.4.2. Primary Insurers. The issuing agency (or primary insurer) is the entity that actually sells insurance
contracts to producers and, in many systems, does most of the contract servicing. An issuing agency can be
either a private company or a government entity. Issuing agencies provide sales, premium collection, loss
adjustment, and indemnity payment services as well as necessary support services. Interestingly, issuing
agencies tend to retain the smallest amount of risk of the overall insurance program. Most issuing agencies do
not have enough ﬁnancial reserves to accept more than a minimal amount of insurance risk; the remainder of
the risk is generally shared with reinsurers or governments.

5.4.3. Reinsurers. Unless governments provide all insurance services, reinsurers are a critical element in
developing successful crop insurance programs. Reinsurers accept most of the risk initially incurred by issuing
agencies. Consequently, reinsurers provide the majority of indemnity payments. Crop insurance designers need
to be cognizant of reinsurance needs, goals, and procedures.

5.4.4. Government. Governments play a variety of roles in crop insurance programs. They may develop
and provide crop insurance products, reinsurance, stop-losses, or serve as regulators. In terms of regulation,
government agencies often monitor the ﬁnancial integrity of issuing agencies and reinsurers. Regulatory
activity is particularly important to conﬁrm that issuing agencies have sufficient cash reserves to cover their
share of liability and that remaining liability is the responsibility of reinsurers with ample ﬁnancial reserves.

Government agencies also enforce government subsidy policies and audit issuing agencies. Government
agencies often transfer funds to private insurance companies to off set administrative expenses or provide
subsidy payments. Governments often conﬁrm that issuing agencies are charging producers actuarially sound
premium rates net of subsidies. Government agencies are involved in contract enforcement through judicial
systems or mediation, including assuring that indemnity payments are made consistent with the insurance
contract.


                                                                                                 MANUAL 1           17
5.5.        Processes and Procedures
Successful crop insurance programs require several processes and procedures including sign-up, veriﬁcation,
premium payments, loss adjustment, indemnity payments, and notiﬁcations among reinsurers and government
regulators.

5.5.1. Sign-up. Crop insurance programs involve multiple steps. Although many appear obvious, each is
important for developing a successful crop insurance program.

Prior to producers signing (purchasing) crop insurance contracts, it is necessary to review previous program
performance and concerns. Mechanisms must be developed to allow producer concerns and requirements to
be recorded and categorized. If those concerns are legitimate and appropriate, then the program should be
modiﬁed accordingly. Before sign up:
     • Modify program details, including premium rates if necessary;
     • Review data and other operations systems;
     • Train sales personnel;
     • Develop program support and collect informational materials. Prescribed procedures must be in place
       for managing common situations and information must be made available to producers. Producers must
       understand the services that are provided to them in exchange for their premium payments;
     • Review risk bearing strategy and agreements including risk distribution and responsibilities of primary
       insurance companies, reinsurers, and governments;
     • Finalize insurance policy details prior to the sign-up period.
During the contract sign-up period, it is necessary to:
     • Conﬁrm that producers understand the program including
       premium calculations;
     • Record producer choices;
     • Calculate premiums;
     • Record producer information (e.g., name, address);
     • Record production information (e.g., crops, acreage, location);
     • Sign insurance agreements and provide both parties with copies;
     • Collect producer comments, concerns, and recommendations.
After the contract sign-up period, it is necessary to:
     • Enter sign-up information into a database.   There should
       be an electronic method for entering this information while
       contracts are being signed. One approach is to remotely enter
       information directly into an electronic database, but this approach
       is problematic if there are electronic transmission problems.
       Therefore, it is sometimes preferable to enter such data after the
       sign-up period to allow for corrections to be made if transmission
       is interrupted;
     • Provide other risk-bearers with information (how many acres were
       insured, liability, which crops);
     • Fulﬁl regulatory requirements, particularly on reporting;
     • Store signed agreements in a ﬁling system;
     • Record producers’ comments and recommendations;
     • Ensure that data are stored redundantly in several backup
       locations;
     • Notify producers of ﬁnal date for contract modiﬁcation (contract
       modiﬁcations may include acreage adjustment just prior to
       planting, but after the insurance contract is signed);

18       INTRODUCTION TO AGRICULTURAL INSURANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT
   • Enter producer modiﬁcations into a database;
   • Notify other risk bearers of required information;
   • Fulﬁl regulatory requirements;
   • Perform and record any required ﬁeld inspections.
5.5.2. Premium Payments. In most cases, producers pay insurance premiums when a contract is purchased.
The United States allows producers to delay premium payments until later in the year. However, the United
States has cross compliance for premium payment with many other government programs, which minimizes
payment default. To receive premium payments it is necessary to:
   • Conﬁrm the accuracy of premiums quoted at sign-up.      Contracts should specify the procedures to be
      followed if producers do not provide sufficient premium payments;
   • Notify producers of premium amounts and provide invoices;
   • Receive premium payments;
   • Record payment or non-payment;
   • Notify producers of payment receipt;
   • Notify producers of a policy cancellation if premium payments are not received;
   • Notify regulators and other risk bearers as required.
5.5.3. Loss Adjustment refers to the process of verifying that actual harvest yields are below indemnity
trigger yields. This is one of the most critical factors in developing a successful crop insurance program.
Stakeholders must:
   • Review loss adjustment procedures, operations, infrastructure, and personnel;
   • Inform producers of loss notiﬁcation procedures;
   • Provide a mechanism to receive producer requests for loss adjustment;
   • Delineate and implement ﬁeld inspections if required;
   • Adjust, document, and record losses;
   • Inform producers of preliminary estimates of indemnity payment.




                                                                                              MANUAL 1        19
5.5.4. Indemnity Payment. When actual harvest yields (or revenues) are below the indemnity triggers, an
indemnity payment is owed. Indemnity payment amounts are determined by the difference between actual
yields (or revenues) and the indemnity trigger multiplied by the price at which the commodity is valued. Several
procedures for distributing indemnity payments must be followed:
     • Review, document, and record indemnity calculations based on loss adjustments;
     • Pay indemnity to producers;
     • Notify and invoice risk-bearing partners;
     • Receive payment from risk-bearing partners;
     • Record payment from risk-bearing partners in database;
     • Record producer indemnity payment in database
5.5.5. Final Steps. A variety of procedures need to be followed annually for the successful completion of a
crop insurance cycle.
     • Fulﬁl regulatory requirements;
     • Analyze program performance;
     • Prepare appropriate reports;
     • Prepare for next year.
5.6.       Example
The following terms are used to illustrate a simple crop insurance example:
     • Expected Yield: A producer’s average historical yield;
     • Price: Price per unit of output used to calculate premiums and indemnity payment;
     • Deductible: A percentage of loss absorbed by a producer prior to qualifying for an indemnity payment.
     • Coverage: The portion of the crop that is insured:
                                            Coverage = 1 – Deductible
     • Indemnity Trigger:   The yield level that triggers an indemnity payment:

                                    Trigger Yield = Expected Yield x Coverage
     • Liability: The maximum indemnity payment:
                                         Liability = Trigger Yield x Price
     • Pure Risk Premium Rate: Expected indemnity payments as a fraction of liability.
     • Load Rate: The cost of providing insurance in excess of the pure risk premium rate.
     • Total Premium Rate:
                            Total Premium Rate = Load Rate + Pure Risk Premium Rate
     • Total Premium: The total cost of insurance:
                                  Total Premium = Liability x Total Premium Rate
     • Producer Premium: The producer’s cost of insurance:
                             Producer Premium = (1 – Subsidy Rate) x (Total Premium)
     • Subsidy Rate: The fraction of total premium paid by the government;
     • Indemnity: Compensation for yield before indemnity trigger.




20       INTRODUCTION TO AGRICULTURAL INSURANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT
Example: Assume a producer buys an individual yield-based insurance product with the following attributes:

       Deductible = 40%

       Pure Risk Premium Rate = 0.87%

       Load Rate = 3%

       Subsidy Rate = 25%

       Price of Output (wheat) = 1.0

       1 hectare is insured

Liability is based on expected yields. Suppose that the producer has the following production history:



                                                            Historical Yield (tons
                                                 Year           per hectare)
                                                   1                  2.7
                                                   2                  3.6
                                                   3                  2.4
                                                   4                  3.3




In this case, Expected (or average) yield = 3.0 tons/ha

Expected yields are sensitive to sample size. Many countries use as little as four years of data, while others use as many
as ten or more years to calculate expected yields. Fewer years of data are subject to outlier (extreme) observations. When
longer samples are used, it may be important to account for yield trends resulting from technological change. In our
example:

Liability = (Expected Yield ) x (Coverage) x (Price) x (Area) =
(3 tons / ha) x (1 – 0.4) x ($1 / ton) x (1.0 ha) = $1.80

Total Premium Rate = (Load Rate + Pure Risk Premium Rate) = (3% + 6%) = 9%

Total Premium = (Liability x Total Premium Rate) = ($1.80) x (0.09) = $0.162

Subsidy = (Subsidy Rate) x (Total Premium) = (0.25) x ($0.162) = $0.0405

Producer Premium = (1 – Subsidy Rate) x (Total Premium) =
(0.75) x ($0.162) = $0.1215

Trigger Yield = (Coverage) x (Expected Yield ) = (1 – 0.4) x (3 tons/ha) = 1.8 tons/ha

If actual yield is greater than the indemnity trigger, no indemnity will be paid. In our example, if the actual yield is 2.0 tons/
ha, then an indemnity is not generated. If actual yield is less than the indemnity trigger, however, then an indemnity is due.
Suppose that the actual harvest yield total 1 ton per hectare. Then, the indemnity payment would is calculated as:

Indemnity = (Trigger Yield – Yield Outcome) x (Price) x (Area) =
(1.8 tons/ha – 1 tons/ha) x ($1/ton) x (1.0 ha) = $0.80




                                                                                                             MANUAL 1            21
Part 2: Foundational Concepts
6.0.         Actuarial Methods
Actuarial Methods refer to processes by which insurance premiums or
rates are established. These premiums must be sufficient to compensate
insurers and reinsurers for expected indemnities, costs of providing
insurance services, business risk, and proﬁt.

Assume a producer is interesting in purchasing a yield insurance product
with the following characteristics:

Acreage = 1 hectare

Price = 1 UAH per ton

Deductible = 40%

In addition, the producer has the following yield history, for which the
indemnity trigger and payments are:


                              Table 1. Simple Rating Example for Yield Insurance

                            Yield           Indemnity        Indemnity
             Year
                           Outcome            Trigger         Payment

                1             2.70              1.8              0.00
                2             1.72              1.8              0.08
                3             3.24              1.8              0.00
                4             4.28              1.8              0.00
                5             4.20              1.8              0.00
                6             4.73              1.8              0.00
                7             0.32              1.8              1.48
                8             2.77              1.8              0.00
                9             4.10              1.8              0.00
               10             1.92              1.8              0.00




This results in:

Expected Yield = Mean Yield = 3

and

Coverage = (1 – deductible) = 60%

6.1.        Pure Risk Rate
Liability represents the maximum possible indemnity payment in any
given year. In this case, the liability is calculated as:

Liability = Indemnity Trigger x Price

Given that Price = 1.0,

Liability = 1.8 x 1.0

The Pure Risk Rate is calculated as the quotient of the expected
indemnity payment and the liability:


22       INTRODUCTION TO AGRICULTURAL INSURANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT
It should be noted that this example is presented only for illustrative purposes. Ten observations is an
insufficient sample size for calculating pure risk rates. In cases of small samples, other methods must be used to
determine pure risk rates, including expert judgments, experimental data, and comparisons to other crops and
regions.

6.2.       Loads and Total Premium Rates
Loads are additions to pure risk rates that compensate insurers for additional costs and risks. Consequently,
loads are product-speciﬁc because more risk may be associated with different crops or even different producers.
Commodities that are highly seasonal, possess small market shares, have little historical data, or are thinly
traded often require high loads. Loads are commonly included in premiums to offset:
   • Rating conﬁdence.      Loads are increased for insurance products that have been rated using low-quality
       data or questionable methodologies;
   • Insurance servicing.     Loads are larger for products requiring high monitoring costs, frequent review,
       audits, and smaller insurance markets;
   • Political, judicial, and other risks.   Loads are larger in regions in which clear and enforceable property
       rights are problematic;
   • Structural change.     Loads are larger for products and commodities subject to policy or technological
       changes.




                                                                                                MANUAL 1           23
Loads are sometimes a function of cost estimates that are based
on contract servicing and historical performance of other insurance
products. However, loads often result in subjective judgements of those
involved in actuarial rating.

Loads can be applied to premium rates either as a proportion of a
premium rate or as a ﬁxed addition to a premium rate:

Proportional loads are added to a pure risk rate as:

Total Rate = (Pure Risk Rate) x (1 + Load )

Fixed addition loads are calculated as:

Total Rate = (Pure Risk Rate) + (Load Rate)

6.3.    Rating Methods
Several formal methods are used to rate crop insurance products
including empirical, parametric, combined, and spatial smoothing
approaches. In general, the quantity and quality of historical data dictate
the choice of rating method.

6.3.1. Empirical Rating Methods use historical data to calculate
premiums. The preceding example used an empirical rating method.

6.3.2. Parametric Rating Methods use speciﬁc probability
distributions rather than empirical distributions (actual data) to establish
premium rates. Parametric rating methods are often used in cases where
historical data are not of sufficient quantity or quality to allow the use of
empirical rating methods. The most common probability distributions
used to rate insurance products include normal distributions, uniform
distributions, and extreme value distributions.

6.3.3. Combined Approach. Empirical and parametric rating methods
are often combined to develop premium rates when data are available.
After using each method, the two rate outcomes are compared. If
both methods generate similar results, then insurers can be reasonably
comfortable with the rating procedures. The uniform distribution may be
used to develop an upper bound on premium rates.

6.3.4. Rating Methods with Limited “On Site” Data. Historical data
are often limited, so a variety of other methods may be used to establish
premium rates. These rates usually include relatively high loads. These
methods include special smoothing, rates from biologically similar crops,
rates from regions with similar growing conditions, use of conservative
parametric approaches, and subjective opinion of crop insurance experts.

In general, it becomes difficult and expensive to reinsure risks if high-
quality data are unavailable.




24       INTRODUCTION TO AGRICULTURAL INSURANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT
7.0.          Data Management and Accounting
Data collection, analysis, and management are central to the success of
any insurance program. Data are used to evaluate and rate products,
reinsure risk, detect fraudulent activities, adjust public policies, and
measure success. Moral hazard and adverse selection in multiple peril
crop insurance products make data management even more important.

7.1.         Data Needs
Data and educational efforts are required by:
    • Farmers and farm organizations;
    • Private primary insurance providers;
    • Reinsurance companies;
    • Government agencies managing and/or operating crop insurance
         programs;
    • Regulatory agencies and/or oversight boards;
    • Policy makers.
7.1.1. Producers. Farmers and farm organizations need data and
information to:
    • Decide whether they want or need agricultural insurance products;
    • Select which products to use, coverage levels, and deductibles;
    • Determine eligibility and size of indemnity payments;
    • Meet sign-up deadlines and respond to loss adjustment requests;
    • Evaluate the performance of insurance products over time and
         assess whether they provide sufficient risk protection.

7.1.2.    Primary Insurance Providers need data to:
    • Service products;
    • Establish premium rates;
    • Pay indemnities;
    • Establish performance benchmarks and monitor performance;
    • Monitor individual farm losses to identify fraud and high risk
         producers;
    • Conduct research, develop new products, and modify existing
         products;
    • Provide product and ﬁnancial information for internal and external
         audits;
    • Receive government reimbursements for service costs and
         premium subsidies;
    • Meet the information and performance benchmark requirements of
         reinsurance companies;
    • Resolve disputes.
7.1.3.    Reinsurance Companies need data to:
    • Evaluate risk of agricultural insurance portfolios;
    • Establish reinsurance premium rates;
    • Service reinsurance contracts.


                                                                           MANUAL 1   25
7.1.4.    Government Agencies need data to:
     • Service and operate programs;
     • Regulate issuing agencies and reinsurers;
     • Research, develop, and improve products;
     • Establish product performance benchmarks;
     • Evaluate product performance against benchmarks;
     • Meet data requirements for internal and external audits;
     • Calculate and disburse premium and service subsidies;
     • Resolve disputes and manage dispute resolution procedures.
7.1.5.    Regulatory Agencies and Oversight Boards need information to:
     • Establish benchmarks for program and product performance;
     • Evaluate program and product performance;
     • Evaluate dispute resolution procedures;
     • Evaluate proposed new products and changes to existing products;
     • Provide policy makers with information on program performance.
7.1.6.    Policy Makers need data and information to:
     • Establish performance benchmarks for program participation among farmers and for budgetary
         expenditures;
     • Evaluate program performance;
     • Determine and monitor subsidy funding levels and related budgetary expenditures.
7.2.         Collecting Data
Data need to be collected from several entities including farms, primary insurance providers, and private and
public third parties.

7.2.1.    Farm-Level. Individual yield and revenue insurance products require a great deal of data including:
     • Crops produced, areas planted to speciﬁc crops, crop production practices, ﬁeld locations, and yield
         histories;
     • Farm locations, names of insured farmers or landowners, and farm or farmer identiﬁcation codes;
     • Insurance product choices, including coverage levels, price elections, deductibles, co-payment choices,
         reseeding options, quality riders, and prevented planting selections.

7.2.2.    Primary Insurance Providers must collect and manage data on:
     • Program and product participation (e.g., numbers of contracts by product, program, region, total area
         covered, total liability, coverage levels and price election selections);
     • Premium rates and revenues;
     • Current year yields by farm, program, product, and region;
     • Indemnity payments by product and region;
     • Retained risk and reinsured risk;
     • Retained earnings;
     • Surplus position of accounts;
     • Product and program service costs.




26         INTRODUCTION TO AGRICULTURAL INSURANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT
7.2.3. Private and Public Third Parties. Government agencies, international organizations, universities,
research institutes, and other private companies gather data. Producers and insurance providers often access
third-party data that may have been collected for non-crop insurance reasons. In the United States, Canada,
and the United Kingdom, government agencies collect data on:
      • Historical production data by county and region (often needed to establish premium rates and for other
         actuarial purposes);
      • Weather and other proxy index data (needed for area-based insurance products);
      • Historical and current crop and livestock prices (by county, state, region, and country);
      • Plant pathology and other biological data;
      • Experimental plot data for crops.
7.3.          Storage
Agricultural insurance programs are data-intensive, so data storage is important for maintaining program
integrity. Ideally, all insurance information should be stored and managed at a central location trusted by
all stakeholders. Farm-level, product performance, and company performance data should be collected and
maintained for all years. Storage issues that must be addressed include:
      • Where will data be stored?
      • Where will multiple data backups be stored?
      • How will data security be managed?
      • How will data be formatted for storage and accessibility?
      • What security measures need to be implemented?
      • Who will have access to data?
      • What quality control measures will be used when entering data?
7.4.          Access
Data conﬁdentiality must be strictly maintained and access limited to relevant parties. Storage redundancy is
essential to prevent data loss resulting from accident or malfeasance.2 If trust between government, private
insurance companies, farms, and farm organizations is at issue, then storage must be provided by a trusted third
party.

If data are stored at a central location, then all program participants should be granted access to summary
data and to their own conﬁdential data, but not to other participants’ conﬁdential data. Oversight boards
and regulatory agencies should have access to such conﬁdential data as has been agreed to by all parties.
Conﬁdentiality rules must be strictly adhered to under penalty of law.

7.5.          Business Operations
7.5.1. Document Storage (Signed Policies) and management are important aspects of insurance programs.
Details to be considered include:
      • Who is going to store signed insurance contracts?
      • Will insurance contracts include references to other documents or will they be self-contained agreements?
Documents must be signed and stored, and duplicates should be maintained in a separate secure place.

7.5.2. Business Processes. Building conﬁdence in crop insurance programs requires the development and
adoption of solid business processes. Businesses must:
      • Educate producers so that they understand products prior to purchase;
      • Recognize and minimize hidden costs to farmers, auditors, and managers.
      • Reduce unnecessary costs.

    Data redundancy means keeping data in multiple places and retaining the original paper ﬁle, not relying solely on electronic data.

                                                                                                                      MANUAL 1           27
8.0.        Underwriting and Loss Adjustment
Underwriting and loss adjustment are cornerstones of successful
agricultural insurance programs. Underwriting refers to the details
involved in preparing crop insurance contracts including deﬁnitions,
processes, rating, and dispute resolution issues. Loss adjustment refers
to the processes used to report, verify, quantify, and document losses
resulting from insured perils.

8.1.       Underwriting
Underwriting represents the processes used to quantify and qualify
insurance portfolio risks. Quantifying risk involves developing risk
measures for sub-populations or individuals. This value is then translated
into premium rates for individual producers. Qualifying risk refers to
identifying reasons for risk differences and assessing the accuracy of
assigned risks. Differences in production practices among individual
producers may provide important actuarial differences but, in other cases,
these differences may be unimportant for assessing risk.

Agricultural insurance underwriting is used to identify individual producer
risk within a region and insurance portfolio. Underwriting is also
necessary for transferring risk to the reinsurers.

Underwriting is a critical element of crop insurance programs. The
following issues must be addressed by underwriting activities:
     • Are underwriting activities conducive to responsible business
       practices?
     • Should all products be underwritten using identical procedures?
     • Are underwriting activities producing products that can be
       supported by existing institutional structures?

Underwriting requires that farmers be categorized into subpopulations
or pools within an overall insurance portfolio. This process must be
accomplished before insurance products are offered.

Program and product design often determine the focus of underwriting.
Substantially different underwriting processes are needed for developing
individual producer-based products versus proxy index products.

Developing and writing policies with a high degree of accuracy is a
complex and time-consuming process. Policies are binding contractual
agreements. Therefore, they must necessarily be written in technical
terms to reduce ambiguity. Supplemental materials must be available to
producers and insurance agents that explain policy details. Developing
these materials must be done by individuals familiar with educating
agricultural producers. The legal ramiﬁcations of selected wording are
critical to maintaining policy integrity and minimizing disputes. Input
from competent individuals including legal professionals, actuaries,
insurance professionals, business managers, and others with agricultural
expertise is frequently required during the underwriting process.

For individual-based products, underwriting must deﬁne the actual crop
being insured. For example, one cannot insure a general crop called
“wheat” because of differences in spring wheat, winter wheat, and durum
wheat yields and prices. In addition, differences exist among wheat
varieties in terms of production practices and yields.



28       INTRODUCTION TO AGRICULTURAL INSURANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT
Insured acreage must also be deﬁned. For example, will all of a producer’s acreage be insured by a single
contract, or will producers be allowed to divide acreages based upon various insurable units? Minimum farm
sizes may be stipulated for crop insurance eligibility.

Finally, underwriting must identify those who are eligible to purchase insurance (e.g., landowners, producers,
trusts, etc.). If a product is designed to allow landowners to buy insurance, there must be some way of
underwriting different risks and tracking rental agreements between farmers and landowners. There may
also be different sub-contracts on the same farm if, for example, two individuals in the same family unit own
different portions of the farm and manage them independently.

Underwriting index-based products is relatively easier than individual yield-based products. However, even
with index-based programs, underwriters must determine crop ownership (eligible farmer), whether the crop is
actually grown (eligible farmer), liability limits, proxy index descriptions, and product design and rating as well as
consider regulatory and subsidy rules.

8.2.       Loss Adjustment
Loss adjustment refers to the process of reporting, measuring, and validating losses that are covered by an
insurance contract.

8.2.1. Procedures. In agricultural insurance, loss adjustment is required to assess claims, monitor ﬁeld
management, gather and verify data, perform underwriting activities, educate farmers, and conduct ﬁeld
research.

Loss adjusters verify yield outcomes provided by producers in both claim and non-claim years. Since non-claim
year yields are used to update expected yields and indemnity triggers, these yields must also be veriﬁ ed annually.
Producer involvement in the loss adjustment process limits appeals and improves dispute resolution outcomes.

Most crop insurance programs require pre-harvest adjustment.

During pre-harvest inspections, loss adjustors should:
   • Determine crop type, location, and size (mapping);
   • Review farm management practices;
   • Identify cropping practice anomalies;
   • Identify the stage of a crop relative to insurance policy speciﬁcations;




                                                                                                  MANUAL 1         29
     • Establish locations of plot samples for estimating production
       (including mapping locations and results of plant counts);
     • Identify insurable and not insurable causes of loss;
     • Collect ﬁeld data;
     • Verify/quantify loss prior to harvest;
     • Fill out, record, and submit required forms.
Loss adjustment procedures are often tailored to speciﬁc product features.
This is especially the case for products that include reseeding compensation,
prevented planting (unseeded acres) beneﬁts, or winter kill beneﬁts.

8.2.1.1. Biological Versus Sample Harvest. The usual approach to
loss adjusting involves a biological assessment. In these cases, a loss
adjuster evaluates small portions of damaged ﬁelds to assess yield losses.
Adjusters generally count the number of plants and amount of production
remaining in each plant. These data are used along with row spacing to
determine the potential yield of a ﬁeld. Finally, adjusters often look for
signs of damage such as kernels of small grains lying on the ground which
cannot be proﬁtability harvested. The process is designed to ascertain
the potential and actual yield of a crop.

Although used less often, some insurance programs allow loss adjusters
to conduct sample harvests to determine actual yields. In this case,
adjusters actually harvest a portion of a ﬁeld and measure the output to
determine harvest yields. Of course, if adjusters have to use their own
harvesting equipment to make this determination, the process can be
very costly. On the other hand, the use of a farmer’s harvest equipment
presents additional challenges. That is, an adjuster would need to be
knowledgeable about the operation and calibration of a wide variety of
harvesting equipment to obtain accurate yields.

Measuring the amount of output in storage represents a combination of
these two approaches. That is, a loss adjuster may measure the amount
of output in storage to determine yields. However, this approach assumes
that an accurate measure of previously stored crops can be obtained. But, it
is often difficult to identify the source of stored commodities. Furthermore
the adjuster needs to verify that all of the production was stored.

8.2.2. Dispute Resolution Systems are similar in Canada and the United
States. After a loss adjuster determines the extent of a loss, a producer
who disagrees with the decision can request that a second, more senior,
loss adjustor provide an opinion. The producer can either accept the
second judgment or submit an appeal to an arbitration committee. These
committees are usually formed within the region of the dispute and consist
of one person from the board of directors and several farmers trained in
dispute resolution. Both the farmer and insurer present evidence supporting
their positions and the committee renders a decision. Although producers
can submit the dispute to the court system, courts often side with the
decision made by the committee unless procedural errors were made.

Canadian loss adjusters are employees of the government agency
that provides crop insurance services. Therefore, they do not need to
insure themselves against professional liability. In the United States,
however, loss adjusters are independent contractors. However, they are
considered similar to government employees because they act on behalf
of the government. Adjustors are generally protected from civil liability
involving simple mistakes. However, adjusters who commit fraud are
subject to criminal prosecution.

30       INTRODUCTION TO AGRICULTURAL INSURANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT
9.0.       Reinsurance
Reinsurance is a major component of a well-functioning crop insurance
program. In the U.S. program, total liabilities are distributed across
several entities. Ignoring the government’s assigned risk pool, primary
insurers carry between 0-5% of crop insurance risks, reinsurers hold
between 20-25%, and the government assumes 70-75%. In terms
of historical indemnity payments, primary insurers pay 4-8% of all
indemnities, reinsurers pay 92-96%, and in recent years, the U.S.
government has paid 0%.

If the 14% of all policies assigned to the U.S. government’s risk pool (a pool
of the highest risk contracts) are included, then primary insurers pay 3-7%
of all indemnities, reinsurers pay 86-90%, and the U.S. government has
paid 6-7% in recent years.

For well-developed insurance programs in which there is broad
participation across many agricultural sectors, it would be highly unlikely
that total indemnity payments in a given year would exceed three times
total annual premiums.

9.1.       Introduction to Reinsurance
Reinsurance refers to the transfer of risk from one company (e.g., an
issuing agency or primary insurer) to another insurance company (e.g., a
reinsurer) or a government. Crop insurance products would not be viable
without an effective reinsurance market.

Reinsurers are usually large insurance companies that are well-diversiﬁ ed
across space, sector, and types of insurance. Diversiﬁcation by space
means that these companies operate in many countries and regions
around the world. Diversiﬁcation by sector means that these companies
insure a variety of economic sectors including housing, commercial
property, and real estate. Diversiﬁcation by insurance type occurs
through reinsuring agricultural production, property, casualty, health, and
life insurance products. Reinsurance companies must be sufficiently large
to bear multiple major risks and manage diverse portfolios.

By their very nature, crop insurance products attempt to insure producers
against both individual (e.g., hail) and region-wide events (e.g., drought).
Region-wide adverse weather events result in many large indemnity
payments in one year and few indemnities paid in other years. Issuing
agencies usually do not have sufficient ﬁnancial reserves to absorb
years of high indemnity payouts. Issuing agencies have an undiversiﬁed
insurance portfolio because of the specialized nature of crop insurance
and regional events. Therefore, reinsurance is particularly important
for crop insurance programs because a region-wide event would likely
deplete the cash reserves of issuing companies. In addition, most issuing
companies are not diversiﬁed to the point where they can manage these
substantial risks. Reinsurance companies have sufficient cash reserves
and portfolio diversiﬁcation to underwrite region-wide events because
they operate across many regions.




                                                                                 MANUAL 1   31
9.2.       Reinsurance Rating
Reinsurers must determine the price at which they are willing to accept risk from issuing agencies. Similar to
the provision of crop insurance, reinsurers must also rate the risks that they are accepting. Reinsurance rating is
a function of the underlying probability distribution of indemnity payments, types of insurance being considered,
costs of providing reinsurance services, and public policies surrounding insurance programs.

Reinsurance companies rely on brokers to obtain business opportunities. Brokers are enlisted because they
often have better understanding of issues, interests, and opportunities in speciﬁc areas. Brokers organize
reinsurance business proposals for reinsurance companies.

9.2.1. Types. There are several types of reinsurance and relationships between reinsurers. It is rare for a
primary insurance company to be owned by a reinsurer.

9.2.1.1. Co-payments, Coinsurance, or Percentage Participation. Co-payments (or Co-pays) refer to the
proportional sharing of losses between a primary insurance company and reinsurers.

If one reinsurance company accepts 40% of indemnity payment risk and another accepts 60%, then the two
companies will share indemnity payments on a 40/60 basis.

Even in a system with co-payments, the primary insurance company may be required to pay a deductible --
often as little as 5% of the liability. The deductible represent the amount of loss the primary insurance provider
sustains prior to loss responsibility transfer to reinsurer. If the primary insurer has no deductible or co-pay
responsibility, reinsurance rates are disproportionately large and reﬂected in reinsurance premiums.

9.2.1.2. Stop-Loss is an amount at which remaining indemnity payments are transferred to another entity. In
general, only governments (with their vast resources and public policy mandates) are willing and able to accept
large indemnity risks. Without stop-loss agreements, reinsurance companies would generally not be willing to
reinsure agricultural insurance risks. In many cases, stop-loss levels are set at three to ﬁve times total annual
premiums.

9.2.1.3. Layered, Stacked, or Tranched Reinsurance refers to situations in which the ﬁrst component of
risk is accepted by one entity before a second entity accepts any risk. Layered reinsurance may be deﬁned in
either percentage terms or ﬁxed amounts. Each entity is responsible for a certain amount of loss based on a
hierarchical structure.




32      INTRODUCTION TO AGRICULTURAL INSURANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT
Example: Proportionally Layered Reinsurance: $1,000,000,000 liability.


                                                                Loss Responsibility
                                                                              Amount
                                Entity               Percentage           (million dollars)
                            Primary Insurer               5%                          50
                            Lead Reinsurer               15%                         150
                          Secondary Reinsurer            20%                         200
                             Government                  60%                         600



This example provides an illustration of proportionally stacked reinsurance. The primary insurance provider accepts the
initial 5% indemnity risk (i.e., indemnity payments), the lead reinsurer accepts the next 15%, a secondary reinsurer accepts
the next 20%, and the government accepts the last 60%. Total liability is $1 billion. In this case, if indemnity claims in
any given year total 5% or less of total liability, only the primary insurer would pay indemnity claims (up to a total of
$50,000,000). However, if claims exceed $50,000,000 but are less than $200,000,000 (less than 20% of total liability),
then the primary insurer’s total indemnity liability would be limited to $50,000,000, and the lead reinsurer would be
responsible for the remaining $150,000,000. The second reinsurer would be responsible for the next $200,000,000 of
liability, and the ﬁnal $600,000,000 would be the responsibility of the government.

                                         Paid

                        B                  125           50            75           0               0
                        C                 300            50           150          100              0
                        D                 500            50           150          200             100




This example illustrates a situation in which indemnities are distributed based upon ﬁxed amounts. Situation A represents
a case in which total indemnity payments would equal $50,000,000. A primary insurer may be responsible for the entire
amount. However, situation B requires total indemnity payments of $125,000,000. In this case, the primary insurer’s
responsibility would be limited to $50,000,000 and the lead reinsurer would pay the remaining $75,000,000. For
situations C and D, total indemnities paid are $300,000,000 and $500,000,000, respectively.

9.2.2. Costs. Primary insurers negotiate with reinsurers over the cost and terms of reinsurance. Primary
insurers want to pay the lowest possible price for reinsurance while transferring the largest amount of risk
possible. Negotiations focus on many factors including pure risk premiums, loads, servicing costs, program
design, program integrity, transparency and auditing, political, judicial, and legal issues, personnel competency,
fraud detection and control, and the reputations of involved parties.

9.3.       Insurance Pooling
Primary insurers pay reinsurers to accept much of the risk incurred through the sale of insurance contracts. The
price that primary insurers pay to transfer this risk depends on several factors, including the degree to which
their product sales, business procedures, and loss adjusting activities are standardized across products, regions,
and companies. In addition, the price of reinsurance depends upon the amount of risk the primary insurer is
willing to retain and whether the issuing company decides to retain or transfer servicing activities and data
management.




                                                                                                         MANUAL 1           33
9.3.1. Standardized Products. Crop insurance programs often offer a variety of products including multiple-
peril yield and revenue products, individualized products, area-wide products, and proxy insurance products.
In many cases, different products are offered for similar crops in different regions. This is certainly the case for
companies that operate on a global scale. The degree to which similar products can be bundled for sale to a
reinsurer greatly affects the price of risk transfer. Standardization reduces reinsurers’ technical, monitoring, and
management costs. Hence, the transfer of risk from homogeneous products is less costly for a primary insurer
relative to that arising from the servicing of heterogeneous products.

9.3.2. Standardized Business Procedures. Reinsurers are also willing to accept risk from primary insurers
at lower costs if the latter’s business procedures are relatively standardized across products. Similarity among
accounting and reporting procedures, sales strategies, auditing, cash ﬂow management, premium collections,
and indemnity payments contribute to lower reinsurer costs. Thus, primary insurers need to develop and deliver
products within pre-established, standard business practices. Such activity also contributes to developing
transparency and conﬁdence in business systems.

9.3.3. Standardized Loss Adjusting. Similarly, standardized and well-documented loss adjusting is important
for reducing reinsurance costs. Of course, loss adjustment approaches will differ across products (e.g., multiple-
peril yield insurance versus proxy insurance products). However, similar loss adjustment procedures certainly
need to be promoted within classes of products, and when possible, across crops.

9.3.4. Pool Risk Retention and Transfer. Reinsurers often require that at least the ﬁrst 5% of crop insurance
liability remain with the primary insurer. In essence, this acts as a deductible for the reinsurer and helps reduce
moral hazard and adverse selection issues related to primary insurers. In addition, the provision of co-payments,
co-insurance, or percentage participation helps reduce concerns of moral hazard behaviour and reduces the
risks incurred by reinsurers. Such reductions reduce fees charged by reinsurers to accept risk.

9.3.5. Alternative Risk Transfer Mechanisms. Insurance pooling also involves various approaches to
transferring risk. In some cases, insurance providers facilitate stop-loss and risk sharing with governments. In
other cases, primary insurance providers agree to continue servicing contracts, even though most of the risk
associated with those contracts has been transferred to a reinsurer.




34      INTRODUCTION TO AGRICULTURAL INSURANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT
10.0        Illicit Behaviour
Unfortunately, crop insurance often provides an opportunity for illicit
behaviour. Strong underwriting, product management, and appropriate
management can minimize the undesirable behaviour.

Various potential sources for illicit behaviour including moral hazard,
adverse selection, and fraud exist within all insurance programs. Some of
this behaviour is especially relevant for crop insurance products.

10.1       Moral Hazard
Moral Hazard occurs when producers act in ways that increase the
possibility of receiving indemnities. Speciﬁcally, moral hazard refers to
actions taken by producers that would not occur in the absence of crop
insurance. In general, moral hazard does not refer to fraudulent activities.


  Example: Producers often have options regarding the quality of seeds used
  to produce a crop. Higher quality seed produces better yields but is more
  expensive. Lower quality and lower priced seed often results in lower yields.
  If a producer has purchased a yield-based insurance contract, the incentive to
  use lower cost and lower yielding seed is increased because resulting low yields
  would be somewhat offset by indemnity payments. Additionally, producers
  who have purchased crop insurance may be less diligent in monitoring
  weed and insect infestations or may be less attentive to irrigation timing or
  harvesting efforts.


The degree of moral hazard varies with program design. Potential for
moral hazard is higher in individual-yield insurance products that are
based on small areas of a farmer’s land. Almost no moral hazard occurs
with area yield, area revenue, or proxy index insurance products.

Moral hazard is usually the result of asymmetric information. Asymmetric
information refers to cases in which one party (usually a producer) takes
advantages of having more information regarding yield variability than
another party (usually an insurance company). If such asymmetries
exist, then insurance contracts must be carefully written to reduce moral
hazard effects.

Moral hazard impacts can be reduced in a variety of ways. The ﬁrst
and most obvious solution is through careful monitoring, but intensive
monitoring is expensive and adds to the costs of providing insurance
products. These costs must either be covered through higher premiums
or increased subsidies.

Another possible solution is to use indemnity triggers that cannot be
altered by the insured. Area yield, revenue, and proxy index products
reduce moral hazard for this reason. Finally, the use of high deductibles or
co-payments reduces the effect of moral hazard. Moral hazard activities
typically occur when actual harvest yields are close to indemnity triggers.
Increases in deductibles or co-payments reduce the likelihood that a
producer is near trigger levels.




                                                                                     MANUAL 1   35
10.2       Adverse Selection
Adverse Selection occurs when different parties have access to different information. In general, asymmetries
occur when the insured has more information regarding yield potential and distributions than an insurer.

Producers of identical crops may face different risks but often share similar premium schedules. Insurance
providers are often not able to distinguish between high-risk and low-risk producers, but high-risk producers are
more willing to buy insurance than low-risk producers. Hence, insurance providers often ﬁnd themselves with a
large pool of high-risk producers who are paying premiums that were calculated based on both high- and low-
risk participants.

Adverse selection may be reduced if pools can be formed so that the risk within each pool is more homogeneous
and rated accordingly. Often, pools are formed by region, by crop, and by different yields.

Compulsory insurance participation almost completely eliminates adverse selection. Cross-compliance
requirements often generate similar results. Proxy index products also reduce adverse selection outcomes.
However, other selection issues can occur if certain individual producers’ yield outcomes are relatively
uncorrelated with the proxy trigger process. A producer’s risk aversion level will encourage participation if
indemnity payments are highly correlated with losses.

10.3       Participation Erosion
Participation Erosion occurs when insurance providers respond to moral hazard or adverse selection issues
by increasing premium rates. However, higher premiums provide incentives for the lowest risk producers to
exit the insurance pool, resulting in a pool with a relatively higher proportion of high-risk producers. As the
process repeats, insurance premium rates must be raised to the point where only the highest-risk producers will
purchase insurance. Participation erosion can eventually make providing insurance impossible.

There are several ways to reduce participation erosion. Separating producers into different risk pools can
help. For example, if one can identify high- versus low-risk producers, these groups can be segregated which
allows premiums to be calculated commensurate with actual risk incurred. Historical yield variability is
one way to segregate producers by risk proﬁle. Additionally, governments can subsidize premiums so that
insurance is desirable to all producers. Another option is to assume varying levels of risk aversion based upon
socioeconomic characteristics. For example, subsistence farmers are often highly risk averse because a single
poor yield can result in starvation.

10.4       Fraud
Fraud occurs when producers attempt to increase indemnity
payments by violating their insurance contracts. Crop insurance fraud
most frequently occurs when producers underreport yields, manipulate
yield histories, or bribe loss adjusters. A variety of methods have been
developed to detect fraud, including:
     • Actively monitoring crop progress and harvest yields;
     • Scrutinizing data for anomalies in yield reports, indemnity
       payments, and location yield correlations;
     • Designing products that reduce potential for fraudulent
       activities (e.g., proxy index and area-based products);
     • Strictly enforcing rules and regulations and assigning high
       penalties for fraud. Effective and well-publicized fraud detection
       programs must be developed in conjunction with insurance
       program designs.




36       INTRODUCTION TO AGRICULTURAL INSURANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT
11.0       Government Responsibilities
Government provides a variety of insurance services even if the program
is largely implemented by the private sector.

11.1       Regulation
A major component of public policy with respect to crop insurance
involves regulation. Public policy must enhance and guarantee contract
enforcement among insurance providers, reinsurers, and the insured.
Insurance contracts must be consistently adjudicated. The adherence
to contract law provides necessary transparency and conﬁdence in
agricultural insurance programs.
The ﬁnancial integrity of primary insurers is critical to a successful
agricultural insurance program. Insurers must maintain accurate
records of policy contracts, premium collections, subsidy transfers,
and loss adjustments. In addition, ﬁrms must have adequate ﬁnancial
reserves to conduct business and provide indemnity payments promptly.
Government agencies or third parties must monitor the ﬁnancial business
practices of primary insurers.

11.2       Audit and Oversight
Public policy is directly involved in auditing and oversight functions.
A major auditing function is to guarantee that primary insurers and
reinsurers will meet their accepted responsibilities. In addition, public
policy must also be sufficient to meet government commitments
regarding stop-loss, reinsurance, or subsidy provisions.
Subsidy payments represent a transfer of resources from taxpayers to
agricultural producers and/or insurance companies. Therefore, the ﬂow
and use of these funds must be monitored to guarantee the integrity of
the process. The process must be transparent so that taxpayers can see
that funds are used as intended. Public policy must provide oversight with
respect to both the delivery and use of subsidies. Because government
resources are limited in terms of ﬁnancial and personnel resources, it is
important to identify essential government roles and activities. If not
performed by governments, these roles must be performed by private or
third-party entities.
If a variety of insurance and reinsurance companies are involved in
product design and administration, it is likely that premium rates will
differ—even for identical or similar products—as a result of unique rating
rules, proﬁt goals, risk preferences, and ﬁnancial resources. Consequently,
it may be necessary to rationalize these differences across companies,
products, and regions. In addition, primary insurers have incentives to
overstate premium rates on products that receive government subsidies.
Government agencies generally perform many of the above functions, but
third-party groups may perform some tasks which lessen the burden on
government agencies and provide access to additional expertise. The use
of third parties may also be more cost-effective.
In some countries, insurance companies are reviewed and monitored
by third-party auditors during normal business operations. If conﬂicts
of interest can be avoided, these auditors can also help monitor issues
related to crop insurance accounting. Check-off dollars from each
policy may be deposited into an account that helps pay for third-party
monitoring. A reserve pool can also be used as insurance against default
by any single insurance company.

                                                                              MANUAL 1   37
Equitable agricultural insurance programs treat all participants fairly and impartially. Equity cannot be
achieved unless decisions are made and implemented consistently. Transparency and consistency are necessary
for fairness, which is only achieved if all participants clearly understand the tradeoff s and details of crop
insurance products.

In addition, programs must be monitored to guarantee consistent application and enforcement of rules.
Monitoring must include:
     • Internal audits of loss-adjusting standards;
     • Processes that prevent “proﬁt” from affecting loss adjusting results;
     • The use of independent loss adjusters;
     • Third-party external auditing.
11.3        Judicial and Legal
Country-speciﬁc judicial and legal systems must fairly enforce contract and property right law. Contracts must
be consistently enforced regardless of insurance provider or the insured. Enforcement must be equitable for all
parties and individuals.

Government agencies need to be involved in enforcing contractual agreements. In addition, government
involvement in arbitration may be desired.

11.4        Subsidies
Public policy must deﬁne the role and scope of agricultural insurance subsidies. For example, it is possible to
provide subsidies directly to producers or indirectly through insurance or reinsurance providers. Policy makers
must decide whether goals are best met through subsidizing insurance premiums and/or through the provision
of administration and operating resources directly to insurers. Reinsurance companies are generally interested
in accepting risk for portfolios that have a minimum starting liability value of $200 million with potential for
increases to $1 billion. Subsidies encourage agricultural insurance participation and may be required to develop
sufficient volumes needed for reinsurance.

11.4.1. Premium and Servicing Subsidies. Governments often play important roles in subsidizing agricultural
insurance programs. Subsidies can be in the form of reductions in premiums, contributions to insurers’
administrative and operating expenses, reinsurance and stop-loss activities, regulatory and auditing oversight,
and impacts on trade and international policies.

Governments use a variety of approaches to providing premium subsidies including subsidizing premiums by
a ﬁxed amount per hectare for a given crop in a given region. Amounts often vary by crop and region, and
subsidies may be paid either directly to producers or to insurance companies.

Governments can also subsidize premiums by a percentage amount. Percentage subsidies are often larger
for higher deductibles and smaller for lower deductibles. This provides farmers with incentives to choose
lower coverage levels and reduces primary insurers’ total liability and opportunities for producer moral hazard
activities. The costs of providing (i.e., servicing) subsidies are generally a constant percentage of pure risk
premiums for similar insurance products. However, costs vary among insurance products. For example, area
insurance products are less expensive to administer than individual farm insurance products.

In many countries—including the United States—low levels of insurance coverage (Catastrophic Crop Insurance)
are provided to producers free of charge.

11.4.2. Public Reinsurance. Public policy is an important dimension for reinsurance. In many cases,
governments serve as reinsurers. Public policy often dictates the collection and storage of data and many
program features. Finally, public policy can inﬂuence portfolio volumes.

Governments may also provide stop-loss services. Stop-loss activities refer to situations in which (usually) a
government accepts insurance losses beyond a certain level. In many cases, insurance providers and reinsurers
will not offer insurance products in the absence of stop-loss agreements. Stop-loss levels are commonly about
three to ﬁve times total premium levels. In the absence of stop-loss agreements, premium rates would be
higher because of added risk.

38       INTRODUCTION TO AGRICULTURAL INSURANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT
11.4.2.1. Government Involvement. Insurance companies use pools to group policies into similar risk
categories. One way that governments support agricultural insurance is by reinsuring high-risk products or
producers. Governments often establish a high-risk pool into which primary insurance companies are allowed
to place a limited number of policies. In general, high-risk pools are limited to less than 15% of total liability. All
indemnities stemming from policies assigned to the government high-risk pool are paid by the government.

Insurance companies often use government high-risk pools as a way to reinsure new products and programs
which are often difficult to rate without historical performance, data, participation, and moral hazard controls.
Well-developed agricultural insurance programs often assign fewer than 10% of total liabilities to government
high-risk pools. New products are less likely to be developed if high-risk pools are not reinsured by governments.

Unless governments reinsure all policies, crop insurance programs must be actuarially sound if the risk is to be
accepted by a private reinsurer. Thus, policies must contain strong underwriting to avoid moral hazard, adverse
selection, and fraud. Some perils may need to be excluded and premium rates must be actuarially sound.

11.4.2.2. Data Quality. To attract reinsurance companies, primary insurers must clearly identify the frequency
of yield losses and their causes. These measures must be quantiﬁable if a reinsurer is going to be interested
in accepting additional risk. Governments are often the source of much of the agricultural data necessary for
underwriting purposes. If high quality data are not available, reinsurers may increase rate loads.

11.5       Trade and International Policies
Agricultural programs are scrutinized for compliance with international trade agreements including WTO/
GATT (World Trade Organization/General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) obligations. WTO trade agreements
limit the amount of agricultural support by country. In general, safety net programs such as crop insurance or
disaster programs are not trade-distorting and does not count toward support limits, but these programs must
follow certain rules. Crucially, such programs must support farm incomes across all enterprises and can only
be implemented when farm income falls below 70% of a farm’s ﬁve-year moving average. Most agricultural
support programs do not meet this requirement, primarily because they are product speciﬁc. However, if those
subsidies represent less than 5% of crop values on a national basis, then they are considered de minimis subsidies
and are not counted as part of a country’s domestic agricultural support program. Although large, expenditures
by the United States and Canada on crop insurance subsidies do not exceed the de minimus target. Current WTO
negotiations include a proposal to lower the de minimus target to 2.5%.

Some European Union countries support crop insurance programs (e.g., Italy and Spain). Since 2001, the European
Commission has been exploring EU-wide options for agricultural insurance including premium subsidies.




                                                                                                    MANUAL 1          39
12.0        Marketing and Program
            Management
The primary issues regarding program management include producer
participation, insurance pooling, and general business management
decision-making. Standardizing these processes is an important element
for effective management, transparency, and reinsurance.

12.1        Marketing
Marketing efforts must be designed so that the beneﬁts from purchasing
crop insurance are clear and well deﬁned. Consequently, the details of
each crop insurance product must be carefully explained and highlighted.
In addition, marketing campaigns must provide for current and future
product education. Marketing must clearly outline the transparency
of insurance products to inspire conﬁdence in agricultural insurance
programs. To this end, loss adjusting policies must be carefully
described. The process of premium collection, acreage updates, and
planting deadlines must be clearly understood by producers. In addition,
regulatory rules, program management issues, and dispute resolution
procedures must be apparent in all marketing literature. A marketing
program should encompass a variety of delivery media including personal
contact, written materials, and Internet-based resources.

Processes for selling insurance contracts must consider a variety of
questions including:
     • Should selling agents be certiﬁed to indicate that they understand
       the products they are selling?
     • Should all selling agents offer every product including those
       favoured or developed by competing companies?

Building conﬁdence in crop insurance programs requires:
     • Adhering to a ﬁxed set of principles;
     • Meeting the objectives of stakeholders;
     • Providing transparency, consistency, equity, and fair dispute
       resolution;
     • Streamlining business processes to improve cost effectiveness.
Developing and adhering to principles or goals is an important element
to building conﬁdence in crop insurance systems. The Canadian and U.S.
systems emphasize similar principles:
     • Clear purpose or program objectives;
     • Transparency and Consistency;
     • Equity and Fairness;
     • Stakeholder Representation;
     • Professionalism and Competency.




40       INTRODUCTION TO AGRICULTURAL INSURANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT
12.1.1. Program Transparency refers to making processes and products understandable and as uncomplicated
as possible. Because agricultural insurance is complex by its very nature, efforts must be made to simplify and
clearly explain procedures, objectives, processes, and products.


  Example: When new Canadian products are introduced, printed materials are developed that describe every aspect of the
  new product. In the process, pros and cons of the product are discussed as are appropriate and inappropriate applications.
  In addition, insurance agents are supplied with documents, information, and training. Agents make appointments with
  their customers to discuss the new product and distribute informational materials. Finally, producers and agents can
  contact the agency that is introducing the new product if questions arise. These efforts provide participants with the
  knowledge necessary for making good decisions and reducing disputes.


12.1.2. Program Consistency requires that programs and products be compatible, harmonious, and consistent
with adopted principles, objectives, and goals.

Consistency of product design implies that:
   • Product designs are standardized across insurance ﬁrms;
   • Insurance contracts, application processes, and underwriting are standardized;
   • Data collection is coordinated and standardized;
   • Loss adjusting and dispute resolution processes are standardized;
   • Accurate methods are presented in educational efforts;
   • Written material are designed to improve interactions between sales agents and producers;
   • Call centres exist for farmers and sales agents;
   • Insurance personnel training is coordinated;
   • Formal processes are developed to document continuous improvements in education, knowledge, and
       efficacy.

12.2       Producer Participation
Farmers are the consumers of crop insurance products. For an agricultural insurance program to be successful,
it must satisfy these consumers. Farmer satisfaction will largely depend upon the degree to which the program
addresses several factors.

12.2.1. Product Identiﬁcation. Producers must be offered products that help them manage risk. Identifying
producer needs can occur in a variety of ways.

Farm organizations play a role in transmitting producer needs to the insurance industry. For example, prior
to 1990, insurance was not available for blueberry production in the United States. Congressional delegations
representing blueberry producers in Wisconsin and Massachusetts asked the USDA’s Risk Management Agency
(RMA) develop a product to help manage yield risk associated with blueberries.

Another example is provided by U.S. malting barley producers who wanted a product to help manage quality
risks. Although individual insurance products were available for feed barley, existing yield insurance did not
mitigate quality risks. Producers could harvest above-average crop yields that were unsuitable for malting
purposes because of weather conditions. As a result, producers incurred price discounts when they were forced
to sell malting barley into the feed barley market. National producer groups successfully lobbied for a quality
rider on barley yield insurance products.

Government crop insurance agencies rely on farmer focus groups to help direct new product development. For
example, the USDA RMA has periodically organized farm focus groups to discuss insurance products and new
product development. These focus groups have had substantial inﬂuence on program design and helped develop
desirable products.

Additionally, government and farm organizations frequently contract with consultants who have substantial
expertise in plant physiology, economics, and statistics to develop new products.


                                                                                                         MANUAL 1              41
12.2.2. Educating Producers. Another important criterion for
success involves educating producers about crop insurance products.
This process often involves government support and collaboration
with university faculty, agricultural extension services, and private
contractors to develop and deliver crop insurance education. These
educational opportunities include in-person producer workshops that
explain product design, implementation, and decision-tool computer
software that enables producers to assess the value of crop insurance
products for their operations. Additionally, farmers are provided with
fact sheets describing products, sign-up deadlines, and other important
administrative and compliance requirements or web- and CD-based
self-directed educational curricula.

The U.S. government allocates $20 to $50 million annually for crop
insurance education. The United States and Canada target limited-
resource and underrepresented populations in much of their educational
efforts. These groups generally consist of relatively small farm producers.

Private insurance companies also provide educational materials for
insurance agents, and those agents educate producers. However, the
potential for conﬂicts of interest certainly exists in these arrangements.
Farm organizations often receive funding from government agencies to
educate their members.

12.2.3. Sales and Enrollment. An agricultural insurance program can
only be successful if farmers purchase products and enrol in insurance
programs. Major stakeholders in this process often include private
primary insurance providers and government agencies (especially if the
crop insurance program is operated and managed by the government).

In the United States, every crop insurance issuing agency must offer the
entire breadth of products to customers. Some farm organizations are
also crop insurance issuing agencies. All Canadian insurance product
sales are managed by a government agency.

12.2.4. Premium Collection. Another important point of contact
with customers involves premium collection. Premium collection
procedures must be clearly deﬁned and operational. The complication of
government premium subsidy payments must be politically acceptable,
transparent, and cost effective.

Collections actually occur in a variety of ways. Private primary insurance
providers or government agencies collect premiums (usually net of
subsidies which are usually paid by the government directly to insurance providers). These premiums may be
collected at purchase or after harvest (premiums are deducted from forthcoming indemnities). If the purchase
occurs at harvest, rules must be established to guarantee that premium payments will be made.

In some countries, such as Ukraine, producers pay the entire premium to a private primary insurance provider
and then receive a subsidy in the form of a rebate, either from the government or from the private company at a
later date.

12.2.5. Loss Adjustment is central to successful insurance programs. The interaction between producers and
loss adjusters is often fraught with emotion resulting from producers’ concerns about recent losses. At these
times producers do not want to argue with adjusters over loss adjustment details and outcomes. Historically,
a variety of approaches have been used for loss adjusting. Private primary insurance providers can randomly
select loss adjusters from a pool of individuals certiﬁed by a government agency. The government may contract
with independent loss adjusters (ideally with no local ties) or uses government employees. Additionally,
private primary insurance providers hire loss adjusters while random audits of performance are conducted by a
government agency.


42      INTRODUCTION TO AGRICULTURAL INSURANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT
12.2.6. Indemnity Payments. Another point of contact between insurance programs and customers occurs
when indemnity payments are issued. The timing, accuracy, and efficacy of indemnity payments are crucial
elements of established insurance programs. Many different approaches are used to manage indemnity
payments.

Loss adjusters sometimes pay small claims immediately (almost literally in the ﬁeld). Large claims are often
paid at a later date after review. Private primary insurance providers can pay all indemnities after a review, or a
government agency can pay all indemnities. This usually occurs when a government agency is the sole provider
of insurance (as in Canada, for example). It is also possible to allow only certiﬁed insurance companies to offer
crop insurance services. The threat of losing certiﬁcation can provide an incentive for companies to provide
accurate, fair, and timely indemnity servicing.

12.2.7. Dispute Resolution. Successful businesses must have reasonable and credible dispute resolution
processes. Dispute resolution procedures must be transparent, accessible, inexpensive, and equitable; these
procedures are key to developing successful agricultural insurance programs. Effective dispute resolution
systems should be easily accessible, understood, and well-deﬁned. The processes that producers must follow to
obtain review of initial claim assessments have to be clear.

Successful programs should employ an independent review panel that incorporates other producers trained
in nuances of agriculture insurance including speciﬁc contract provisions and rationales for loss adjusting and
encourage local or “informal” professional representation rather than legal representation. Review committees
must be educated so they understand agriculture insurance programs, contracts, production management
issues. These committees must be void of conﬂicts of interest and understand spatially diverse situations.

Producers must be given opportunities to appeal cases in a non-threatening environment. Appeal procedures
for appeals and decision-making must be well-documented, affordable, and timely. Decisions must include
clear reasons for a given outcome and must be promptly provided. Finally, records of reviews and disputes
must be maintained.




                                                                                                MANUAL 1         43
For example, in the United States, dispute resolutions involving loss adjustments follow these steps:
     • Initially, a producer must appeal the loss adjustment to the private primary insurance provider who
       sold and serviced the contract. Producers may request a second loss adjustment opinion by a different
       adjuster. Most disputes are resolved at this level;
     • If a producer is still dissatisﬁed, he or she ﬁles paperwork with a Dispute Resolution Panel;
     • Dispute Resolution Panel members are drawn from a broad base (representatives from farms and farm
       organizations, loss adjusters, etc.). Members are appointed by the Director of USDA’s Risk Management
       Agency;
     • If a producer is still dissatisﬁed with the outcome, he or she can use the judicial system to resolve the
       dispute. However, the judicial system generally sides with decisions of the Dispute Resolution Panel
       providing that there were no procedural errors.

Although loss adjustment disputes are a reality, the issue is likely to be more common during the early stages
of development as underwriting oversights are revealed and producers learn about procedures, processes, and
products. Consequently, it is imperative that dispute resolution processes be fully developed before offering crop
insurance products.

12.3        Primary Insurance Pooling
Insurance providers pay reinsurers to accept much of the risk they incur through the sale of insurance contracts.
Reinsurance costs are lower if insurance providers can pool similar contracts across multiple dimensions.
Furthermore, appropriate pooling is necessary to avoid participation erosion. Hence, programs need to facilitate
pooling across crops, yield determinations, regions, and production practices. Rating must recognize risk
difference in these pools.

12.3.1. Crop. Every crop has unique properties for purposes of crop insurance. Differences in yield variability
cause premium rates to differ markedly across crops and crop sub-classes. In addition, many crops have quality
dimensions that must be considered when establishing value for indemnity and sales purposes. Variations in
normal planting dates and other cultural practices also need to be considered. For example, prevented and
delayed planting dates must be established.

12.3.2. Yield. The establishment of expected yields for each crop also affects insurance pooling. Historical
data are often lacking or incomplete. Regional data may not be highly correlated with speciﬁ c farming
operations. The measurement of actual yields and loss adjusting procedures differ across crops and insurance
providers. Often, yields can be measured on either a “wet” or a “dry” basis which affects the weight of a crop
and, ultimately, yield calculations. In cases of quality considerations, there are differences in insurance contracts
regarding whether quality adjustments are to be made on yield or price factors.

12.3.3. Spatial. There are substantial regional differences in crop production. Normal production practices
differ by region, as do expected yields. Different varieties of the same crop are often planted in across different
regions to take advantage of local weather conditions. The establishment of prices used for indemnifying yield
contracts and calculating value in revenue contracts vary spatially. Even within a region, substantial basis
differences exist. Climate differences also cause variation in end-use quality factors in terms of food and feed
processors. Thus, spatial issues complicate insurance pooling activities.

12.3.4. Production Practices. Heterogeneous production practices also provide challenges for insurance
pooling. Even within a region, several types of wheat (e.g., spring, winter, and durum) may be produced. Each
may be produced under either dry land or irrigated production systems. Tillage practices for each can range
from conventional tillage to limited tillage, minimum tillage, or no tillage. Each of these tillage systems may be
used in conjunction with every-other year fallow, ﬂex-cropping, or continuous cropping practices.

12.3.5. Farm Size. Larger farms usually have less yield volatility and lower servicing costs than small farms.
Therefore, actuarially sound insurance rates are less for larger farms. However, providing lower rates to larger
farms is often politically controversial.




44       INTRODUCTION TO AGRICULTURAL INSURANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT
12.4       Business Management
A wide range of business functions including management, monitoring, and governance are important elements
of the agricultural insurance industry. The purpose of management is to coordinate the business functions of an
agricultural insurance company. Management is supposed to be “the face” of the system to producers and the
public. They represent the integrity of the system and organize communication and strategic planning.

Monitoring functions include contract enforcement, identiﬁcation of the entities of the transaction, products
offerings, coverage limits, insurance eligibility, risk capacity of insurance ﬁrms and the system, public reporting,
consumer protection, certiﬁcation of agents and insurance ﬁrms, and data management.

Governance involves decision-making about the structure and culture of a business entity. Speciﬁcally,
governance involves strategic planning and setting priorities, regulatory compliance, establishing accuracy and
clarity of insurance contracts, operating processes, and communications, ﬁnancial management and public
disclosures, and auditing and performance management. Together these functions facilitate the operations,
administration, and accounting activities of a business ﬁrm.

12.4.1. Operations. Operating philosophy, program evaluation, reporting, monitoring, and oversight are
essential elements of a successful agricultural insurance program.

Operating philosophies must allow managers to embody and communicate vision and philosophy, embed
operations functions throughout system, assess and train successors, plan and manage knowledge, and develop
processes that create and maintain integrity across operating functions (e.g., sales and loss adjusting).

Evaluating the success of a crop insurance program requires creating measurable targets that compare
outcomes with original goals and gathering data that supports targets. Evaluations must include regular
monitoring of key operating functions (e.g., loss adjusting, surplus premium investment performance, and
dispute resolution) and conduct cost/beneﬁt analyses of “best practice” improvement strategies.

Reporting and third-party audits refer to public accountability (if government funding is involved), transparent
annual performance accounting, on-going open and effective communication with primary stakeholders and
the public, third-party audits, sufficient ﬁnancial reserves, and premium subsidy ﬂows within system.

Monitoring business functions involves performing “system” assessments (business process review, producer
participation, timing of claims and premium paying, response to production disaster, claims paid vs. claims
reported); assessing loss adjustments (accuracy, consistency with standards, timing); and evaluating the
performance of individuals within ﬁrms (management and other personnel).

Oversight committees or boards of directors should represent the interests of all stakeholders, insurance
companies, government, and customers. The committee or board collectively decides on governance
responsibilities, monitors management activities, and communicates with government, producers, and insurance
ﬁrms. The committee should provide integrity, competency, and transparency to the system.

12.4.2. Administration. Management must have the authority to take action in the interest of meeting goals
and fulﬁlling ﬁduciary responsibilities. For crop insurance system it is necessary to have sufficient resources to
pursue business strategies, the authority to assign competent personnel with appropriate training and skills to
complete tasks, structured performance assessments with rewards, guidance, and training for improvement,
and processes for internal audit and monitoring to create and maintain integrity.

Additional administrative tasks include coordination and business strategy development through designing
consistent products and developing operating standards (e.g., loss adjusting, underwriting), organizing data
management and information technology systems, and setting priorities. Administration must coordinate
research and product development, provide clear expectations regarding product delivery, and offer non-
confrontational monitoring for the purpose of business improvements (education/training focus).

12.4.3. Accounting. Accurate, reliable, and efficient accounting systems are critical to the successful
management and control of an agricultural insurance program. Such systems must have well-designed and
functioning information technology systems, business systems, reporting, and auditing procedures.

12.4.3.1. Information Technology (IT) Systems. Agricultural insurance programs must have accurate,
secure, accessible, redundant, and expandable IT systems. As is the case with many businesses, IT activities are
essential for agricultural insurance programs. Most IT systems used by agricultural insurance programs employ
“Relational Databases” because of the huge amounts of information being processed. Relational databases
are characterized by key identiﬁers of individual producers (contracts) that can be linked across data sets.
Agricultural insurance programs often require that variables be adjusted to reﬂect current conditions. Given
the number of records that must be managed, a relational database allows for a change in one element of the
database to be reﬂected across all records.

IT systems must provide easy access to data. One data access method uses “Query Tools”—automated systems
that allow clients to access those data most relevant to current tasks.

Data management involves the use of numbers that represent, for example, yield data, price information,
and loss adjustments. However, data must also be managed with respect to “Knowledge and Records” which
refer to recording and tracking decisions made by insurance providers. Knowledge created over time must be
transferred to others.

IT systems must also consider the delivery modes used to transfer information to others. That is, IT systems must
include speciﬁc design elements if information is to be accessible through the Internet, in-person, or in print.

12.4.3.2. Business Systems are necessary for providing agricultural insurance, and include operating
procedures that allow for the management of:
     • Sales, applications, underwriting, and contracting;
     • Accounts receivable – billing and collection systems (producer, government, reinsurance);
     • Accounts payable – claims assessment (loss adjusting, processing, dispute resolution, documentation);
     • Reporting – ﬁnancial and performance indicators.
12.4.3.3. Reporting Procedures must not be arbitrary. They should be clear, consistent, well-deﬁned,
accurate, objective, and scheduled.

Reporting systems are often the responsibility of an oversight committee or board of directors that includes
representation from major stakeholders, including representatives of insurance ﬁ rms, government, farmers,
and the public. Reporting should include issues related to business development, program delivery, policy, cost
sharing, and regulatory compliance.

12.4.3.4. Auditing functions include internal and external audits. Internal audits are performed by insurance
providers and external audits are conducted by qualiﬁed third parties. Audits evaluate the operational aspects
of business systems as a check of impartiality, accuracy, and integrity.

Internal auditing is a management tool that reviews business functions such as governance, operating processes,
policy documentation, contract application, billing accuracy, premium rating results, and claims processing.
Additionally, audits can identify issues with and make improvements to system processes and determine
problems that may emerge during third-party external audits.

Third-party external audits are conducted by unbiased external observers and are designed to provide an
independent review of business practices and ﬁnancial stability and evaluate premium collection process, data
management systems, record keeping, accuracy, and consistent application of rules and procedures. Third-party
audits provide recommendations to management and regulators and review progress in addressing concerns
from previous audits. Third-party audit processes should be organized so that multiple audits are unnecessary.

Third-party audits, which are often required by regulatory agencies, frequently require substantial participation
from management because external auditors usually do not understand crop insurance. Therefore, additional
efforts have to be made to provide training. Well-developed agricultural insurance systems should conduct annual
third-party audits that result in publicly-available annual reports that develop and maintain system integrity.




46       INTRODUCTION TO AGRICULTURAL INSURANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT
13.0. Summary Comments
The development, implementation, and success of agricultural insurance
programs require much coordination, cooperation, and shared visions.
Financial sustainability depends upon offering products desired by
producers. In addition, appropriate premiums must be charged and
transparent business management systems must be employed. In
many cases, government involvement is necessary in terms of providing
regulatory services and/or ﬁnancial reserves or subsidies. In addition,
human resources with speciﬁc expertise must be developed before
implementing an insurance program. Substantial human capacities are
required in government ministries, insurance regulators, private insurance
companies, and producer organizations. Many of these skills are speciﬁc
to the agricultural insurance sector.

Agricultural insurance systems involve multiple elements that must be
carefully coordinated. To attract the interest of reinsurers, a pool of
agri-insurance companies must often agree to market similar insurance
products. Banks and other input suppliers are often involved in the sale
of agri-insurance because it minimizes credit risk and improves producers’
access to ﬁnance. Enforceable contract legal systems must exist for such
programs to thrive. Also, the cooperation among disparate groups must
center on a common vision and outcome. Finally, training and system
development must be the product of substantial efforts to develop and
introduce agri-insurance products into a market.
