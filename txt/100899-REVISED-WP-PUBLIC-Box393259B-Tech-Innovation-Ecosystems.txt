There are several implications arising
from this trend. The rise of technology
startups (particularly, information and
communications technology, ICT) in cit-
ies is leading to new sources of employ-
ment and economic growth by creation
of new businesses and employment cate-
gories. In New York City, the technology
sector has increased jobs faster than in
other sectors, becoming a new source of
direct and indirect employment (Figure
0.1). The positive correlation between
growth in the ICT industry of a city and
job creation is being observed in other
cities as well. Bangkok has been adding
over 3,000 direct jobs a year to its ICT
industry. In Barcelona, ICT is recognized
as a key industry with almost a third
of all companies and around half of the
labor force involved in the knowledge
economy. As the economy evolves into

However, tech innovation and
entrepreneurship is not growing equally.
Some cities are experiencing higher,
faster, and more sustainable growth than
others. There is anecdotal evidence that
connections and communities play a key
role in the surge and sustainability of
urban tech innovation. Some cities, such
as New York, are already creating policy
actions to nurture tech innovation with
this hypothesis in mind. Identifying key
success factors to grow, develop, and
sustain technology innovation in cities
can help to inform policy actions. This

These four categories are connected
through networks and markets. This
last element finds traction in the most
recent two frameworks proposed (Bell
and The Brookings Institution). The
Brookings Institution framework expands
the concept to networking assets, which
include events that create community,
such as meetups or challenges and
collaboration spaces, such as coworking
spaces, accelerators, or incubators.

Work with country clients on activities
related to developing and strengthening
urban innovation ecosystems
corroborates these categories. Several
urban innovation ecosystems have been
mapped by the World Bank and the
Research Partners (see Appendix B for
World Bank activities and Appendix
C for Research Partners). Through
these mapping efforts, these four

RESEARCH PARTNERS

Computation Institute, Harris School of Public of Policy, University of Chicago

The Computation Institute (CI) was established in 2000 as a joint initiative between The University of Chicago and Argonne
National Laboratory to advance science through innovative computational approaches. Scholarship in the sciences, arts, and
medicine depends increasingly on collection and analysis of large quantities of data and detailed numerical simulations of complex
phenomena. Progress is gated by researchers’ ability to construct complex software systems, to harness large-scale computing, and
to federate distributed resources. The CI is both an intellectual nexus and resource center for those building and applying such
computational platforms for science. As an intellectual nexus, it brings together researchers from different disciplines with common
interests in advancing the state-of-the-art in computing and its applications. As a resource center, it provides expert assistance to
scholars whose work requires the most advanced computational methods.1

Endeavor Insight

Endeavor Insight is the research arm of Endeavor, which seeks to deepen understanding of how high-impact entrepreneurs
contribute to job creation and long-term economic growth in order to educate key constituencies, such as policy makers. Endeavor
Insight seeks to serve as a knowledge center for high-impact entrepreneurs, VCs and others in order to provide useful information
and tools that assist high-impact entrepreneurs as they grow their business.2

Global Entrepreneurship Research Network (GERN)

“A collaboration of research organizations around the world whose goals are to generate useful and actionable knowledge
for entrepreneurs, policymakers, and others; fill gaps in what we know about entrepreneurship; standardize data, especially
longitudinal survey work; conduct experiments and evaluation of entrepreneurship education and training programs; and, gain
a better understanding of policy barriers and what the right policies are for fostering entrepreneurship. The organizations
participating in this network commit to collecting and sharing research results so they are accessible, usable, and open. Key
founding partners, along with Kauffman, are Endeavor Insight and the World Bank.”3

MaRS Innovation and NESTA are also participating in similar research on urban innovation ecosystems as part of GERN.4

CITY PARTNERS

City partners include agencies and departments from local city governments as well as innovation hubs and collaboration spaces.
The list of city partners includes the members of the Working Group on urban innovation ecosystems from the Community of
Practice of Open Innovation in Cities. In addition, a ministry and a national agency also participate. The list of city partners is as

Innovation ecosystem-related projects the team has been working with include, but are not limited to:

LEBANON MOBILE INTERNET ECOSYSTEM PROJECT (MIEP)

MIEP’s objective is to strengthen technology-led innovation ecosystem and foster entrepreneurship and employability in Lebanon.
The project focus is to grow and sustain the ecosystem community, expand technical and entrepreneurial skills and to expand the
technology ecosystem throughout the economic sectors in Lebanon.

The project is a 4-year program with a budget of USD 12.8 MM with four main activities:

1.	 Skills training for youth and entrepreneurs. The activity will develop a series of crowdsourcing competitions, which will
   include intense hand-on training (for example, bootcamp style) with a light acceleration phase. The result of this competition
   will be a series of startup projects (that is, minimum viable prototype beta tested, a business plan and a pitch). The
   competitions will also include an international mentorship program and exchange to connect the Lebanese ecosystem to others.
   In addition, this activity will create a university-industry platform for industry project training and a series of technology skills
   activities for schools. The university-industry platform will provide final-year students to team up with industry to solve real
   challenges from companies through a start-up or product projects in a 6-month timeframe.

2.	 Growth and sustainability of the tech-innovation community. The activity will develop network of mentors, links
   among entrepreneurs and networking events (for example, meetups) to support existing community. The activity will also
   complement existing collaboration spaces and provide technology tools (for example, maker space), labs (for example, living
   labs), and a space for community networking. This space will be managed by an innovation hub (the Mobile Innovation Hub,
   MiHub), which will serve to coordinate the community and the community-building activities. The MiHub will also take the
   role of promoting the community and its exemplary members.

3.	 Innovation for legacy industry and other sector of the economy. The activity will develop a series of hands-on workshops
   and activities between technology startups and entrepreneurs, and legacy industries that have not integrated widely technology
   in their production processes. This activity will also develop exchange activities with experts from other innovation ecosystems
   globally. This project is supported by a Trust Fund of the Korean-World Bank partnership.5

   local entrepreneurship.

4.	 Development of strategic plan with local ecosystem stakeholders (for example, government, academia, private sector, civil
   society, technology hubs, citizens) to support government’s open innovation and development of local entrepreneurship.

This activity was funded by the Information Communications Technologies (ICT) Korean Trust Fund.

GLOBAL: BARCELONA URBAN TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION HUB

The objectives of this activity is the co-creation of new knowledge and the dissemination of good practices on urban technology
and innovation that the city of Barcelona and its partners have developed over the years. The main areas of focus relates to
bottom-up innovation and how city government can engage with the city ecosystem to develop innovation and entrepreneurship
that addresses urban challenges. The activity organizes Citisense (an annual event on bottom-up approaches to urban
innovation) together with Smart City Expo World Congress, and the City as a Laboratory training course (a practical program
for policy-makers to introduce open innovation in city government) and develops common research on urban innovation and
entrepreneurship. This activity was funded by the City of Barcelona.

OPEN INNOVATION IN
CITIES COMMUNITY
OF PRACTICE


BACKGROUND

Cities everywhere face a growing influx of people and subsequent demand for public services. Investing in digitalization and civic
innovation can reduce service development costs, account for user needs in solutions and eventually lead to a more affordable
delivery and accountable management of resources. Administrators want to learn from each other but participatory approaches
applied in digital service design often still reside as a tacit know-how in the heads of few committed practitioners. This initiative
will bring practitioners together to identify, analyze and codify good practices applied in participatory design of ICT enabled
services/policies in global cities and to share it with peers where mostly needed.

OBJECTIVE

The Community of Practice (CoP) provides a vehicle to network lead practitioners in different cities and a platform to engage
them to work together on promoting open innovation for cities. The CoP will develop an open repository of good practices and
host a calendar of thematically related events targeted to share knowledge and lessons learned among cities.

ACTIVITIES

The CoP is an informal group for practitioners and based on projects of common interest focused on learning and new business
development. Activities can be discussions, blogging and presentation of members’ knowledge, but also more formal projects that
link members to joint work. Projects can be proposed by the members and executed within the CoP or outside of its domain
depending on members’ interest. Members can propose new projects executed within the CoP. These should have a leader and
initial work plan. If there is enough support amongst the members, projects are to be defined and started with the working group
led by a thematic leader.

WORKING GROUPS

The proposed Working Groups (WG) are the following:
•	 WG 1: Mapping and diagnosis of urban tech innovation ecosystems
•	 WG2: Compilation and impact of policies for open innovation
•	 WG3: Compilation and common solving mechanisms of challenges that cities face
•	 WG4: Curation and knowledge sharing of cases studies and best practices for open innovation tools in cities

MEMBERSHIP

The CoP starts initially with a closed membership to prepare the initial work and deliverables. The secretariat of the CoP is hosted
by the World Bank who will prepare a draft work plan including a proposal for gradual expansion and intake of new members to
the CoP. The work plan is to be approved by initial members.

Initial members include the following:

                                                                  31

                           Some of these living labs have evolved, similar to coworking spaces, into
                           tech-innovation community management centers, becoming innovation

                           among actors e.g., Citilab, and also providing links with or including in the

APPENDIX F
ANALYSIS OF
GEOGRAPHIC AND
SOCIAL DIMENSIONS
OF ECOSYSTEM
Kathy Qian and Nga Phuong Nguyen are the main authors of this Appendix.

In order to measure the value of networking assets in urban innovation ecosystems, the impact of connections on ecosystem
success outcomes must first be understood. Once the value of incremental connections can be quantified, individual networking
assets can be ranked and valued by multiplying their success in creating new connections by the value of incremental connections.

Connections are defined as either social or geographic. While there are multiple metrics that can be used to define success, in this
analysis the raising of a round of funding is considered as a successful outcome for startups and by extension the ecosystem as a
whole.

As such, this analysis focuses on examining the interplay between the geographic, social, and funding dynamics within New York
City’s (NYC) urban innovation ecosystem. The research questions explored and findings were as follows:

1.	 Where is the geographic center of NYC’s urban innovation ecosystem? The geographic center of NYC’s urban innovation
   ecosystem is located in Midtown Manhattan.

2.	 Which people or organizations are located at the social center of NYC’s urban innovation ecosystem? While startups
   have the highest closeness centrality and are at the center of the social network, incubators have the highest degree, eigenvector,
   and “betweenness” centralities and are key connectors within the ecosystem.

3.	 How do the geographic and social connectivity of startups influence their funding outcomes? Social momentum matters.
   The faster a startup gains second-order connections to investors, the more likely they are to successfully fundraise. A significant
   impact of geographic centrality on funding outcomes was not found.

4.	 What is the relationship between geographic and social centrality? While startups in the geographic center of the startup
   scene may be highly connected, their connections are not as socially diverse.

In summary, a relationship was found between social connections and funding outcomes within the NYC innovation ecosystem.
Evidence was also found to support the hypothesis that networking assets are central to the urban innovation ecosystem.

DATA

The dataset is comprised of two dimensions: social and geographic. The social dataset includes connections between startups,
investors, and incubators15 and was obtained from the raw data Endeavor Insight developed for its study The Power of
Entrepreneur Networks (Endeavor Insight, 2014).16 The geographic data was obtained by gathering address data through
Mechanical Turk and geocoding through an online geocoder.17

The urban innovation ecosystem is represented as a network of nodes and edges. Nodes are entities such as people and
organizations, while edges connect nodes through their relationships. For example, a startup is a node. An investor is also a node.
An investment is an edge that connects the startup and the investor.

It can be difficult to determine which nodes fall within the scope of each city’s urban innovation ecosystem if one is focused solely
on geography. What happens if a startup moves from one city to another? Or if a startup takes investment from a firm outside the

                                                                 36

city? Fortunately, the primary interest of this research is in mapping the social dimensions of the urban innovation ecosystem, so
the dataset is more flexible in incorporating nodes outside of NYC.

In order to define the scope of the data, the startups interviewed by Endeavor from 2013-2014 were first added as nodes. Next,
the founders of these startups were added as additional nodes, and then their associated investors and incubators were added to
the list of nodes. Finally, funded companies from which they sourced mentors, previously funded non-NYC startups, and former
employers that have received funding were included as other nodes. The aim was to map the first and second-order network each
startup can draw upon in order to reach investors.

                                                                BOX F.1
                                           The differences between accelerators and incubators


 Although the dataset and analysis does not differentiate between incubators and accelerators, there is a difference in their
 definitions:

 Accelerators support entrepreneurs and start-ups in early stages of development and they are often comprised of the following
 features: (i) a highly competitive and open application process for entrepreneurs, (ii) provision of small amounts of seed investment,
 (iii) focus on small teams rather than individual founders, (iv) intensive support for a limited period of time (usually 3-6 months),
 with active mentorship and networking, and (v) collaborative work among startups through cohort or classes of start-ups.

 Incubators are spaces that support start-ups by providing an office space and administrative support services. The most typical
 services are legal, recruiting, IT, accounting, public relations and pooled buying programs. In addition, incubators may also provide
 coaching, mentorship and help with access to funding at an ad hoc basis. Startups pay rent (which is usually below market rent) for
 the office space and there is normally not a time limit set for startups staying in the incubator (average staying ranges widely from
 18 months to 5 years). Some incubator providers may ask for a profit share in the future or require minority stake in the startup as
 prerequisite to access the incubator.

Nodes are never removed from the dataset, even if the represented entity no longer exists. In other words, once a startup appeared
in the dataset, they were kept in the dataset for all subsequent years. There were two reasons for this decision. First, accurate
end dates for startups were difficult to gather. Second, the primary interest was in mapping the social dimensions of the startup
network, not creating a year-by-year catalogue of startups. Although startups may close, socially they still function as nodes within
the urban innovation ecosystem that can introduce other nodes to second-order connections.

As seen in Figure F.1, in 2014, the latest year of data within our dataset, there were 2,119 startups in the ecosystem. Although
our dataset is smaller than the Digital.NYC and CrunchBase datasets (the largest publicly available databases of startups in
NYC), which include about 6700 and 7500 startups respectively, the survey-based sourcing of our dataset is more helpful in
obtaining historical connection data. However it is important to note that, when it comes to historical data, our dataset also shows
survivorship bias. As such, our dataset is most accurately described as a year-by-year mapping of how founders of startups that
existed in 2013-2014 evolved within the ecosystem.
                                                               FIGURE F.1
                                                 Cumulative number of startups per year




                                                                   37
APPENDIX F: ANALYSIS OF GEOGRAPHIC AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS OF ECOSYSTEM




However, the fact that the dataset was sourced through surveys also introduces biases that we should be aware of. When
interpreting the results within this paper, it is important to remember that our dataset comprises startups that have already “burst”
onto the NYC startup scene. As such, these startups are more likely to have already existed for some time and are more likely to
have already received funding.

This effect may be seen in Figure F.2, where the number of new startups in our dataset drops after 2012. Given the consistent
growth in the number of new startups in every year leading up to 2012, it is unlikely that there was a sharp decline in the number
of new startups. Rather, it is more likely that there was a systematic bias in how interview targets were gathered that caused newer
startups to be underrepresented.

In addition to startups, our dataset also includes venture capital firms and incubators. The number of active NYC institutional
investors is defined as institutional investors with locations in NYC who have made an investment within our dataset in that year
or prior. Institutional investors include venture capital firms, banks, and investment arms of large corporations. The number of
active NYC institutional investors jumped in 2000, grew steadily from 2000-2006, then grew more quickly from 2006 onward
(Figure F.3). In addition to the NYC institutional investors, our dataset also includes institutional investors who have invested in
at least one NYC startup but are located outside of NYC (Figure F.4).

The number of active NYC incubators is similarly defined as incubators with locations in NYC who have made an investment
within our dataset in that year or prior. The number of active NYC incubators grew steadily from 1995-2009, then grew more
quickly from 2009 onward (Figure F.5). In addition to the NYC incubators, our dataset also includes incubators who have
invested in at least one NYC startup but are located outside of NYC (Figure F.6).

APPENDIX F: ANALYSIS OF GEOGRAPHIC AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS OF ECOSYSTEM




Our dataset also includes the number of active individual investors each year. Individual investors are commonly known as “angel
investors.” Unlike institutional investors and incubators, location data for individual investors was not available, so we do not
differentiate between individual investors located in NYC and those who do not. The number of individual investors in our dataset
also rises rapidly beginning in 2009 (Figure F.7).

                                                              FIGURE F.7
                                             Number of active individual investors per year




In addition to startups and investors, our dataset also includes a few other organizations (Figure F.8). These are the funded
companies from which startups have sourced mentors,18 previously funded non-NYC startups of founders, and former employers
of founders that have received funding. These nodes exist to allow second-order connections to investors within the dataset to be
measured.

                                                                  40
APPENDIX F: ANALYSIS OF GEOGRAPHIC AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS OF ECOSYSTEM




In addition to individual investors and founders, our dataset includes a few other individuals who were key employees at funded
startups but not founders (Figure F.9).

                                                              FIGURE F.9
                                                     Roles of active people by year




Our dataset comprises both individuals and organizations (Figure F.10). Technically, the network is bipartite. However, given that
individual investors can function similarly to institutional investors and founders of small startups are practically synonymous with
their companies, the network is treated as if it only contains one type of entity.

                                                                  41

There are a total of 30,440 total edges, or connections between the nodes (Figure F.11).

These edges include all founding events,19 funding events, exits, mentorship, and employment relationships (Figure F.12). It is
important to remember that edges represent distinct events—if an investor invests in a startup twice, there would be two edges
between the startup and the investor.

The vast majority of employment relationships observed in our dataset are the prior employment relationships of current startup
founders. As such, the number of “current employment” edges is nonexistent in the most recent years.

By looking at 2014 data, a quick summary of the types of connections seen in the dataset were generated (Table F.1).20 On
average, each founder founded 1.12 companies, each startup received 5.90 investments, each incubator incubated 7.25 startups,

TOOLS

A variety of tools were used for the analysis.

Data was munged and cleaned using SQL and stored in a MySQL database. The graph data was then transformed into a Neo4j
database. Neo4j allows us to store and search a directed graph database that captures the labels and properties of nodes and edges.
It also allows for easy querying and visualization of subsets of the graph.

Data was exported from the Neo4j database and imported into Gephi in order to quickly calculate network statistics such as
centrality and degree. These values were then imported into Stata to be summarized and regressed.

Maps were created using Tableau. Charts were created in conjunction with pivot tables in Excel.

RESULTS

Our results are fourfold. First, the geographic dimension of the NYC urban innovation ecosystem was mapped and then the social
dimension was mapped. Then, the interplay between the geographic dynamic, the social dynamic, and the funding dynamic within
the ecosystem was examined. Finally, the interplay between the geography and social dynamic was explored.

Geographic Network

                Research question #1: Where is the geographic center of NYC’s urban innovation ecosystem?

It was possible to map the current locations of 70 percent of the NYC startups within our dataset (Figure F.13).

Most startups and investors were located in Manhattan (Figure F.14). However, startups were more likely than investors to
be located in the lower Eastern part of the island, as well as in Brooklyn. The majority of startups are clustered in the top 10
neighborhoods (Table F.2).21

Social Network

     Research question #2: Which people or organizations are located at the social center of NYC’s urban innovation
                                                      ecosystem?

An analysis of network statistics indicates that the network is becoming more interconnected over time. Nodes have more direct
edges over time (Figure F.15), and the average diameter and average path length decrease steadily post dot-com bust (Figure
F.16, Figure F.17).22 This may mean that players within the urban innovation ecosystem are more likely to know each other over

time, but most likely it is because of better data population over time.

In addition to network statistics, for each node the following statistics were also generated.

The diagrams in Figure F.18 below, while not specific to our dataset, help illustrate the definition and interpretation of each type
                                                               FIGURE F.18
                                                            Centrality types




                            Degree centrality measures the number of other nodes within the ecosystem each node is directly
                            connected to. It does not take into account any second-order connections.




                            Closeness centrality measures a node’s social distance to other nodes. It is expressed as the
                            inverse of the average distance from each node to every other node in the network. A low closeness
                            centrality indicates that the firm is on the edge of the network.




                            Eigenvector centrality augments degree centrality by taking into account the connectivity of the
                            nodes a node is connected to. Highly connected nodes within highly interconnected clusters have
                            high eigenvector centrality.




                            Betweenness centrality measures how many times a node acts as a gateway in the network. The
                            higher the betweenness centrality of a firm, the more paths run through that firm to connect two
                            other firms. High betweenness centrality means that a node is a key bridge or facilitator between
                            different clusters.



                                                                   46

of centrality.23 Red indicates higher centrality values. Blue indicates lower centrality values.

Startups have the highest closeness centrality, while incubators have the highest degree, eigenvector, and betweenness centralities
(Table F.3). These results support the hypothesis that incubators are key connection spaces within the urban innovation
ecosystem.
                                                                 TABLE F.3

       Research finding #2: While startups have the highest closeness centrality and are at the center of the social
      network, incubators have the highest degree, eigenvector, and betweenness centralities and are key connectors
                                                 within the ecosystem.

Impact of Connectivity on Funding Outcomes

         Research Question #3: How do the geographic and social connectivity of startups influence their funding
                                                      outcomes?

In order to measure the impact of social and geographic connections on startup outcomes, measures of both types of connectivity
in year n were regressed against the likelihood of obtaining funding in year n+1.

A binary outcome was used, of either obtaining funding in year n+1 or not, rather than a continuous outcome, such as the size of
the round obtained. This was because the latter is more likely to be influenced by the particular business opportunity rather than
the ability to connect to investors.

We hypothesize that there are unobserved omitted variables that vary by startup and as such a fixed effect model should be used,
as opposed to a mixed effects model that assumes that unexplained fluctuations within the dataset are random and not inherently
related to characteristics of each startup. In essence, this acknowledges that there are variables outside of our dataset, for example,
the presentation skills of the founders, which influence funding outcomes. The hypothesis was tested using a standard econometric

                                                                 TABLE F.4
                                                          Results of Hausman Test




                                                                     47
APPENDIX F: ANALYSIS OF GEOGRAPHIC AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS OF ECOSYSTEM




test called the Hausman Test (Table F.4). The results of the Hausman Test indicate that the coefficients under the fixed effects
model are more likely to be consistent, so a conditional fixed-effects logistic regression was used on the panel dataset.

This lead to the finding that social connectivity is more influential on funding outcomes than geographic connectivity (Table F.5).
                                                                 TABLE F.5
                                        Impact of Connectivity on Probability of Funding Next Year24




Geographic centrality, measured as the average distance to all NYC startups, institutional investors, and incubators, was not
significant in our model. In alternative models, average distances to startups, institutional investors, and incubators was separated
out, but the effects were mixed and unreliable.26

However, it cannot be concluded that geographic centrality does not influence funding outcomes. Historical geographic data for
nodes was not available, so in order to test the influence of geographic connections on funding outcomes, it was assumed that
companies had been located in or near their current location since founding. In other words, only the latest address was available,
so in order to populate address data for previous years the assumption was made that the latest address was also the address at the
time of founding. It is likely that this assumption does not hold, and that is why the results are not significant.

Interestingly, the current number of second-order connections to investors also had an insignificant impact on funding outcomes
in the following year. These are investor connections available through the startup’s founders, current employees, and past
employees. In other words, these second-order investors are connections that are “a phone call away” when a startup decides to
raise a round of funding.

It was hypothesized that the number of second-order connections to investors would influence funding outcomes, so this result
was surprising. However, given that our dataset is a more mature sample wherein most connections come from already receiving
funding, it is likely that it was not possible to tease out the incremental effect of more second-order connections to investors after
controlling for other investment-related variables because of an insufficient sample size of connections that occurred outside of
funding events.

What is significant is social momentum. The faster a startup gains second-order connections to investors, the more likely they are
to successfully fundraise. In fact, each additional second-order connection to an investor increases the odds of raising funding in
the next year by approximately 2%. This finding is interesting because it suggests that startups can ride the coattails of fundraising

                                                                    48
APPENDIX F: ANALYSIS OF GEOGRAPHIC AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS OF ECOSYSTEM




successes in their broader networks. Or, perhaps, combined with the finding that the absolute number of second-order connections
to investors is insignificant, this result might suggest that the “freshness” of a connection is important, or that the value of
connections possibly atrophies over time.

However, we should exercise caution in interpreting the social momentum findings given that our dataset is primarily comprised
of founders. What this means is that most second-order connections we observe are through founders and their previous
employers or through employees that have gone on to found companies of their own. As such, not only is the observed sample
of each startup’s associated personnel probably limited in comparison to the actual number of founders, employees, mentors, and
advisors, the effect is probably overstated given that the average employee is unlikely to have the number and strength of investor
connections as our observed set of founders.

Finally, there are multiple nonconnectivity variables that are significant. A startup that has raised money this year is more likely
to raise money next year. The more years a startup has existed and the more employee connections it gains, the more likely it is
to raise funding. However, the more investments and investors a startup already has, the less likely it is to raise funding. This is
probably because startups reach a threshold where they are self-sustaining enough to slow their fundraising efforts.

    Research finding #3: Social momentum matters. The faster a startup gains second-order connections to investors,
    the more likely they are to successfully fundraise. We could not find a significant impact of geographic centrality
                                                  on funding outcomes.

Relationship Between Geographic and Social Dynamic

                  Research question #4: What is the relationship between geographic and social centrality?

Although the lack of historical location data prevents us from understanding how changes in geography impact the social dynamic,
an OLS linear regression enabled us to examine the relationship between geographic centrality and social centrality (Table F.6).27

                                                                  TABLE F.6
                                     Correlation of Geographic Centrality with Social Centrality (2014)29




While location alone does a poor job of explaining centrality,28 the closer a startup is to other startups, the higher the startup’s
degree, eigenvector, and betweenness centrality. Meanwhile, the closer a startup is to investors, the higher the startup’s closeness
centrality. This result suggests that startups closer to other startups may be highly connected but within an insular startup
community, while startups farther from other startups may be less connected but connected with a more diverse set of nodes.


    Research finding #4: While startups in the geographic center of the startup scene may be highly connected, their
                                         connections are not as socially diverse.


Discussion

Our findings suggest that incubators are key networking assets within the urban innovation ecosystem, and the social dynamic is
important for startups because increased social momentum can mean better chances of obtaining funding. However, our findings
also suggest that while startups in the geographic center of the startup scene may be highly connected, their connections are not as
socially diverse.



                                                                     49
APPENDIX F: ANALYSIS OF GEOGRAPHIC AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS OF ECOSYSTEM




However, without historical location data, we are unable to determine whether it is the social dynamic that influences the
geographic dynamic or the geographic dynamic that influences the social dynamic. Do incubators form where there is already a
critical mass of startup activity? Or are they the key players that build the social activity? Do startups form more connections when
they are located in the geographic center of activity? Or do they move into the center of the city after already having already made
the social connections?

To answer these questions, we must obtain more granular timestamps for social and geographic changes. It would be informative,
for example, to understand how many connections startups had before applying for incubation, and if it is the acceptance to the
incubator that spurred their relocation or if they moved into the center of the scene beforehand in the hope of attracting funding
and incubation.

  21.	 The small number of startups located in Brooklyn is surprising. However, this may be explained by the fact that Brooklyn has not been
     developed for as long as Manhattan, and our data is incomplete for recent years.

  22.	 The average diameter and path length likely first increases as unrelated nodes were added into the network, then decreases when the
     social graph “fills out” owing to better data population.

  23.	 Diagrams are from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrality.

  24.	 In addition to this specification, multiple alternative models were explored. A year fixed effect was considered, where we expected to
     see effects in 2000 (dot-com boom) or 2008 (financial crisis), but no irregularity was detected. Likewise, there was no irregularity by
     neighborhood. Other variables such as centrality measures for startups and employees and non-linear transformations of variables were
     also considered. Regression outputs from these alternative models are available upon request.

  25.	 Odds ratios tell us how many times more likely the outcome is to occur given a one-unit increase in the input variable. An odds ratio
     greater than 1 indicates that the outcome is more likely to occur.

  26.	 Results from these models are available upon request.

  27.	 The social centralities are the dependent variables. The geographic centralities are the independent variables.

  28.	 The R2 of the regressions is low. See footnotes 30-33 for more details.

  29.	 Correlations become weaker and weaker as we move backwards in time. Effects do not hold <2009, likely due to data population and the
     likelihood that our locations are not historically accurate.

  30.	 Adjusted R2 = 0.0273.

  31.	 Adjusted R2 = 0.0031.

  32.	 Adjusted R2 = 0.0237.

  33.	 Adjusted R2 = 0.0104.
