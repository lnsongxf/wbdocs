Against this backdrop, IDA 17 promotes a more ef-
fective response in FCS by encouraging activities
that strengthen collaboration with the UN, mul-
tilateral development banks, and other develop-
ment partners, including through the New Deal for
Engagement in Fragile States and the implementa-
tion of the new Strategic Results Framework (SRF)
for UN-WB Partnership in FCS . The FCV Group will
support implementation and monitoring of the
IDA17 partnership commitments in FCS . The SRF
is a living document that identifies objectives,
activities, and outcomes that will contribute to
strengthened strategic and operational collabora-
tion between the Bank and UN in FCS.

The SRF builds on the findings and recommenda-
tions of a 2013 review of the UN-WB partnership
in FCS , which concluded that while considerable
progress had been made in strengthening the
partnership, cooperation had not been system-
atic or deep enough and institutional incentives
for collaboration needed further strengthening. It
also found that institutional differences and con-
straints, insufficiently understood, continued to
be a challenge for both the Bank and UN, and had
contributed to misunderstandings and missed
opportunities. It recommended stronger efforts
from both institutions to improve mutual under-
standing and awareness of how each institution
operates and the tools and resources available,
as well as to highlight successful models and
lessons learned from cooperation. This resource
note aims to address some of those issues.

Experience has shown that achieving results in
FCS requires different approaches that respond
to the volatility, high risks, and low capacity in

the goals set out in the UN Charter, the UN ga l-
vanizes the international community in response
to crisis situations and engages in a variety of ac-
tivities. including humanitarian assistance deliv-
ery and coordination, mediation and conflict res-
olution, early recovery and development support,
re-establishment and maintenance of peace and
security, and support to political processes and
democratic governance. The UN is often already
on the ground, with established networks. ac-
cess, logistical and security structures. and direct
implementation capabilities to provide rapid and
flexibl e assistance during or following a crisis. The
political legitimacy, operational field presence,
and security umbrella of the UN are often critical
for early entry by the Bank in FCS.

The Bank can provide technical assistance and
is a major financier of activities that support na-
tional institution-building, economic and social
resi lience, and recovery in post-crisis countries.
The Bank may not have the presence or facili-
ties on the ground immediately after a crisis, but
it brings access to longer-term resources and
strong relationships and dialogue with develop-
ing countries and multilateral partners . This com-
plementary profile can act as a catalyst for other
partnerships-with national stakeholders, re-
gional organizations, international financial insti-
tutions (I Fls). and bilateral partners. Bridging the
humanitarian. development, political , and secu-
rity pillars of support will contribute significantly
to an effective, efficient transition from crisis.

is central to the international humanitarian community's coordination architecture in

The New Deal for engagement in fragile states
highlights the importance of more effective part-
nerships to reduce the burdens on low-capacity
governments in FCS and ensure more coordinated
support around clear country priorities delivered as
much as possible through each country's own sys-
tems. In committing to the New Deal, the World
Bank committed to strengthen its efforts to build
partnerships to bridge the traditional security, de-
velopment, and humanitarian divides.

New Deal Fragility Assessments are used to kick
start the New Deal process. They are led by na-
tional governments and key stakeholders and part-
ners to identify the causes, features, and drivers of
fragility and conflict and the sources of resilience
within a country. The fragility assessment process
and the fragility spectrum tool provide an import-
ant partnership platform to enable constructive
and forward-looking dialogue between the govern-
ment, working with civil society and other national
stakeholders and their international partners, to in-
form the development of a single nationally owned
strategic plan, and to set realistic joint peacebuild-
ing and state-building priorities that address the
causes and drivers of fragility and conflict across all

There are compelling reasons for the Bank an9 UN
to collaborate on the implementation of govern-
 ment projects and programs in FCS. UN entities
 can offer quick implementation capacity and sup-
 ply health and other critical goods when govern-
 ments may lack capacity, even in challenging en-
vironments. They can deliver technical assistance
 and capacity building and develop promising pilot
 initiatives that can be scaled up with Bank funding.

The potential implementation role will vary with
 the agency, as well as capacity and access in a par-
 ticular context, so it is important to clarify these
 aspects at an early stage. While some UN enti-
ties, such as UNOPS, will typically undertake im-
plementation activities directly, others, including
 UNDP and UNICEF. will often work with local im-
 plementing partners. While many UN organizations
 (including UNDP. UNICEF. UNFPA, and FAO) sup-
 port national implementation where the capacity is
 in place, direct implementation is prevalent in FCS.

 Real progress has been made in making Bank and
 UN fiduciary systems more compatible, but it can
 still be challenging to establish the legal and opera-
 tional framework for initiatives that involve cross-fi-
 nancing. When considering specific activities with
 UN entities, teams should refer to the compre-
 hensive guidance on structuring collaboration with
 UN partners, which OPSOR is finalizing in parallel
 with the development of this resource guide. The
