    Strategic Considerations
    Cambodian milling costs are higher than Thailand and
    Vietnam: Improvements in milling and polishing capacity
    will help exports by allowing Cambodian traders to bid for,
    and deliver, larger orders. Milling costs in Cambodia are
    higher than those in Thailand and Vietnam due in part to
    Cambodia’s higher cost of electricity and greater milling
    and storage capacities in both Vietnam and Thailand.
    Furthermore, Cambodian mills typically operate one 8–10
    hour shift per day, and do not have the working capital to
    operate year-round. Thai competitors operate around the
    clock, on three 8-hour shifts, six days a week throughout
    most of the year. The good news is that Cambodia’s recent
    investments in the larger, more efficient rice mills and
    polishing factories have led to a four-fold capacity increase
    over the past four years – and the expectation that
    capacity will double again by the end of 2014.

    Thai dominance: The Thai rice industry is reported
    to have up to two million tons of Jasmine rice in storage
    as a result of the previous government’s inventory policy.
    Cambodian (as well as Vietnamese) rice exports have
    benefited significantly from this policy and its artificially
    high Thai prices. Thailand’s new leadership has signaled
    that a ‘free trade’ approach will be used in rice marketing
    from this point forward, which, given the stored tonnage,
    should lower rice prices for both fragrant and white rice.
    If so, barring crop failure in key rice consuming countries,
    export rice prices could be low for the next three years.
    But longer-term expectations appear solid, with global
    production just covering demand.

    The volume of Thailand’s recent exports has been
    inconsistent, from a peak of nine million tons in 2011 to just

    Cambodia
    Cambodia established milled rice standards for both
    white and fragrant rice in 2013. These standards,
    promulgated by Royal Decree, have instituted quality
    assurances that have led to international recognition
    and confidence from global buyers. Consequently, DNA
    fingerprints have been established for Cambodian
    fragrant rice varieties, and more farmers are now able to
    access higher value seeds and related trainings. Improved
    farming techniques and milling processes are raising
    Cambodia’s rice industry yields and revenues alongside
    its reputation for producing outstanding fragrant rice.
    The results are impressive: Cambodia has won the
    World’s Best Rice award the past three years in a row
    at the annual TRT World Rice Conferences. Cambodia
    now seeks to capitalize on these gains in the
    international market.

    Cambodia’s export growth has largely been achieved
    since 2010 and focused first on the EU under the special
    EBA (Everything But Arms) arrangements of the EU-GSP
    (Generalised System of Preferences). Currently, 62 percent
    of all rice exports go to EU markets, and while the need
    to further diversify the customer base is clear, exporters
    currently have limited funds for market development and
    sales support. Greater export success and penetration of
    new markets will therefore depend on prudent selection
    of industry priorities, correct analysis of market trends,
    proper identification of customer preferences, and short-
    versus long-term strategies.

    Strategic Considerations

    Identity

    First things first: Despite the gains in export volumes
    and international accolades, Cambodian rice lacks name-
    brand recognition and as such must carve out an identity
    for its rice varieties. Furthermore, marketing and price
    strategies must reflect the demands of the particular
    market: for example, a deep discount on fragrant rice from
    Cambodia might work in a price market such as Singapore,
    but it is not an effective way to enter and remain in the US
    or EU fragrant rice markets.

    The adoption and recognition of national and international
    certification procedures and seals/stamps are inextricably
    linked to this build up of brand identity, as is the
    commensurate support and promotion of the industry,
    both at home and abroad, by government agencies,
    associations, and business organizations.




6      Cambodia Rice: Export Potential and Strategies
Establish the brand

Cambodia produces fragrant, white, and to a lesser
extent, organic rice. Fragrant and organic rice are ‘luxury’
products, white rice is a ‘commodity’ product, and thus
all require different marketing strategies and price levels.
Top priority should be given to establishing a recognizable
brand for Cambodia’s fragrant rice product and reinforcing
it with a government-approved certification process and
stamp to gain the confidence of importers and distributor.

Ideally, the brand should combine a unique fragrant rice
name and visual portrayal of Cambodia’s famously rich
cultural heritage. The certification seal will confirm quality
to international customers, solidify reputation both at
home and abroad, and invite comparison to competitor’s
‘luxury’ products. For further exclusivity, brand creators

and separating Cambodia and its products from the
numerous varieties of food products present. Assistance
from the commercial section of the embassy can bolster
the beneficial effects of show attendance.

Cooperate with related sectors: There is also clear
opportunity for the rice industry to take advantage of
Cambodia’s allure as an international tourism destination.
Piggybacking on hospitality, tourist and food events,
websites, blogs, and airline and travel magazines is a
comparatively low effort and cost publicity opportunity
– especially once the fragrant rice brand has been
launched. To apply this advantage abroad, Cambodia
needs to promote its image in markets where there is clear
consumer desire to use ‘exotic’ products. A known chef or
food writer from Asia could be approached to be the ‘face’
or spokesperson for the Cambodian rice export industry.
This would be a part-time person who could be called upon
to be at special government-sponsored receptions or trade
shows, write articles for food sections in magazines, etc.
The industry should also recognize the value of investing
in their representatives to ensure they have the proper
training and skills to represent and negotiate with
confidence. This would include language proficiency,
cultural awareness, financial and commodity training and
business ethics.

Market knowledge

To oversimplify, Cambodia needs to present the right
product to the right market and the more knowledge
of market preferences exporters can accrue, the more
effective their attempts at market penetration can be. For
example, USA is by all accounts a mature market, with
its own government standards, consumer particularities,
and significant barriers to entry. However, at both the
importer and supermarket level, ethnic markets are
significant importers of rice (this is also true for France and
Singapore). Ethnic markets can present an opportunity
for easier entry, particularly if there is a direct or indirect
relationship between the importer and the exporter, gained
through shared culture, friends or family ties, or other
commonalities. Additionally, there is significant demand
in the US and EU for organic rice. Cambodian millers
should explore obtaining additional quantities of certified
organic rice for targeted customers and test with sample
shipments. In this way, organic rice can be the way to
enter the market, with fragrant and/or white rice following
thereafter.

Another key consideration is the role of the government in
a market. For example, Thailand and Singapore have had
inventory/stockpile policies, and Chinese trade authorities
control levels of imports and quotas. Understanding
quota systems and regulatory specifications is critical,
as is establishing contacts at government levels - as
aforementioned in promotional considerations.

Recommendations




Short term priorities, grouped:

Priorities	        France, Germany (EU), and USA

                   Develop a unique “export” name for Cambodian fragrant rice for the global stage, which will be
Brand
                   defined by variety and quality specifications and, in time, a mark of certification procedure.


                   This is the time to take advantage of the situation and build the image of Cambodian rice in the EU,
                   particularly in France and Germany, but the duty preference program will end at some point. In the
Price
                   U.S. market, Thailand sets the price, and exporters will have to likely sell below the Thai price in order
                   to encourage buyers to switch suppliers or have a special product such as organic rice to offer.


                   There is large demand in the United States and EU for organic rice. Cambodian millers should explore
Special Products   obtaining additional quantities of certified organic rice for targeted customers. Test the market with
                   sample shipments and use organic rice as a way of entering markets.


                   Ethnic Importers and Ethnic Retail Chains are a good place to start with small volume shipments,
Target Markets
                   particularly for a market unfamiliar with Cambodian rice such as the United States.


                   Prepare website, literature, and small brochures that describe the Cambodian rice industry, history,
                   and natural conditions where rice is produced.

                   Participation in a country pavilion in international food shows such as SIAL in France, ANUGA in
                   Germany, and the Fancy Food Show in the United States in San Francisco, as California is the location
                   of the majority of rice importers. While Cambodian rice has become known with importers in France
Marketing
                   and Germany, the U.S. importers and retail market chains are not familiar with Cambodian rice.

                   It is useful to identify a known chef or food writer from Asia who can be the “face” or spokesperson
                   for the Cambodian rice export industry. This would be a part-time person who could be called upon
                   to be at special Government-sponsored receptions or trade shows, or write articles for food sections
                   in magazines, etc.

                   Focus on the needs of buyers to develop packaging. In France, packaging for the consumer market
                   may be possible, particularly working with private brands. Consumer packaging in the United States
Packaging
                   and Germany will be a goal for the future once the product has become better known and stronger
                   commercial relationships have been established.

                   Marketing executives should have strong awareness of ethical business practices, finance
Training
                   instruments, the structure of commodity trade, and language skills.




                                                                                                                                15
     Priorities	         China, Côte d’Ivoire, and Singapore
                         Target Government and other support in conducting rice and food trade missions to key Chinese
                         cities in order to meet with rice importers and establish a dialogue and business relationship with
                         importers. This also applies to Singapore, where, despite the close proximity of Cambodia and Singa-
                         pore, importers indicated little knowledge or experience with Cambodian rice.	
     Support

                         Organize government- or industry-led trade delegations to China, Singapore, and Côte d’Ivoire to
                         help Cambodian exporters develop the “human” links with importers that are essential to breaking
                         into a market dominated by a few players or established supply relationships.

                         All markets are price sensitive and market share is usually “bought” with price or volume discounts, or
                         special promotion/advertising. In China and Singapore, Vietnamese exporters have made significant
                         inroads into Thailand’s market share, and have found it relatively easy to price below Thailand’s price,
                         which was inflated by Thai Government policies.
     Price

                         Cambodian rice should be positioned against rice from Thailand not from Vietnam.

                         Quote CIF prices as importers indicated that CIF was the norm and their preference.

                         A list of importers and retailers useful to contact has been prepared for each country including China,
     Target Markets      Singapore, and Côte d’Ivoire. In countries where importers are unfamiliar with Cambodian rice, it will
                         take time and personal contact to build mutual confidence and trust.


                         The key here is for Cambodian exporters to become increasingly aware of what buyers want in
                         different markets and work to fulfill customer needs. Selling premium rice in bulk (50 kg bags) is not
     Packaging
                         the way to add value. Working with customers to understand their packing needs is critical. There
                         may also be a need for a highly specialized packaging consultant to help Cambodian exporters


                         Marketing executives should have strong awareness of ethical business practices, finance
     Training
                         instruments, the structure of commodity trade, and language skills.




     Long term priorities, grouped:

     Priorities	         France, Germany (EU), and USA
                         Mark of Certification/Quality Assurance: Establish a government approved and sponsored quality
                         assurance program with a “mark of certification” that places Cambodian Jasmine rice equal to or
                         above Thai standards. Creating trust through quality assurance is a high priority of the Cambodian
                         rice sector.

      Brand              Protected Geographical Indication (PGI): Developing a PGI would help sellers differentiate the
                         product and increase confidence in the product, since it would be certified through a European
                         agency. A PGI, which targets a specific region with traditional, top grade rice, would be useful in a
                         promotional campaign and potentially give a boost to all Cambodian rice. Developing a PGI could be
                         relatively cost effective if restricted to a specific geographical area. At the same time, the strategies
                         for developing a PGI and a national certification program should be coordinated.

                         Define a plan for accelerating organic rice production, obtain financial support for the plan, and agree

              Consumer Research in China: Because of the market size, its diversity, the demand for imported
              rice, and the close proximity of China and Cambodia, it would be useful to continue to carry out

18     Cambodia Rice: Export Potential and Strategies
Strategic Export Priorities for China

              Simplify the designation of Cambodian rice into two main types: higher quality Phka Malis and lower
              quality Sen Kra Ob. Utilize fragrant rice and organic rice to establish a quality image, obtain early orders,
              and establish relationships with Chinese importers.

              Establish a mark of certification for branded fragrant rice as a quality designator or certification
              of genuine Cambodian rice, which can compete with the Thai Hom Mali trademark and mark of
              certification. This mark of certification would have to be managed by either the Cambodian Ministry of
Brand         Agriculture or the Ministry of Commerce, and tied to specific quality standards.

              Though most brands still tend to be local, it is possible to find some brands emerging nationally.
              Chinese consumers will look at the origin of rice in their rice purchasing decision if this information
              available. Some of these national brands (e.g. Ko-Ko of G.A.G.) already use Cambodian origin rice in their
              branded products, but it is sold under the familiar brand name, rather than by its place of origin. The
              mark of certification must be compatible with established house brands in supermarkets which are the
              primary distribution channels in some markets, as well as with importer brands.

              Organize government- or industry-led trade delegations to China to help Cambodian exporters develop
              the “human” links with Chinese importers that are essential to breaking into a market dominated by
              established supply relationships.

              Establish contacts at government-to-government level with Chinese trade authorities that control the
Support       level of imports and quotas; understand the quota system and ensure that exporters comply with it, as
              well as with any other regulatory specifications.

              Emphasize and support the role of the CCIC in Cambodia (for inspections). CCIC is the Chinese
              inspection agency that has a large office in Bangkok and another one in Phnom Penh, which would
              need to certify rice for export to China.

              Emphasize the lower cost of shipping from Cambodian ports to the Pearl River Delta, equivalent
              shipping times as from other exporters, and reduced rates for backloads.

Price
              Ensure competitive pricing that reflects known milling costs and marketing margins.

              Ensure compliance with buyer requirements.

              Focus on the rice trading segment (which accounts for the bulk of imports) and aim to satisfy the

              segment.

              Emphasize the quality of Cambodian rice, in particular “pure” strains and low fertilizer use in production.
              Organic and SRI rice will be well-received. The Cambodian industry can effectively emphasize the
              production of rice under more natural conditions with clean water, and minimal use of agricultural

              Improve storage and logistics to lower marketing costs. Cool storage may improve quality especially for
              preferred new crop rice.

              Focus on improved packaging and labeling; emphasize consumer packs. Work with Chinese packers to

     Strategic Export Priorities for France
                      It is important to have a mark of certification for Cambodia’s fragrant rice. The mark of certification
                      would define a superior quality standard for top of the range Jasmine rice and other standard qualities,
                      adapted to demand and competition.

                      Seeking a Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) designation could be a useful tool for Cambodian
                      exporters (Thailand recently registered its, ‘Khao Hom Mali Thung Kula Rong Hai’). It would only
                      cover a small portion of total Cambodian production, but it would be useful as a tool in the increased
     Brand
                      PR activities designed to raise consumer awareness of the quality of Cambodian rice, rather directly
                      yielding increased sales or significant use on packaging. Though supermarkets are not interested in
                      helping Cambodian exporters develop a PGI, their primary interest is in offering quality differentiated
                      products, and so would list a PGI, which could further consumer confidence and knowledge. Granted,
                      establishing a PGI is time consuming and expensive, and in the meantime the Cambodian Rice
                      Federation can consider developing and utilizing PR material about the uniqueness of the rice varieties
                      and production methods.

                      To gain the confidence of importers and distributors, the rice quality standards need to be clearly
                      defined and trusted, conform to international standards, and issue from or be regulated by the
     Standards        government. Additionally, importers would appreciate the development of an established, long-term
                      production policy: certified seeds, recommended agricultural practices, etc. as this would provide
                      them with greater assurances of quality and consistency.


                      The private brands of supermarkets are the best suited targets for Cambodian exporters to approach
                      because they look for avenues for differentiation in their product offerings. For the private brands of
                      supermarkets, Cambodia’s limited presence as a named origin in traditional rice products provides an
                      element of exclusivity. The Intermarché supermarkets have the brand “Itinéraires des Saveurs,” which
                      introduces consumers to new product origins as affordable, indulgent escapes. “Saveurs d’Ailleurs”
                      is brand that pursues the same approach used by Casino supermarkets. For example, Antartic II
                      (working for Intermarché supermarkets as a private brand) is interested in Cambodian origin rice
                      and may promote the product in supermarkets. The main national brands operating in France, Ebro
                      (Taureau Ailé) and Soufflet (Vivien Paille), also seek rice product differentiation through offering
                      different origins in their product ranges. Vivien Paille (Groupe Soufflet) is specifically interested in
     Target Markets
                      differentiating its product offering with Cambodian rice. Furthermore, supermarket sales of rice
                      represent half of the total sales in the French market, so successful introduction of Cambodian rice
                      into this segment would yield significantly increased sales volumes.

                      Also, Cambodia should target French cuisine restaurants, as they are more willing to use rice from
                      outside France than ethnic restaurants. The successful promotion of Cambodian rice as the preferred
                      rice for use in French cuisine restaurants would also generate a ripple effect affecting household rice
                      consumption. France actively promotes its strong culinary heritage in its population’s home cooking,
                      and so the preference for Cambodian rice in French cuisine restaurants would increase its choice as a
                      quality rice for use in traditional French cuisine prepared at home.




22    Cambodia Rice: Export Potential and Strategies
Strategic Export Priorities for France

                Cambodian rice organization and exporters should attend food exhibitions like SIAL, Sirha in Lyon
                (specifically for restaurants and gastronomic activities) or Equiphotel. Attendance would need to be
                supported by preparing documents to introduce the sector policy, to introduce each of the companies
                who are present, to give all details concerning production (agricultural methods and processing), and
                Cambodian quality control systems. Event attendance would be coupled with specific meetings with
                commercial contacts to develop specific targets including packers, private brands, organic packers, etc.

                Promotion should also consider working with chefs, working with associations of chefs who could use
                the Cambodian rice in their recipes and mention it in interviews, or with invitations for food critics to
Marketing       visit. Promotional drives will help introduce the range of Cambodian rice products, including organic
                and fair trade products, to French professionals and will help smooth the concurrent commercial
                contacts with distributors. The aim is to increase total sales in France and increase the knowledge
                of fragrant rice in France by getting Cambodian rice identified in private brands, and possibly in the
                product lines of packers. These actions will prompt restaurants to list the Cambodian origin as an
                appealing attribute to attract consumers.	

                Finally, a public relations campaign with press coverage and a specific website to inform traders and
                consumers about promotional events would provide the necessary communication tools to complete
                this market penetration strategy.

                 The private labels of supermarkets also present a strong target for Cambodian rice, as they would be
                 interested in importing milled and packed products, with a quality certification for the supermarkets’
                 own brand. The ethnic market segment in Germany also presents a significant opportunity for
                 Cambodian rice as these customers know the product and its specifications well, and this segment is
                 growing.

                 Organic rice is a niche product but demand for it is steadily growing in Germany (seven percent in

                 2013), providing a key market for the entry of Cambodian rice. Distributors and importers (and even
                 conventional millers such as Müller’s Mühle) are more amenable to importing Cambodian organic
                 rice, relative to other Cambodian rice products, because in the newer organic rice market, long-
                 standing supplier relationships have not yet been established and market demand is urging German

                 Importers are keen to import rice directly from Cambodia rather than from Vietnam or Thailand.
                 They said they could get Cambodian rice from their Thai suppliers, but the price was not as attractive

                 Buyers for the government owned supermarkets that buy Cambodian rice in accordance with the
                 government’s stockpile program felt the quality of the rice is good, but priced too high relative to the
                 equivalent Thai rice.


                 Given the growth trends in rice consumption in Singapore in the food service sector and diminishing
                 household rice consumption due to a variety of demographic features, exporters’ and industry
                 promotion efforts should target the food service sector in the country’s numerous hotels and
                 restaurants. The hotel and hospitality sector caters to middle-class and relatively well-off visitors
                 that expect good quality and are willing to pay premium prices. Cambodian fragrant rice can be
                 successfully promoted as a high priced product in this segment of the market.

                 Continue to expand sales to NTUC Fairprice stores or other government-owned entities that have a
                 policy of seeking diversified sources of rice. In order to increase consumer knowledge of Cambodia
                 as a source of quality rice, it might be useful to explore initiating a promotional campaign with
                 certain partner supermarkets such as the NTUC Fairprice stores. NTUC has several rice brands
Target Markets
                 of its own, but is marketing Cambodian rice under an exporter’s brand (one 5kg package of the
                 Baitang rice), as they were concerned that if there was a quality issue with the Cambodian rice they
                 marketed under one of their own Fairprice brands, it would damage their own brand.

                 There are rice importers who work closely with supermarkets and chain stores. Working with
                 those importers who serve supermarkets to address a need for a certain package or type of rice, a
                 long-term supply arrangement could be negotiated. The local supermarkets (Cold Storage, GIANT,
                 Sheng Siong, etc.) have developed their own brands, which are expected to take a bigger share of
                 the market in the future, but this transition has been slow to date. Targeting these relatively newer
                 supermarket brands to include Cambodian rice in their products would be a viable long term strategy
                 as the appeal of the supermarket brands grows.

     Strategic Export Priorities for Singapore

                       Use Singaporean hotels, particularly those catering to wealthy visitors, to showcase premium
                       Cambodian Jasmine rice to consumers, by supplying rice to the hotel and establishing promotional
                       campaigns within selected hotels. The campaign would have to be carefully designed to feature
                       Cambodian fragrant rice on the labels on the hotel’s buffet or on the menu of hotel restaurants,
                       as well as feature displays in other parts of the hotel, if possible. This type of campaign would be
                       an opportunity to connect with consumers able to afford premium rice from various markets,
                       considering the number of short-stay wealthy visitors from around the world, as well as an
                       opportunity to develop broader consumer knowledge of Cambodian rice in Singapore.

                       An educated, urban market such as Singapore is diverse in terms of its product offerings. One
                       strategy is to focus on providing niche products, of which fragrant rice would be one product, but
     Marketing         there were also suggestions of providing black rice or mixed grain packages (although this requires
                       a significant knowledge of the market and working with the importer/distributor to develop specific
                       niche products.) This strategy benefits from an increased focus on quality and slightly reduced
                       competition as products are less frequently perfect substitutes, both of which would benefit
                       Cambodian exporters seeking to establish a presence in the market. Later, the exporter can expand
                       into other market segments. One advantage of going into the specialty rice market is that it is a
                       premium price segment, so introducing products first in this segment will create an image of the
                       suppliers operating in that segment as being “up-market”/high quality, a perception which it could
                       then be associated with product offerings in the other larger market segments.

                       Emphasize the proximity of Cambodia to Singapore which translates to a low cost of shipping from
                       Cambodian ports to the port of entry and equivalent shipping times as from other exporters.


                       Packaging of rice products in Singapore is an important issue to consider, as the market’s relative
                       proximity and urban location of consumers encourage the production of smaller consumer packages
                       in Cambodia. The design of the packaging must be considered in this effort, as certain packaging
                       details have been important for the most successful brands. For example, the striking red color of the
     Packaging
                       Royal Umbrella brand (Singapore’s favorite rice brand) resonates with Chinese consumers (red being
                       the color for good luck and prosperity). The packaging material was also enhanced to help maintain
                       the freshness of the product. But most importantly, the package features the green Thai Hom Mali
                       collective brand mark.


                       The leading rice importers are long standing market actors with well-established relationships with
                       suppliers and generally operate with a high degree of transparency. Cambodian exporters need to
                       develop a “partner” type relationship with the importer, and develop, over a period of time, mutual
                       trust. These relationship-building efforts must include the development of excellent business
     Training
                       practices and services that cultivate trust and respect the interests of the customer/buyer. These
                       efforts should include training marketing executives in tactics appropriate to Singapore (including
                       ethical business practices), finance instruments (e.g. Letter of Credit,) the structure of commodity
                       trade, and language skills.

 Strategic Export Priorities for USA

                     In the US, there is a definite consumer movement that wants to know about the source of a food
                     product, how it was produced, etc. Cambodia should establish a mark of certification for fragrant rice
                     as a quality designator or certification of genuine Cambodian rice, which can compete with the Thai
                     Hom Mali mark of certification. This mark of certification would have to be aggressively managed by
                     either the Cambodian Ministry of Agriculture or the Ministry of Commerce, and tied to specific quality
                     standards. Such a designation allows marketers to appeal to the source and production methodology
                     conscious consumers of the U.S.

 Brand               Seeking a Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) designation could also be a useful tool for Cambodian
                     exporters (Thailand recently registered its PGI, ‘Khao Hom Mali Thung Kula Rong Hai’). It would only
                     cover a portion of total Cambodian production, but it would be useful as a tool in the increased PR
                     activities designed to raise consumer awareness of the quality of Cambodian rice, rather directly
                     yielding increased sales or significant use on packaging. A protected geographical indicator can also be
                     used quite effectively in segmenting the large U.S. rice market. But by definition, a geographical brand
                     will only serve a small portion of the market (although there are certainly opportunities for multiple
                     geographical brands), but it will also provide publicity that Cambodia is famous for high quality rice
                     production.




                                                                                                                                    29
     Strategic Export Priorities for USA
                      Actualization of a marketing strategy for the U.S. market requires outside backing through a
                      combination of funding from Government sources, development organizations, and the Cambodian
     Support          rice industry to support a modest effort to introduce Cambodian rice to U.S. rice importers. This effort
                      should be coupled with on-going contacts by Cambodian rice exporters with importers, particularly
                      importers that serve the Asian ethnic market in the U.S.

                      Competitive prices may provide an initial point of entry for Cambodian fragrant rice in the U.S. market,
                      a ‘luxury’ product like fragrant rice should not be sold on a price basis but on the basis of image, quality.
                      U.S. importers indicated that quotes for fragrant rice from Vietnam are very low, but the quality is also
     Price
                      low. A deep discount on fragrant rice is not an effective way to enter the U.S. fragrant rice market. This
                      belief was expressed by several U.S. importers, who emphasized that consistent high quality is what
                      their customers are seeking, particularly in the purchase of high value, fragrant rice.


                      Fancy Food Show in the United States: One of the most efficient ways to introduce a new food product
                      and meet specialty food producers and buyers is to establish a booth and attend the Fancy Food Show,
                      held in San Francisco in January and in New York in July, annually. Many countries and exporters to the
                      United States use this venue to introduce and publicize their particular products. This show will typically
                      have presentations by organizations such as Indian Basmati rice exporters, and specialty branded food
                      companies such as Lotus Foods and Village Harvest, both specialty rice marketers.
     Target Markets
                      Literature describing the available products, Cambodian rice production, grades and standards, and
                      export procedures should be available at a booth. A reception in conjunction with a formal presentation
                      at the Fancy Food Show can be organized to allow leading food importers and retailers another venue
                      through which they can familiarize themselves with Cambodian rice. Cambodian Government officials
                      could provide additional support through reception attendance. Attendance at the show by Cambodian
                      exporters should be coupled with meetings before and after the show with targeted rice importers.


                      The marketing strategy for the U.S. market should be a combination of promotion, contact with
                      importers, particularly importers and distributors focused on the Asian ethnic market, and establishing
                      quality standards, especially for Jasmine and organic rice. To be competitive over time, Cambodia
                      will have to match the quality of Thai Jasmine in the marketplace, develop additional commercial
                      relationships, undertake promotional efforts, increase the production of organic rice, and compete
                      aggressively on price.
     Marketing

                      Exporters need to know about the peculiarities of the U.S. market. There is a considerable amount of
