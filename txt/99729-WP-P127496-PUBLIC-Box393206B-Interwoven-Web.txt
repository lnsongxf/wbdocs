    How Workers Describe Job Quality

    Defining job quality is important but difficult because jobs have many different char-
    acteristics like pay and working conditions. This study aims to understand how work-
    ers themselves see the key characteristics that shape job quality. Our field research in
    four countries (Cambodia, Kenya, Lesotho, and Vietnam) finds that job quality means
    largely the same thing. Certain economic characteristics such as good pay and benefits
    are prominent in workers’ minds, but so too are social dimensions such as respectful
    relations with managers and supervisors and work-life balance (facilitated by having
    reasonable work hours).

    New Tool: Performance Improvement Consultative Committees (PICCs)

    One of the innovations of the BW Program has been the formulation of Performance
    Improvement Consultative Committees (PICC). PICCs are groups made up of an equal
    number of both management and union/worker representatives who meet regularly to
    help resolve disputes within the factory and also try and improve performance of the
    factory in a collaborative way. In Lesotho, workers can raise their specific health and
    safety concerns through PICCs, which are heard by union and non-union worker repre-
    sentatives, management representatives, and an enterprise adviser from Better Work.

    Success of PICCs:
    •	 The PICCs proved to be useful avenues in which to bring up problems, and to resolve
       them more effectively than previous mechanisms.
    •	 The PICCs not only helped improve industrial relations, but also helped to strengthen
       trade unions overall.
    •	 In the case of Vietnam, the success of the PICC model was such that it compelled the
       government to introduce a new labor code that obligated employers to conduct social
       dialogue in the workplace.

Chapter 2: Apparel Workers
Highlights
       Demographic profile: Workers in the textile and apparel industry tend to be younger than
   L




       those in other industries. The average age of textile workers is 26 in Cambodia and 30 in
       Vietnam. Most are female (about 80 percent in Cambodia and Vietnam). Contrary to the
       popular belief that these workers tend to be single, about 50 percent are married.
       The apparel industry provides job opportunities for young people, mostly women from rural
   L




       areas. Although apparel wages are low by international standards, the sector offers wage
       premiums, which draw women and men from rural areas. High wages and good working
       conditions are two of the top reasons why workers in Cambodia choose apparel factory
       jobs. Data also show that a sizable number of women are supervisors in the apparel industry.
       Workers defined job quality: Across the four countries (Kenya, Lesotho, Cambodia, and
   L




       Vietnam) where field research was conducted, it was found that job quality means largely
       the same thing. Certain economic characteristics such as good pay and benefits are
       prominent in workers’ minds in addition to social considerations such as collegial rela-
       tions with managers and supervisors, clean and safe work environments, and reasonable
       working hours. Thus, many of the qualities that workers from our field research value can
       be achieved at little to no economic cost.

    Size: In Cambodia, about 7.9 percent of employed workers (aged between 15 and 64)
    worked in the textiles and apparel industry in 2012. The apparel sector was less signifi-
    cant in Vietnam, where about 3.5 percent of employed workers (aged between 15 and
    64) worked.

    Location: In Phnom Penh, the capital and economic center of Cambodia, the textile and
    apparel industry provides a significant share of employment. About 15.2 percent of work-
    ers in Phnom Penh work in the industry, and 25.7 percent of jobs in the sector are located
    in Phnom Penh. In Vietnam, about 30.8 percent of the textile and apparel workers live in
    urban areas, while about 27.7 percent of the non-textile and apparel workers reside there.

    Demographic profile: Textile and apparel factory workers in Cambodia and Vietnam are
    predominantly women (83 percent and 80 percent, respectively). Workers in the textile
    and apparel industry tend to be younger than those in other industries. In 2012, the aver-
    age age of the textile workers was about 26 years in Cambodia and 30 years in Vietnam,
    while that of non-textile and apparel workers was 35 years and 38.5 years, respectively.

    Education: In Cambodia and Vietnam, only a small proportion of textile and apparel work-
    ers has received education beyond the secondary level, and its share is proportionately
    smaller than that of non-textile and apparel workers. At the same time, larger shares
    of the textile and apparel workers have completed primary education and received at
    least some lower-level secondary education, compared with the non-textile workers.
    This holds true for both countries.

     Defining job quality is important but difficult because jobs have many different char-

     conditions (benefits, air quality, noise, unionization, among many others) are scarce and
     generally not comparable across countries. Yet, job quality can be measured by more
     than just money. It is also measured by nonmonetary elements attached to the job, such
     as social security coverage, job security, promotion opportunities, and the like.

     From a theoretical perspective, the relationship between wages and nonwage working
     conditions can be positive or negative. Using wages as a measure of working conditions,
     however, poses potential problems if workers receive higher wages as compensation for
     working in poor conditions. This is certainly the case, even in developed countries, in
     dangerous industries, such as mining. Beginning with Adam Smith, economists have long
     theorized that workers who take jobs in less favorable conditions must be compensated
     with higher wages; this is commonly referred to as “compensating differentials.” This
     theory implies that workers in developing countries who accept jobs with less favorable
     working conditions earn higher than average wages. Surprisingly, empirical evidence on
     the compensating differentials hypothesis has been mixed.

Highlights
  ᭤ Better Work is an ILO-IFC joint initiative aimed at improving working conditions for apparel
     workers.
  ᭤ Better Work started in 2001 as Better Factories Cambodia, which grew out of terms stipu-
     lated in the U.S.-Cambodia Bilateral Textile Trade Agreement of 1999.
  ᭤ Better Work was intended to leverage key strengths of the main stakeholders in the apparel
     industry in an attempt to arrive at a beneficial outcome for all.
  ᭤ Better Work now operates in eight countries (Bangladesh, Cambodia, Haiti, Indonesia,
     Jordan, Lesotho, Nicaragua, and Vietnam) and reaches more than 1 million workers in more
     than 1,000 factories.
  ᭤ How Does the Better Work Program Work?
     • Better Work addresses weak governance and low implementing capacities.
     • The program goes beyond monitoring and offers added-value services that help build
       capacity and create more cooperative work environments.
     • The program maintains cost effectiveness and promotes local ownership by employing
       mostly local staff to conduct factory assessments.
     • Transparency is a prominent feature of the program.

     Box 3.1: HIV/AIDS in the Lesotho Garment Industry

     HIV/AIDS is a serious problem in Lesotho, with a national prevalence rate of 23.2 percent,
     and the prevalence rate among garment workers estimated to be as high as 43.2 percent
     (ALAFA 2008). ALAFA—the Apparel Lesotho Alliance to Fight Aids, an NGO in Lesotho,
     has provided HIV/AIDS testing for factory workers in addition to training on safe sexual
     practices and other activities to raise awareness. Apparel workers have been well aware
     of ALAFA and have benefited from the organization for years. ALAFA and BW have
     tried to coordinate efforts to address the issue of HIV/AIDS in the workplace. In 2013
     some apparel workers reported that there were some small adjustments in workplace
     practices, such as allowing short breaks for workers with HIV/AIDS who need to take
     their medications with food and water.

     To further understand the extent of training and awareness around the issue of HIV/
     AIDS, apparel workers were asked whether their factories have an HIV/AIDS policy and
     whether there has been any awareness creation or training for workers related to the
     issue. Surprisingly, fewer people in 2013 than in 2011 report having an HIV/AIDS policy in
     their factories. However, more report that there has been some kind of awareness creation
     of HIV/AIDS. Though there is a decrease in the number of reported HIV/AIDS policies, a
     high number of factories still have such policies in place: 67 percent of non-BW factories
     compared to 85 percent of BW factories. Similarly, the amount of training/awareness
     creation related to HIV/AIDS for workers in non-BW factories is lower (80 percent) than
     for those in BW factories (90 percent).

     ALAFA recently closed due to funding problems. While BWL (Better Work Lesotho) is
     unable to take on all of of ALAFA’s tasks, they have incorporated some elements of safety
     and awareness regarding HIV/AIDS.

    Tuoi’s life drastically improved since she made the move from working as a coffee farmer in
    Dal Lac province in the Central Highland region of Vietnam where she was born, to working
    as a sewer in a garment factory just outside of Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC). Together with
    her husband, who works in construction, they have been able to save enough money to
    purchase their own house where they live with their two children and her mother-in-law.

    Every morning, except for Sunday, Tuoi takes her six-year-old son to kindergarten at
    the factory where she works. The kindergarten is only one of several improvements that
    Tuoi mentioned when discussing how the Better Work program has helped to improve
    her quality of job and life. Other key improvements she identified included improved
    ventilation, better overtime allocation, and better safety procedures. She also spoke to
    the positive relationship she has with both her supervisors and colleagues.

    In terms of the impact of her job on her life at home, Tuoi said, “Since I have been working
    here, we have a better life. We discuss what to do, what to spend, and also what school
    to send our children to.” She was also grateful for having a happy family, with a husband
    who supports her, including helping with household chores.

    While Tuoi enjoys her job, she has ambitions to eventually open up her own tailor shop
    and wants to see her children continue their studies so that they can get jobs in finance
    or accounting. Commenting on her job and future plans, she said, “I really like this job. I
    really like the garment factory job. I plan to work here for a few years to save money to
    open a tailor shop of my own.”

     Box 4.1: Better Work Compliance Monitoring Methodology and Reporting

     Better Work carries out factory assessments to monitor compliance with international
     labor standards and national labor laws. Assessments are based on a comprehensive
     set of questions (generally more than 200 in total) that cover core labor standards and
     national labor law. Information is gathered through a variety of sources and techniques,
     including document reviews, observations on the shop floor, and interviews with manag-
     ers, workers, and union representatives.

     Better Work organizes reporting into eight areas, or clusters, of labor standards. Each
     of the eight clusters is divided into its key components. These components are known
     as compliance points (CPs), of which there are 38. Each CP contains specific questions
     that may vary from country to country. Four of the clusters are based on fundamen-
     tal rights at work regarding child labor, discrimination, forced labor, and freedom of
     association and collective bargaining. In 1998, member states, workers, and employer
     representatives at the International Labour Organization (ILO) identified fundamental
     principles and rights at work regarding these four issues based on eight widely ratified
     International Labor Conventions (29, 87, 98, 105, 100, 111, 138, and 182). These conven-
     tions provide the baseline for compliance with the fundamental rights clusters across
     all Better Work country programs. The four other clusters, which monitor compliance
     with standards primarily established by national law (and therefore vary from country to
     country) consist of compensation, contracts and human resources, occupational safety
     and health, and working time.

     In its factory and industry-level reports, Better Work highlights noncompliance findings.
     It reports these figures to help factories easily identify areas in need of improvement.
     Better Work calculates noncompliance rates for each factory and reports the data in
     individual factory reports. The noncompliance rate is reported for each subcategory, or
     compliance point, within a cluster. A compliance point is reported to be noncompliant
     if even one question within it is found to be in noncompliance.

     In public synthesis reports, Better Work calculates the average noncompliance rates for
     all participating factories in each subcategory. For example, an average noncompliance
     rate of 100 percent means that all participating factories were found to have violations
     in that area.

    Box 4.2: Specific Categories of Compliance

    To illustrate some of the differences across various categories, we focus here on four
    specific areas that are fairly comparable across countries, either because the questions
    used are fairly similar or because they cover similar aspects. The four comparable areas
    analyzed in this section are ambient conditions, safety, wage policies, and freedom of
    association and collective bargaining (FACB). Ambient conditions encompass air, tem-
    perature, water, and sanitation facilities in the factories. Safety covers machine safety
    and fire safety. Wage policies focus on three areas: contracts (e.g., whether contracts
    are in the native language, are written, and are understood by the workers), wages (e.g.,
    paid on time and correctly), and overtime (e.g., measured and paid correctly). The last
    category, FACB, includes questions about the freedom of workers to join a union, man-
    agement attempts to interfere with unions, the presence of collective bargaining, and
    whether the collective bargaining agreement is followed.

    It is possible to analyze improvement in compliance over time using regression analysis.
    In particular, we estimate differences in compliance categories across countries by esti-
    mating a linear probability model. This regression estimates the effect of employment,
    share of female workers, visit number, time, and country on question-level compliance.
    The results are shown in Appendix A.1.

    Several interesting results emerge. First, and perhaps not surprisingly, having a Better
    Work (or BFC) Program increases compliance, which is consistent with improvements
    being linked to Better Work. Furthermore, compliance is higher in larger firms (when size
    is measured by employment). A higher female share of employment is also associated
    with higher compliance.

    Differences across the categories are statistically significant. Compliance with ambient
    standards, safety, and wage policies are lower than in other areas of compliance. Dif-
    ferences across countries are also evident. The results suggest that both Jordan and
    Vietnam have higher noncompliance rates than Cambodia, which is again consistent
    with the idea that time in Better Work or BFC is associated with increasing compliance.
    The main message from these results is that the definition of “sweatshop” varies across
    countries in the sense that different problems arise in different countries. In this regard,
    allowing for country-specific flexibility to deal with different problems is a strength of
    the Better Work Program.

    Box 4.3: What Do Our 2015 Data Tell Us about the BFC Program in Terms
    of Compliance?

    The 2015 Cambodia Apparel Workers Survey confirms earlier findings on the impact
    of BFC on working conditions. Appendix Table A.5 summarizes our survey data from
    Cambodia in terms of assessing workers’ perceptions of compliance. It shows that more
    than half of workers received OSH training, and almost all workers report that their
    factories have a health and safety committee. Slightly fewer workers, however, report
    having a health and safety policy. In terms of contracts, 71 percent of respondents have
    a fixed-term contract, 80 percent have had their contract explained to them, and 88 per-
    cent have signed a contract. Although the relative percentage of men and women who
    have fixed-term contracts is similar, a higher percentage of female workers have signed
    contracts and have had their contracts explained to them. When workers were asked
    “how often were you asked to work overtime when you did not want to over the past
    three months?” about two-thirds reported that it had never occurred. Still respondents
    reported working long hours, on average about 58 hours per week. The working hours
    do not differ across factory category. On a positive note, workers almost universally (over
    90 percent) reported that they received leave whenever they asked for it.

    Awareness of the existence of the BFC Program is low among workers. Only about
    36 percent of workers have heard of the BFC Program, and both male and female work-
    ers appear to be equally aware or unaware of the program. Across types of factories,
    as expected, workers in factories in service category C, who receive a full package of
    services from BFC (assessment, advisory, and training), are most aware of the BFC.

    Among workers who know BFC, workers in factories that receive some services from
    BFC (category B and C) reported that their working conditions had improved more than
    those of their peers in factories that only receive assessment services. Among workers
    who said that there have been improvements in their factories, most identify the most
    significant area of improvement in terms of safer and healthier workplaces. Again, work-
    ers in category A factories have not experienced this improvement to the same extent.
    Despite high rates of satisfaction with OSH, women’s satisfaction with OSH is consider-

     Box 4.5: The Success of the PICC Model in Vietnam
     •	 Better Work Vietnam has seen that factories with performance improvement consul-
        tative committees (PICCs) are much more likely to attempt negotiation before strikes
        occur. As a result, the number of strikes in Better Work factories is significantly lower
        than the industry average.
     •	 According to the 2012 Vietnam General Confederation of Labor (VGCL) study, the
        PICCs not only helped improve industrial relations, but also helped to strengthen
        trade unions overall.
     •	 The model of PICCs in Vietnam has had such a profound impact on the country that
        it has inspired a change in the labor law. In 2013 a groundbreaking change was made
        in the Vietnamese labor law, which now calls for worker/management committees in
        all enterprises to serve as a mechanism for social dialogue.

Pham’s story




                                              Age: 35
                                 Years working in garment sector: 17

After graduating from high school, Pham worked in his hometown in the Nong Son Dis-
trict of Quang Nam Province of Vietnam as a construction worker apprentice for three
months, but it was not the career he wanted. His parents also urged him to learn a skill
that could help him get a better job and Pham ended up taking the initiative to learn
sewing from a local tailor. He then worked for that shop for three months before moving
to Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) to start working in a garment factory. His sister had moved
to HCMC a year earlier and had warned Pham about the difficulties of the job and city
life, yet Pham still chose to come because he did not see much of a future for himself
back home, where he probably would have worked as a construction worker if he had
not pursued a career in the garment industry.

Since moving to HCMC, Pham has since worked in four different factories, and has been
with his current factory for more than 10 years now. He is very happy at his current fac-
tory, where he works as a technical worker and is a PICC member. Pham recalled his
first day at work:

My first impression on my first day of work was seeing the general director having lunch
together with workers. I also saw the general director roll up his sleeves and help workers
move/load/unload goods so I feel at home and have a strong attachment to my factory.

The training that Pham received from Better Work (BW) in workplace communication
also proved to be of value at home. Pham is now able to better communicate with his
wife. While he would get upset in the past, he reported that now he calms down and
speaks to her in a gentle tone to resolve any problems they may have.

Pham also offered an interesting suggestion for a possible future area for training given
that so many workers like him migrate from rural areas. He recommends that the factory
provide practical programs for workers, such as life skills and knowledge/experience
regarding city life so that workers can gain confidence and more quickly integrate into
their new lives and contribute to their factories.
Pham’s wife is also working in the garment industry. Together they have been able to save enough money to
buy a house in HCMC. So he sees their future there, and despite the difficulties of life away from his parents,
he reports that the schools in HCMC are better for his children. Pham’s dream is to continue working in the
garment factory and earning money, which he plans to send to his parents, spend on his children’s education,
and use to eventually open his own tailor shop in HCMC.

      Working in the garment industry is associated with a better quality of life for workers’

      families. In addition, field work in 2013 in Lesotho revealed that learning how to budget
      better was one of the most common improvements that workers talked about. Using 2011
      data from Cambodia, we find that having a mother working in the apparel sector makes
      girls 6.5 percent more likely to attend school.
      Both quantitative results (in Cambodia) and qualitative findings (in Vietnam, Cambodia,
  L




      and Lesotho) confirm that women and men receive equal pay for equal work. The use of
      productivity targets and piece-rate remunerations also help explain the wage equality.

      the formal sector, and in fast-paced and demanding work in the garment industry could act
      as an agent of change in breaking old norms, like women bearing the burden of household
      chores. In addition, Cambodia data suggest a correlation between the length of exposure
      to the garment industry and the likelihood that households will switch to joint decision-
      making. The data also reveal that communication skills learned through BW has been key
      in changing parochial norms, as improved communication skills allows women to negotiate
      a new balance inside theirs home and society.

    Box 5.1: The Value of Communication Skills Training

    The results from the Lesotho survey suggest that benefits from communication skills
    training can often be substantial, so it is useful to consider that the value of Better Work
    (BW) training activities may not be fully captured by synthesis reports, which focus on
    compliance points. Here is an example:

        “I’ve learned more about communication [from Better Work]. If I have an issue with
        my husband, I should prepare myself to sit down and discuss in a calm manner and
        I should not shout at him. It is the same as at work because I always prepare myself.
        For example, I should know what I’m going to talk about, with whom I’m going to have
        the discussion, and that we’re going to discuss a certain issue and I’m prepared for it.”
        —Female quality control worker at BW factory; worked in the factory for six years,
        Lesotho

    Even if only anecdotal, the experience described above is encouraging. While our cod-
    ing of focus group discussions (FGDs) in Lesotho does allow for an analysis that goes
    beyond anecdotal findings, we still need to capture more systematically the impacts of
    programs such as Better Work beyond factory walls.

     Box 5.2: Poverty Measurement of Apparel Workers in Cambodia

     Usually, the poverty rate is measured at the household level since the standard poverty
     estimation method relies on comparing the level of household consumption with appro-
     priate poverty lines. Therefore, poverty rates shown in this report are actually the poverty
     level of the households that workers are living in at the moment.

     How can the poverty of workers from the 2015 workers survey be compared with the
     national poverty line?

     Generally, poverty analysis is carried out by using a national household survey with an
     extensive module on household consumption like the CSES. However, there is a consid-
     erable challenge in collecting direct income or consumption data upon which to assess
     poverty levels. Asking income or consumption questions in a household survey can be
     extremely time-consuming and vulnerable to error (due to dependency on recall, lengthy
     modules, etc.). This has been the main reason preventing researchers from studying pov-
     erty situations and well-being of a small and specific group of population like garment
     workers in factories in the Better Factories Cambodia (BFC) program.

     To overcome the challenge on data availability, this report employs the Survey of Well-
     being via Instant and Frequent Tracking (SWIFT) method, which entails collecting a hand-
     ful of strongly predictive poverty correlates, such as household size, ownership of assets
     or employment conditions, and then converts them to poverty statistics using rigorous
     estimation models. Collecting correlates is a far easier task and can be accomplished
     more quickly than collecting income or consumption data (World Bank, forthcoming).
     The projection model (see appendix F for estimation methodology and results) was
     combined with key data collected from the workers survey. Data collected from the
     workers survey include data about assets owned by each worker’s household, such as
     motorcycles, TVs, washing machines, etc., in addition to demographic data, such as the
     number of people in the household.

Pinda’s story




                                        Age: 37
                           Years working in garment sector: 12

Coming from Koro, a rural town in Lesotho, Pinda dropped out of school to work as a
babysitter to help support her family. After her mother disappeared when Pinda was
only 8, she went to live with her grandmother and her sisters. After some time, Pinda
realized that her income was not enough to sustain their livelihood and thus made the
move to work in a garment factory when she was 25 years old. Even today Pinda still
has to support a large family including two of her sisters, her children, and her husband
(who works but in the agricultural sector). Pinda vividly remembers that Better Work
first started operating in their factory in 2012. During her interview with us, she described
three of the benefits of the Better Work program in detail.

OSH training benefit: greater safety and preparedness

“After Better Work came to my factory, things really changed. Because I didn’t understand
how firefighters, health and safety, and smoking houses work. We now have things like
this. Exit line. Evacuation plan. First aid kits. Things have changed.”

Benefit of being a PICC member: confidence

“Since Better Work came to my factory, I have been one of the members of PICC [per-
formance improvement consultative committees] in my factory. I feel comfortable and
confident because the one thing I can feel, the one is important is that we have a meeting
with the factory manager, with the management and discuss some problems. And we can
see what we achieve.”

“After becoming a PICC member, really they can see they come to me and ask me many
questions and I can tell me. And I teach them some many things. Really I feel so confi-
dent. Really.”

Budget training benefits: better budgeting

“I appreciate Better Work because I didn’t understand how to manage my salary. I was
the one who attend the workshop with Better Work. They gave us some training about
budgeting and really I realize how to manage my salary. Even if it is small, I have to man-
age it. I have to sit down and see how things are going.”

     Box 6.1: A Race to the Top: Greater Productivity and Improved Worker Welfare

     Asuyama et al. (2013) delve deeper into the post-MFA (Multi-Fibre Arrangement) period,
     studying changes in performance of Cambodia garment firms between 2002/03 and
     2008/09. They cite improved average total-factor productivity (TFP) as a key reason for
     how the Cambodian garment industry managed to increase its production and profits in
     the face of increased competition. They then ask if this was achieved by sacrificing the
     welfare of workers, especially low-skilled workers. The answer is emphatically no. In fact,
     they identify an improvement in workers’ welfare, including a rise in the relative wages
     of the lower-skilled workers. “These industrial dynamics differ considerably from those
     indicated by the ‘race to the bottom’ argument as applied to labor-intensive industrializa-
     tion in low-income countries.” Beresford (2009) similarly finds no evidence of a decline
     in labor standards as competition increased post-MFA.

    Diep’s Story




                                               Age: 40

                                Years working in garment sector: 17

    As the HR, Admin, and Compliance Manager for a factory in Vietnam with over 2,500
    employees, Diep has her hands full. But she loves her job and has gradually worked her
    way up the ranks, spending a total of 17 years at one factory, something that is not very
    common in the apparel industry. She has been in her current position for over 7 years
    and has seen many improvements in that time. Diep spoke to several specific benefits
    that she attributed to the presence of the Better Work program in her factory.

    First, the creation of the PICC (performance improvement consultative committees) has
    enabled the factory to better resolve in-house problems. For example, the PICC realized
    that workers were having a high number of accidents when operating the button-punching
    machine. They then devised a plan to address it, which included monitoring of the work
    stations to ensure that a proper safety protocol was followed in addition to having work-
    ers who had accidents on this specific machine to join the supervisory team and help
    convince other workers of the importance of following the safety protocol. Diep happily
    reported that ever since the introduction of the PICC initiative, the number of accidents
    to button-punching machine operators has fallen substantially.

    Second, Diep spoke about the benefits provided by BW trainings. They received train-
    ings in workplace cooperation, professional safety, and organizational skills. She reported
    three concrete positive outcomes as a result of the trainings: (1) an improved collective
    bargaining process, (2) reinforced use of personal protective equipment (PPE) among
    workers, and (3) improved dialogue between workers and factory management.

    Finally, Diep also linked the improvements brought about by the BW program to higher
    productivity. In her own words: “Thanks to Better Work Program, we have a better work-
    ing environment. The workers are happier and are more committed to the factory. And
    then we have significantly reduced our turnover. Thanks to the Better Work Program,
    we’ve increased our productivity. Also, the products are much improved, and we have
    more clients.” From 2000 to 2013, the factory where Diep works more than tripled its
    sales, reaching US$90 million last year. And her factory’s monthly output is now roughly
    1.1 million pieces.

Kenya: An Ideal Candidate for Better Work?

To examine possible gains from implementing a program such as BW, we conducted a
case study of Kenya, a country in Africa with a sizable garment sector. The field research
focuses on workers’ perspective; thus, it is not meant to be taken as a policy recommen-
dation that BW should be established in Kenya. For us to make that conclusion, other
criteria would need to be evaluated, which includes, but is not limited to governmental
laws, regulation and support, brand interest, and donor funding. The following discus-
sion therefore offers a brief overview of the Kenya apparel sector before identifying key
issues raised by the Kenya apparel workers through focus group discussions (FGDs). A
program such as Better Work seems to be well positioned to address many of the con-
cerns regarding job quality that the workers expressed.

Mastamet­  -Masona and Ogembo­   -Kachienga (2012) identify the historically important role
played by the Kenya apparel industry in the country’s economic development. Ever since
gaining independence in 1963, the country has relied greatly on manufacturing output
and textile and apparel production in particular. The textile and apparel sector developed
rapidly and employed about 30 percent of the labor force in the national manufactur-
ing sector in the mid-2000s. Currently, approximately 170 apparel companies operate
in Kenya. Of these companies, approximately 16 companies are operating in the Export
Processing Zone (EPZ) and employ an estimated 24,000 workers producing garments
for export. Yet, the sector’s competitiveness has been seriously hampered by the loss of
global markets following the elimination of the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA) quotas
regime at the end of 2004. Moreover, Kenya is also facing stiff competition from Asian
countries that can produce apparel products at lower costs However, like many other
countries in Africa, Kenya has benefited from duty-free access to the U.S. apparel market
under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). In addition to political support
by the Kenyan government, buyers also suggest that African countries such as Kenya
are well positioned to grow their apparel sectors (Manson 2014).

The following section highlights the main complaints voiced by workers and details how
a program such as Better Work could help to address these concerns.

Long Working Hours without Pay. Several workers said they are working overtime
without pay. Moreover, many workers spoke about the impact that working long hours has
on their home life. The majority of female workers said working long hours is angering/
frustrating their husbands, who only tolerate it for a few nights and then leave them.
Others said they are short tempered with their children. Overtime is a BW compliance
point and thus this problem could at least be identified, and possibly rectified through
BW assessments. The link between work and home-life satisfaction is also evident in this
particular complaint. Our review has shown that improving work conditions can indeed
have positive spillover effects on the quality of life outside factory walls.

Health and Safety Issues. Basic health and safety measures, such as distribution
of personal protective equipment, appears to be lacking, or, at best, inconsistent. This
reflects a shortcoming with respect to occupational health and safety policy, which can
be identified, and possibly then rectified, through BW assessments.


                                                                                     (continued)

    Kenya: Continued

    Poor Relations with Supervisors. Workers talked about supervisors using harsh
    language an generally poor relations between workers and supervisors. BW supervisor
    trainings on communication could be conducted to equip supervisors with the necessary
    skills needed to better interact with workers.

    Barriers in Joining Unions. Some reported that their bosses discouraged them from
    joining a union (or that they were flat out denied the right to join a union). And if they
    did join, they felt they were discriminated against. This problem would fall under the BW
    freedom to associate compliance point.

    Lack of Adequate Dispute Resolution Process. If they have a grievance, workers
    do not take it to a dispute resolution body/organization. Instead, they take their griev-
    ances to their shop stewards. Many workers reported that they feel their grievances go
    nowhere. The performance improvement consultative committee (PICC) model that has
    proven so valuable is a clear solution here to help ensure that workers’ concerns are
    adequately heard and addressed.

    Favoritism along Tribal Lines. There is favoritism based on tribalism concerning hir-
    ing, allowing leave, giving overtime hours if workers want them, etc. This issue would be
    captured in the discrimination compliance point during BW assessment.

    Many of the problems raised could be addressed through a program like BW. Moreover,
    despite all the complaints the workers voiced, many said they appreciate having a job,
    despite poor job quality, because it means they can at least put food on the table.
    Because their working conditions are far from ideal, this reality reinforces the importance
    of programs such as BW that aim to improve working conditions in garment factories.

            The Better Work program is an innovative approach to improving
            working conditions in apparel factories.

                The e ects of the BW program on factory conditions are strong
                and positive.

                   Evidence indicates that the beneﬁts of BW extend beyond
                   factory walls.

                   Evidence suggests that better working conditions are linked to
                   higher productivity.

    As pointed out by a representative from the Ministry of Labor, it is a myth
    that milk will help those working with chemicals. The government has been
    working to try to discourage workers from believing in this. A representative
    from BWL also remarked that they do trainings on chemical management
    and that they are emphasizing that providing milk will not help them in any
    way.
