THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
                                                               Region: Middle East & North Africa

from 1 to 189 by the ease of doing business ranking.           Population: 34,278,364

frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where    DB2015 rank: 160*
0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business
2016: starting a business, dealing with construction
permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in the economy
profile.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2015 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name

Iraq is a set of specific procedures—the bureaucratic
and legal steps that an entrepreneur must complete
to incorporate and register a new firm. These are              Legal form: Private Limited Liability Company

       Reserve a unique company name at the Baghdad Chamber of
       Commerce and the Federation of Chambers of Commerce

       The company name should be an Arabic name. A special department at
       the Chamber of Commerce, Trade Names, starts by searching the
       suggested name through their system to see if the name is already
       taken or reserved by another company. Once a name is agreed upon
       and available, the name is reserved upon payment of a nominal fee. The
       Federation of the Chambers of Commerce is informed in order to
       ensure that the chosen name is not taken through other Iraqi chambers
       of commerce. This procedure likely requires more than one visit to both       2 days        IQD 500,000

       chambers and client coordination, ending with the reservation of the
       trade name by virtue of a letter addressed to the Company Registrar
       Office of the Ministry of Trade, issued by the Federation of Chambers of
       Commerce. In order to facilitate the company name reservation process,
       the Chamber of Commerce will open an office at the company
       registration office.

       Hire a lawyer to draft articles of association

       Because lawyers are required to draft the articles of association, they
       are often also in charge of completing the registration process. The cost                    about IQD

        * Receive site inspection by Ministry of Electricity

        The office manager will request the technical department to inspect the
        site. The inspection is conducted for the following reasons:
        a. To check whether the wiring (the interface to the public network) is
        done properly and ready to be connected to the distribution network.

        Obtain external works and final connection from Ministry of
        Electricity

        The manager reviews the inspection report and notes from the local
        office on the availability of material, then asks the commercial
        department to determine the cost of material and services.
        The client needs to pay all the fees in advance. The manager checks the
        entire petition (paper copy) has been filled out. If the form is complete
        and according to the regulations in place, the manager will request
        implementation.
        The technical team will take all necessary actions to bring the materials
        to the site and carry out the works: install the poles (distance of 25
        meters between every 2 poles), the overhead wires, a 250-kVA
   4    transformer and its accessories, and connect the warehouse to the           44 calendar days     USD 15,360
        distribution network.
        In theory, both the MV and the LV networks can be overhead or
        underground in Baghdad. In the area assumed however, the most likely
        case is to have overhead connection.
        Because the works are carried out by the utility, the client is not
        requested to obtain any special permit. In the case of an underground
        connection, the Ministry of Electricity will need to obtain an excavation
        permit. In the case of an overhead connection, no such permit is even
        required.

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

       A new title elucidation (statement of data relevant to the property under
       registration) is drafted. This is free of charge.
       A competent team is formed to estimate the value of the property. This
       does not involve an inspection of the property. The team consists of the
       following persons:
       -     The Director General of the Real Property Registry of his
       representative
       -     The representative of the State Commission of Income Tax

       or not, then fix the information on the new deed title draft.
       - checking the IDs issuance for both the seller & buyer. (Proof of identity
       is obtained by sending a letter sent to the nationality authority - jinsiya).
       - Food card, Baghdad resident card, Iraqi Nationality Certificate, Jiseea,
       Land Deed. The cadastral map of the property should be in the file and
       send sent to the zone municipality.

      An approval to the transfer should be obtained from the Municipality
      Office, determining the type of the real property and the way to occupy
      it (zoning restrictions). It is quite easy to obtain this approval because it
      will not alter the way to use the property but only confirm that the way
      to occupy the property will be as per the purpose being set by the
      Municipality.

      The Municipality will check for any inconsistency on the property, if there
      are any required charges have to be paid.
      An investigation team from the Municipality will visit the property to
      confirm its status and if there were any changes done since its last
      investigation and in correlation with the old property map. Investigators
      are governmental employees only. Arrangement of the investigation
      team and fulfillment of the visit take 2-3 days. The new investigation
      report will be attached to the new cadastral certificate.
      The Municipality will check all services charges owe by the property
      owner in order to be paid prior to the approval that the property is free

      ID / meter length of asphalted road in front of the property, in addition
      of time delay.
      After completion all requirements, Municipality will send the New
      Cadastral Certificate ( NCC )by mail to the Cadastre.

      mail - property investigation - pay all due charges until reception by the

      changes or additions with reference to the original construction map,
      this will determine the amount of fines to be paid.
      - inspection fees 4000 IQD.
      - numeration fees 6000 IQD.
      - paving fees = the front of the property m2× 2455 IQD / m2.

      competent team is formed by the cadastre (Real Property Registry Office)
      consisting of the following persons in order to estimate the current value
      of the property. There is fixed day for the purpose of property
      evaluation of each area covered by the same property registry office.
      (i) Representative of the real property registry office.
      (ii) Representative of the Province Main real property registry office.

      city center, type and level of the property building, how old it is, the type
      of roofing and finishing with endeavor of evaluation with the minimum
      price / meter square or higher. From the time the New Cadastral
      Certificate is received by the Real Estate Registry and the time the
      inspection appointment is confirmed, it will take approximately 3 days.

      leave to inspect them all at one time , so the time will depend on the
      availability of other buyers.
      The inspection will take place, and the team will provide a report that will
      be used for the evaluation of the property. However, if the buyer objects
      to the estimate, then there is another inspection and a final report will be
      re-issued. All documents will then be sent to the Tax Authority once the
      report is final. This report will be used as a base by the Tax Authority to
      estimate the amount of taxes to be paid. Transmission of documents to
      the Tax Authority is done by mail.
      Note: The buyer will provide transportation for the evaluation team and
      will be charged an amount between 10000-15000 Dinars. This is an
      unofficial cost. There is possibility to request a certificate showing that
      the property is free of mortgage and encumbrances from the Registry
      Office by a governmental authority only.

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in

economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
