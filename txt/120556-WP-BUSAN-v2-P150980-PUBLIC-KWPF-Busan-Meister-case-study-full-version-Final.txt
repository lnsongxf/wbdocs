Background
Context and Purpose of the Study
East Asian countries are among the fastest growing economies in the world over the last
decade. However, as growth continues, the countries in East Asia are faced with a skills
shortage and mismatching that has limited their economic growth. To tackle this issue,
regional governments are currently restructuring their respective TVET systems to guide
schools towards demand-driven education and training; and in order to do so, they have
researched the best method of restructuring their respective systems.

In this context, the East Asia Education team has embarked on an in-depth study of
“Excellent Institutions” by selecting particular outstanding cases in select countries of East
Asia in order to research: (1) which factors contribute to a particular school’s successful
outcomes; (2) how the school developed its demand-driven system; and (3) how the school
utilizes finite resources to enhance school performance.

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to provide policy makers with empirical evidence that
will be used to develop new policies that direct schools towards more market-responsive and
demand-driven approaches. Specifically, it aims to; (1) offer guidance for individual
institutions to develop innovative methods to improve the internal and external efficiency of
their programs and determine resource priorities; (2) provide the World Bank with empirical
evidence to guide the knowledge services it offers client countries in regards to TVET
policies and practices; (3) engender a productive dialogue on the improvement of TVET
relevance within the EAP region.


Literature Review
Definition

The definition of excellent is measured by the school’s internal and external efficiency.
Internal efficiency refers to the relationship between the inputs and outputs and focuses on
what occurs within the educational and training processes. Then, what happens to the outputs
of the training process in relation to economic and social requirement is defined as external
efficiency, which is also referred to as relevance of the program (Johanson and Adams,
2004). Therefore, the excellent TVET institutions produce the best training outcomes by
retaining high internal efficiency.

Premised Four Factors Contributing to School Outcomes

Based on the literature review, the study premises that a school becomes excellent when it (1)
conserves adequate resources; (2) delivers relevant programs; (3) develops an effective
management system; and (4) establishes linkages with enterprise in the three previously
discussed areas. Additionally, there are external factors impacting the success of schools,
called “ecosystem factors” (Altbach and Salmi, 2011).

Research Design and Method
Research Questions

By conducting an in-depth analysis, this study seeks to find: (1) whether or not the above
premise factors impact school outcomes; and if so, then, (2) which of these factors is the
determining factor that contributes most to the enhancement of school performance and in
what context (various settings and time periods within respective countries); and (3) how this
factor can be strengthened based on suggestions from teachers/instructors and school
administrators.

The Rationale

We will reversely examine the relationship between outcomes and premise factors by
selecting a high-performance school (purposely selecting the sampling procedure) and the
impact of the premise factors on graduate employment rates. The logic is that if this high-
performance school demonstrates a showing of all these factors, then we can conclude that
these premise factors are likely to raise employment rates.

Case Selection

The following shows three areas of consideration for the case selection process in our study.

First, as we are reversely testing the factors that are assumed to be contributing to a school’s
success, we will select excellent schools with exemplary outcomes. Second, we will select the
school at both the secondary and post-secondary levels within the same sector. In this way,
we can more easily compare how different levels of skilled graduates are absorbed into the
labour market within the same sector, thereby investigating whether “different levels of
skills” is one of the ecosystem factors positively impacting school excellence. Also, this
analysis may provide some suggestions on how to attract more students in vocational high

school, especially to countries where students’ vocational track preferences are low. Third,
we will select schools that provide skills training for sectors that may best represent the select
country’s economy. In this way, lessons learned from the case study can be tailored to meet
the specific needs of a country that may be considering introduction of TVET training for the
same sector.

In Korea’s case, Busan Meister Technical High School (BMT) was selected because it meets
all three criteria.

Data Collection Process

The study will collect data from multiple sources to increase validity of the study. The
sources include: (1) archived information and quantitative measures; (2) a survey; and (3)
interviews.

The Survey

The survey was conducted with students, teachers, vice principals, and the principal. For the
students, we excluded 1st grade students, as they are assumed to have a lack of learning
experiences with BMT (Korea’s school year starts in the first week of March, and this survey
was conducted during the second week of April). 555 students (277 2nd graders and 278 3rd
graders) out of the total number of 600 (300 for 2nd and 3rd grade) responded to the survey.
For teachers, we excluded administrative staff, because they are assumed to have no
knowledge of the school’s program. 107 teachers (the principal, two vice principals and 104
teachers) responded to the survey out of the total number of 113 teachers.

With structured questions (category or ranking), the survey questionnaire is designed to
directly address whether or not the schools retain each factor (resources, teaching,
management, and linkage with industry) and these factors’ impact on school outcomes.

The sample of the survey questionnaire is attached in Annexes 1 and 2.

The Interview

In order to conduct an in-depth analysis, interviews were conducted with 10 students, 10
specialty teachers, the principal, and one vice principal. The interview question types were
structured to investigate the association between the premise factors and the factor most
effective in enhancing school outcomes and how this identified factor can be improved. A
sample of the interview questions is attached in Annex 3 and 4.

To maintain the validity and reliability of the study, we collected multiple resources to
investigate the research questions.

About Busan Meister Technical High School (BMT)
History

BMT was founded in 1967 by the government to supply skilled workers to Korea’s newly
established industry, and since then, the school has produced 28,415 graduates (as of 2015) in
the field of mechanical engineering. The school became a Meister High School in 2009, and
accordingly, it reorganized the program and class into Precision Machine 3 classes, Mold
Design 3 classes, Shipbuilding and Machine 3 classes, and Robot Tech 6 classes. Since 2012,
the new principal, Dr. Lee, the first principal elected via public contest, has begun a series of
reforms within the school system in order to meet new industry demands for the 21st century
global economy.

Educational Goals

The school’s vision is to help students become future industry leaders through self-
development. The educational goal is to produce Young Meisters who are self-motivated and
have problem-solving skills and warm hearts. More specifically, the school focuses on: 1)
developing basic occupational competencies and problem-solving skills; 2) combining
academic knowledge with industry-specific technical skills; providing students with an
excellent learning environment; 3) and ensuring teacher competency.

Strategies (Big 3+4 Links)

In order to achieve this goal, BMT articulates its strategy of “Big 3 [Humanity, Creativity,
Teamwork] plus 4 Links [Strengthening Basic Job Skills, Strengthening Project Design
Education, Strengthening the system of learning portfolio, Strengthening numerical, and
foreign language skills]” (Diagram 2).

Outcomes
BMT has showed very high graduate employment rates particularly after being transformed
into a Meister High school. As shown in Table 2, until 2009, its graduate employment rate
was between 45% and 55%. However, since 2010, the employment rate has increased to
83% when the school reformed its organization and programs to apply for Meister High
School. Since 2013, when the school produced its first Meister High School graduates, the
graduate employment rate has increased to above 90% (Table 2).

Table 3 shows the details in the employment of 2014 graduates. About 40% of the students
are hired by public enterprises and large companies, while about 50 % are hired by SMEs.
Finally, less than 10% of total graduates joined the Korea International Cooperation on
Agency (KOICA) as volunteers, working at training institutes founded by KOICA in
developing countries. By major, Precision Machine shows a very high employment rate,
while Shipbuilding and Machine shows the lowest employment rate. Considering its larger
number of students, compared to the other three majors, Robot Tech also shows a high
employment rate, particularly in public enterprises and larger companies most pursued by
BMT graduates (Table 3). According to the survey conducted by BMT, the majority of
students (70%) responded that their plan after graduation was either employment with large
companies (35.6%) or public enterprises (34.8%), while 21.5% responded that they were
planning to work at SMEs (21.5%) (Educational Planning, 2015, BMT).

    BMT has achieved various skill awards since its establishment, and the number and type of
    awards for Skill Competition is presented in Table 4. Until 2014, 1,069 BMT students
    achieved the awards for local Skill Competition, 303 achieved National Competition and 36
    achieved International Competition. This result indicates that BMT students have been
    trained as top skilled workers, which also increase their chances of employment upon
    graduation.

    The teachers believe that their students are highly competent. During the survey conducted by
    the Bank, 101 teachers (96%) of BMT teachers believe (either strongly agree or agree) that
    their students are highly competent (Graph 1), and 87 teachers (97%) of teachers believe
    (either strongly agree or agree) that the school is attractive to these highly competent
    students. In fact, during the interview, teachers pointed out a “virtuous circle”, indicating that
    because the school shows successful results, not only a high employment rate but also a high
    chance of being employed at prospective companies, the school is very attractive to
    competent students who can easily obtain skills during the school year. With the school’s best
    inputs, these competent students acquire a high skill that increases their chances of being

    successful outcomes again.

As the graduate employment rate is an outcome indicator in this study, BMT is assumed to be
an excellent school. Next, we will reversely examine whether or not the school possesses all
these factors: [(1) adequate resources; (2) relevant programs; (3) an effective management
system; and (4) school-industry linkages], then we can conclude that these premise factors are
likely to raise the employment rates.

Findings
In this paper, ‘excellent TVET’ institution’ means that it helps its students to transition
smoothly into the labor market upon graduation by inputting adequate resources. BMT
teachers also share this definition. They stated that ‘excellent school’ means that the school
produces a high employment rate, and in order to do so, the school requires competent
teachers, demand-driven programs, and well-established school-industry linkages. The
teachers pointed out that skills currently required by industry include problem-solving skills,
basic technical skills, and education of humanity, such as adaptation, work ethic, diligence,
and consideration for others.

The teachers described an excellent school as a “virtuous circle.” If the school inputs the
above resources and uses them efficiently, then, the more students become employable,

which in turn results in a graduate employment rate increase. Then, the outcomes increase the
school’s brand power, which attracts more competent students and better teachers. Also,
when the school produces high employment rates, it receives more financial support from the
government, which enables the school to acquire and retain expensive equipment and
practical training facilities. Also, with the high social recognition attached to the school of
being a top performing school, more companies are interested in hiring BMT graduates.
Therefore, they believe that BMT entered this virtuous cycle and has its high brand power.

The students shared the same view with the teachers. During the interview, all students
agreed that BMT is an excellent school because of the school’s high employment rate,
especially with the prospective companies. The students stated that the factors contributing to
the high employment rate of BMT are the good teachers and facilities, and the school’s well-
established school-industry cooperation. In addition, some students pointed out the school’s
reputation, tradition, and alumni support, and others mentioned the school’s strong emphasis
on employment with the provision of various employment service programs, such as field trip
to companies.

All students stated that they choose to attend BMT because they believe that BMT would be
able to help them secure a job with prospective companies upon graduation. Currently, they
are generally satisfied with their choice.

Factor 1: Adequate Financial and Human Resources

Financial Resources

The students are satisfied with the school’s facilities and equipment and with their teachers,
whom they believe are competent in their technical and teaching skills and actively help them
secure jobs. The school continually provides them with information on companies. Also,
considering Korea’s high youth unemployment rates, the school is still able to maintain its
high

BMT is overseen by three government agencies: the Ministry of Education, the local
education office of Busan local government, and the Small and Medium Business
Administration (SMBA). SMBA is the main agency that provides annual funding to BMT,
and it also funds two other Meister High Schools for the purpose of producing and supplying
adequate skilled workers to SMEs. The details of BMT’s budget (2015) are illustrated in
Table 5. In regard to revenue, the government (SMBT and the provincial office) provides
about 60% of the total revenue followed by parental support. In regard to expenditure, the
school spends the most on students’ welfare, including dormitories and food followed by
administration. Given the high costs for teaching services, the school also spends 16% of its
total budget on teachers’ wages. More than 20% of the total budget is allocated to the
curriculum development.

Facilities and Equipment

Tables 6 and 7 show BMT’s Facilities and equipment. As Table 6 shows, BMT retains a large
campus compared to other TVET schools, and their laboratory occupies about 21,300 m2,
which is larger than regular classrooms’ total size. Regarding the school’s retention of
equipment and materials for practical training, each department of the school shows some
deficiency as to the required amount (total of 10% of deficiency). However, given the size of
the school, the deficiency is relatively small compared to other TVET schools.

 The fact that the school retains adequate financial resources is supported by the finding from
 the survey and interviews with the teachers and students.

 During the survey with teachers, 91 teachers (85%) responded that school building conditions
 are either excellent or good (Graph 3), 90 teachers (84%) responded that equipment
 maintenance is either excellent or good (Graph 4), 88 teachers (83%) respond that retaining
 full or updated equipment is either excellent or good (Graph 5). Overall, the majority of
 teachers are satisfied with the school facilities and equipment and its maintenance.
 Furthermore, during the interview with teachers, they indicated that even though there is
 some deficiency in retention of equipment and materials for practical training, BMT
 possesses adequate financial resources compared to other TVET schools.

   The Characteristics of BMT Teachers
   The majority of teachers of BMT are in their 50s, while there is a shortage of teachers in the
   40s age-range. This shortage prevails in TVET schools in Korea, because during the 1990s,
   the government’s policy on TVET teachers limited the number of teachers. The average
   educational level of the teachers is an undergraduate degree, but there are a good number of
   teachers who have obtained a master’s degree in their areas of specialty.

In-service Training

In terms of in-service training, the school requires teachers to receive in-service training of 90
hours per year. According to their Educational Planning of 2015, among 65 specialty
teachers, 4 from Precision Machining, 8 from Mold Design, 17 from Shipbuilding and
Machining, and 15 from Robot Tech, received in-service training in their respective areas
from various training institutes including Hangi Training Institute for Human Resource
development; Korea University of Technology; Hyndai Heavy Industry Technology Training
Institute; ProTech. Co. This is also evidenced by the teacher’s survey conducted by the Bank.
The survey results show that 96% of the teachers received in-service training, and among
them, 59% of teachers have received more than 61 hours until April, 2015 (Graph 13). Also,
Graph 14 illustrates that the majority of teachers (61%) received the training in the form of a
seminar/workshop.

We asked the teachers to assess their own competency during the survey. 98% of the teachers
regard themselves as a competent teacher who possesses required technical and teaching
skills. Also, the same number of teachers believes that the school has adequate teacher
recruitment standards to select competent teachers.

During the in-depth interview, all teachers indicated that the most important element of being
a competent TVET teacher is technical skill. However, newly hired teachers lack technical
skills due to their lack of practical training during their teacher college programs. To
overcome this issue, according to the Principal, the school offers a long-term training (three
to six months) to newly hired teachers and hires a temporary teacher to substitute them during
their absence. Also, the school appoints mentors from industry and teachers to them to
improve their technical skills.

As for the experienced teachers, they are also required to take in-service training of 90 hours
per year to update their technical skills, which is also reflected in the teacher’s assessment.
They select in-service programs either offered by the Busan education office, universities
(e.g. Korea University of Technology), or companies. For some specific skills, BMT
develops its own training program with an approval from the Busan education office.

Second, the teachers pointed out the necessity of having a technical instructor who can
demonstrate the running of a specific machine and equipment to the students and also
continually maintain them. They stated that the regular teachers do not have time to master
the utilization of and maintain all the machines and equipment, particularly new ones. To
overcome this issue, the Principal mentioned that the school hired five part-time instructors
who co-teach with the specialty teachers. However, because of a lack of sense of the
responsibility of these instructors, some teachers recommended that the school should hire
full-time technicians.

The students also agreed that their teachers are highly competent. According to the Bank
survey, 415 students (75%) perceived that teachers are generally competent by responding
that they are either very satisfied or satisfied with their teacher and instruction (Graph 15).

Also, according to an internal survey, the students indicated that their low understanding of
the program is not due to inadequate teachers’ lecture methods (15.1%), but rather their lack
of motivation to learn (49.7%) (Educational Planning of 2015, BMT).

During the interview with the students, they further stated that the teachers are competent in
both technical knowledge and teaching. For example, the teachers perfectly demonstrate and
explain how to use a specific machine and provide one-on-one teaching to all students.
Considering the teachers’ age, the students said the older teachers have more teaching and
technical skills than the younger teachers, and these older teachers are able to teach the latest
skills. Also, according to them, the teachers support the students in acquiring certificates by
working closely with them even after class, weekend and vacation. The teachers actively find
prospective companies for the students and continually provide the students with information
on employment with these companies

Career Development Supporting Programs

The school offers various programs to help the students build their career plans.

First, “Semester for Promotion of Learning Motivation” is one of new initiatives that have
been developed by the current Principal, Dr. Lee. The program is offered to freshmen during
the first month of the high school year. The purpose of the program is to improve the
students’ learning motivation and help them develop their career plans. Also, the school
expects to see the enhancement of the students’ sense of community, self-reflection, self-
esteem, self-control, filial devotion, and respect. During this month, the students participate
in various group activities and attend special lectures conducted by prominent graduates.
They also visit large companies (Hyndai Motor, Hyndai Heavy Industry, Posco) for one day
as well as SMEs of their related companies for two days. Also, during this period, the
students should develop their career load map and “My Portfolio” which is used for the rest
of the high school year.

According to the internal survey, 59.5% teachers responded either very satisfied or satisfied
(very satisfied, 16.5%; satisfied, 43%); 63.5% of parents responded either very satisfied or

satisfied (very satisfied, 26.3%; satisfied, 37.2%); and 63% of students responded either very
satisfied or satisfied (very satisfied, 30.1%; satisfied, 32.9%). Overall, the teachers, parents,
and students are satisfied with this program (The Educational Planning of 2015, BMT)

During the interview conducted by the Bank, several teachers and students referred to this
program (Semester for Promotion of Learning Motivation) as one of the most successful
BMT programs that assist students in building their future career plans. During the interview,
the students stated that this program motivates them to study hard and develop their career
plans. They said that “My future company visit” during the Motivation program was a key in
helping them understand how a manufacturing plant operates and the workings of a real job.

Second, another program is “Weekly Special Lectures of Personalities” held on the 4th Friday
of each month which includes invites of prominent alumni, such as corporate CEO. The goal
is to foster the students’ motivation for future achievement and a job acquisition. In addition,
the lecture is expected to increase the students’ self-confidence, cultivate a caring mind for
others, and develop their future career plans.

According to the internal survey, 69.7% of teachers responded either very satisfied or
satisfied (very satisfied, 22.8%; satisfied, 46.9%); 57.3% of parents responded either very
satisfied or satisfied (very satisfied, 26.3%; satisfied, 31%); and 51.9% of students responded
either very satisfied or satisfied (very satisfied, 23%; satisfied, 28.9%). Overall, the teachers,
parents, and students are satisfied with this program (The Educational Planning of 2015,
BMT).

The fact that BMT instituted the excellent support system to enhance employment is
supported by evidence collected by the Bank. During the survey with the teachers, 38% of
teachers rated the school’s supporting system excellent, particularly in the area of career
service (Graph 16). Also, during the interview, they agreed that the school has successfully
motivated the students to learn and helped them develop the career plans. In addition, the
school helps the students understand their future job in the real production field.
Furthermore, according to the Principal, this supporting system directly influenced the
employment rate. As of April, 90 students out of 295 (3rd grade) secured their employment,
and in order to make this happen, the school has provided various other programs, besides the
two aforementioned programs, such as employment camp, Job Fair, and Field visits to
companies. The career development department helps the students prepare for their self-
introduction letter and interview.

The students also said that the school’s supporting system has been very helpful. During the
survey, 63% of the students have received career counselling, and among them, 89%
responded that the counselling has been helping them navigate their career plans. During the
interview, the students mentioned that the school helps them: (1) develop the career plan via
the above programs (Semester for Promotion of Learning Motivation, Weekly Special
Lectures of Personalities, and career counselling services); (2) find a company; and (3)
prepare them for acquiring a position with that company. The school helps them concrete
their career plans: for example, the homeroom teacher, particularly, guides them in finding
their interest, specific occupation and companies. Then, the school provides information on
the company and special employment opportunity: for example, assisting the students in
acquiring certifications needed for the specific job and company, improving their interview
skills, and supporting them in writing resume and self-introduction letter. Also, the students
pointed out other supporting system, such as an aptitude test that is held twice a year, One-
on-One Meeting with the homeroom teacher and staff of career development department,
field trip to companies, and employment camp, is helpful.

Factor 2: Relevant Program
The program of the 1st year focuses on the National Common Basic Curriculum, while the
program of the 2nd and 3rd year focuses on Optional Subject Curriculum. The BMT offers a
total of 210 credits during the three year, and the ratio among normal subject vs. specialist
subject vs. creative subject is 38.1: 50.5: 11.4. As BMT is a specialized high school whose
specific purpose is to produce skilled workers within relevant fields, the specialist subjects
occupy the most (50%), and they are mostly required credits (Table 9).

Technical Skills
In addition to the regular curriculum, the students can improve their technical skills by
joining a student club. For example, the students can join the club of a technical training
program, such as CNC milling, CNC lathe, Mold design, Machine design, Polymechanics,
Refrigerating technology, Piping, Welding, ad Mechatronics. Also, they can join technology
research, such as Making Robot, FA, Practical Use of Invent, Electric CAD, Steel Frame
Structure, Model Plane, Patent for an Invention, Mobile, and Indoor Controlling. The school
also offers ten skill clubs to the select students to prepare them for various skill competition
awards in their relevant areas as well as increase their talents and employment opportunity.
Each club is managed by one designated teacher who works closely with these select
students.
According to the internal survey, 64.7% of the students responded that they are either very
satisfied or satisfied (very satisfied, 26.8%; satisfied, 37.9%) with their club activity (The
Educational Planning of 2015, BMT).

Creativity and Problem Solving Skills

To meet industrial demands, BMT also focuses on improving the students’ creativity and
problem-solving skills. The school created “Creative Design Center”, “Realization of Think
different, Seek teamwork, Make operate, Challenge yourself (T.S.M.C)”, “the Project-based
Education Program”, Unlimited Imagination Lounge”, and “Mathematics and Science
Lounge”.

Regarding “the Project-based Education Program”, the program encourages the students to
incubate their ideas via free and open debates, choose their own topic, and work as a group.
Also, see Diagram 4.           “Unlimited Imagination Lounge” fosters leadership and
entrepreneurship by providing basic technical skills and opening this specific facility for 24
hours to students. “Mathematics and Science Lounge” cultivates the students’ basic math
ability for engineering. The program is delivered in the form of one-point lessons for
students who require additional assistance and in the form of level-differentiated small group
classes.

According to the internal survey, 49.4 of teachers responded either very satisfied or satisfied
(very satisfied, 8.9%; satisfied, 40.5%); 60.7% of parents responded either very satisfied or

According to the internal survey, 58.2% of teachers responded either very satisfied or
satisfied (very satisfied, 11.4%; satisfied, 46.8%); 57.3% of parents responded either very
satisfied or satisfied (very satisfied, 25.5%; satisfied, 31.8%); and 60.7% of students
responded either very satisfied or satisfied (very satisfied, 27.5%; satisfied, 33.2%) with “the
Reinforcement of Character Education” (The Educational Planning of 2015).

Basic Skills

In order to strengthen the students’ basic skills, BMT offers after class programs. The
programs include the preparation for certificates, foreign language, mathematics/science
skills, and basic knowledge of another three majors. The topics of after class are selected by
the students, and they must attend at least one of the classes. Instructors are invited from
either inside or outside BMT. Each class is continually assessed by regular monitoring and
feedback.
Entering College with Advance Points

Even though they are in a TVET track, more than half of the students are interested in
pursuing further education after employment as evidenced by the survey conducted by the
Bank. 56% of the students responded that upon graduation, they pursue an advanced degree.
To meet this demand, the school also offers the special program, “Entering a College with
Advance Points”. The students gain employment first and enter college later with advanced
points that they obtained during the high school year. For this, the school developed a MoU
with companies and college to combine work with learning.

According to the internal survey, 20.2% of teachers responded either very satisfied or
satisfied (very satisfied, 3.8%; satisfied, 16.4%); 43.7% of parents responded either very
satisfied or satisfied (very satisfied, 18.2%; satisfied, 25.5%); and 38.5% of students
responded either very satisfied or satisfied (very satisfied, 18.2%; satisfied, 20.3%). Overall,
the teachers, parents, and students are satisfied with this program (The Educational Planning
of 2015).

The findings support the fact that BMT is providing the students with the programs that
enhance the skills required by industry. First, for the question of the relevance of the school
curriculum (Graph 17), 87% of the teachers said either agree or strongly agree, and 93% of
the teachers said the school offers high quality programs (Graph 18). 60% of the teachers
said that the students still need to take additional training to be employed (Graph 19). This is
because in Korea’s case, the students need to acquire certificates, and additional training
serves this purpose. Overall, 95% of the teachers believe that the school provides relevant
teaching programs (including practical training) to produce competitive school outcomes.
Furthermore, 90% of the teachers believe that the program also can help students advance to
higher education.

During the in-depth interview, the teachers generally agreed that the school offers the
program that is needed by industry. According to the Principal, the currently needed skills
include basic technical skills, cognitive skills, problem-solving skills, self-determining, and
humanity of ethic, patience, diligence, adaptation, and consideration. To improve problem-
solving and creativity, the school has developed several new initiatives.

Regarding technical skills, the teachers believe that the school should impart basic technical
skills because this skill is the job-ready skills needed in the production line and a basis for
acquiring firm-specific skills. According to these teachers, because in reality it is impossible
for the school to teach specific skills, the school should focus on teaching the basic technical
skills that can be a basis for the specific skills once they are hired by a specific company.

Also, to meet the rapid changes in industry, BMT annually review its curriculum and update
supplement training materials. Textbooks are developed by the MoE in collaboration with
industry as the goal of Meister high school is to match manpower with industrial demands.
On the other hand, each major develops its own supplement training materials in
collaboration with about four companies in their relevant fields.

The students also support the fact that BMT provides the relevant program to its students.

During the internal survey, the students indicates their satisfaction with the school program
by stating that the reason for their low understanding of the program is not because of
inadequate curriculum but because of their lack of learning motivation and absence of goal
(49.7%). Also 63.7% of the students responded that they are either very satisfied or satisfied
(very satisfied, 25.6%; satisfied, 38.1%) with their major (The Educational Planning of
2015).

During the survey conducted by the Bank, 56% of the students responded that they receive
more than 20 hours of practical training at school per week (Graph 20). For the question of
whether they believe the school is preparing them adequately, skill-wise, to find a job, 72%
of the students responded “Yes”. 78% of the students said that they take additional training
aside from school’s regular program, and among them, the more than half is receiving

not because they lack practical training but because they need to prepare for certain
certificates. The school provides additional training courses after class, during weekend and
vacation in order to help them obtain certificates, which increases the chance of being
employed. In Korea’s case, the students said that during a hiring process, companies give an
emphasis on whether or not an applicant holds needed certifications.

Factor 3: Effective Management System
	
BMT’s unique feature of management is “Center-focused Department Management” which
aims to improve open communication, unity, and harmony among the faculty members by
integrating 25 departments into seven major centers. The seven centers are the Education
Planning Research Center; Meister Center; Technical Education Center; Creative Design
Center; Cognitive Education Center; Student Support Center, and the School Administration
Support Center. The school holds the bi-weekly meetings to discuss and share the center’s
issues, including curriculum, budget, and facilities; therefore, during the meetings, the
teachers understand the total workflow across the department as well as the centers. Also, the
center-focused management enables the school to use the budget efficiently as the funds are
allocated to each center, and the departments within the center share the funds overall.

Organization of School Management

BMT’s organizational chart is illustrated below (Diagram 6). The management includes one
principal, two vice principals, seven center heads and 25 team leaders. Under the Principal,
there are two vice-principals and one head of Administration. Each vice principal is
responsible for the three centers, and each head of center manages their own department. The
head of Administration under the Principal manages the school administration center that
consists of five departments, including school-industry cooperation.

During the interview, two issues emerged: the teachers’ lack of sense of ownership and a lack
of communication between the management and the faculty members as well as among the
faculty members. In regard to the sense of ownership, the teachers stated that the issue arises
due to Korea’s teacher recruitment system. In Korea, each provincial education office retains
the pool of certificate teachers and appoints them to the schools located within the province.
So, teachers are employed by a local education office, not by the school, and they stay in each
school for a limited number of years (up to five years). As a result, teachers in general feel
less responsible for and ownership of their appointed schools. This also occurs with BMT.
Also, considering the large number of faculty members compared to other TVET schools,
BMT faces difficulty in increasing communications between the management and the faculty
members as well as among the faculty members.

To overcome this issue, the Principal reorganized the school from 25 departments to the
seven centers, hoping to see an increase in information flow and a developed sense of
ownership among the teachers. Several departments are concentrated under one center, and
each department must take responsibility for their own department’s affairs as well as share
their information and resources with other departments within the center. The seven centers
will then share their information and resources with the other six centers and the head of each
center will directly communicate with the Principal. In this way, all faculty members will
then be responsible for their own department and center and able to communicate with other
departments.

Second, the teachers stated that the resources are efficiently utilized in this center-focused
management. For example, financial resources are allocated to the seven major centers, and
within the center, the funds flow across the departments. The departments within the center
are encouraged to share information, budget, and machines and equipment to increase
efficiency of utilization of the resources. For example, unlike other TVET schools, the four
departments of BMT (four majors) share their machines and equipment with another
department.

Third, the teachers all agreed that management contributes to the school outcome. The
teachers first indicated the Korean education system as an example. The Korean education
system confers the strong management power to the Principal. For example, the Principals
can reorganize the school system, manage teachers, and even develop new curricula. This is
so, because especially Meister High Schools have more freedom to develop their own
curricula to meet industry demands; therefore, the Principal of BMT is able to develop and
institute his new initiatives. In addition to this power conferred by the government, BMT
Principal has strong vision: He defined new skills required by the labour market as creativity,
self-directing skills, problem solving skills, and accordingly developed new programs to meet
this demands. Several teachers referred to the school’s new initiative programs as one
example of the principal’s strong leadership, because these programs were initiated and
developed by the principal whose vision is to provide the students with an opportunity to
acquire industrial demanded skills and develop their career roadmaps.

However, few teachers mentioned that this vision should be shared more by the rest of the
teachers. His messages should convince more teachers who believe that the school should
focus more on the basic technical skills than creativity as the students of secondary level
TVET has a limited role in the labour market. Also, the Principal needs to have more
communication with the teachers and involve more teachers in the decision-making process.
However, even these teachers said there is no doubt about the Principal’s strong vision and
leadership, and this has contributed to the school outcomes.

Lastly, one teacher pointed out that management impacts the employment rate by increasing
the students’ motivation and confidence. The experiences during the new initiative programs,
such as “Semester for Promotion of Learning Motivation”, directly influence the students in
improving their motivation on learning and acquiring a job. This view is supported by the
students as well. During the interview, the students stated that their experiences during
“Semester for Promotion of Learning Motivation” helped them find the purpose of their study
and navigate a career plan, which pushed them to work harder during the school year to
achieve the goal of employment with prospective companies.

Factor 4: School Industry Linkages
	
To strengthen school-industry linkages, BMT has created various departments, including
School Industry Cooperation TF, the School-Industry Cooperation Advisory Committee,
Council for Operation Field Practice, and Management of Job Career Development Center.
Furthermore, the school organizes several field visits to select companies for the students.

School-Industry Cooperation Advisory Committee

The committee is composed of the school teachers/staff and representatives from enterprises.
The chair is selected from industry, and the head of the Meister Center is designated as an
assistant administrator. Within the committee, operation committee members are composed
of the vice principal, the head of five centers, and the team leader of the 3rd grade, two staff
members from the school-industry cooperation department, and the head of four major
departments; while advisory Committee members are composed of representatives from
enterprises. The meeting is held annually, and during the meeting, the members discuss
specific programs, textbooks, and curriculum to meet industrial demands, share employment

                                                               BMT, Korea | Excellent TVET Case Study	
                               	
                                                                                                               	




	
information, and discuss the possibility of in-company training for both the students and
teachers.
Council for Operation and Field Practice

The council is composed of the vice principal, the head of five centers, and the team leader of
3rd grade, the head of four major departments. The vice principal is designated as a head and
the head of the Meister Center is designated as an assistant administrator. Their main tasks
include selecting companies for practical training; defining procedure for in-company
practical training; and assessing practical training.

School Industry Cooperation TF

Its role is to develop a MoU with prospective companies, and their specific activities include
finding excellent SMEs, visiting these SMEs, developing a MoU with them, and sending
students to these companies for in-company practical training and employment. Table 10
shows the number of new companies in which the school developed a MoU between 2011
and 2014, and the school also aims to develop a MoU with 60 companies in 2015.

Job Career Development Center

The center’s main responsibilities include building database on company information in
connection with SMEs administration; supporting educational programs offered by the
companies; organizing staff’s company visits to develop a MoU for the employment. In
addition, the center provides the students with the latest information on the companies,
helping them prepare self-introductions resumes, and job application letters, and providing
personalized career counselling via job interview simulation. According to the internal
survey, 65.9% (very satisfied, 16.5%, satisfied, 49.4%), 55.9% of parents (very satisfied,
22.4%; satisfied, 33.5%), and 62% (very satisfied, 24.6%; satisfied, 37.4%) of the students
said that they are either very satisfied or satisfied with their experience with the Job Career
Development Center (The Educational Planning of 2015, BMT).

Field Trip to Select Companies

The school provides students with an opportunity to visit prominent companies to help them
understand how products are manufactured in the production lines, to help them develop their
career roadmaps, and to promote school-industry linkages. Table 11 shows the name of the
company and the number of students of each major who visited these companies. Because the
students of 3rd year are taking in-company training during summer, the site visit is designed
specifically for 1st and 2nd grade students who are still developing their career plans.

During the survey conducted by the Bank, 95% of the teachers believe that their school has
built a successful partnership with companies in order to enhance school outcomes. Also, in
regard to the type of cooperation, 96% of the teachers believe that a school should have a
formal partnership with companies. Although it is important to develop the formal school-
industry linkage, the teachers often face difficulty because of a lack of the company’s
interest. 67% of the teachers said the main reason for preventing the school from developing
a formal partnership is the companies’ disinterest (Graph 25).

During the interview, all teachers stated that SMEs are generally not interested in developing
school-company cooperation. According to them, SMEs are not much interested in offering
pre-employment training to students because they do not retain adequate training places and
instructors. Also, their production lines are too busy to meet their own production deadlines.
However, the companies train newly hired staff for job specific skills; therefore, most SMEs
train the students who are of premise employment with them.

To overcome this challenge, BMT teachers have made tremendous efforts by visiting
companies in personal to discuss a possible collaboration and have developed a MoU. Once a
MoU is developed, then the companies participate in developing training materials and
curriculum as well as provide scholarship, in-company training for the students and teachers,
places for the field visits and employment.

Also, all teachers agreed that their cooperation with the companies is systematic as the MoU
defines each other’s roles and responsibilities. The role of companies is rather advisory: for
example, during the School-Industry Cooperation Advisory Committee meeting, the
representatives from the companies provide advice on the direction of the program and
curriculum. In regard to developing BMT’s own training materials, the teachers of each
department work closely with the representatives from four companies according to their
relevant fields.

However, most teachers indicated that the companies need to be more active in this
cooperation. Although the formal School-industry Cooperation Advisory Committee is held
twice a year, sometimes one and third representatives of the companies fail to attend the
meeting. Therefore, the teachers said that the school-industry cooperation can have the best
outcome only when the companies also actively participate in this cooperation.

Conclusion
This paper reversely examined the relationship between outcomes and premise factors by
selecting a high-performance school (the high graduate employment rate) and the impact of
the premise factors on school outcomes. The logic is that if this high-performance school
demonstrates that it possesses these factors and has close relationships with the outcomes,
then we can conclude that these premise factors are likely to raise employment rates.

The first research question is whether or not the school possesses these factors. The findings
strongly support that BMT has adequate resources, relevant programs, excellent management,
and well-established school-industry linkages. The second question is whether or not the
above premise factors impact school outcomes. The findings suggest that these factors both
directly and indirectly influenced the BMT’s graduate employment rate. According to the
survey and interview conducted with both the teachers and students, these factors increase the
students’ employability, which leads to a higher chance of being employed, particularly with
prospective companies. The third question concerns which of these factors determines what
contributes most to the enhancement of school performance, in what context, and how this
factor can be strengthened. According to the findings, the primary factor has changed
throughout the time due to economic and social conditions.

During the 1970s, because the country shifted from a lighter to heavier manufacturing
industry, it required different types of labor force, such as skilled technicians and experts.
Accordingly, the government expanded technical and vocational education to meet the
demand for skilled workers in the heavier manufacturing industry (Zang, 2009; Kim, 2000;
Lee et al, 2012). Given this economic context, BMT was strongly supported by the
government. In fact, the government founded BMT in 1967 to meet this shortage of skilled
workers with support from the German government as well as IBRD. Then, the government
produced practical trainers within a short time period by issuing a practical trainer certificate

to those who graduated from BMT. The teachers stated that during this period, both financial
and human resources are the most important factors contributing to the school’s performance.
Although BMT faced a lack of resources, strong government support, support from IBRD
and other donor countries, and the way of their ability to expedite technical teachers enabled
them to overcome the odds.

Since 1985, the enrolment of higher education (both 2 year technical and vocational college
and 4-year university) has rapidly increased due to economic growth and social demands. As
a consequence, according to the teachers, all TVET schools had the most difficult time during
1990s: most students entered academic high school to pursue their higher education, while
stigma attached to those who studied at TVET schools prevailed. During this time period, the
teachers generally agreed that management, particularly a strong leadership and vision, was
the most important factor that contributed to school outcomes. First, the management of BMT
efficiently utilized its resources in the face of a lack of financial support from the
government. Second, the management focused on establishing the school-industry
cooperation with a strong support from its alumni. Because of its long history, BMT had a
good number of prominent alumni, such as CEO of SMEs. Their companies provided
employment, lecture, and scholarship to BMT students. Also, under the direction of the
strong leadership, the teachers not only taught but also actively worked on establishing the
school-industry cooperation. Therefore, the teachers said that during the 1990s when there
was low demand for and high stigma attached to TVET schools, the management was the
most important factor, and their recommendation was to have a leader with strong vision and
leadership.

In 2008, the government made a major policy change in the TVET system. Due to a shortage
of technical skilled workers and stigma attached to TVET schools, the government decided to
establish Meister High School by selecting 39 existing TVET schools whose performance
meet the criteria. The purpose of establishing the Meister High School is to produce skilled
workers via a curriculum tailored to industry needs in order to reduce skills mismatching.
Also, by transforming TVET schools into this specialized high school purposed to produce
the best skilled workers, the Meister High School could reduce the stigma attached to TVET
schools. To achieve this goal, first, the government provides the schools with financial
resources to substitute their students’ tuition, dormitory, and fees, as well as to maintain
training facilities and equipment. Second, the schools can have autonomy for developing
customized curricula to meet the demands of companies in their relevant fields. Third, due to
increasing school autonomy, the government encourages the schools to select a Principal with
strong management skills via public contest. Lastly, the government encourages Meister from
industry to train Meister High School students via the school-industry cooperation. In 2008,
BMT became a Meister High School, and since then, it has received strong government
support, particularly financial resources. Currently, BMT regained its reputation and high
employment rate outcomes. And given the fact that a Meister High School has strong
autonomy in the areas of curriculum development and management as well as its Principal’s
strong autonomy, most teachers agreed that the management, particularly leadership, is a key
factor determining the school outcomes. They recommended that the school should have a
good leader who has vision, manage the resources efficiently, encourage the teachers to
improve their competency, develop demand-driven, tailored school curriculum, and establish
meaningful school-industry cooperation. This is because all school inputs are created and
utilized under the direction of the school leader and his strong leadership.
