Although it currently represents a small percentage of global power generation, installations of solar
photovoltaic (PV) power plants are growing rapidly for both utility-scale and distributed power generation
applications. Reductions in costs driven by technological advances, economies of scale in manufacturing,
and innovations in financing have brought solar power within reach of grid parity in an increasing
number of markets. Continued advancements and further cost reductions will expand these opportunities,
including in developing countries where favourable solar conditions exist. Policy environments for
renewable energy in the developing world are being refined, drawing on the lessons learned from
the successes and failures of policies adopted in first-mover markets. We now see several regulatory
models being successfully deployed in the developing world with consequent increase in investment and
installations. Solar is proving to be viable in more places and for more applications than many industry
experts predicted even a few years ago.

At the same time, this rapid market growth has been accompanied by an observed uneven expertise and
know-how demonstrated by new market entrants. Building capacity and knowledge on the practical
aspects of solar power project development, particularly for smaller developers, will help ensure that new
PV projects are well-designed, well-executed, and built to last.

Enhancing access to power is a key priority for the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and solar
power is an area where we have significant expertise. IFC has invested in more than 55 solar power
projects globally representing about 1,400 MW of capacity, with key recent transactions in Thailand, the
Philippines, India, China, Jordan, Mexico, South Africa, Honduras, and Chile.

We trust that this publication will help build capacity amongst key stakeholders, as solar power continues
to become a more and more important contributor to meeting the energy needs in emerging economies.

                                    subsections below.

                                    Developing a PV project is a process involving many stages
                                    and requires a multidisciplinary team of experts. The project
                                    developer starts by identifying a power market that offers
                                    adequate risk-reward opportunities, then identifies a promising
                                    site and secures the land-use rights for this site, carries out two
                                    separate rounds of technical-financial assessments (prefeasibility
                                    study and feasibility study), obtains all required permits and
                                    licenses, secures power purchase and interconnection agreements,
                                    arranges financing, and selects a team to design and construct the
                                    project (often an EPC contractor), supervises plant construction,
                                    and carries out testing and start-up. As the project moves from
                                    one stage to the next, the technical-financial assessments become
                                    more detailed until a final design is developed and construction
                                    starts.

                                    It is important to emphasize the back-to-back nature of many
                                    project contracts and documents; a PPA is needed in order for
                                    financing to be completed. However, this must be preceded by a
                                    grid connection agreement, construction and site access permits,
                                    land lease agreement, etc. Throughout this process, technical,
                                    commercial, and legal/regulatory experts are involved, working
                                    in parallel on distinct yet interdependent activities. While clear
                                    responsibilities can be identified for each expert, most project
                                    activities are related and the work of one expert influences the
                                    work of other experts; hence close coordination is needed. It is
                                    crucial to emphasize this latter point. Although this guide lays

                                      Cadmium Telluride (CdTe), Copper Indium (Gallium) Di-Selenide
                                      (CIGS/CIS), and Amorphous Silicon (a-Si).

                                      The performance of a PV module will decrease over time due to a
                                      process known as degradation. The degradation rate depends on
                                      the environmental conditions and the technology of the module.

                                      Modules are either mounted on fixed-angle frames or on sun-
                                      tracking frames. Fixed frames are simpler to install, cheaper and
                                      require less maintenance. However, tracking systems can increase
                                      yield by up to 45 percent. Tracking, particularly for areas with
                                      a high direct/diffuse irradiation ratio also enables a smoother
                                      power output.

                                      Inverters convert direct current (DC) electricity generated by the
                                      PV modules into AC electricity, ideally conforming to the local

     project economics. Careful selection of the PV modules is required. Although modules are an up-front capital cost, developers should think
     of long-term revenues.

     The “bankability” of a module may be understood in different ways by developers, financiers and module manufacturers. The “bankability”
     usually includes an overall assessment of:
        Module technical characteristics.
        Quality of the manufacturing facility.
        Certification and testing procedures.
        Track record of the company and module.
        Warranty conditions.
        Company financial position.

     To fully understand module risk, a full assessment of these criteria should be undertaken.

     Current certification standards do not fully assess the technical adequacy of PV modules over the project life. A bath-tub failure curve
     is typical for PV modules, with increased risk of failure during the early years (infant-failures), low risk for the mid-term of the project
     (midlife-failures) and increased risk at the end of the project lifetime as modules deteriorate (wear-out-failures). From the lenders
     perspective, revenues from projects are most important during the first 15 years to coincide with typical debt terms. A lender is therefore
     well protected if the risk of infant-failure can be passed on to the EPC contractor or module manufacturer.

     Most EPC contractors are willing to provide plant (PR) guarantees during the EPC warranty period (typically two years). Accompanied by a
     linear power warranty provided by the module manufacturer, a degree of infant failure module risk is covered.

     The interests of the owner can be protected still further with additional testing of the modules during the EPC warranty period
     accompanied by appropriate termination scenarios whereby the owner has the right to reject the plant if it fails performance tests.
     Examples of module testing include external or on-site flash testing of a sample of modules upon delivery and prior to the end of the EPC
     warranty period, electro-luminescence testing and thermographic testing. These tests help to identify defects that may not affect the plant
     power within the EPC warranty period, but may do so in the future.

     Many module manufacturers now typically offer a 25-year linear power output warranty. However, during historical periods of PV module
     over-supply, a large number of module manufacturers have entered insolvency, and many more have had poor financial positions. This
     means that not all module manufacturers can be assumed to be in a position to honour long-term warranty claims. Some module
     manufacturers, therefore, provide additional risk protection by offering third-party warranty insurance so that power output warranties
     can still be honoured in the case of manufacturer bankruptcy.

     Developers, owners and financiers are advised to consider incorporating such additional risk reduction strategies into project contracts in
     order to match the project risk with their own risk profile requirements.

The use of the term “capacity factor” is less common in
the solar industry than “specific yield.” Capacity factor
and specific yield are simply related by the factor 8760.
The capacity factor of a fixed tilt PV plant can vary from
12 percent to 24 percent depending on the solar resource
and the performance ratio of the plant. In Germany, a
capacity factor of 12 percent may be typical. Higher
capacity factors in the region of 16 percent may be
experienced in southern Spain, which has a higher solar
resource. For Thailand and Chile, capacity factors may be
in the region of 18 percent and 22 percent, respectively. A
5MWp plant in Chile will generate the equivalent energy
of a continuously operating 1.1MW plant.

        There are two main sources of solar resource data: satellite-
        derived data and land-based measurement. Since both sources
        have particular merits, the choice will depend on the specific site.
        Land-based site measurement can be used to calibrate resource
        data from satellites in order to improve accuracy and certainty.

        As solar resource is inherently intermittent, an understanding
        of inter-annual variability is important. Often ten years or
        more of data are desirable to calculate the variation with a
        reasonable degree of confidence, although many projects have
        been completed with less detailed levels of historical data (see the
        checklist at the end of Chapter 4).

        The following sections describe how the solar resource may
        be quantified and summarises the steps in the solar resource
        assessment process.

Box 2: Case Study of Solar Resource for a Location in India

There are a variety of possible solar irradiation data sources that may be accessed for the purpose of estimating the irradiation at potential
solar PV sites in India. The data sources for solar radiation in India are of varying quality. Comparison and judicious selection of data sources by
specialists in solar resource assessment is recommended when developing a project. Some of the more accessible data sources include:
   India Meteorological Department data from 23 field stations of the radiation network, measured from 1986 to 2000.
   SolMap project, data measured at approximately 115 Solar Measuring Stations over India.a
   NASA’s Surface Meteorology and Solar Energy data set. Due to large deviation from other databases, and course spatial resolution, it is not
     advised to apply this database for solar energy projects in India. The data can provide some indication about the inter-annual variability.
   The METEONORM global climatological database and synthetic weather generator. This database has limitations in regions with
     sparse availability of historical ground Solar Measuring Stations, such as India.
   Satellite-derived geospatial solar data products from the United States-based National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). Annual average
     DNI and GHI, latitude tilt, and diffuse data are available at 40km resolution for South and East Asia and at 10km resolution for India.
   Commercial databases. SolarGIS has historical coverage of 15+ years at 3km spatial resolution and 30 minute time resolution. The
     database is updated daily and has been validated over India.b
In order to support financing, the developer of the 5 MW plant in Tamil Nadu had a basic solar resource assessment carried out. However, only
one data source was used and there was no assessment made of the inter-annual variability of the resource. Nor was any analysis provided
of the historical period on which the data were based. The location of the 5 MW plant in Tamil Nadu was more than 200km from the nearest
meteorological station. Data interpolated from these distant meteorological stations had a high degree of uncertainty.

The image below compares the data obtained for the site location from three data sources. There is a significant discrepancy between
them. A robust solar resource assessment would compare the data sources, discuss their uncertainty and select the data most likely to
represent the long-term resource at the site location. An improved resource assessment could be carried out by purchasing commercially
available satellite-derived data for the site location.

Where there is significant uncertainty in the data sources (or in the case of large-capacity plants), a short-term data monitoring campaign
may be considered. Short-term monitoring (ideally up to one year in duration) may be used to calibrate long-term satellite-derived data
and increase the confidence in the long-term energy yield prediction.

Table 6: Losses in a PV Power Plant
Loss                                                                                       Description
Air pollution                The solar resource can be reduced significantly in some locations due to air pollution from industry and agriculture.
                             Air pollution reduces solar irradiance incident on the module and thereby reduces power output. This is more
                             significant in urban and peri-urban locations, particularly in more recently industrialised nations.
Soiling                      Losses due to soiling (dust and bird droppings) depend on the environmental conditions, rainfall frequency, and cleaning
                             strategy as defined in the O&M contract. This loss can be relatively large compared to other loss factors. It has the
                             potential to reach up to 15 percenta annually and potentially higher in deserts, but is usually less than 4 percent unless
                             there is unusually high soiling or problems from snow settling on the modules for long periods of time. The soiling loss
                             may be expected to be lower for modules at a high tilt angle as inclined modules will benefit more from the natural
                             cleaning effect of rainwater. Tracking systems typically record similar soiling losses as fixed systems. As this loss can
                             have an important impact on the PR, it is recommended that an expert is consulted to quantify the soiling loss.
Shading                      Shading losses occur due to mountains or buildings on the far horizon, mutual shading between rows of modules
                             and near shading due to trees, buildings, pylons or overhead cabling. To model near-shading losses accurately, it
                             is recommended that a 3D representation of the plant and shading obstacles are generated within the modelling
                             software. This loss can potentially be quite large, thus it is important that the plant is modelled accurately.
Electrical shading           The effect of partial shadings on electrical production of the PV plant is non-linear and is modelled through
                             partitioning of the strings of modules. Modules installed in landscape configuration for an orientation towards the
                             equator will typically experience less electrical shading losses than modules installed in portrait configuration due to
                             the connection of diodes. Similarly, some types of thin-film technology are less impacted than crystalline PV modules.
                             Electrical shading effects can typically be set within the modelling software. This will be quantified differently
                             depending on module configuration, chosen technology and the system type (i.e., tracking or fixed).
Incident angle               The incidence angle loss accounts for radiation reflected from the front glass when the light striking it is not
                             perpendicular. For tilted PV modules, these losses may be expected to be larger than the losses experienced with dual
                             axis tracking systems, for example.
Low irradiance               The conversion efficiency of a PV module generally reduces at low light intensities. This causes a loss in the output of
                             a module compared with the Standard Test Conditions (STC) (1,000W/m2). This “low irradiance loss” depends on the
                             characteristics of the module and the intensity of the incident radiation. Most module manufacturers will be able to
                             provide information on their module low irradiance losses. However, where possible, it is preferable to obtain such
                             data from independent testing institutes.
Module temperature           The characteristics of a PV module are determined at standard temperature conditions of 25˚C. For every degree rise
                             in Celsius temperature above this standard, crystalline silicon modules reduce in efficiency, generally by around 0.5
                             percent. In high ambient temperatures under strong irradiance, module temperatures can rise appreciably. Wind can
                             provide some cooling effect, which can also be modelled.
Module quality               Most PV modules do not exactly match the manufacturer’s nominal specifications. Modules are sold with a nominal
                             peak power and a guarantee of actual power within a given tolerance range. The module quality loss quantifies the
                             impact on the energy yield due to divergences in actual module characteristics from the specifications. Typically,
                             the module output power at STC is greater than the nominal power specified in the datasheets. As such, a positive
                             quality factor can be applied to the energy yield.
Module mismatch              Losses due to "mismatch" are related to the fact that the real modules in a string do not all rigorously present the
                             same current/voltage profiles; there is a statistical variation between them which gives rise to a power loss. This loss
                             is directly related to the modules’ power tolerance.
Degradation                  The performance of a PV module decreases with time (see Section 3.3.5). If no independent testing has been
                             conducted on the modules being used, then a generic degradation rate depending on the module technology may
                             be assumed. Alternatively, a maximum degradation rate that conforms to the module performance warranty may be
                             considered as a conservative estimate.
Inverter performance         Inverters convert current from DC into AC with an efficiency that varies with inverter load. Manufacturers are usually
                             able to provide an inverter’s efficiency profile for low, medium and high voltages; entering these into the modelling
                             software will provide more accurate inverter losses.
MPP tracking                 The inverters are constantly seeking the maximum power point (MPP) of the array by shifting inverter voltage to the
                             MPP voltage. Different inverters do this with varying efficiency.
                                                                                                                                                          (Continued)

 Table 6: Losses in a PV Power Plant (Continued)
 Loss                                                                                          Description
 Curtailment of                Yield losses can occur due to high winds enforcing the stow mode of tracking systems so that the PV modules are not
 tracking                      optimally orientated.
 Transformer                   Transformer losses are usually quantified in terms of iron and resistive/inductive losses, which can be calculated
 performance                   based on the transformer’s no-load and full-load losses.
 DC cable losses               Electrical resistance in the cable between the modules and the input terminals of the inverter give rise to ohmic
                               losses (I²R).b These losses increase with temperature. If the cable is correctly sized, this loss should be less than
                               3 percent annually.
 AC cable losses               AC cable losses are the ohmic losses in the AC cabling. This includes all cables post inverter up to the metering point.
                               These losses are typically smaller than DC cable losses and are usually smaller for systems that use central inverters.
 Auxiliary power               Power may be required for electrical equipment within the plant. This may include security systems, tracking
                               motors, monitoring equipment and lighting. Plants with string inverter configurations will typically experience
                               smaller auxiliary losses than central inverter configurations. It is usually recommended to meter this auxiliary power
                               requirement separately. Furthermore, care should be taken as to how to quantify both daytime and nighttime
                               auxiliary losses.
 Downtime                      Downtime is a period when the plant does not generate due to failure. The downtime periods will depend on the
                               quality of the plant components, design, environmental conditions, diagnostic response time, and repair response
                               time.
 Grid availability and         The ability of a PV power plant to export power is dependent on the availability of the distribution or transmission
 disruption                    network. The owner of the PV plant relies on the distribution network operator to maintain service at high levels of
                               availability. Unless detailed information is available, this loss is typically based on an assumption that the local grid
                               will not be operational for a given number of hours/days in any one year, and that it will occur during periods of
                               average production.
 Grid compliance loss          Excessive loading of local transmission or distribution network equipment such as overhead lines or power
                               transformers may lead to grid instability. In this case, the voltage and frequency of the grid may fall outside the
                               operational limits of the inverters and plant downtime may result. In less developed regional networks, the risk of
                               downtime caused by grid instability can have serious impacts on project economics.
 b Ohmic Loss is the voltage drop across the cell during passage of current due to the internal resistance of the cell.

 Box 3: Energy Yield Prediction Case Study in India

 The developer of a 5MW plant in Tamil Nadu, India, required a solar energy yield prediction to confirm project feasibility and assess likely
 revenues. In this instance, the developer was either not aware of or did not consider a number of additional losses and did not calculate
 a long-term yield prediction over the life of the project with uncertainty analysis. Both of these would have been essential for potential
 project financiers.

 The developer sourced global horizontal irradiation data for the site location. Commercially available software was used to simulate the
 complex interactions of temperature and irradiance impacting the energy yield. This software took the plant specifications as input and
 modelled the output in hourly time steps for a typical year. Losses and gains were calculated within the software. These included:
      Gain due to tilting the module at 10°.
      AC losses. Reflection losses (3.3 percent).
      Losses due to a lower module efficiency at low irradiance levels (4.2 percent).
      Losses due to temperatures above 25°C (6 percent).
      Soiling losses (1.1 percent).
      Losses due to modules deviating from their nominal power (3.3 percent).
      Mismatch losses (2.2 percent).
      DC Ohmic losses (1.8 percent).
      Inverter losses (3.6 percent).

 The software gave an annual sum of electrical energy expected at the inverter output in the first year of operation. Although this is a useful
 indicative figure, an improved energy yield prediction would also consider:
      Inter-row shading losses (by setting up a 3D model).
      Horizon shading, if any.
      Near shading from nearby obstructions, including poles, control rooms and switch yard equipment.
      Downtime and grid availability.
      Degradation of the modules and plant components over the lifetime of the plant.

 This analysis modelled energy yield for one year, however lifetime analysis is typically required. In order to clearly show the expected output
 during the design life of the plant and assess the confidence in the energy yield predictions, it is necessary to analyse the level of certainty in
 the data and processes used for this analysis, including:
      Level of accuracy of solar resource data used.
      Reliability/accuracy of modelling process.
      Inter-annual variation of the solar resource.

 The energy yield prediction for the 5MW plant was provided as a first-year P50 value (the yield that will be exceeded with 50 percent
 probability in the first year), excluding degradation. An investor will usually look for a higher level of confidence in the energy yield

        utility-scale PV power plant in a specific location may include
        constraints due to a low solar resource, low grid capacity
        or insufficient area to install modules. However, a low solar
        resource could be offset by high local financial incentives that
        make a project viable. A similar balancing act applies to the other
        constraints. A Geographical Information System (GIS) mapping
        tool can be used to assist the site selection process by assessing
        multiple constraints and determining the total area of suitable
        land available for solar PV project development.

        The checklist at the end of the chapter lists the basic requirements
        and procedures necessary to assist developers with the site
        selection process.


        6.2	 SITE SELECTION CRITERIA

        Selecting a suitable site is a crucial component of developing
        a viable solar PV project. There are no clear-cut rules for site
        selection. Viable projects have been developed in locations that
        may initially seem unlikely, such as steep mountain slopes, within
        wind farms and on waste disposal sites. In general, the process
        of site selection must consider the constraints and the impact the
        site will have on the cost of the electricity generated. The main
        constraints that need to be assessed include:

          •	 Solar resource.

          •	 Available area.

          •	 Local climate.

          •	 Topography.

          •	 Land use.

          •	 Local regulations/land use policy or zoning.

        process that requires considerable technical knowledge and
                                                                                    general rules of thumb. But

                                                                                    specifics of project locations—
        order to achieve the optimum balance between performance and
        cost. This section highlights some of the key issues that need to           such as irradiation conditions,
        be considered when designing a solar PV power plant.                        temperature, sun angles and
                                                                                    shading—should be taken into
        For most large solar PV plants, reducing the levelised cost of
        electricity (LCOE) is the most important design criteria. Every             account in order to achieve
        aspect of the electrical system (and of the project as a whole)             the optimum balance between
        should be scrutinised and optimised. The potential economic                 annual energy yield and cost.
        gains from such an analysis are much larger than the cost of
        carrying it out.

        It is important to strike a balance between cost savings
        and quality. Engineering decisions should be "careful" and
        "informed" decisions. Otherwise, design made with a view to
        reduce costs in the present could lead to increased future costs
        and lost revenue due to high maintenance requirements and low
        performance.

        The performance of a solar PV power plant can be optimised
        by reducing the system losses. Reducing the total loss increases
        the annual energy yield and hence the revenue, though in some
        cases it may increase the cost of the plant. In addition, efforts to
        reduce one type of loss may conflict with efforts to reduce losses
        of a different type. It is the skill of the plant designer to make
        compromises that result in a plant with a high performance at a
        reasonable cost.

        For plant design, there are some general rules of thumb. But
        specifics of project locations—such as irradiation conditions,
        temperature, sun angles and shading—should be taken into
        account in order to achieve the optimum balance between annual
        energy yield and cost.

Criterion                                                                                 Description
Levelised cost of           The aim is to keep the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) at a minimum. When choosing between high-efficiency/
electricity (LCOE)a         high-cost modules and low-efficiency/low-cost modules, the cost and availability of land and plant components
                            will have an impact. High-efficiency modules require significantly less land, cabling and support structures per MWp
                            installed than low-efficiency modules.
Quality                     When choosing between module technologies such as mono-crystalline silicon (mono-c-Si), multi-crystalline silicon
                            (multi-c-Si), and thin-film amorphous silicon (a-Si), it should be realised that each technology has examples of high
                            quality and low quality products from different manufacturers.
PV module                   Modules tested under a specific set of conditions of irradiance, temperature and voltage, with a specific inverter, may
performance                 perform very differently under alternative conditions with a different inverter. Independent laboratories such as PV
                            Evolution Labs b (PVEL) and TÜV Rheinland c can test PV modules according to a matrix of operational conditions under
                            a wide range of environmental conditions in line with IEC 61853-1.
Power tolerance             The nominal power of a module is provided with a tolerance. Most crystalline modules are rated with a positive
                            tolerance (typically 0/+3 percent to 0/±5 percent), while some crystalline, CdTe and CIGS modules may be given with
                            a ±5 percent tolerance. Some manufacturers routinely provide modules at the lower end of the tolerance, while others
                            provide modules that achieve their nominal power or above (positive tolerance). For a large plant, the impact of the
                            module power tolerance on the overall energy yield can have a significant effect.
Flash tests                 When ordering a large number of modules, it may be recommended to have a sample of modules independently flash
                            tested from an accredited laboratory (such as Fraunhofer institute d or PI Berlin e) to confirm the tolerance. Additional
                            acceptance tests such as electroluminescence tests may also be performed.
Temperature                 The value of the power change with temperature will be an important consideration for modules installed in hot
coefficient for power       climates. Cooling by wind can positively affect plant performance in this respect.
Degradation                 The degradation properties and long-term stability of modules should be ascertained. PV module manufacturers,
                            independent testing institutes and technical consultants are sources of good information with regards to the potential
                            induced degradation (PID), long-term degradation and, for crystalline modules, light-induced degradation (LID).
Bypass diodes               The position and number of the bypass diodes affect how the module performs under partial shading. The orientation
                            of the PV modules on the support structure (portrait or landscape) can affect the inter-row shading losses (see also
                            Section 5.3).
Warranty terms              The manufacturers’ warranty period is useful for distinguishing between modules, but care should be taken with the
                            power warranty. It is recommended that a detailed technical and legal review of warranty terms be conducted.
Suitability for unusual     Frameless modules may be more suitable for locations that experience snow, as snow tends to slide off these modules
site conditions             more easily. Modules located close to the coast should be certified for salt mist corrosion as described in Section 6.3.3.
Spectral response of        Different technologies have a differing spectral response and so will be better suited for use in certain locations,
the semiconductor           depending on the local light conditions. Some technologies show an improved response in low light levels compared to
                            other modules.
Maximum system              When sizing strings with modules with a high Open Circuit Voltage (Voc), it should be verified that for extreme ambient
voltage                     temperature conditions (up to 60° and down to -10°), the maximum system voltage (1,000V) will not be exceeded.
Other                       Other parameters important for selection of modules include cost ($/Wp) and the expected operational life.

 Table 10: Inverter Selection Criteria
 Criterion                                                                                      Description
 Project capacity                  The plant capacity influences the inverter connection concept. Central inverters are commonly used in
                                   megawatt-scale solar PV plants. Inverters are discussed more fully in Section 3.5.
 Performance                       High efficiency inverters should be sought. The additional yield often more than compensates for the higher
                                   initial cost. Consideration must also be given to the fact that efficiency changes according to design parameters,
                                   including DC input voltage and load.
 Maximum Power Point               A wide inverter MPP range facilitates design flexibility.
 (MPP) voltage range
 3-phase or single phase           The choice will be subject to project size. Large capacity projects will require 3-phase inverters. National electrical
 output                            regulations may set limits on the maximum power difference between the phases.
 Incentive scheme                  Banding of financial incentive mechanisms may have an influence on the choice of inverter. For example, FiT
                                   schemes might be tiered for different plant sizes, which may, in turn, influence the optimum inverter capacity.
 Module technology                 The compatibility of thin-film modules with transformerless inverters should be confirmed with manufacturers.
 National and international        A transformer inverter must be used if galvanic isolation is required between the DC and AC sides of the inverter.
 regulations
 Power quality/grid code           Power quality and grid code requirements are country-dependent. It is not possible to provide universally
 compliance                        applicable guidelines. The national regulations and standards should be consulted when selecting an inverter and
                                   designing a solar PV power plant.

                                   National grid codes may specify requirements for:
                                   •	 Frequency limitation.
                                   •	 Voltage limitation.
                                   •	 Reactive power control capability—over-sizing inverters slightly may be required.
                                   •	 Harmonic distortion limitation—to reduce the harmonic content of the inverter’s AC power output.
                                   •	 Fault ride through capability.
 Product reliability               High inverter reliability ensures low downtime and maintenance and repair costs. If available, inverter mean time
                                   between failures, figures and track record should be assessed.
 Mismatch                          If modules of different specifications or different orientation and tilt angles are to be used, then string or multi-
                                   string inverters with multiple MPP trackers may be recommended in order to minimise mismatch losses.a This
                                   may be especially relevant for rooftop applications where the orientation and tilt angle is often dictated by the
                                   properties of the roof space.
 Maintainability and               Access constraints for PV plants in remote locations may influence the choice of inverter manufacturer: a
 serviceability                    manufacturer with a strong in-country presence may be able to provide better technical support. For PV plants in
                                   remote areas, string inverters offer ease of maintenance benefits.
 System availability               If a fault arises with a string inverter, only a small proportion of the plant output is lost (i.e., 25kW). Spare inverters
                                   can be kept locally and replaced by a suitably-trained electrician. With central inverters, a larger proportion of the
                                   plant output will be lost until a replacement is obtained (e.g., 750kW).
 Modularity                        Ease of expanding the system capacity and flexibility of design should be considered when selecting inverters.
 Shading conditions                String or multi-string inverters with multiple MPP trackers may be the preferred choice for sites that suffer from
                                   partial shading.
 Installation location             Outdoor/indoor placement and site ambient conditions influence the IP rating and cooling requirements. Either
                                   forced ventilation or air-conditioning will usually be required for indoor inverters.
 Monitoring / recording /          Plant monitoring, data logging and control requirements define a set of criteria that must be taken into account
 telemetry                         when choosing an inverter.
 a	 Each PV string with a given tilt and orientation will have its own unique output characteristics and therefore needs to be "tracked" separately to maximize yield. An
    efficient design requires that only identically oriented sub-arrays are allocated to a single maximum power point tracker.

Export Cable

In India, projects are typically required to be commissioned within 12 months from the date of execution of the PPA. This is intended to
allow ample time for planning and executing the export cable works. However, there have been a number of projects in India where
commissioning has been delayed because power evacuation could not commence due to unavailability of the export line. This can be
avoided by planning the export line routes and signing right-of-way agreements with the property owners at an early stage of project
development.

Grid Stability

The smooth operation of a grid-connected solar PV power plant is dependent on the voltage and frequency of the grid staying within
certain limits that are acceptable for the inverter. Grid instability may result from varying loads applied on the utility substation. With no
historical load data available at the local substation level for the majority of Indian utilities, grid availability can become a significant risk to
project development. In order to understand the risk, it is recommended that the developer conduct a thorough grid quality evaluation by
physically verifying the voltage and frequency variations for a minimum period of two weeks during the project planning phase.

In addition to monitoring, measures during the component selection phase can also mitigate the risk of grid instability causing downtime.
These measures include:

1) Selecting inverters that have a dynamic grid support function with low voltage, high voltage and frequency ride-through features.

2) Using plant transformers equipped with on-load tap changers.

Reactive Power Compensation

While few of the Indian states force project developers to maintain a power factor close to unity, there are other states that charge for
the reactive power consumed by the PV plant. Although most modern central inverters can be made to operate at leading power factor,
supplying the reactive power during hours of high irradiance, there may be a need to include a capacitor bank to compensate reactive
power during periods of low irradiance. It is advisable to select inverters that can compensate the reactive power.

 Box 5: Example of Poor Design

 It is far cheaper and quicker to rectify design faults prior to construction than during or after construction. Therefore, it is vital to apply
 suitable technical expertise to every aspect of plant design. Should the developer not have all the required expertise in-house, then a
 suitably experienced technical advisor should be engaged. Regardless of the level of expertise in-house, it is good practice to carry out a
 full, independent technical due diligence of the design before construction commences. This will be an essential requirement if financing is
 being sought.

 As an example, consider the faults that independent technical consultants identified with a 5MWp project that had been constructed in
 India in 2010:

     •	 Foundations:
        The foundations for the supporting structures consisted of concrete pillars, cast in situ, with steel reinforcing bars and threaded
          steel rods for fixing the support structure base plates. This type of foundation is not recommended due to the inherent difficulty in
          accurately aligning numerous small foundations.
        Mild steel was specified for the fixing rods. As mild steel is prone to corrosion, stainless steel rods would have been preferable.

     •	 Support structures:
        The support structures were under-engineered for the loads they were intended to carry. In particular, the purlins sagged
          significantly under the load of the modules. Support structures should be designed to withstand wind loading and other dynamic
          loads over the life of the project. Extensive remedial work was required to retrofit additional supporting struts.
        The supporting structure was not adjustable because no mechanism was included to allow adjustment in the positioning of modules.
          The combination of the choice of foundation type and choice of support structure led to extensive problems when it came to aligning
          the solar modules to the required tilt angle.

     •	 Electrical:
       String diodes were used for circuit protection instead of string fuses/MCBs. Current best practice is to use string fuses/MCBs, as
         diodes cause a voltage drop and power loss, as well as a higher failure rate.
       No protection was provided at the combiner boxes. This meant that for any fault occurring between the array and the DC
         distribution boards (DBs), the DBs would trip, taking far more of the plant offline than necessary.
       No-load break switches were included on the combiner boxes before the DBs. This meant it was not possible to isolate individual
         strings for installation or maintenance.

 The design faults listed above cover a wide range of issues. However, the underlying lesson is that it is vital to apply suitable technical
 expertise on every aspect of the plant design through in-house or acquired technical expertise. Independent technical due diligence should
 be carried out on the design prior to construction.

        The following sections describe permitting and licensing
        requirements.


        8.2	 PERMITTING AND LICENSING REQUIREMENTS

        Permitting and licensing procedures vary depending on plant
        location and size. For small PV installations, permitting regimes
        are often simplified and obtained at a local authority level.
        However large-scale plants can have more extensive requirements
        that are determined at a national or regional level. The key
        permits, licences and agreements typically required for renewable
        energy projects include:

          •	 Land lease agreement.

          •	 Planning/land use consents.

          •	 Building permits.

100 A Project Developer’s Guide to Utility-scale Solar Photovoltaic Power Plants
Box 6: Permits, Licensing and Environmental Considerations

There are many types of permits required for a multi-megawatt solar PV power plant, which in accordance with country requirements
will vary in terms of purpose of requirements. Shown below is an indicative, non-exhaustive list of the key permits that were required
to be obtained in South Africa for a ground-mounted fixed-tilt PV plant. These permits apply specifically to the case study; permitting
requirements differ across other regions of South Africa and especially in different countries. Some of the case study’s permits were
issued with condition-requirements including time limits for commencing and rules for the processes of construction, operation and
decommissioning. The majority of these permits were applied for and in place prior to the start of construction, as is deemed best practice.

An Environmental Impact Report was compiled for the project under the required Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Regulations and
Natural Environmental Management Act. The EIA process was used to inform the preferred layout for the project in order to reduce the
potential for significant environmental impacts. Elements of the project design thus reduced the potential for impact on water resources
and included a visual buffer zone from nearby roads, railway lines and farms, in addition to avoiding sensitive areas/heritage resources.
Mitigation measures proposed to further reduce impacts during construction included:
     Pre-construction ecological checks.
   	
     Rehabilitation/re-vegetation of areas damaged by construction activities.
   	
     Implementation of soil conservation measures, such as stockpiling topsoil or gravel for remediation of disturbed areas.
   	
     Bunding of fuel, oil and used storage areas.
   	

Implementing these mitigation measures ensured that the only significant impacts likely to arise from the project would be those
associated with visual impacts.

International lending standards (Equator Principles and IFC Performance Standards) were also applicable, such that this project required an
appropriate degree of environmental and social assessment to meet these standards. A principle finding of the environmental assessment
work carried out to meet these international criteria was a recommendation for a bird breeding survey in order to assess fully the project
impacts upon the population of a species of conservation concern. This recommendation was identified following the completion of the
EIA, highlighting the importance of the consideration of Equator Principles and IFC Performance Standards alongside EIA preparation from
the very outset of the project. This will help ensure reaching a standard that is acceptable to lenders.

The following table provides the key permits that were required in order to develop the project.

                                 to a guaranteed level. Failure to comply with any of these
                                 requirements will usually result in the contractor having to pay
                                 financial compensation to the owner in the form of liquidated

                                 highlighting the basic requirements that a developer may wish to
                                 consider during the EPC contracting process.

                                 9.2	 BASIC FEATURES OF AN EPC CONTRACT

                                 The EPC contract for any project-financed solar PV power plant
                                 will typically be held between a project company (the owner) and
                                 the EPC contractor (the contractor).

                                 It is common practice to use a standard form of contract
                                 (sometimes referred to as a “boilerplate contract”) as a template
                                 and basis for the EPC contract. The following standard form of

        Key project management activities that will need to be
        carried out, either by the developer or a contractor, include
        interface management, project planning and task sequencing,
        management of quality, management of environmental aspects,
        and health and safety.

        There are a number of common issues that may arise during
        the construction phase. Most of these can be avoided through
        appropriate design, monitoring, quality control and testing onsite.

        Provided at the end of the chapter is a checklist of both basic
        required procedures and recommended actions, which should
        assist developers during the construction phase of a solar PV
        project.

        The following sections summarise critical considerations for the
        construction of a megawatt-scale solar PV power plant.


        10.2	 CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT

        The management of the construction phase of a solar PV project
        should be in accordance with general construction-project
        management best practices.

        The approach to construction project management for a solar PV
        power plant will depend on many factors. Of these, one of the
        most important is the project contract strategy, whether multi-
        contract or full turnkey EPC. The vast majority of megawatt-
        scale solar PV power plants are built using a fully-wrapped EPC
        approach.

    multi-contract approach.

 •	 An EPC contract is nearly always more expensive than
    an equivalent, well-managed multi-contract approach.

 •	 A multi-contract approach gives the developer greater
    control over the final plant configuration.

 •	 EPC avoids interface issues between contractors and
    shifts risks to the EPC contractor instead of the project
    developer.

Regardless of the contract strategy selected, there are a
number of key activities that will need to be carried out,
either by the developer or a contractor. These activities are
described in the following sections.
                                                                  Image courtesy of First Solar

  Box 7: Construction Lessons Learned

  The construction of a solar PV power plant is a relatively straightforward process. However, there are common mistakes that EPC contractors
  can easily avoid with correct planning and training procedures. Examples of such mistakes are itemised below.

  PV Module Installation

  Common issues during installation of modules include:
         Inadequate number of clamps used, or incorrect positioning resulting in reduced module load-bearing capacity.
       	
         Modified or wrong type of clamp used as a result of inadequate spacing between modules, compromising integrity of the fixing and
       	
         leading to invalidation of warranty.
         Module clamp bolts initially hand tightened and then tightened to the correct torque after a period of delay. There is a risk that strong
       	
         winds can blow the modules off the structure if the time lag between assembly and tightening is too long. Tightening of bolts should
         occur shortly after assembly.
         Over-tightening of clamp bolts with power tools leading to deformation of clamp and damage to corrosion-resistant coatings.
       	
         Damaged or scratched modules due to poor installation technique. The front and rear surface of modules should not come into
       	
         contact with support structures.

  Mounting Structure

  Common issues in relation to the construction of the mounting structures include:
       Dissimilar metals not isolated from one another leading to material incompatibility issues in the form of galvanic corrosion. Isolation
         solutions such as neoprene pads can be used.
         Deformation of mounting structure during piling process, compromising galvanisation or structure.
       	
         Piles installed out of position, leading to piles and steel sections being forced or bent out of alignment in order to line up with
       	
         framing sections.

  Civil Works

  Common issues in relation to the construction of the mounting structures include:
         Poor dust suppression leading to excessive accumulation of dirt on modules.
       	
         Missing or delayed perimeter fencing leading to animal or human intrusion. A fence should be installed prior to construction
       	
         commencing.
         Drains becoming blocked with silt during earth works.
       	
         Inadequate surface water run-off management during construction, leading to delays caused by flooded and waterlogged sites.
       	
         Exceeding load-bearing capacity of exiting public tracks, causing damage.
       	
         Lack of levelling works after installation.
       	

  Equipment Enclosures / Housings

  The integrity of the controlled environment within equipment enclosures/housings can be compromised if not installed correctly. Examples of
  common issues include:
         Unused glands not sealed or replaced with dummies.
       	
         Unsealed cable conduits.
       	
         Damaged or missing gaskets on entrance doors.
       	
         Unsealed cable trenches leading into inverter housings.
       	
         Water ingress due to any/all of the above, leading to a humid atmosphere causing corrosion damage to electrical components.
       	

  Environmental Monitoring

  Incorrect positioning of the environmental monitoring equipment can lead to inaccuracies during performance assessment. The most common
  reasons for these inaccuracies include:
         Pyranometers not positioned at the same tilt angle as the modules.
       	
         Pyranometers subject to shading, causing reporting of elevated performance ratio (PR) calculations.
       	

                                                                                                                                          (continued)

Cable Management

The most common issues in relation to cable management include:
     Cables crossing over sharp edges of mounting structures without suitable padding.
   	
     Insufficient labelling of cable ends.
   	
     Long unsupported spans due to an insufficient number of cable ties.
   	
     Cable bending radius too tight.
   	
     Inadequate cable burial depths.
   	
     Inadequate conduit cable protection.
   	

Signage

Basic information requirements which are often omitted include:
     General health and safety information including emergency contact numbers.
   	
     Lack of warning labels on electrical components.
   	
     Lack of warning labels on perimeter fence.
   	
     Support structure identification labelling.
   	

Spare Parts
     The permanent storage area for spare components is often not available when such components are delivered to the site, leading to
   	
     damage from poor temporary storage conditions.




                                                                                                                     10: Construction    123

An operation and maintenance

PV plant during its operating life.      maximise both energy yield and the plant’s useful life. Optimal
                                         operations must strike a balance between maximising production
                                         and minimising cost.

                                         The presence of an operation and maintenance (O&M) contract
                                         is crucial to define the parameters for the operation and
                                         maintenance of a project during its life. If an O&M contractor is
                                         being employed to undertake these tasks, it is important that all
                                         requirements relating to preventative and corrective maintenance,
                                         performance monitoring and reporting are clearly stated in the
                                         contract along with the frequency with which these activities
                                         need to be conducted. This allows contractor performance to be
                                         measured and if necessary challenged.

                                         It is normal for an O&M contractor to guarantee plant
                                         performance during the contract term. Typically this is achieved
                                         through the presence of an availability- or performance-ratio
                                         warranty covering the entire plant. In the event of the contractor
                                         not honouring its obligations, resulting in the plant performing
                                         below the guaranteed value, the owner would be eligible to claim
                                         for compensation to cover lost revenues.

                                         The basic requirements for drafting an O&M contract for a Solar
                                         PV power plant are set out in a checklist at the end of the chapter.


                                         11.2	 O&M CONTRACTS

                                         It is common practice on solar PV projects that O&M is carried
                                         out by a principal contractor, who is responsible for all aspects of
                                         O&M, including any of the works performed by subcontractors
                                         that may be engaged to deliver specialist services, such as inverter
                                         servicing, ground-keeping, security or module cleaning.

11.3	 SCHEDULED/PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE

Appropriate scheduling and frequency of preventative
maintenance is dictated by a number of factors. These
include the technology selected, environmental conditions
of the site, warranty terms and seasonal variances.
Scheduled maintenance is generally carried out at
intervals planned in accordance with the manufacturer’s
                                                                                Figure 24: Module Cleaning Using Crane
recommendations, and as required by equipment
warranties. Scheduled maintenance that requires plant
shutdown should be conducted where possible during non-
peak production periods, such as early morning or evening.

Although scheduled maintenance will both maximise
production and prolong the life of the plant, it does
represent a cost to the project both in terms of expenses
incurred and lost revenue due to reduced power generation.
Therefore, the aim should be to seek the optimum balance
between the cost of scheduled maintenance and increased
yield over the life of the system.

Specific scheduled maintenance tasks are covered in the
following sections.

      Performance guarantees included to allow owner to claim
       liquidated damages (LDs) in the event of low availability
       or PR.

      Payments are made to the contractor in arrears to allow for
       deduction of any LDs over the corresponding period.

      LDs sized to be a genuine pre-estimate of losses likely to be
       incurred.

      Rules for spare parts management are clearly defined.
       Contractor is responsible for replenishing stock and

                                   available to bridge the gap between the costs of conventional
                                   power sources and solar PV power.

                                   It is important for developers to understand the conditions under
                                   which they may access support schemes and the requirements

                                   of the regulatory regime and the structure of the power market.
                                   Levels, types, and duration of support that developers can access
                                   will vary. Incentives are generally offered at the national level.

  Box 8: Thailand’s Feed-in Tariff (FiT) Policies

  The solar market in Thailand is currently driven by two key Feed-in Tariff (FiT) policies designed to help the country meet its ambitious
  targets for solar development by 2021.a
      1.	 Rooftop solar projects policy.b
      2.	 Ground-mounted solar projects policy.

  The rooftop FiT policy provides an incentive for developing rooftop and community ground-mounted solar systems, and is capped at an
  installed capacity of 200 MW. The FiT rate is scaled dependent on the project size. The FiT rates below are granted to projects that were
  fully commissioned before December 2013 and are valid for a 25-year operational period.

  For both the rooftop and ground-mounted FiT policies, the FiT rate can be considered relatively generous and project IRRs should be
  attractive to investors. The Thai government has periodically revised the FiT rates and current information on incentives for projects

140 A Project Developer’s Guide to Utility-scale Solar Photovoltaic Power Plants
  Box 9: South Africa’a REIPPP

  South Africa has in place policies and initiatives that are aimed at accelerating growth in the solar PV power sector, including REIPPP and
  the Eskom Standard Offer.

  REIPPP

  South Africa’s REIPPP is split into different bidding rounds. The allocated resources are shown below for Rounds 1 to 3. The decreasing trend
  in average PV bid price and the increase in local content is indicative of the policy’s success in incentivizing solar development, although it
  remains to be seen whether developers can truly sustain operation at such low prices.a

  Under Round 1 of the REIPPP, construction has commenced on 18 large-scale solar PV projects with a combined installed capacity of 630
  MW. In Round 2, a total of nine projects with a combined capacity of 417 MW were awarded preferred bidder status and are currently under
  construction. An additional six projects with a capacity of 435 MW have achieved preferred bidder status in Round 3 and are approaching
  financial close. In 2013, nearly all of South Africa’s solar PV power market consisted of large ground-mounted systems and it is expected
  that this market will remain strong.

  However, historically there have been a number of delays with the bidding process. In September 2012, the Department of Energy
  announced delays to Round 3 of the REIPPP due mainly to difficulty in progressing the first round projects to financial close. The need to
  focus on financial closure for projects selected during the first two bidding rounds had a knock-on effect.b

  In 2013, the government delayed an announcement on a final list of preferred bidders in the third round of its national renewable energy
  programme. This was finally completed in November 2013, more than 12 mosnths later than expected.

  The Department of Energy is now in the process of finalising the financial close protocol for the Round 3 preferred bidders.

  Box 10: India’s Evolving Regulatory Support Mechanisms

  India has implemented a number of different regulatory support schemes including FiTs, renewable obligations and reverse auctions.

  The National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) of India sets Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) targets for each state in India.
  This provides a minimum level of the total power that electricity distribution companies need to purchase from renewable energy sources.
  Although this is not directly related to solar projects, it requires the states to incentivise the development of renewable energy projects.
  Among the states, Gujarat has offered the highest FiT, at 12 Rupees ($0.20), resulting in an installed capacity of 916.4 MW as of 31 March
  2014. Below is a short summary of the FiT rates by state awarded by individual state-based solar energy policies.a

  The national Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM),c also referred to as the National Solar Mission, was launched in January 2010
  to specifically incentivise the development of solar power as part of the broader national renewable energy targets. JNNSM set a target of
  20GW of grid-connected solar power by 2022. It aims to reduce the cost of solar energy-to-grid parity by supporting large-scale deployment
  (through a reverse auction scheme in Phases 1 and 2), long-term policy, research and development and domestic production. The develop-
  ment road map of JNNSM is divided into three phases, presented below.

                                                                 Roof-Top Plan
                         Phase 1 (2010–2013)                           1,100MW                  67% of the projects commissioned.
                         Phase 2 (2013–2017)                         10,000MW                   750 MW projects selected after bidding.
                        Phase 3 (2017–2022)                          20,000MW                   Details not yet announced.


  In the first phase, selected developers were awarded a PPA with the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) through a reverse
  auction scheme. The average tariff was approximately US$0.15/kWh, representing a 43 percent decrease on the benchmark tariff approved
  by the CERC. It is noted that only 67 percent of Phase 1 projects were commissioned as of March 2014. There are a variety of reasons for this,
  including delays to financial close, land acquisition and grid connection issues. Reverse auction was used in Phase 2d through which 10,000
  MW are expected to be awarded.

                                      PV power plants are rare because PV costs typically result
                                      in power that is more expensive than other energy sources
                                      and excessively risky to financiers. Also, regulations (support
                                      mechanisms) promoting PV technology and other renewables
                                      are usually based on some form of long-term PPA. However, as
                                      PV costs continue to decline, merchant PV plants may become
                                      more common. For example, in 2014, IFC and other partners
                                      financed the first merchant solar PV project in Chile, the La
                                      Huayca II project, with no subsidy and no PPA. Merchant plants,
                                      depending on how the power sector is structured, may be able to
                                      sell both energy and capacity (the latter in a day-ahead market).
                                      Including La Huayca, as of early 2015, IFC had financed four
                                      large-scale PV projects in Chile, of which three were merchant
                                      projects and only one had a PPA. These projects are described
                                      briefly in Table 19.

                                      This section looks at the key elements of the typical PPA for
                                      large-scale PV projects, and describes how small solar power
                                      plants (distributed generation) can utilize similar contractual
                                      arrangements.

                                      PPAs are legally binding agreements between a power seller
                                      and power purchaser (off-taker). The party that is selling the
                                      power is, in most cases, the owner of the solar PV plant. The
                                      purchaser of power could be a power company, power trading
                                      company, or individual consumer, depending on the structure

Box 11: Distributed Generation and Commercial PPAs

As a modular technology, solar power can easily be scaled up to meet a range of power needs. While this publication focuses on financing
and business models suited to utility-scale solar power projects, informally defined as 5 MW or larger, much of the technical guidance it
contains also applies to smaller projects (see Annex 4 on Rooftop PV Systems). As the price of solar power has fallen, there are increasingly
interesting opportunities for distributed generation of solar power in emerging economies. This is especially true in economies where the
price of power is high and/or reliability of the grid is low, and solar power can effectively compete with diesel generators and other forms of
back-up power generation.

Distributed generation refers to power generation that occurs close to the load or end user, and involves plants with typically small generat-
ing capacity located on the off-taker’s land or nearby. In a traditional utility model, power generation takes place at a large central plant and
is transmitted through the grid and sold by a distribution company to end-users. In contrast, distributed generation projects sell power di-
rectly to the end user and can exist independent of the grid, although sometimes power is delivered to the end user (e.g., off-taker) over the
grid, in a process known as “wheeling.” Depending on local regulations, wheeling may or may not require paying a fee to the grid company.

Distributed generation projects still require purchasing agreements, sometimes called “Commercial PPAs,” which obligate the customer to
purchase power for a period of time suitable to pay off project debt and earn a suitable return. There are a variety of business models, the
potential of which depends on the particular power market and its regulations. Commercial PPAs may govern the sale of electricity to a
range of customers, from individual residencesa to large-scale industrial facilities. However, a very large project selling to a single buyer is
more commonly referred to as “captive power”.b In many emerging economies, the credit worthiness of individual commercial or industrial
customers may be superior to that of the utility, and customers may be willing to pay a tariff higher than that offered by the utility to ensure
they have an adequate and high-quality supply of power.

An opportunity sometimes exists to sell excess power from distributed generation to the grid. This model of distributed generation rep-
resents over half the recent growth of solar energy in Germanyc and between a quarter and half of recent solar PV growth in the United
States.d In Germany, this growth was driven by a national feed-in tariff (FiT) for distributed solar. In the U.S., distributed solar has been largely
driven by regulations that allow net-metering.e Also referred to as “behind the meter” pricing, net metering allows the customer to sell elec-
tricity back to the grid, typically at the same rate as a utility tariff, and pay only for the net amount of grid power consumed.

Several distributed generation sites may collectively function similarly to a utility-scale project if they have significant exposure to the utility
alongside private buyers as a key off-taker. The terms of sale to the grid from distributed PV projects are often standardized, with a pre-
determined price and a requirement for the utility to purchase all electricity from projects under a certain installed capacity.

The amount of distributed solar power in emerging markets at present is very small, but there is significant potential for growth. While the
models that proved successful in the United States and Europe may be taken as starting points, new business models are likely to develop in
response to unique local conditions. In many emerging markets, insulation levels for solar power are high (increasing capacity factors), and
utility efficiency and reliability are low—factors that improve the competitive position for distributed solar power. Improvements in energy
storage will drive further innovation. While still in its infancy, the potential for distributed solar power (and other distributed renewable
energy) presents interesting opportunities. Thailand, the Philippines, and Pakistan have recently introduced legislation permitting distributed
generation.

                                    involve two key components:

                                     •	 Equity from one or more investors, injected directly or via
                                        the project developer into a special purpose vehicle (SPV or
                                        “project company”).

                                     •	 Non- or limited-recourse debt from one or more lenders,
                                        secured against the assets owned by the SPV.

                                    This section provides an overview of the financing process,
                                    focusing on aspects that are unique to solar PV projects.74

                                    considerations of project finance (requirements, timing, and
                                    structure), and the due diligence process (risks and ways to
                                    mitigate them). Issues related to project costs and revenues, as
                                    well as solar PV-specific aspects of the project’s financial model
                                    are discussed in Section 15.

  IFC InfraVentures­ —the IFC Global Infrastructure Project Development Fund—helps develop public-private partnerships and private projects
  for infrastructure in developing countries. It provides early-stage risk capital and actively participates in the project development phase to
  create private infrastructure projects that are commercially viable and able to more rapidly achieve financial close.
  Through IFC InfraVentures, the World Bank Group has set aside a $150 million fund, from which IFC can draw to initiate project development
  in the infrastructure sector. IFC serves as a co-developer and provides expertise in critical areas, while partially funding the project’s
  development.
  IFC InfraVentures is an additional resource for addressing the limited availability of funds and for providing experienced professionals dedi-
  cated to infrastructure project development, both of which are key constraints to private participation in infrastructure projects in frontier
  markets.

  Box 13: IFC Financing of Solar Energy

  IFC is the largest global development institution focused on the private sector, bringing its AAA credit rating to 108 offices around the globe.
  As of May 2015 IFC has made over 350 investments in power in more than 65 countries, and is often at the forefront of markets opening to
  private participation.
  The majority of IFC’s current portfolio in power generation is in renewable energy (76 percent in fiscal year 2014, and renewable energy
  consistently makes up two-thirds of IFCs portfolio), including more than $500 million in solar power projects. IFC has invested in more than
  55 solar projects that generate more than 1,397 MW, with key transactions in Thailand, the Philippines, India, China, Jordan, Mexico, South
  Africa, Honduras, and Chile.
  IFC provides a range of financing solutions, including debt and equity at the project or corporate level. IFC can offer long maturities tailored
  to meet project needs, flexible amortization schedules, fixed or floating interest rates, and lending in many local currencies. IFC also helps
  to mobilize additional sources of financing through syndications as well as third-party capital managed by the IFC Asset Management
  Corporation (AMC).
  IFC works with experienced and best-in-class new developers who demonstrate commitment to project success through their equity
  contribution to the project.

  Box 14: Environmental, Social, and Governance Issues in Financing

  While solar PV projects are often considered to be inherently socially beneficial based on their potential to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG)
  emissions and local pollution, it is still important to consider the full scope of environmental, social, and governance impacts of any project. In
  addition, lenders often require compliance with social and environmental standards, such as the Equator Principles (EPs)a before agreeing to
  finance a project (see Section 8 for further details on EP requirements).
  International development finance institutions, such as the IFC, have their own social and environmental standards (IFC Performance
  Standards directly inform the Equator Principles). Government bodies may aim to mitigate the adverse impact of developments through
  permitting requirements. Developers should strive to follow best practices to mitigate environmental and social risks even when this is not
  required or enforced by national law.


  a	 The Equator Principles (EPs) are a set of 10 environmental and social principles adopted by the Equator Principle Financing Institutions (EPFIs). These principles
     are criteria that must be met by projects seeking financing from these institutions. EPs ensure that the projects that receive finance are developed in a manner
     that is socially responsible and reflect sound environmental management practices. The full set of principles can be accessed through the following link: http://

  IFC Risk Management Tools

  The International Finance Corporation (IFC) provides financing in nearly 60 local currencies, at both fixed and variable rates, which allows a
  company with local currency revenues (such as tariff payments under a PPA) to obtain long-term financing denominated in that currency,
  reducing foreign exchange risks. IFC also provides interest rate and currency swaps and credit enhancement structures that enable
  clients to borrow in local currency from other sources. IFC is one of the few multilateral development banks prepared to extend long-
  maturity risk management products to clients in emerging markets. More information can be found at http://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/

  World Bank Guarantees

  World Bank Guarantees are risk mitigation instruments intended to diversify the financing options of the governments and government-owned
  entities through credit enhancement. They protect the beneficiaries against the risk of default by sovereign or sub-sovereign governments
  with respect to their obligations arising from contracts, law, or regulations. There is a wide range of risks that could be covered by World Bank
  Guarantees, such as off-take/payment risk, regulatory risk, change in law, political force majeure (including war, revolution, and expropriation),
  transferability & convertibility of foreign exchange, etc. The World Bank Guarantee can be issued in foreign or local currency.

  World Bank Guarantees are only given for projects that are strongly supported by the government, which is embodied in a counter-
  guarantee from the government to the World Bank. They are anchored on the strong day-to-day relationship of the World Bank with the
  government, through policy dialogue, loans, grants, technical assistance, etc., which enables the World Bank to pre-empt an event that
  could result in the materialization of a risk. In the event that a claim is made under a guarantee, the World Bank does not require an arbitral
  award or any other formal decision from a court of law as a condition to pay. Guarantees are paid promptly upon recognition by the parties
  that amounts are owed and are undisputed. More information on the World Bank’s Private Risk Guarantee group can be found at
  http://web.worldbank.org/external/default/main?menuPK=64143540&pagePK=64143532&piPK=64143559&theSitePK=3985219.

  Political Risk Insurance with MIGA

  The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) provides political risk insurance to private sector investors on a commercial basis through
  insurance products, with the exception of the Non Honoring of Sovereign Financial Obligations (NHSFO), which operates as a guarantee.
  These risks include currency inconvertibility and transfer restriction, expropriation, war, terrorism, civil disturbance, breach of contract,
  and non-honoring of financial obligations. MIGA’s objective is to compensate investors in the event of a loss. The baseline relationship is
  between MIGA and the private investor, with no government involvement. The government is required to provide a no-objection clause for
  MIGA participation but does not provide specific support to MIGA or the project. Claims under MIGA insurance, including NHSFO, are paid once
  the claimant has obtained the respective award from a judicial court or an arbitration tribunal, which usually takes several months or years
  depending on the jurisdiction. More information on MIGA can be found at http://www.miga.org/investmentguarantees/index.cfm.

Box 16: Refinancing, Solar Securitization and the Rise of the Yieldco

Since 2013 there has been rapid development in securitisation of solar and other power generation assets. Securitisation is the process
of pooling multiple projects and packaging the portfolio as a tradable asset (a security). This can either be in the form of a project-
backed bond or a “yieldco.” A yieldco is an exchange-listed entity designed to hold cash-generating assets, generally with stable expected
dividends. While securitisation is common for other assets, such as mortgages and automobile financing, and for infrastructure in countries
like Australia and Canada, it is a relatively new tool for solar energy projects.

Solar projects are well suited for securitisation because they typically have predictable long-term revenues secured through a PPA and have
mitigated many project uncertainties and risks through their project finance structure. These stable, low-risk cash flows are desirable for
institutional investors, such as pension fund managers.

Once a project is operational, developers often want to exit the project so that they can focus on deploying their capital and creating
value with new projects. Securitization allows developers to create their own vehicle to hold projects so that they can sell the project to
the securitized vehicle and exit their investment. While this can also be achieved through sale to another buyer, by creating their own
securitized pool of assets, developers are able to retain more value. Securitisation is also attractive for large pools of smaller projects, as it
can reduce the transaction costs of selling these projects individually.

While these relatively sophisticated vehicles are still in nascent stages in developed markets, they may also become relevant in emerging
markets. For example, SunEdison’s Terraform announced they will launch a second emerging markets-focused yieldco in mid-2015.

                                    Capital expenditure (capex) and O&M costs are site-specific and
                                    should be assessed as part of the prefeasibility and feasibility
                                    studies. Initially, these costs are established as evidence-based
                                    assumptions, and they will only be finalized with the signing
                                    of the EPC contract. Nevertheless, they are essential inputs for
                                    the financial model. For illustrative purposes, some indicative
                                    estimates for solar PV project costs (both capex and operating

                                             can vary depending upon the perceived quality of the supplier. An average module price of $720k/MWp has
                                             been assumed based upon collected third-party data. Thin-film modules such as Cadmium Telluride are
                                             available at an 8 percent to 10 percent discount to this price. However, this economic benefit is often lost
                                             due to increased land and balance of system cost requirements.

15.4.4	 CARRYING OUT A FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

A financial model’s output determines not only the
structure of the project’s financing, but also the
project company’s maximum supportable level of
debt. Performing financial modelling requires a highly
specialized skillset. In order to build a financial model, a
developer will require the services of a financial analyst
with advanced knowledge of Excel spread sheets, or
alternatively, someone with experience building models
in one of the several other sophisticated software tools
designed for this purpose.

Yet the ability to construct the mechanical aspects (e.g.,
the functions/calculations) of the financial model is itself
not the only or necessarily even the most important key
requirement.

It is critical that the developer understand the importance
of reliable inputs to the financial model, as well as
the significance of the model’s key outputs from an
investor’s perspective. The developer should have a
clear understanding of the probable degree of variation
for different inputs, as well as the cause(s) of variation.
Furthermore, a firm grasp of the terms used by investors
to describe key outputs from the financial model will
be necessary for the developer to enter into informed
negotiations on project financing.

Financial Modelling Requirements/Procedures Checklist

The checklist below is for developers, and sets out basic financial
modelling requirements and procedures that investors in solar
PV projects typically expect.

   Independently verify key assumptions in the financial
    model, including EPC and O&M costs, energy yield, off-take
    pricing, and terms of financing.

   Prepare financial model covering full lifecycle of the
    project.	

   Include stress tested results and scenario analysis for debt
    service for potential lenders and equity investors.

   Clearly present cash flow analysis and relevant indicators,
    such as IRR, DSCR, CFADS, LLCR, MRA calculations, etc.

   Provide a sensitivity analysis for key inputs on capex, opex,
    and financing costs.

         The following images have been taken from megawatt-scale,
         ground-mounted solar PV power plants constructed in the U.K.,
         India and South Africa. The images show a variety of common
         construction mistakes and issues that may arise under a variety
         of environmental conditions during operation. They are intended
         to illustrate topics that have been discussed throughout the
         guidebook and inform readers so that the mistakes may be
         avoided.

1                                             Soiled pyranometers give conservative solar irradiation measurements,
                                              which can lead to over-estimated performance ratio measurements.
                                              Pyranometers must be well-maintained, kept calibrated and placed in
                                              locations where they will not be shaded by nearby obstacles.




2                                             Soiled modules will result in lower performance and can cause
                                              unexpected growth of vegetation, with associated shading loss.




3                                             Heavy rainfall, including monsoons, can restrict vehicular access and
                                              delay construction. Effective planning will avoid construction during
                                              heavy rain or incorporate mitigating measures such as sealing access
                                              routes before construction begins.




4                                             Poor waste management can lead to environmental damage and
                                              represents a risk to health and safety.

EPC Contract Heads of Terms                                       2
   This Annex provides a summary of the key technical terms to be
   discussed between a potential EPC contractor (the “Contractor”)
   and the potential owner (“Owner”) of a megawatt-scale, ground-
   mounted solar photovoltaic (PV) power plant. It is expected
   that the term sheet that follows will be used to guide discussions
   between the Owner and the Contractor. Throughout the term
   sheet, [x] is used to indicate a value that needs to be determined
   through an agreement between the Contractor and the Owner,
   and in some cases an indicative value [such as 10 percent] is
   provided in place of [x]. Once all the details have been agreed
   upon, lawyers will typically use the term sheet to draft the full
   contract.

   It is assumed that all plant equipment will be sourced by the
   EPC contractor and that the EPC contract has separately been
   provided with “Employer’s Requirements” documentation,
   which specifies minimum technical requirements for the plant
   construction, including technical specifications for modules,
   inverters, transformers, cables, civil works, and procedures for
   safety, quality control, monitoring, and security.

 Ground keeping              The Contractor shall perform ground keeping and vegetation control at the plant such that plant performance
                             is not impeded through shading. Ground keeping shall be conducted in a manner and frequency that adheres to
                             permit and lease obligations and component manufacturer’s recommendations.
 Security                    The Contractor will be responsible for plant security and surveillance provision during the contract term. This will
                             be provided on a 24 hours/day, 365 days/year basis.
 Spare Parts Management      The Owner will make available to the Contractor an inventory of spare parts for use in performing the Services
                             (The spare parts will have been previously provided by the EPC Contractor.)
                             The Contractor is responsible for providing all other material, equipment, tools and consumables necessary to
                             perform the Services.
                             The Contractor shall ensure that all Spare Parts are labelled and maintained in a log when received into or
                             withdrawn from the inventory. Contractor shall, at its own cost, replace any Spare Parts that it uses with new parts
                             of equal or better quality and warranty levels.
                             All Spare Parts remain the sole property of the Owner and shall be returned to Owner at the end of the Contract term.
                             All Spare Parts shall be kept by the Contractor on the Site or within an acceptable distance for prompt
                             transportation to the Site.
                             The Contractor warrants to Owner that each installation or repair performed shall be free of defects in material or
                             workmanship for a period of 12 months following the date of its installation or repair
 Availability Guarantee      The Contractor guarantees that the Availability Level of the Plant shall be at least [99] % (Guaranteed Availability
                             Level) during each operational year of the Contract Term starting at the Commencement date. Plant availability
                             shall be calculated at the [inverter] level in accordance with the methodology contained within the O&M Contract.
                             Measured Plant Availability shall be compared with the Guaranteed Availability Level. If Measured Plant Availability
                             falls below the Guaranteed Availability Level, liquidated damages shall be payable to the Owner in accordance with
                             the O&M Contract.

                             methodology contained in the O&M Contract.
                             Measured Plant PR shall be compared with the Guaranteed PR value. If Measured Plant PR falls below the
                             Guaranteed Performance Ratio, liquidated damages shall be payable to the Owner in accordance with the O&M
                             Contract.
 Liquidated Damages          If it is established that the plant is performing in deficit of the Guaranteed Availability Level and/or Guaranteed
                             Performance Ratio during the Contract terms, the Contractor shall pay to Owner liquidated damages by way
                             of compensation. Both parties agree that liquidated damages will be sized at a level that represents a genuine
                             pre-estimate of losses that may be anticipated from failure to achieve the Guaranteed Availability Level and/or
                             Guaranteed Performance Ratio.
 Limit of Liability          The Contractor’s liability under the Contract is limited to the Contract price.
 Health and Safety           The Contractor shall be responsible for the safety of all Contractor and Subcontractor personnel at the Site. The
                             Contractor shall be responsible for ensuring the safety of all maintenance activities performed at the Site.

                                 A4.1	 ROOFTOP SOLAR PV SYSTEMS OVERVIEW

Rooftop solar applications       A4.1.1	 INTRODUCTION
are a substantial part of the    Rooftop solar PV systems can significantly vary in size from
deployment of PV technology      kW-scale systems on domestic properties to multi-megawatt-
and are expected to grow         scale installations on non-domestic buildings such as commercial
                                 warehouses, factories or office parks. The modular nature of
substantially in the future.
                                 solar PV modules makes them highly adaptable for use on roof
                                 spaces. Benefits of roof-mounted solar PV system for a developer
                                 can include reduced land cost, the opportunity to offset
                                 electricity consumed on site and reduced connection cost due to
                                 close proximity to a connection point.

                                 From a public benefit perspective, rooftop solar PV technology
                                 is a source of distributed generation that is by its nature close
                                 to the source of load demand. It also reduces stress on use of
                                 scarce ground surface, especially in urban settings. With the
                                 benefits come additional challenges in the design, construction
                                 and operation. These additional complexities are explored in the
                                 following sections.

                                 While this guidebook makes mention of aspects relating to small-
                                 scale residential systems, the main focus is on larger-scale systems
                                 for non-domestic rooftops. The guide focus is on the grid-
                                 connected sector and therefore does not address the additional
                                 challenges of off-grid systems, for which battery or other energy
                                 storage systems are required.

                                 A4.1.2.1	Small-scale Residential Systems
                                 A typical small (kW scale) residential system might consist of a
                                 single string of PV modules connected to a single string inverter
                                 as illustrated in Figure 33. The grid connection for a residential
                                 system can often make use of existing infrastructure (for example
                                 the existing power box) at the building.

A4.2.1.1	Module Temperature Losses
Compared to a ground mount system, integrating a solar
PV system on a roof space can increase the temperature
of the PV modules, due to a reduction in wind cooling
and absorption of heat emitted by the rooftop surface
and other building surfaces. The range of temperature
loss corrections on solar PV plants could range from a
14 percent loss to a 2 percent gain, depending on the
climate, and therefore this consideration is significant. PV

Box 17: Lessons Learned from a 1 MWp Rooftop PV Array, India

As the market penetration of larger rooftop solar PV installations increases, the issues and differences between rooftop PV systems and
ground-mount systems become more apparent. The siting, physical integration, interconnection and installation of rooftop PV systems
all typically require more detailed field work, analysis, and planning compared to ground-mount systems. Several of the issues may be
categorised as follows:
     Siting to maximise generation.
   	
     Roof loading and method of attachment.
   	
   	Interconnection.
   	Construction requirements.
     Access and safety.
   	

Experience with rooftop arrays in India has yielded solutions to many of these issues.
Siting to Maximize Generation
      Location is often a trade-off as the roofs are not oriented optimally to the solar resource and adjacent structures can shade the array
    	
      for significant periods of the day. A detailed site visit and measurement of dimensions are required for input into a shading model for
      the yield analysis. Large periods of shading can significantly alter the economics by reducing yield. Shading models require effort and
      expertise, but can prevent underperforming installations. Beyond failing to meet profit goals, contractual obligations can come forth
      where the building owner may not be receiving the output that was warranted in the PPA. An instance was highlighted in a project
      where shading from a building structure shaded half the array for several months each year. While there was not an easy solution, the
      energy yield prediction could have identified this.
 Roof Loading and Method of Attachment
      The building structure design must be reviewed to ascertain its ability to accept the additional dead weight loads and potential lifting
    	
      loads of PV arrays during high winds. While there is typically a margin in the roof load capacity, one must consider the individual
      frames and various sheathing and membrane on which the array will rest. The choice to use a ballasted array versus a mechanically
      secured frame utilising penetrations avoided concerns of leakage and the need to seek approval for the attachment method from the
      architect and the roof membrane provider, thereby saving on cost and reducing risk.
Interconnection
      Building power and facility areas are often built with minimal future expansion in mind, and require codes for access and open space.
    	
      When a PV system must run power conductors via conduit and establish correct disconnects, metering and entrance into the main
      power panel, the job is often more difficult and requires preplanning and design. While one project had wall space for the correct PV
      system disconnects, there was no available space on the main panel and a larger panel had to be incorporated.
Construction Requirements
      Rooftop installations require clear and practiced planning for items such as:
    	
       Any required roof penetrations as the underlying substrate must be known.
    •	 	
       	 onduit runs to the power room and potential to interrupt fire blocks by the conduit installation, and assessing the run to not
    •	 C
       damage other conduits/services.
       An outage may be required in the building, and interrupt services.
    •	 	
       Precautions to protect the roof membrane and related structures.
    •	 	
       Access for cranes or material lift equipment, including a material storage plan during installation.
    •	 	
   Roof space was tight on one project and this made construction in a small area more difficult. Because the crane was only available
     for a short period of time, all of the modules were delivered onto the roof space at once. This became problematic as it left very limited
     room for assembly activities. While there may not have been an alternative, further planning would have been beneficial.
Safety
     Safety is paramount because working at height, working with live modules, and working with high voltages present multiple hazards.
   	
     As with the installation planning, safety is an integral part of any job and the various hazards must be inventoried, reviewed, and
   	
     discussed with all personal.
     With multiple workers on the roof, various staff were working concurrently on the DC array string wiring. This led to uncontrolled
   	
     voltage and current rises. Working practices had to be changed to reduce the electric shock risk.
