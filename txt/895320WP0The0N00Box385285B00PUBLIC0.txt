The Caribbean Knowledge Series is an occasional series that presents World Bank knowledge in an accessible format. It is meant to assist knowledge sharing across
the region and trigger policy dialogue on topics relevant for the Caribbean.

This note was prepared to support the participatory policy dialogue in the context of the Caribbean Growth Forum (CGF). The CGF is an initiative facilitated by the Compete
Caribbean Program, the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank and the Caribbean Development Bank, with the support of the Department for Foreign Affairs,
Trade and Development of Canada, the United Kingdom’s Agency for International Development, CARICOM Secretariat, the University of the West Indies, the European
Union and Caribbean Export. It aims to facilitate a multi-stakeholder dialogue to identify practical solutions for the growth challenge in the Caribbean. To learn more about

3 Under the Lomé and Cotonou agreements, Caribbean countries received unilateral preferential access to the EU for traditional agricultural exports. Similarly, the region has enjoyed 30 years of unilateral preferential access to the United States for
certain products under the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) and subsequently through the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA).
4 The gravity model predicts the level of exports between two economies, based on size, income level, distance, whether countries share a common border, whether they share a common language, and whether one was a colony of the other or they were
colonies of the same country. The analysis covers bilateral merchandise exports among 213 countries between 2005 and 2011, and tourism receipts (or arrivals) among 194 countries over the same period. Gravity models have been used extensively
in the literature on international trade (see literature reviews provided in Anderson & van Wincoop 2003, Feenstra 2004, and Baldwin & Taglioni 2006).

7 In fact, openness as a ratio of trade to GDP is high in the Caribbean, However, the tariffs (trade policy) as a tool of openness is still high in many Caribbean countries. It is important to note that while countries like Haiti and Jamaica have made
tremendous efforts in reducing their tariffs, tariffs remain high in some other Caribbean countries causing the average regional tariff to be high relative to that of other regions.
8 Successful Small Islands are defined in this study as Small Island Economies that gained market share in global trade over the last three decades.
