The Opportunity
Indian Cities Heritage: Unmatched Legacy




   Largest density and diversity
of heritage assets and streetscapes
 Vibrant living cultural practices
        and expressions

Rooted traditional economic base

   India’s heritage assets are unmatched in the world with 5,000 years of history,
   22 official and 1,000+ minor languages, around 200 million craftspersons, countless
   traditional skills, cultural practices and performing arts, 30 World Heritage Sites,
   and tens of thousands of monuments, historic areas and sacred sites spread over
   highly diverse natural and built landscapes.
In cities, this heritage is of three main types:

 Monuments     and buildings
These often iconic, “nationally important” tangible
assets are individual, isolated features of cities.
They are often already listed in heritage inventories
or designated and protected under heritage laws
established by the Archaeological Survey of India
and related agencies at the state level.


 Traditional neighborhoods, streetscapes,
  ghats and parks
These are the tangible locations in which iconic
monuments and buildings are located and which
gain meaning from the assets they contain.


 Practices and traditions
These intangible cultural actions—the evolving social
practices, traditions and skills transmitted from
generation to generation—give life to monuments,
historic areas, landscapes and properties.
India’s potential for poverty reduction and sustainable growth through the proper
stewardship of these heritage assets is vast, and conditions in the country are
already increasingly favorable:

   The decline of heritage assets
is becoming an engrained feature
   of India’s urbanization pattern,
    rather than its driving force.
The Program
Motivation
The Department of Economic Affairs,           It has been anchored by the Ministry of
Ministry of Finance, Government of India,     Urban Development (MoUD), and guided
requested the World Bank’s assistance in      by a Steering Committee, chaired by the
the design and implementation of a            Joint Secretary and Mission Director of
Demonstration Program on Inclusive            the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban
Heritage-based City Development in India.     Renew Mission (JnNURM), MoUD, and
The purpose of the Demonstration              comprised of the key ministries involved
Program was to contribute to filling the      in city planning and development as well
knowledge and application gap at a critical   as heritage conservation in India, namely
moment in India’s urbanization process.       the Ministries of Finance, Housing and
                                              Poverty Alleviation and Culture.
The Program was conceptualized by the
World Bank in consultation with the           CEPT University was competitively
Government of India and experts in 2011       selected as the implementing agency for
and implementation began in May 2012.         the Program.
Objectives
To provide national policy makers,
state governments, Urban Local
Bodies (ULBs) and sector
professionals in India with a
refined methodology, practical
guidelines, institutional
arrangements and financial and
management incentives that will
enable them to revisit their
development strategies in a way
that empowers cities to draw
inclusive and participatory
heritage-based city development
and investment plans.
Expected Impacts
 Enable cities to better
  manage urbanization and
  distribute its benefits by
  valuing and leveraging their
  existing heritage assets.

 Enhance the character, living
  standards and development
  effectiveness of cities.

 Unlock billions in funds
  earmarked for “urban
  renewal” investments, but
  not fully utilized due to low
  capacities at city level, and a
  lack of adequate approaches
  and tools.
The Approach
Process
The Program consists of two phases:

Phase 1, the pilot phase
(May 2012 – December 2013)
aimed to test and refine an inclusive
heritage-based approach to city
development planning in India’s
varying urban contexts, with a focus
on learning from pilot cities.

Phase 2, under preparation,
aims to expand the institutionalization
of the piloted policy approaches
and mechanisms through urban
development and poverty schemes,
especially at central and state levels.
Phase 1
Phase 1 of the Program, consisting of five core components, took a deductive
approach from the preparation of city-level heritage inventory to the
detailing of micro-level interventions in consultation with state and local
stakeholders.

Component 1 – Institutional Setup
The institutional setup entailed four main steps:
1. Governance arrangements for Inclusive Urban Revitalization
  Through institutional mapping, stakeholder analysis and consultations at national,
  state and city levels, and expert discussions, the Program supported the
  establishment of the governance arrangements for Inclusive Urban Revitalization.
  At the central level, the Program supported the establishment of an Inter-Ministerial
  Program Steering Committee, bringing together ministries involved in city planning
  and development as well as heritage conservation.

2. Technical criteria for pilot cities selection
  To inform learning and institutionalization of tested approaches, technical criteria
  were defined, including:
  i) % of the city’s population living in the heritage area; % of the city’s population
       living in slums
  ii) heritage relevance of the city
  iii) level of state government’s support to vision
  iv) city-level entrepreneurship
  v) socioeconomic status (poverty, stress)
  vi) JnNURM performance in the city
  vii) state government’s leadership.
3. Pilot Cities Selection
  Through the Program, a rapid appraisal of JnNURM 45 heritage cities was carried
  out; six cities shortlisted by Program Steering Committee. An initial profiling and
  technical rating of the shortlisted cities was prepared by the implementing agency
  and four cities were selected, including: Ajmer, Rajasthan (medium size city),
  Pushkar, Rajastan (small size city) Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh (metropolitan city),
  Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh (mega city). Pilot cities were also selected based on
  their geographic distribution and distinct sizes to ensure the Program captured
  India’s diverse urban context.


4. Heritage Cells at city level
  The selected ULBs were mobilized by the respective state Urban Development
  Departments to coordinate the Program activities. The Program provided city
  officials with hands-on support and knowledge sharing. They also received
  guidance from the Steering Committee, and advisory support from local experts,
  the World Bank, Cities Alliance and the implementing agency. Heritage Cells were
  established in Varanasi, Ajmer and Pushkar, and the existing Hyderabad Heritage
  Cell supported as the loci for Program implementation. The Heritage Cells
  operated under the chairmanship of the respective Municipal Commissioners, and
  guided by a City Heritage Committee comprising state and local officials,
  distinguished scholars, experts from the city and concerned residents.

Component 2 – State level Assessment
By assessing the existing urbanistic approach, financial mechanisms and
regulatory frameworks, Component 2 aimed to understand:

•   The role of heritage in city planning at
    the state level
•   The extent of collaboration between the
    state and city levels in decision making
    for city planning
•   Capacities of government and private
    sector organizations
•   Development and regulatory conflicts
•   Local resource mobilization, budgeting
    mechanisms and funding systems
•   Wealth distribution

            The state level assessment
            also served as a platform
         for a continuous dialogue and
          facilitated closer relationships
        between the cities and the states.

                                standards are required to be
                                   brought together for a

Component 3 – City profiling
The city profiling entailed three main steps:

1. Heritage Listing
   City-wide inventory, categorization and mapping of tangible and intangible
   heritage assets in each city, performed by Heritage Cells with technical support
   from the implementing agency.

2. Heritage Zone Mapping
   Mapping of heritage zones (areas containing a high density of heritage assets) and
   linkages between built heritage and surrounding community livelihoods.
   Assessment of any current heritage-based initiatives and/or funding.

3. Socioeconomic and services assessment
   Information gathered on cities’ morphology and existing land use practices;
   typology of neighborhoods; poverty geography; service delivery in heritage zones
   compared to the city level; economic clusters and employment; city and
   neighborhood aspirations; livelihoods, lifestyles and local stories; gentrification;
   and decision making processes and capacities.

Based on the state assessment and city profiling, the respective Heritage Cell conducted
participatory consultations, workshops and focus groups with scholars, experts and local
stakeholders to select potential heritage areas for the preparation of a demonstration
Detailed Project Report (DPR) or investment plan in the pilot city to test out the
approaches and tools promoted by the Program. Through a rapid appraisal,
demonstration areas in each city were selected according to their:

•   Land uses – Area that has a representative mixed land use, with cultural, commercial,
    and residential areas.

•   Socioeconomic status – Area with a highly diverse    socioeconomic group and
    poverty pockets.

•   Heritage at risk – Area with lower living standards and degraded heritage assets.

•   Heritage significance – Area that covers most of the city’s monuments and vernacular
    heritage as well as significant intangible assets.

Component 5 – Knowledge Management
Given the nature of the Program as an instrument for testing methodologies
and disseminating experiences, ongoing knowledge management was central
to Phase 1.

   At the central level, activities involved continuous knowledge support to the
    Steering Committee, and the initiation of a process of revision of the existing
    JnNURM guidelines to ensure more effective allocation of JnNURM funds and a
    more inclusive, area-based approach to urban revitalization, which better reflects
    the reality and capacities of cities.


   At the state level, good practices were shared with the states and a stronger
    dialogue between the states and the pilot cities was facilitated.


   At the city level, expert teams were posted in each pilot city and assigned to assist
    city authorities and the respective Heritage Cells, and city-to-city peer learning
    through study tours and exposure visits was promoted across India.

              "Benaras is older than history,
              older than tradition, older
              even than legend and looks
              twice as old as all of them put
              together"
                                  Mark Twain
Varanasi or Benaras, Kashi, Avimukta,
Rudravasa and Mahashmashana, is one of the oldest living
cities in the world. According to the Vamana Purana, the
Varuna and the Assi rivers originated from the body of the
primordial person at the beginning of time itself. The land
lying between them is believed to be ‘Varanasi’, the holiest
of all pilgrimages. The word ‘Kashi’ originates from the
word ‘Kas’ which means to shine. Steeped in tradition and
mythological legacy, Varanasi is the ‘original ground’
created by Shiva and Parvati, upon which they stood at the
beginning of time.

Varanasi is located in the middle of the Ganga plains.
Historically it was part of an important water trade route
that connected Patliputra (Patna) to Taxila (presently in
Pakistan). Varanasi became the microcosm of India’s
traditional classic culture: a city glorified by myth and
sanctified by religion. From time immemorial, its temples,
shrines and ashrams have attracted uncounted
worshippers searching for the rays of the dawn
shimmering across the Ganges, the temples and shrines
along its banks stirring hymns and mantras, along with the
fragrance of incense filling the air and the refreshing dip in
the holy waters gently splashing at its ghats.
                                             Archaeological evidence suggests that the city was populated from
                                             800 BCE to 1000 BCE. Most of the remaining monuments,
                                             networks of residences, market streets, and secular buildings were
                                             constructed in the 18th and 19th centuries.


                                             The 82 ghats and palaces along its seven kilometers of riverbank
                                             were constructed by most princely states of India. Varanasi’s
                                             intangible heritage and rich tapestry of music, arts, crafts and
                                             education, have given life and meaning to this material heritage for
                                             centuries. The products of its artful silk weaving have also been
                                             cherished as collectors’ items worldwide.


                                             In its 3000 years of existence, Varanasi has experienced periods of
                                             growth, prosperity and change. In the last forty years, however, it
                                             has witnessed unprecedented urban growth pressures, which are
                                             irreversibly threatening the city’s heritage and sociocultural
                                             landscape in a scale and intensity never faced before.

     City Morphology
 Varanasi neighborhoods represent different periods in
 history. Presently, the city can be divided into three areas:
 •    The Old City located along the ghats, within 200m from
      the riverbank, is characterized by high densities and
      narrow streets lined with ancient houses on both sides.
      An area of high religious significance, the old city retains
      most of Varanasi’s heritage and is the center of its
      cultural activities. It also has a high concentration of
      commercial activities, both formal and informal.
 •    The Central area bounds the Old City up to the National
      Highway 2 at the western and northern edge of the city.
      It is characterized by lower density and less congested
      streets with relatively wider roads as compared to the
      Old City. Development pressure is high and is likely to
      impose additional stress on the already strained
      existing infrastructure and Old City.
 •    The Peripheral area along the Trans Varuna has
      experienced a different development pattern (sprawl)
      than the rest of the city, driven by the construction of a
      new ring road in the north part of the city, and of
      connections to the national highway in the south.
                                                                     Municipal Corporation

Population Profile and Poverty

   The city population has undergone significant growth, with a seven-fold increase
    in the last century (from 157 people/ha in 2001 to 179 people/ha in 2011). It is
    ranked 32nd amongst India’s 53 large cities. Its literacy rate was 79.39% in 2011.


   Varanasi has 228 slums spread all over the city, housing about 57,055 households
    or 453,222 people (37.69% of the total population). The slums cover
    approximately 1372.6 ha (about 17%) of the city. The average density in slum
    areas is 330 per ha, with 10 people per household as compared to the city ’s 7.3
    average. Income of a slum household is about Rs.100-150 per day.


   In 2011, the Varanasi work participation rate was 28.7%, a low rate compared to
    both state (32.5%) and national (39.9%) levels as per the census. Micro, small and
    household businesses account for 73.52% of workers, with 10.69% engaged in
    manufacturing and 6.80% in the tertiary sector. Spinning and weaving is the oldest
    and most important economic activity in Varanasi and employs more than half of
    the workers, followed by textiles.
 City-wide Heritage Mapping
The city-wide mapping of Varanasi’s tangible

improve the living
conditions and assets of
the local community
living within their
immediate boundaries,
but also of those in the                         Trilochan-Gola-Nandeshwar Ghat
surrounding areas who
depend on the kunds for
their livelihood. Their
revitalizaton is also
expected to benefit the
city more widely, by
increasing its green
intake and recreational
areas in the short-term,                          Pushkar Kund
while recovering
important
environmental functions

Pushkar Kund is a replica of the religious Pushkar site
in Rajasthan. The Kund has a Brahma temple similar to
the one in Pushkar. It attracts thousands of pilgrims
and visitors as it is believed to bestow equivalent
benefits as the original site.

The local community and pilgrims also take holy baths
(Kartik Snana) during Kartik Poornima in the Kund

AJMER
DEMONSTRATION DPR
Ajmer            genuinely fuses Hindu, Jain and Islamic heritages.
One of the oldest cities of the state of Rajasthan, Ajmer was
founded in the 7th century A.D. by Ajayrajsingh Chauhan. The city.
was named after King Ajayraj, originally Ajaymeru, meaning ‘the
one surrounded by mountains’. The Chauhan dynasty ruled Ajmer
until the beginning of the 12th century, despite several attacks
from Turkic Muslims. The permanent foundation of Islam in India
was laid by Khawaja Mouinuddin Chishti in the city in 1192 A.D.
Ajmer remained subject to Delhi sultanate until 1365 when it was
captured by the Mewar ruler. In 1509, the city became a source of
contention between the maharajas of Mewar and Marwar, and was
ultimately conquered by the Marwar ruler in 1532. Ajmer was
dominated by the Mughal Emperor Akbar in 1559, who ruled the
city until 1770, when it was ceded to the Marathas. From then up
to 1818, Ajmer was alternatively seized by the Mewar and the
Marwar maharajas.

The Hill Fort of Taragarh and the Anasagar Lake are the only
remains of the Chauhan dynasty. It took 15 years for Emperor
Akbar to build the mosque of Adhai-Din-Ka-Jhonpra, whose carved
stones were later engraved with Islamic calligraphy from the
Quran. The Chisti Shrine Dargah Sharif is one of India’s most
important Islamic pilgrimage sites. The Dargah Sharif, Akbar Fort
and Badshahi Building and the remaining old havelis are witnesses
of the supremacy of the Mughal culture in the region.
City and Population Profile
                        Ajmer is a typical example of an Indian city
                        with a dense inner historic area, with over
                        50,000 persons/km2 as compared to the
                        overall city area density of 5,750 persons/km2.

(45%) followed by transportation (18%)
and commercial use (12%).
  City–wide Heritage Mapping
The city-wide mapping of Ajmer’s
tangible and intangible heritage
was conducted in about seven
months. As in Varanasi, it involved
the state and local authorities,
residents and experts.




Desk reviews, workshops, one-to-
one interviews and reconnaissance
visits to the city inner area and
other significant areas (e.g., Lake)
were conducted.

PUSHKAR
DEMONSTRATION DPR
Pushkar Sarovar                            was created at the place
where a lotus flower fell from the hands of Lord Brahma and
touched the ground. The name Pushkar derives from the word
“Pushp” meaning flower and “Kar” meaning hand. According to
Hindu mythology, it is believed that three Pushkars were formed
when three lotus petals dropped from Lord Brahma’s hand:
Kanishta/VridhaPushkar, Madhya Pushkar and JyesthaPushkar.
KanishtaPushkar is located 3km from the town’s inner area.
Madhya Pushkar is situated on the right side of the
KanishtaPushkar. Pushkar Lake is JyesthaPushkar. The lake is 2
hectares in size and has 52 ghats.

Sanchiattest inscriptions show its existence in the late 2nd century
B.C. Apart from a few silver coins from the Gupta period, there is
not a great deal of information about that era. During the
invasions of Huns, Pushkar was destroyed and forgotten. In the
12th century, the town was conquered by Chauhan, who rebuilt it
to its glory. Most of the Hindu temples were in turn destroyed by
the ruler. With the formation of the Rajput coalition under the
leadership of Mewar, Pushkar again flourished. For Rajput leaders,
visits to Pushkar and subsequent donations to the town were not
only motivated by religious beliefs, but also enhanced their status.
Pushkar received special attention from courts of Amber, Bundi,
Bikaner and Jaisalmer. The Maharaja Man Singh of Amber
constructed the Raj Ghat and Man Temple in Pushkar, while
RanaPratap renovated the Varah Temple. The Marathas also
constructed several buildings in the 18th century. Its world
famous cattle fair was first initiated during the British rule.
Town and Population Profiles

                                            Pushkar has 15 wards. Its population density
                                            is unevenly distributed with the highest in the
                                            inner area (923 people/ hectare) as compared
                                            to the overall town area density of 45 people
                                            per hectare.

Rescue of the Town’s Cultural Landscape
The adaptive use of abandoned areas
is proposed to showcase local artists’
paintings, sculptures, and traditional
and contemporary Rajasthani
performing arts, as well as to raise
awareness of the town’s value as a
Heritage Town and its many assets
and their intrinsic relationship with
the residents’ way of life and the
town’s economy.

HYDERABAD
DEMONSTRATION DPR
Hyderabad                      was built in 1589 by
Mohammed Quli Qutub Shah of the Qutub Shahi dynasty
in the banks of the Musi River eight kilometers east
of Golconda Fort. The Purana Pul "old bridge” was built
to easily connect Golconda to the new city. The city was
built to accommodate Golconda’s growing population.
“Char Minar” was built in 1591 as a ceremonial gateway
marking the foundation of Hyderabad, a new Millennial
City, and as a point of reference for its planning grid pattern
with precincts and iconic monuments.


During the Qutb Shahi reign, Hyderabad
became a vibrant diamond trade center
and Golconda one of the world’s
leading markets for pearls, steel and
printed fabric. All of its seven sultans
were patrons of learning and
contributed to the development of
Indo-Persian and Indo-Islamic
literature and culture in the city. Its
“baghs” (gardens) and comfortable
climate attracted visitors from far away,
adding vibrancy to the city.
  Hyderabad's independence fell in 1687 when Mughal
  prince Aurangzeb conquered Golconda. With the
  emancipation of the Mughal Empire after Aurangzeb's
  death in 1707, the Mughal-appointed governors of
  Hyderabad gained more autonomy from Delhi.

  In 1724,Chin Qulich Khan Asaf Jah I Mir Qamaruddin
  Siddiqi, who was granted the title Nizam-ul-Mulk (governor
  of the country), defeated a rival official and established
  control over Hyderabad, inaugurating the Asaf Jahi dynasty
  that would rule the city until India's independence from
  Great Britain. The seven Nizams reestablished Hyderabad
  both culturally and economically. Hyderabad became the
  formal capital of the kingdom and Golconda was
  abandoned.



                                                                                                  Aurangzeb sieged and

The Program team is currently                  Policy strengthening and knowledge
discussing Phase 2 of the Demonstration         management for inner city
Program with the central Indian                 management, exposure visits, and
authorities.                                    sensitization for public officials and city
                                                managers at state and regional levels,
                                                etc.
Phase 2 aims to expand and
institutionalize the piloted approaches
and mechanisms through urban                   Broad-based capacity support for states
development and poverty schemes,                to review regulatory and institutional
especially at central and state levels.         frameworks for city heritage
                                                management, develop selection criteria
                                                for pilot projects, etc.
Similarly to Phase 1, the second phase
would be implemented in partnership
with key expert agencies in India and          Technical and advisory assistance for
abroad and government institutions              cities to establish Heritage Committees,
across India.                                   prepare DPRs, perform technical
                                                oversight of DPR preparation, etc.
It would be executed in direct support to
the implementation of JnNURM and
other key government schemes in
principle through three main set of
activities:
The Demonstration Program on Inclusive Heritage-based City Development in India was
possible due to the vision and collaborative efforts of many individuals and agencies from
India and around the world.

The Program was originally requested by Mr. Venu Rajamony (former Joint Secretary,
Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Government of India), and endorsed
by Mr. Roberto Zagha (former Country Director for India, World Bank). It was designed
under the overall guidance of Mr. Nilaya Mitash (Joint Secretary, Department of Economic
Affairs, Ministry of Finance), Ms. Nisha Singh (former Joint Secretary, Ministry of Urban
Development), Mr. Vijay Shankar Madan (former Joint Secretary, Ministry of Culture),
and Ms. Aruna Sundararajan (former Joint Secretary, Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty
Alleviation), Government of India. During its conceptualization, the team consulted with
cultural officials and experts from the Archeological Survey of India, INTACH, UNESCO
New Delhi, and other reputable scholars, heritage conservation and urban professionals
across India.


The Program was implemented under the guidance of Ms. Nisha Singh (Program Chair,), Mr.
Onno Ruhl (Country Director for India, World Bank) and Ms. Maria Correia (Sector Manager,
Social Development, South Asia, World Bank). It was also implemented under the World Bank
and UNESCO Memorandum of Understanding and the expert guidance of Mr. Francesco
Bandarin (Assistant Director General for Culture, UNESCO). Its Pilot Phase 1 was financed by
the Governments of India and Italy under the Multi Donor Trust Fund for Cultural Heritage
and Sustainable Tourism managed by the World Bank. Knowledge sharing activities were co-
financed by the National Institute of Urban Affairs – NIUA, Ministry of Urban Development.
Its implementation would not have been possible and in such short period of time without
the leadership, enthusiasm and contributions of many government officials, experts,
businesses, community members and residents from each pilot city and respective states.
The Program team expresses its sincere gratitude to each and all of them.
