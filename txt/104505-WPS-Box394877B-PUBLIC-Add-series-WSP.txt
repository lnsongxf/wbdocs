    rapid urbanization has been a short-

   Box 4.1: Examples of the Importance of Demand
   In the Philippines, the domestic private sector expressed its preference for densely populated areas that have
   growth potential. For example, Balibago Waterworks System stated that the criteria used to select areas to
   serve were (a) the availability of a water source, (b) the number of households and potential customers, (c) the
   growth potential, and (d) if the area were small, the potential to cluster with neighboring towns. The entrance of
   a well-known business venture (such as a Jollibee fast food franchise or a shopping mall) into a rural growth
   center is often used as an indicator that the area is growing and that the population’s economic conditions are
   improving.

   In Uganda, private operators expressed a desire to expand their business to neighboring unserved areas with
   evident demand, and the need to allow for these types of expansions or clusterings of small towns.

   In Bangladesh, the existence of alternative sources of water, such as shallow wells, has deterred private
   operators from providing services. In most areas, households have private shallow wells, while industrial or
   commercial establishments have deep wells. Neither type of customer provides the demand needed to justify
   piped supplies.

    Private Sector Provision of Water Supply and Sanitation Services in Rural Areas and Small Towns   Potential for Private Sector Involvement




       Box 4.2: Drivers for Private Participation in the WSS
       The Bangladesh Water Supply Program Project is a donor-led program to introduce private participation in
       WSS service provision in the small towns of Bangladesh. It includes a financing component as well as some
       capacity building.

       In Ghana until 2000, PPPs were unknown in small towns and rural areas. The World Bank funded a pilot project
       to demonstrate the benefits of private sector involvement in the provision of water supply services. The project
       started in four small towns with populations of between 5,000 and 25,000 and attracted small local water
       enterprises.

       In Cambodia, the government public utilities could not cope with the demand for water services. There are only
       12 public utilities serving mostly urban areas, while in rural areas small private operators were filling in the gap
       and meeting the demand for water supply services.

       Malawi implemented a community-managed rural piped scheme that had gained a lot of recognition. However,
       due to poor maintenance of the network, the program deteriorated over time, and reached a point where only
       half of the taps were functioning. The government then decided to adopt a new approach of establishing Water
       User Associations to contract the maintenance of the piped network to private firms. As a first step, the User
       Associations are established and private operators are hired with core operational staff. Subsequently, business
       plans and operator performance agreements are prepared.

     Private Sector Provision of Water Supply and Sanitation Services in Rural Areas and Small Towns                   Potential for Private Sector Involvement




      Table 4.2: Examples of Private Sector Experience in Providing WSS Services
      Country                Form of private participation in the WSS in small towns
      Bangladesh             In Bangladesh, there are very few private sector WSS operators. Schemes run by nongovernmental
                             organizations (NGOs) and community-based organizations (CBOs) are common. These are regarded as
                             “private” because they are not public. The profit-making private sector is not common for the WSS sector.
                             The private sector success story relates to the marketing of sanitation services by local entrepreneurs. They
                             build latrines and provide other sanitation services. The local availability of sanitation materials and kits also
                             facilitates self-provision of improved sanitation by households.
      Colombia               Colombia has been committed to private provision of water services in urban areas since 1990. A flexible legal
                             form—the public services enterprise—makes it possible for municipalities to establish commercialized water
                             utilities that attract private capital and skills. Full-scale national PPP procedures can thereby be avoided.
                             For private sector participation in small town WSS, the success stories relate to private sector operators in
                             large urban areas extending their services to nearby small towns. The private sector is pushing for a system of
                             regional tariffs, which would allow for cross-subsidization between urban areas. This would result in many more
                             small towns being served by private operators.
      Philippines            Among the case study countries, the Philippines has the most successful program of private participation in
                             small town water supply. There is now a vibrant and active market for it in small towns. Key performance
                             outcomes have been positive in terms of water service availability, drinking water quality, water pressure, per
                             capita water availability, and operational efficiency. Private participation is mainly market driven in that the
                             private sector actively seeks opportunities to invest.
                             The Philippines has an established national PPP framework supported at the highest political level. Many
                             institutional forms have emerged in the water sector, flexibility being one of the hallmarks of successful
                             penetration of the private sector. Private companies make proposals to governments or local utilities to provide
                             WSS services, on a joint venture or some form of PPP. Unsolicited proposals are subject to a Swiss challenge,a
                             but once signed the contracts run for 25 years or longer.
      Uganda                 In Uganda, private water operators have played an important role in operating piped water schemes in a
                             number of small towns. As of mid-2014, the leading 20 such operators were managing 48 town water supply
                             systems, with a total of around 28,000 connections (including water kiosks and public stand posts) and a total
                             population served of over one million people. The main driver of private participation is government initiative,
                             anchored in the legal framework.
                             The role of the private sector, however, is currently regarded by the authorities as a stopgap until the water
                             supply systems can be taken over by the National Water and Sewerage Company. The management contracts
                             are short (typically three years) and investment by the private sector is precluded.
      Cambodia               Small private operators play a key role providing water supply services to small towns and rural areas in
                             Cambodia, filling the gap between the demand for WSS services and the absence of government-supported
                             systems. The private sector is the main driver of WSS in Cambodia.
                             Many of the small private operators, however, are not licensed. To operate in areas not provided by government
                             public utility, private operators must get municipal and provincial approvals before obtaining a license from the
                             Ministry of Industry and Handicraft.
      Niger                  Government policy prescribes PPP arrangements to manage WSS assets in urban and rural areas. In urban
                             areas, one private operator, SPEN (an asset holding company), has lease-affermage contracts. In rural areas,
                             the municipalites are asset owners and lease the assets to various small private operators. The main driver for
                             private participation is government reforms and initiatives.
      Senegal                Senegal has promoted PPP in WSS sector since 1996, starting with a large PPP contract between Senegalaise
                             des Eaux and Société Nationale des Eaux du Senegal. Since then, rural water PPPs have also been promoted and
                             supported by the government. A new institutional framework for rural water PPPs has recently been established,
                             where OFOR (the institution responsible for rural WSS) can contract private distribution companies to provide
                             WSS to the communities. The main driver for private sector participation is government reforms and initiatives.
         A “Swiss challenge” is a form of public procurement that requires a public authority (usually an agency of government), upon which receiving an unsolicited bid for a public

                        •	 Technical support. Provide assistance to line ministries and local governments in developing projects.
 Local government         •	 WSS service provision. Responsible for providing WSS services. In some cases, the local
                             government is allowed to choose how to provide WSS services, either through an internal
                             department (usually public works or a dedicated WSS department), or by contracting a separate
                             entity (private or state-owned) to provide the WSS services.
                          •	 Contracting agency. If the local government chooses to contract out WSS services, there may need
                             to be contracting agency responsibile for monitoring the operator’s performance.
                          •	 Asset owners. In most cases, the local government is the owner of the WSS assets.
 Regulator                Regulatory functions can be performed by a national government agency or an independent regulator.
                          In some countries, regulation of small town WSS is delegated to local authorities, with varying degrees
                          of supervision from central regulatory institutions.

                          Regulatory functions usually include the following:
                          •	 Licensing. Issue licenses that allows operator to provide WSS services in the designated areas.
                          •	 Tariff regulation. Regulate WSS tariffs to ensure financial sustainability of the operator while being
                             affordable to consumers. In some cases, the regulator approves tariffs proposed by the operators;
                             in other cases final approvals are given by the ministry.
                          •	 Technical regulation. Provide guidance and technical standards to be followed by the operators.
                          •	 Performance monitoring. Monitor technical, financial, and operational performance of the operators.
                             In some cases the regulator also benchmarks the performance of the operators.
                          •	 Customer protection. Provide customers with a forum or a means to be heard. Also provide
                             awareness raising to customer about relevant WSS services.
                                                                                                               table continues next page

     Private Sector Provision of Water Supply and Sanitation Services in Rural Areas and Small Towns   The Public Sector’s Role in Enabling Private Sector Participation




      Table 5.1: (CONTINUED)
      WSS utility or                 WSS can be provided by a department within the local government, a separate utility owned by the
      operator                       municipality or central government, or by a private operator.

                                     WSS services usually include the following:
                                     •	 Piped or nonpiped water supply
                                     •	 Sewerage services, such as piped sewerage and septic tanks emptying services
                                     •	 Sanitation services, such as community toilets

                                     Note that few WSS utilities or private operators provide sewerage and sanitation services.

   Box 5.2: Examples of Market Structuring for Private Participation in WSS
   In Uganda, Senegal, and Niger, there is a clear legal framework regarding the roles and responsibilities of the
   private sector under which operators are responsible only for the operation and maintenance of the system.
   Thus, private operators do not invest in construction of major new assets, and therefore do not need to find
   large financing sources.

   In Senegal, in the case of rural piped water schemes, the government creates PPP areas with a population of
   more than 100,000 inhabitants. These PPP opportunities are then open to public competitive tenders.

   In the Philippines, the PPP framework and Joint Venture Guidelines provide guidance to both government
   institutions and private companies on the types of partnership that are legally accepted. Although private
   companies are encouraged to invest in WSS systems, at the end of the contract period, the assets will be
   returned to the government. To allow for returns on their investments, companies usually receive long-term
   contracts, mostly 25 years.

   In terms of incentives, most countries provide some form of financial incentives to attract private operators. In
   Bangladesh and the Philippines, the legal framework clearly prescribes the types of financial and fiscal incentives
   the governments are willing to provide. This includes capital investments, guarantees, subsidies, and tax breaks.

   In some cases, market structuring is also tied to water resource management. In Kenya the industry is
   structured around water catchments to promote equitable management of water resources within the area.

   In Colombia there is an indirect incentive, also anchored in the legal framework, in that local governments that
   have corporatized their public service provision through the establishment of a separate utility may receive
   higher national budget allocations for WSS investments.

        Box 5.3: Example of the Need for Institutional Support
        In Bangladesh, local government institutions do not fully understand opportunities for the sector of having
        private partners in providing WSS services. In addition, communities in general share the local government’s
        view that the private sector will be interested only in earning profits and not in providing public services such
        as WSS. These views have deterred private operators from becoming involved in WSS service provisions.

        In contrast, private sector participation is a well-accepted concept in the Philippines. The national government
        has made great efforts in promoting PPPs in all infrastructure sectors, and has created a PPP framework that
        includes the establishment of a PPP Center, which acts as a knowledge center. The PPP Center provides
        capacity building programs for local government institutions regarding the concept of PPPs; how to structure,
        develop, and prepare PPP projects; and how to implement and monitor PPP projects. This dissemination of
        knowledge has resulted in the acceptance of the PPP concept by local government institutions. In addition, the
        PPP Center also engages private sector actors, such as chambers of commerce, to increase PPP awareness
        in the private sector. These awareness raising and capacity building programs have been complemented
        by several successful pilot projects. They have greatly improved community understanding and belief in the
        benefits of private sector participation.

   Box 5.4: Example of Legal and Regulatory Frameworks
   In Niger, Senegal, and Uganda, the legal frameworks explicitly encourage partnerships with private operators in
   providing WSS services, and outline how the partnership should be governed and the types of contracts that
   can be entered into. They clearly outline the roles and responsibilities of each party, for example, in Uganda,
   the local authorities remain asset owners and the private sector service providers are responsible for operating
   and maintaining those assets.

   There are, however, exceptions to this arrangement. For example, in Cambodia the lack of clear legal and
   regulatory framework has created opportunities for private entities.They have stepped in to invest in WSS
   systems and provide the services without any government technical or financial support. Since these private
   operators are contributing to access, they should be recognized and supported in their growth to further
   expand their coverage.

   Market development by operators has also occurred in the Philippines, albeit to a lesser degree. The
   comprehensive PPP framework has diminished the impact of a lack of regulatory framework Regulation by
   contract has been an accepted compromise. However, this PPP framework needs to be supported by capable
   and experienced staff and good arrangements for accountability.

   In the Philippines, tariff setting procedures are not restrictive, in that in most cases tariff adjustment clauses
   are included in the PPP contracts, monitored by the regulator. Thus, having a regulatory framework that allows
   private companies to earn returns on their investment, is also key to attracting private participation.

   Box B.1: Available References on Developing Public-Private Partnership Frameworks
   In developing national public-private partnership (PPP) framework, policy makers should consider account
   decentralization policies that delegate public service provision to subnational governments.

   Key aspects with regard to subnational PPP arrangements:
   •	 Knowledge, skills, and capability of subnational governments. Local level institutions were established to
      meet local empowerment and other attractive decentralization goals, but without being endowed with the
      necessary capacity and resources to carry out their mandates.
   •	 Simplified processes for local PPP projects. Local projects may not require complicated PPP processes
      designed for national PPP projects.
   •	 Transaction costs. These may be disproportionately high for small PPP projects, therefore, there may be a
      case to pool small PPP projects and gain from economies of scale by having regional PPP centers help local
      governments implement local PPP projects.

        Project objectives: (a) support water sector reform by creating enabling environment for private sector
        participation in the management and operation of water utilities through assisting the implementation of pilot
        projects and providing financial support to ensure viability; (b) expand the coverage of water and sewerage
        services; and (c) facilitate access of population in low income areas to water and sewerage services.

        Project components:
        •	 Investment in water supply and sanitation work in medium-size cities and in small municipalities—provide
           financial support to engage private sector in several medium-size cities and small municipalities
        •	 Environmental management capacity strengthening—capacity building program with a focus on wastewater
           management
        •	 Development of a rural water and sanitation policy
        •	 Project management and training

        The project was a pilot project to test a novel approach to private sector participation in small and medium-
        sized cities, and was considered to be satisfactory in achieving the stated objectives.

   Box B.4: Available References on How to Support WSS Sector Reforms
   Many investment projects include a component to review the existing legal, regulatory and institutional
   framework. However, if the main focus of the project is to implement a project with private sector participation,
   in some cases this will be done without ensuring that the legal and regulatory framework are sound and
   conducive to the sustainability of private sector participation. Therefore, it is highly recommended that a
   thorough WSS sector reform is conducted and implemented before shifting the focus to investment project
   development and implementation.

        Box B.6: Example of Proposal for Regional Tariff in Colombia
        In the northern department of Atlántico, Triple-A was established as an Empresas de Servicios Públicos (ESPs) in
        1992 to operate WSS services in the urban municipality of Barranquilla. Once the operator had established itself
        successfully in Barranquilla, it started expanding its services to the communities in surrounding municipalities. This
        was carried out by using the plants employed for Barranquilla to treat larger quantities of waters to supply
        neighboring municipalities. The system currently supplies seven additional municipal systems besides
        Barranquilla. Furthermore, the operator has included two additional water supply systems that serve another seven
        locations.

        Triple-A proposed a new regional tariff that allows the firm to earn a return on a larger asset base with minimal
        additional risk by charging a uniform tariff across a region, even when systems are not physically connected, as
        is the case in Atlántico. Effectively, the regional tariff allows for cross-subsidization of poorer municipalities by
        large urban centers without the need of physical interconnection.

   Box B.8: Example of Designing a Capacity Building Program for Local Government
   When designing a capacity building program for local government, policy makers should include a component
   that explains that engaging DPSP in public service provision has benefits, but is not the only way or necessarily
   the best way to provide public services such as WSS. In some cases, the local government departments may
   be best placed to provide the services, or in other cases, community-based organizations (CBOs) are already
   providing satisfactory WSS services. The main development objective of improving access to safe WSS
   services should always be in the forefront of the assistance program.

        Box B.10: Example from the Finance Facility for Urban WSP in Kenya
        A finance facility for urban water service providers (WSPs) in Kenya was developed to provide an alternative
        source of financing for urban water and sanitation investment projects. The intention is not to replace the
        traditional sources of investment financing (government and development partners) but to provide a
        complementary additional financing option.

        The intended financing structure is to be a 50 percent grant from Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid
        (GPOBA) and a 50 percent loan from Kenyan commercial banks. The role of subsidies in improving affordability
        where market financing is used to pay for infrastructure is critical. This is because it may not be practical to
        expect full recovery of operational and capital costs in a sector that has traditionally relied on public funds to
        finance infrastructure.

        The grant is output-based and can thus be released only when the project is complete and the agreed output
        has been independently verified. During the construction period, therefore, the banks have to extend the full
        amount of the project. Commercial banks were interviewed during the facility planning process and suitable
        candidates identified as potential partners. The accredited banks will compete to provide credit facilities for the
        WSPs. Even though this project does not include an explicit capacity building component for the commercial
        banks, the interaction with commercial banks throughout the project has improved the participating local
        banks’ understanding of WSS business and the types of loans or financial products are suitable for WSS.

        Box B.11: Example of Clustering in WSS Project in Rural and Small Towns in Benin
        The DPSP WSS project in Benin started with the selection of pilot sites, which were grouped into four clusters
        to reduce transaction costs. The project design required the private operators to design, engineer, rehabilitate,
        operate, and maintain systems, without increasing the price of water. One key lesson from the pilot project is
        that more ambitious clustering than what was included in the pilot project should be considered.

        Such clustering can be fostered in several ways:

        On the one hand, “market-led” clustering, whereby a single operator can win multiple contracts should be
        allowed (i.e., there should not be any rule stating that any operator cannot win contracts in multiple locations)
        and explicitly encouraged. This is likely to lead to “market consolidation,” which is already taking place for the
        affermage contracts and much needed in Benin, since the market probably cannot support 70 viable operators.
        Scaling up of the most robust operators will allow them to build technical competencies and increase their
        access to capital (both from their own resources and through commercial loans). This could also generate
        employment. However, such market consolidation should be monitored carefully so as to limit the exercise of
        market power by the private operators. If one private operator starts winning all contracts, for example, such a
        situation could be investigated to ensure that there was no wrongdoing.

Private Sector Provision of Water Supply and Sanitation Services in Rural Areas and Small Towns   Appendix B




   On the other hand, incentives could be given to municipalities that wish to group together to let out larger
   contracts. For example, this could be done by making subsidies available only above a certain threshold in
   terms of the target number of new household connections. Such a threshold could gradually be increased to
   encourage letting out larger contracts to private operators and enable economies of scope and accumulation
   of technical expertise.

   Box B.12: Contracting with Small-Scale Providers
   Many PPP investment projects focus on the PPP transaction process and do not put enough emphasis in the
   project development and selection process. Although transaction assistance is undoubtedly required and
   useful, policy makers should also provide support to the public institutions on how to develop and select PPP
   projects, taking into account the necessary demand factors. In addition, in some cases the type of PPP
   contract has already been decided before the project was developed, and therefore the project development
   process was not done to suit the local conditions but rather to suit the types of contract selected. This situation
   may result in less buy-in from DPS and a less sustainable arrangement.
