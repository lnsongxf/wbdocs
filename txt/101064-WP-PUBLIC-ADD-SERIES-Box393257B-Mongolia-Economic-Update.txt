The economy is undergoing a sharp adjustment to large imbalances and a weak external environment

Mongolia’s growth sharply slowed to 3.0 percent in the first half of 2015. External demand is weakening due to a
continued dampening of the commodity market and slower growth in China, translating into a drop in exports.
Slowing domestic demand is largely caused by a plunge in investment due to falling FDI. Declining investment and
weaker mining exports are translating into sluggish real household income growth, thereby slowing consumption.
Adjustment in domestic demand has contributed to reducing the current account deficit and stabilizing inflation.
The current account deficit is expected to decline to about 5 percent of GDP in 2015, from 11.7 percent of GDP last
year. Inflation also continued to stabilize, moderating to 4.9 percent in September from 9.8 percent early this year.
Deterioration in bank asset quality has accelerated with the slowing economy, with the share of non-performing
loans rising from 5 percent at the end of 2014 to 7 percent in September.


Tighter economic policies have contributed to the adjustment of the economy

Fiscal policy became tighter compared with previous years. As revenue shortfalls reached over 15 percent of the
budget plan, tight expenditure controls have been implemented, containing the budget spending execution at less
than 80 percent of the plan. As a result, on-budget expenditures excluding the public investment financed by the
Development Bank of Mongolia (DBM) increased by only 2.8 percent in the first eight months compared with the
same period last year, a negative spending growth in real terms. Public investment financed by the DBM also stayed
tight, reaching less than half of its MNT 1.5 trillion annual spending plan in the first eight months.

Measures were taken to curb the budget deficit, debt, and off-budget expenditures. New deficit and debt ceilings
were set for 2015-18 by amending the Fiscal Stability Law (FSL) in January. The 2015 budget was amended in January
to curb the structural deficit within 5 percent of GDP. A significant portion of the DBM’s off-budget expenditures
were also newly included in the budget by including the non-commercial projects financed by the DBM. The
definition of the debt controlled by the FSL, however, was changed to general government debt from public debt.

The fiscal plans for 2015 and 2016 entail a risk of overstating revenues. The 2015 supplementary budget reduced
budget spending by MNT 560 billion and plans to mobilize additional revenues by MNT 340 billion, to absorb an
expected MNT 900 billion revenue shortage. The revenue mobilization plan, however, is likely to be challenging as
it largely relies on collecting significant revenues from tax payment arrears in the remaining two months amidst a
sharp economic downturn. The revenue projections of the draft 2016 budget also entail elements of uncertainty.
The draft budget is based on an optimistic assumption of strong coal exports despite the weak coal market conditions
and an expected slowdown in China. The draft budget also relies on resources from privatizing large SOEs that has
been delayed in the previous years, and significant new foreign grant inflows from China.

Monetary policy has tightened. The Price Stabilization Program (PSP) has been phased out since early 2015, reducing
the outstanding BoM credit to PSP to MNT 386 billion in August, from over MNT 700 billion at the end of 2014. The
BoM financing to the subsidized housing mortgage program, however, continued to grow from MNT 1.7 trillion one
year ago to MNT 2.8 trillion in August. The BoM also provided a MNT 350 billion loan to the corporate sector late
2014 via commercial banks. With the growing housing mortgage program and the one-off corporate sector support,
outstanding policy loans provided by the BoM still remains substantial, reaching MNT 3 trillion in August.

The real effective exchange rate has been on an appreciation trend in recent months, after a significant adjustment
over the last two years. Between March 2013 and March 2015, the nominal exchange rate depreciated by 40 percent
against the US$ in response to a large balance of payments deficit. Higher import prices induced by the exchange

                                                         1
rate adjustment have contributed to the current account adjustment, by encouraging consumers to substitute
towards domestic products. Exchange rate adjustment, however, has been limited in recent months, with increased
central bank interventions. The tugrik depreciated by only 1.4 percent in June-Oct against the US$, a far stronger
performance compared with other commodity-dependent economies, putting the real effective exchange rate on
an appreciation path since late 2014.


Growth is expected to slow in 2015-16, but a recovery in foreign investment would begin to support the
growth of the non-mining sector in 2016

Growth is projected to slow to 2.3 percent in 2015, revised downward from 3.3 percent of the last projection. The
downward revision largely reflects weak crop harvests and the slower-than-expected industrial production in the
third quarter. Mining GDP growth will likely remain in double digits in 2015, but is expected to moderate in the
second half of the year. Non-mining GDP growth is expected to further slow in the second half as investment and
consumption demand remains subdued and FDI stays weak. Weaker crop harvests due to severe droughts are
expected to slow agricultural production. There is a risk that agriculture could be hit harder by weaker crop harvests
and harsher winter weather conditions.

Growth is expected to further slow to 0.8 percent in 2016 due to a sharp contraction in mining production, despite
a gradual recovery of the non-mining sector. Mining production is projected to decline in 2016-17 with lower mineral
concentration in ores produced by the OT mine and the weak global commodity market conditions. Mining
production is expected to pick up from 2018, on the back of a gradual recovery in the commodity market and an
improvement in the ore quality of the OT mine. Non-mining GDP growth is expected to gradually recover in 2016
after a sharp slowdown in 2015. The non-mining sector of the economy will likely remain weak in early 2016, but a
recovery in foreign investment in the mining sector is expected to support the industries supplying goods and
services needed for large scale mining investment projects in the latter of half of the year.


The fiscal outlook is weak, with the prospect of a slow revenue recovery

The revenue projections for 2015-16 of the current fiscal plans may be difficult to achieve on account of optimistic
assumptions and challenging revenue mobilization plans. Non-mining budget revenues are expected to gradually
recover in 2016 as consumption and import-related taxes pick up in tandem with increased FDI inflows. However, a
drop in commodity exports is likely to continue to dampen mining-related tax revenues, which account for more
than 20 percent of total revenues, in the next couple of years. Some of the key revenue mobilization measures for
2015-16 may also prove challenging, including the collection of significant tax arrears this year amid a sharp
slowdown of the economy, and optimistic assumptions of a strong coal export increase and an ambitious
privatization plan for 2016. Accounting for these uncertainties, potential budget revenue shortfalls could reach over
MNT 100 billion in 2015 compared with the second supplementary budget, and up to MNT 400 billion in 2016
compared with the draft 2016 budget. Assuming the current spending plans of the government for 2015-16, the
budget deficit following the FSL definition – which includes the budgetary projects of the DBM – is expected to stay
over 5 percent of GDP in 2015-16, a higher deficit path than the medium term deficit ceilings of the FSL.

The consolidated budget deficit – which adds DBM’s commercial portfolio to the FSL-defined budget deficit – is
expected to decline to 8-9 percent of GDP in 2015 and 6-7 percent of GDP in 2016, from 11 percent of GDP in 2014.
The DBM is expected to provide about MNT 600 billion to its commercial portfolio in 2015, and to further reduce its
commercial spending to MNT 300-400 billion in the next couple of years due to tight financing conditions. Under
these assumptions, the commercial projects financed by the DBM is expected to around 3 percent of GDP in 2015,
and decline to 1-1.5 percent of GDP in 2016.


                                                          2
Large external financing mitigated the immediate balance of payments pressure, at the cost of higher
external public debt

With the balance of payments under pressure from falling FDI, considerable external financing was mobilized by the
government and the central bank. US$ 660 million was newly raised including a US$ 500 million government
guaranteed bond of one commercial bank and a RBM 1 billion sovereign dim sum bond. The central bank also drew
down $630 million from the bilateral currency swap facility with the People’s Bank of China in the first nine months,
pushing the total external debt-financing of the public sector close to US$ 1.3 billion in 2015. The large external
financing significantly reduced the balance of payments deficit to US$172 million in the first nine months, from
US$743 million in the same period last year.

The improvement of the balance of payments in recent months relying on external debt-financing came at the cost
of higher external debt. Mongolia’s external debt rose to 180 percent of GDP in June 2015, from 162 percent one
year ago, with the public external debt to GDP ratio jumping to 62 percent in June from 45 percent one year before.
With higher external debt, the fiscal and external accounts are more exposed to exchange rate risks and increased
volatility in the international financial market.

Rapid increases in external liabilities have substantially increased the government and public debts. The government
and government guaranteed debt reached 58 percent of GDP in 2014, a sharp increase from 24 percent of GDP three
years ago. The public debt also rapidly increased to 77 percent of GDP from 40 percent over the same period. The
liabilities of the government and the public sector are expected to continue to rise towards the end of 2015, due to
a large budget deficit and external debt financing.


The balance of payments remains under pressure and the economy is vulnerable to shocks…

Despite the recent improvement led by large external financing, the balance of payments will likely remain in deficit
in 2015. Although the current account deficit is expected to significantly narrow to about 5 percent of GDP in 2015,
a sharp drop in mineral exports and a large deficit in the services and income accounts will likely keep the current
account in the red in the coming months. With weak capital inflows, a continued current account deficit would
translate into a deficit in the balance of payments, unless further external financing is mobilized.

Mongolia’s external positions are expected to come under elevated pressure in the coming years, with the widening
current account deficit and declining reserve buffers. A continued drop in mineral exports is expected to substantially
increase the deficit in the current account in the next couple of years. Although a recovery in foreign capital inflows
could provide some buffers, a growing current account deficit is likely to strain the balance of payments in the coming
years. Compounding the external vulnerabilty is the first large repayment of public external debt in 2017 amounting
to US$ 1,080 million, which will pose significant challenges to the fiscal and external accounts.

The weak balance of payments will continue to erode international reserves. After rebounding from US$ 1,267
million in April to US$ 1,728 million in August on the back of large external borrowing, the gross reserves of the
central bank dropped by over US$300 million in September to US$1,412 million, reflecting the balance of payments
pressure and increased foreign exchange market interventions. Foreign exchange buffers would likely stay under
growing pressure in the coming months and the next couple of years unless a significant correction of external
imbalances is made through tighter economic policies and continued exchange rate adjustment.


… with substantial external downside risks ahead.

A sharper slowdown in China and the commodity market could further undermine Mongolia’s growth and
exacerbate its external vulnerabilities. China’s growth moderation and rebalancing have already exerted a significant


                                                          3
negative impact on commodity prices. Mongolia’s lack of diversification in export products and trade partners leaves
the economy highly vulnerable to a sharper slowdown in China and the commodity market. Exports to China
constituted 42 percent of the 2014 GDP, with the neighboring economy absorbing 87.9 percent of Mongolia’s total
exports. Compounding the vulnerability is Mongolia’s high export concentration on minerals which account for over
80 percent of total exports. Each 10 percent drop in copper and coal export revenues from the baseline projection
could be expected to further widen Mongolia’s current account deficit by more than 3 percentage points of GDP in
2016.

There is also a risk that a U.S. monetary policy normalization could further deteriorate external financing conditions
for emerging economies including Mongolia. The East Asia and Pacific Economic Report of the World Bank (October
2015) assumes a gradual, smooth tightening of external financing conditions, with an orderly normalization of the
U.S. monetary policy. However, there is a risk that the U.S. policy rate “lift -off” will instead trigger abrupt market
reactions, causing currencies to depreciate sharply, bond spreads to rise steeply, and liquidity to tighten. Mongolia
has increasingly relied on external debt-financing over the last three years, and will face significant future debt
rollovers in 2017 and beyond. A sharper tightening in external financing conditions could make it more difficult or
costly to mobilize external financing needed for debt rollovers or current account deficit financing. According to the
analysis reported in the EAP Update, every 100-basis-point increase in the benchmark 10-year U.S. bond yield is
associated with 106-144 basis-point increase in yields in East Asia and Pacific countries on average.



Growing external and fiscal vulnerabilities amid substantial downside risks demand a continued policy
adjustment to restore sound economic management.

Mongolia’s long-term economic prospects remain promising with an increasingly educated population and vast
potential from mineral wealth waiting to be materialized. However, the economy faces significant short-term
challenges. External financing needs will remain high due to the growing current account deficit and large external
debt repayments in the next couple of years. External financing conditions will likely stay much tighter amid
heightened global financial volatility. Meanwhile, the country lacks sufficient fiscal and external buffers to counter
possible shocks with public debt increasing and international reserves declining. The economy is slowing, but it
reflects inevitable adjustments to external imbalances, falling FDI and a negative terms of trade shock.

While the government has demonstrated its commitment to policy reforms, implementation risks are high as the
next election approaches. Maintaining reform momentum and a stable investment environment during the election
cycle is important to build a solid footing for a stable and sustainable growth path against possible headwinds.

    Fiscal consolidation efforts should continue. Reducing the budget deficit and consolidating off-budget
     expenditures should remain a primary target of the fiscal policy adjustment agenda in the coming years,
     particularly in light of the growing debt and the volatile external environment. Credible fiscal adjustment plans
     are needed for 2015 and 2016 to restore a prudent fiscal path as envisioned by the Fiscal Stability Law (FSL).
     The 2016 budget should adhere to the fiscal targets demanded by the FSL, by containing and prioritizing budget
     spending based on realistic revenue projections. Considering the uncertainty over the revenue outlook of the
     current fiscal plans for 2015-16, additional measures adjustment are likely to be needed to meet the fiscal
     targets of the FSL.

    Including the commercial portfolio of the DBM would strengthen the credibility and the effectiveness of the
     fiscal consolidation plan. A significant step was taken to reduce off-budget expenditures in 2015 by including
     the non-commercial projects financed by the DBM into the 2015 budget. The commercial portfolio of the DBM,
     however, still remains outside the control of the FSL even though such projects are financed by government or


                                                          4
  government guaranteed borrowings and the boundary between the commercial and non-commercial projects
  of the DBM remains unclear. DBM’s commercial lending operations are expected to reach close to 3 percent
  of GDP this year, far exceeding the budgetary spending of the DBM.

 Quasi-fiscal programs financed by the BoM should be phased out and transferred to the government. The
  Price Stabilization Program should continue to be phased out. Central bank financing to the housing mortgage
  program needs to be phased out and the program transferred to the government. Such quasi-fiscal programs
  blur the boundary between central bank’s balance sheet and the government budget, undermining the role of
  the central bank as an independent keeper of price stability. New policy lending programs to support specific
  industries or policy objectives, if needed, should be implemented through the government budget, competing
  with other spending priorities within the fiscal disciplines of the FSL.

 Enhanced exchange rate flexibility will help the economy better adjust to external imbalances and shocks
  and safeguard foreign exchange buffers. Excessive interventions against market fundamentals are unlikely to
  be a sustainable measure to contain inflation. Underlying pressure on the currency is likely to build up in light
  of the weak balance of payments prospects and the overall weakening of emerging market currencies. The
  cost of intervention is particularly high for a country with inadequate reserves as interventions require losses
  in reserve buffers. Monetary policy focused on reducing external imbalances combined with flexible exchange
  rate would help ease underlying pressures on the exchange rate and safeguard foreign exchange reserves.

 The safety buffers of the banking system need to be further strengthened. Strengthening the bank
  supervision and prudential regulations may seem pro-cyclical in the short-term, but maintaining loose
  prudential regulations could prove more costly should the banking system soundness be continuously eroded
  by worsening asset quality. The NPL recognition rules and loan-loss provision could be further strengthened.
  The regulatory forbearances granted to PSP loans (i.e., zero percent risk-weighting) since 2013 should be
  immediately lifted to enhance the transparency and credibility of the banking system.

 Better targeting of the social welfare programs would help strengthen the social safety net in an economic
  downturn. To make the social welfare program more efficient, small programs could be consolidated by
  prioritizing program design based on the need to provide comprehensive support to the targeted population.
  To contain costs of social welfare programs while making them more effective, programs could be made
  poverty-targeted. For example, benefit amounts for the richer quintiles could be reduced or eliminated, using
  the readily available Poverty-Means-Tested (PMT) household database. The government may want to consider
  redesigning the Child Money Program (CMP) which alone accounts for half of total social welfare transfers.

 A recovery in FDI would help the policy reforms to continue with less adjustment costs and mitigate the
  balance of payments risks. Revamped foreign capital inflows and improved investor sentiment is expected to
  support the gradual recovery of the economy in 2016 against weak external demand. This would provide a
  good opportunity to solidify policy reform efforts, which otherwise would come at higher adjustment costs.
  Revitalizing foreign investment would also help reduce balance of payments risks, and support materializing
  economy’s long-term growth potential. This would require implementing stable and predictable policies and
  regulations on investment including the proper implementation of the Investment Law. Clearing the
  uncertainty over large foreign investment projects in a swift and transparent manner would also help improve
  investor sentiment towards Mongolia.

 Sluggish domestic demand and weakening exports drag on growth

Growth slowed to 3.0 percent in the first half from 7.5 percent in the previous six months. Contraction
in the non-mining economy dampened overall growth to 2.1 percent in the second quarter from 4.3 percent
in the first quarter on a year-on-year basis. Mineral GDP expanded at 16.5 percent in the first half but the
rate of growth softened from 24.4 percent in the last half of 2014. Non-mineral GDP contracted by 1.2
percent in the second quarter, down from a 1.5 percent growth in the first quarter. In the first six months,
the non-mining sector of the economy contracted by 0.2 percent, from 2.9 percent of the last six months in
2014. (Figure 1)

A plunge in investment continued to dampen growth, and external demand also substantially
weakened. Fixed investment fell by 43 percent in the first half with foreign direct investment turning into a
net outflow of $27 million from a $363 million inflow in the same period last year. Sluggish household
consumption growth and falling government consumption in real terms dampened final consumption growth
to 2.3 percent (y/y) in the same period, down from 7.3 percent of the previous six months. The growth
contribution of net exports also substantially declined despite a 7 percent drop in real imports as the export
growth in real terms dropped to 1.3 percent in the first six months year-on-year. (Figure 2)

Strong copper production buoyed mineral GDP growth despite a decline in coal production in the
first half. Mineral GDP recorded a 22 percent growth in 2014 largely on the back of a 34.5 percent increase
in copper concentrate production, with Oyu Tologi (OT) copper and gold mine beginning its first full-year
commercial production. Copper concentrate production of OT mine accounted for one-third of total mining
production and approximately eight percent of total GDP in 2014. In the first half of 2015, production of
copper concentrates increased by 24.9 percent year-on-year, a robust but slower growth than a 56.2
percent growth one year before as OT mine entered into the second year of full production. Coal production
declined by 2.4 percent in the same period, reflecting the continued weak coal market conditions. Crude oil
production also moderated but maintained a 14.9 percent growth and gold production fell by 15.7 percent.
(Figure 3) The mining sector contributed 22 percent of total production of the economy in the first half.

Mining industrial production remained robust in the third quarter. Copper production moderately
slowed in the third quarter, increasing by 33 percent year-on-year. Coal and crude oil production also
remained robust, growing by 22 percent and 32 percent in the third quarter compared with the same period
last year. Gross mining industrial production increased by 25 percent in July-Sep on a year-on-year basis,
indicating that the mineral GDP growth will remain strong in the third quarter. Mining production is expected
to stay robust in the last quarter of the year but the rate of production growth is likely to moderate.

production growth dropped to 1.4 percent (y/y) in the second quarter from 11.1 percent in the first quarter.
Wholesale and retail trade was hard hit amid falling imports and fragile consumption sentiment, contracting
by 7.6 percent in the first half. Transportation services also declined by 4 percent due to weakening external
trades. Construction increased only by 1.3 percent from a year ago amid tighter government capital
expenditures and slowing residential property construction. (Figure 5)

Non-mining industries are expected to remain under pressure in the coming months. Manufacturing
industrial production fell by 10 percent in the third quarter year-on-year, after a 1 percent contraction in the
second quarter. Electricity production also declined by 1 percent in July-September from one year before.
(Figure 6) Construction of buildings fell by 24 percent (y/y) in nominal terms. Slower manufacturing
production and a continued large decline in imports in July-Sep suggest that the wholesale and retail trade
and transportation services will likely remain weak as well.

Unfavorable weather conditions are likely to drag on agricultural production. The newly released
agricultural production data shows that crop harvests sharply fell due to the severe drought that lasted in
the spring and summer of 2015. Cereal crop harvests of the first nine months reached only 27.7 percent of
the last year’s level. Harvested vegetables and potatoes were 66 percent and 83 percent of last years’
harvests in the first nine months of the year. Accounting for 18 percent of total agricultural production, poor
crop harvests are likely to be a drag on the economy. The World Bank team estimates that each 20 percent
drop in crop harvests from last year’s level would reduce the GDP growth by 0.4 percentage points.

Growth contributions of domestic and external demand are both waning. Strong domestic demand
buoyed by FDI inflows and pro-cyclical economic policies propped up double-digit growth in 2011-12,
accompanied by a rapid increase in imports that supplied a significant portion of domestic demand. In 2014,
the growth contribution of domestic demand turned negative largely due to a plunge in investment demand
amid a sharp drop in FDI. Strong exports, however, largely supported growth in 2014 on the back of new
copper and gold production of OT mine. In 2015, growth came under heavy pressure from waning domestic
and external demand. Domestic demand continued to
decline led by a 43 percent drop in investment, Figure 7. Growth contributions of domestic and external

investment has dampened fixed investment since
2013. FDI financed 65 percent of gross investment in
Mongolia on average in 2011-12, accounting for around 40 percent of GDP. FDI-financed investment,
dropped to 17 percent of GDP in 2013 and further declined to only 4 percent of GDP in 2014. (Figure 8)
With FDI sharply falling over the previous two years, public investment financed by the government budget
and the Development Bank of Mongolia has rapidly risen relying on domestic and external debt-financing.
Public sector investment rose to over 15 percent of GDP in 2014 from less than 10 percent of GDP in 2011
due to revamped capital expenditures by the government budget and the off-budget expenditures of the
DBM. (Figure 9) In 2015, investment remains under heavy pressure as FDI inflows further decline and the
rapid expansion of public investment cannot be sustained with growing debt and weaker budget revenues.

Tighter fiscal conditions and sluggish real income growth weigh on consumption. Final consumption
growth slowed to 2.3 percent (y/y) in the first half, down from 7.3 percent in the previous six months. Real
government consumption expenditures declined by 4.2 percent amid tight fiscal conditions. Private
consumption growth remained positive but slowed to 3.8 percent from 7.5 percent in the last half of 2014,
amid negative real income growth of households. (Figure 10) Average household real income began to
slow in mid-2013 with double-digit inflation after a rapid growth in 2011-2012. Household real monetary
income growth remained below the consumer price inflation since early 2014. The weakening of real
household income and expenditures appears more severe in Ulaanbaatar which is likely to be more affected
by a slowdown in the secondary and tertiary sectors of the economy. (Figure 11)

 Inflation moderates amid lower food price inflation and subdued domestic
 demand.

Headline inflation has been moderating since July 2014. National consumer price inflation fell to 9.8
percent (y/y) in January from its peak of 14.9 percent in July 2014, and has further moderated to 6.6 percent
in August, below the 7 percent inflation target of the BoM. The consumer price inflation substantially
declined in September to 4.9 percent, driven by an 11.4 percent drop in the meat price. The core inflation

– which excludes items with volatile prices such as food – continued to edge down to 6.1 percent in
September from 7.2 percent in the previous month amid tighter policies and subdued domestic demand.

A sharp drop in the meat price significantly contributed to slower inflation. Food price inflation in UB
decelerated to 2.3 percent (y/y) in August, and turned into a negative 1.3 percent in September. Lower
meat prices have been behind the falling food price inflation in 2015 due to increased supply of meat. In
particular, the meat price dropped by 6.2 percent in August and 10.5 percent in September as compared
with the price level in the same months last year, due to increased meat supply from herders expecting
harsher winter conditions. Non-food price inflation also slowed to 6.3 percent in September from 11.8
percent nine months ago. Administered price inflation – which includes utility prices, tuition and
transportation fees – climbed to 12.3 percent (y/y) in September, picking up from 10.3 percent in July. The
prices of electricity and hot water were raised by 4.2 percent and 19 percent respectively in July, followed
by a 23.5 percent rise in tuition fees in August.

Inflation will likely stay under downward pressure from weak domestic demand in the coming
months. Reduced supply-side pressure has substantially contributed to moderating inflation in 2015,
particularly via the lower food price inflation. Subdued domestic demand coupled with a tightened monetary
policy stance helped ease the demand-pull inflationary pressure. Without unexpected disruptions in food
supply and a loosening of the monetary policy, inflation would likely continue to stabilize towards the end
of the year. Despite the continued moderation in inflation, inflation expectations are still high after persistent
double-digit inflation in recent years, reflected in demand for double-digit wage growth by workers and
trade unions. In 2016, inflationary pressure may rise with large domestic liquidity injection stemming from
increased FDI inflows. Continued commitment of the monetary authorities to the price stability would help
maintain stable inflation and strengthen the credibility of central bank’s inflation target, which would
eventually help lower high inflation expectations that have been persistent in recent years.

 Box 1: Producer price index and imported price inflation

 The National Statistics Office of Mongolia (NSO) began to publish the monthly industrial producer
 price index (PPI) in 2015. The PPI measures the prices of domestically produced goods received by
 producers, also known as the wholesale prices. The PPI is different from the consumer price index (CPI)


                                                                                                                    10
which measures the retail prices of both domestically produced and imported goods that are included in
a predefined basket of consumption goods. The new PPI is based on the 2010 price level but its coverage
is limited to key industrial sectors including mining, manufacturing and electricity industries.

The recent PPI trend indicates the deteriorating market conditions for the industrial sectors of
the economy. In particular, the mining producer prices have sharply dropped since late 2014, reflecting
price drops in key commodities such as coal, copper and crude oil. The mining producer price index fell
by 22 percent in August, compared with the same month last year. The year-on-year growth in the
manufacturing producer price index remained high in 2014 and early 2015, reaching 13 percent in the
first quarter of 2015. However, the manufacturing producer inflation slowed in the second and third
quarters to 1.5 percent (y/y) in August.(Figure 14)

The PPI combined with import price data could provide useful information on underlying sources
of inflationary pressures in recent years. Assuming stable retail margins added to the wholesale
prices, the manufacturing producer price index trend would indicate how the prices of domestically
produced goods broadly affected consumer prices. The import price index converted to local currency
values would show the inflationary pressure stemming from foreign inflations (or changes in import prices
in tugrik terms). The past trend in the manufacturing PPI published by the NSO and the import price
index valued in tugriks indicates that inflation began to pick up in late 2013 in tandem with an import price
increase that were likely triggered by a sharp exchange rate depreciation in August 2013. Higher prices
of imported goods gradually translated into higher core inflation in late 2013 and early 2014. Core inflation
began to rapidly accelerate to double digits in mid-2014 as the prices of domestic goods – which
constitutes 70 percent of the consumer price index basket – sharply rose, reflecting higher prices of
imported intermediated inputs. In 2015, the core inflation has been on a moderating path amid a
continued slowdown in the prices of domestic goods and subdued import price inflation with lower oil
prices and slower exchange rate depreciation. (Figure 15)

 Steps were taken to restore fiscal sustainability in the medium term.

Measures were taken by the government to curb the growing budget deficit and government debt.
Mongolia’s fiscal reform agenda was set by the Comprehensive Macro Adjustment Plan (CMAP) that was
approved by the parliament in February. The amendment of the Fiscal Stability Law (FSL) in January and
the adoption of the Debt Management Law (DML) in February provided a legal framework for medium-term
fiscal adjustment.

      New deficit and debt ceilings were set for 2015-18 by amending the FSL. A new structural
       budget deficit ceiling was set at 5 percent of GDP for 2015 and was mandated to be gradually
       tightened to 2 percent of GDP by 2018, including the budgetary projects financed by the DBM. The
       ceiling on the present value of the government debt – formerly 40 percent of GDP – was relaxed to
       58.3 percent of GDP for 2015 and mandated to be gradually reduced to 40 percent of GDP by
       2018.

      January amendment of the 2015 budget reflected new fiscal ceilings and included DBM’s
       non-commercial projects. The amended 2015 budget aimed to curb the structural deficit within 5
       percent of GDP (overall deficit of 4.9 percent of GDP), as required by the amended FSL. Reflecting
       slowing economic conditions, budget revenue projections were adjusted downward by 7.4 percent
       and the on-budget capital expenditures were reduced by 34 percent compared with the original
       2015 budget. To curb off-budget expenditures, the non-commercial projects financed by the DBM
       (MNT 794 billion) were newly added as general government’s capital expenditures, which included
       construction of roads, streets, railways, and a hydroelectric dam. Commercial projects financed by
       the DBM, however, remain outside the budget.

      Some fiscal consolidation measures proposed by the government, however, failed during
       the parliament review of the 2015 budget in January. Government’s proposal to save about
       MNT 100 billion by reforming social transfer programs (e.g., Child Money Program) failed to get the
       parliament’s approval. The budget revenue projection (MNT 6.3 trillion) proposed by the MoF was
       revised upward by the parliament to MNT 6.7 trillion to allow more spending, which eventually
       undermined the credibility of the 2015 budget revenue projections.

      A unified debt management framework was established with the adoption of the new Debt
       Management Law. The Debt Management Law (DML) was adopted by the parliament in February
       and unified scattered debt management functions into the MoF, regulating legal procedures and
       requirements for borrowing and guarantees by the general government. The new Debt
       Management Law also strengthened the debt reporting system. The MOF is required to establish
       and maintain a centralized government debt information system which will include outstanding
       public foreign debt, government and government guaranteed debt, information on government
       securities and foreign debt, and information on projects that are financed by government debt.

FSL’s control over debt, however, was loosened. The amended FSL narrowed its debt definition to
“general government debt” from “public debt”, excluding SOE debt s that are not under government
guarantees from FSL’s debt ceiling. Government guarantees that are collateralized by borrower’s
government bond holdings were also excluded from the debt ceiling. This allowed the government to seek
further external borrowing without breaching FSL’s debt ceiling by using non -government entities,
particularly major commercial banks which are the major holders of government bonds. In May, this scheme
was put into use as one commercial bank (TDB) raised $500 million in government-guaranteed bonds,
collateralized by the government bonds in TDB’s balance sheet.

Steps are also being taken to improve the transparency of DBM’s operation. The DBM began to
publish information of its project portfolio on the website, according to the Glass Account Act. The interim
financial statements based on an independent auditing for the first half of 2015 was publicly released in
June. DBM’s 2015 business plan which was approved by its Board in June is yet to be publicly disclosed.
Amendment of the DBM law is currently under discussion. The current amendment proposal of the DBM
law follows the guidelines set by the Government Resolution 95 (March 18, 2015) including:

       Budgetary spending of the DBM to be phased out and transferred to the budget by 2018;
       DBM projects that are subject to Public Procurement Law to be identified by the MoF;

       Operational interventions from the government and parliament to be prevented;
       Governance structure to be improved by separating the government’s roles as a shareholder and
        as a regulator;
       Prudential regulations to be developed for DBM’s operations and the DBM to be subject to the
        banking supervision of the BoM.



 Fiscal policy became tighter amid large revenue shortfalls.
Large revenue shortfalls have been severely constraining the fiscal space. In the first eight months,
budget revenue receipts fell short of the budget plan by 16 percent. Shortfalls in tax revenues reached 11
percent compared with the budget plan. (Figure 16) Sharp declines in imports caused 36 percent and 17.6
percent revenue shortfalls in import VAT and customs duties. Revenue shortfalls in corporate income tax
reached 10.4 percent compared with the budget plan. Royalties from mining companies fell short of the
budget plan by 9 percent in the same period. Non-tax revenues have been experiencing a 36 percent
revenue shortage over the same period due to poor revenue outturns from dividend revenues and
privatization receipts. Under the current trend, total budget revenues are expected to fall below last year’s
revenue outturn (MNT 6.1 trillion) and the annual revenue shortage will reach up to MNT 1 trillion.

In response to revenue shortages, tight expenditure controls have been implemented by the fiscal
authorities. A government resolution was issued in June, putting tight expenditure controls on discretionary
spending items, including purchases of goods, operating expenses, special purpose transfers to local
governments, and capital expenditures to new investment projects including DBM’s budgetary portfolio.
The resolution put spending priority on necessary expenditures including wages and salaries, social
insurance and welfare benefits, utility costs and expenses of medical institutions, sanitation expenses, and
foreign financed projects. As a result of the spending controls, budget spending execution remained at 78
percent of the plan between January and August. Capital expenditure execution remained at only 45
percent of the spending plan and purchases of goods and contracted work remained at 80 percent of the
budget. Meanwhile, expenditures on wages, social insurance spending and social welfare transfers have
been almost fully executed. (Figure 17)

With a prolonged delay in adopting a supplementary budget, there has been a growing concern on
the limited effectiveness of administrative spending control measures. The government resolution did
not have full control over the entire expenditure cycle from commitments to payments. Monthly cash
rationing based on revenue outturns has not been able to effectively curb new commitments made by line
ministries. As a result, the government seems to have accumulated payment arrears to some contractors,
which would inevitably ramp up budget spending towards the end of the year. Increasing payment arrears
of the government would also adversely affect the banking sector soundness as many contractors are likely

to rely on bank loans for their project financing. To mitigate the pressure on the banking system from the
challenging fiscal situation, the government issued promissory notes to some contractors in lieu of delayed
payment.

 The supplementary budget for 2015 was adopted in early November and
 the draft 2016 budget is under discussion.
The supplementary budget for 2015 was approved by the parliament in November. Anticipating a
MNT 900 billion revenue shortfall compared with the budget towards the end of the year, the second
supplementary budget reduced budget spending by MNT 560 billion and mobilize additional revenues by
MNT 340 billion. Spending cuts include a MNT 120 billion cut in the wage bill and operating expenses by
postponing wage increases, and a MNT 480 billion cut in capital expenditures including a MNT 350 billion
reduction of DBM’s budgetary spending. Capital expenditure adjustments will be made by postponing new
investment projects to the next year. Subsidies and transfers – which include social welfare benefits – were
left almost unchanged. The additional revenue mobilization plan of the supplementary budget may prove
challenging. The revenue mobilization measures plan to raise MNT 61 billion by increasing the excise tax
rate and customs duties on petroleum products amid lower oil prices. The largest revenue mobilization,
however, is planned to be made by collecting from tax payment arrears, which could prove difficult to
achieve in only two remaining months of the year given the weak economic conditions.

The draft 2016 budget was also submitted to the parliament, aiming to curb the structural budget
deficit within 4% of GDP, as required by the Fiscal Stability Law. The draft budget assumed the
aggregate budget revenue to reach MNT 6,989 billion, a 15 percent increase from the 2015 revenue
estimates of the supplementary budget. The revenue projections expect an 8.4 percent increase in tax
revenues and a 48 percent increase in non-tax revenues and foreign grants, compared with the 2015
supplementary budget. Based on the revenue projections, the draft budget proposed to increase the
aggregate budget spending by 8 percent to MNT 7.9 trillion from MNT 7.3 trillion of the 2015 supplementary
budget. The recurrent expenditures are proposed to be contained at a 5 percent growth by reducing the
wage bill. The capital expenditures, however, are planned to increase by 32 percent from MNT 1,530 billion
in 2015 to MNT 2,016 billion, including MNT 450 billion of the DBM-financed capital expenditures. Under
the budget plan and a 4.1 percent real GDP growth assumption, the structural budget deficit is planned to
be contained at MNT 901 billion, equivalent to 3.3 percent of the nominal GDP projected by the budget.

The revenue mobilization plan of the 2016 draft budget entails elements of uncertainty. Assumptions
on commodity prices are broadly in line with the projections of international institutions. Assumptions on
export volumes, however, could prove challenging. In particular, the revenue estimates assume that coal
export volume will increase to 19.5 million tons next year, a 42 percent rise from 13.7 million tons in 2015.
This is likely to be optimistic in the wake the weak prospects of the coal market conditions and an expected
slowdown in China. Another uncertainty stems from implementation risks to a proposed privatization plan.
The draft budget proposed to raise MNT 171 billion by privatizing the State Bank, the Stock Exchange and
other state owned entities. The prospect of the privatization plan remains uncertain considering the weak
track record of previous privatization plans and lack of public consultation process so far. In addition to the
uncertainty, privatization revenues are supposed to be recorded as a financing component according to the
2011 Government Financial Statistics Manual. Mongolia has been recording privatization revenue as a non-
tax revenue item since 2013. Including privatization revenue as a financing item in line with international
standards would increase the budget deficit by an equivalent amount. Finally, the draft 2016 budget expects
MNT 368 billion in foreign grants, a substantial
increase from MNT 62 billion in 2015, largely due to Figure 18. Overstated revenue projections have severely
                                                           undermined the credibility of budget in recent years.

 Public investment financed by the DBM became tighter.

The Development Bank of Mongolia (DBM) provided around MNT 0.7 trillion to its budgetary and
non-budgetary projects in the first eight months. The annual business plan of the DBM plans to finance
MNT 794 billion to budgetary (or non-commercial) projects and MNT 715 billion to non-budgetary (or
commercial) projects. The budgetary portfolio of the DBM is now included in the central government budget
as capital expenditures financed by the DBM. The non-budgetary portfolio of the DBM, however, is excluded
from the government budget. (See Box 2 for more details on DBM’s pr oject classification). Between January
and August, the DBM financed MNT 248 billion to the budgetary projects out of the MNT 794 billion annual
plan, reflecting spending control of the fiscal authorities. Meanwhile, the DBM also financed about MNT
440 billion over the same period to its commercial portfolio. The annual expenditures of the DBM are
expected to decline to around MNT 1 trillion, from MNT 1,487 billion last year. The 2015 supplementary
budget reduced the capital expenditures to be financed by the DBM to MNT 452 billion in 2015, from MNT
794 billion of the original plan. The commercial project financing of the DBM is also expected to be contained
at around MNT 600 billion, a more than MNT 100 billion reduction from its original annual plan.

 Box 2. The loan structure and financing sources of the Development Bank of Mongolia

 The DBM released its Interim Financial Statements and an Independent Auditor’s Report for the first half
 of 2015 on June 30, 2015. This box provides a summary of the composition of loans and the source of
 financing, based on DBM’s interim financial statement and the independent auditor’s report.

 1. Composition of Loans

 The DBM held MNT 4,374 billion of loans and advances in its balance sheet at the end of June, 2015.
 MNT 2,244 billion of loans (51.3 percent) were loans to budgetary projects, which will be repaid by the
 state budget. MNT 2,219 billion was commercial loans that were issued to the corporate sector and state
 owned enterprises (SOEs).

 Budgetary projects. Loans that were given to projects to be repaid from the state budget are classified
 as socially beneficial projects that do not create cash flows of their own. These projects cover areas such
 as improvement of rural and city roads, civil engineering construction, extension and improvement of
 power and heat plant, building of new railways and mortgage financing through commercial banks. All of
 these loans are under direct government guarantees. DBM lending to the budgetary projects were not
 recorded in the budget until 2015.

 Commercial projects. Loans and advances given to the corporate projects are to be repaid from the
 future cash flows of projects or borrowers. These loans are classified as commercial projects and are not
 included in the budget. The DBM provided lending to corporate projects which the government considers
 priority commercial activities (air transport development, support of mining industry, housing,
 infrastructure, and manufacturing projects). A quarter of commercial projects are currently under explicit
 government guarantees.

 The loans to corporate customers include MNT 623 billion of policy on-lending operations to 10
 commercial banks which provided subsidized loans to government programs to support SMEs and
 strategically important sectors, such as Mongol “888” export promotion projects and leather production
 projects.


                                                     16
The report also explains that MNT 1,103 billion was lent to seven state owned enterprises (SOEs), as a
part of commercial loans. These SOEs include Erdenes Tavan Tolgoi (ETT), Erdenes MGL, State
Housing Corporation, SME Development Fund, MIAT Airlines, Baganuur mining SOSC. A US$ 200
million loan was issued to ETT, a state-owned mining company, in September 2013, under government
guarantee. A MNT 175 billion loan was issued to Erdenes MGL, a state-owned holding company of
strategic mines, without government guarantee.

2. Financing sources

The financial statement and the auditing report show the composition of DBM’s financing sources. (Table
2) As of June 2015, 92 percent of DBM’s liabilities were either government bonds or government
guaranteed external borrowings. The DBM financed MNT 4 trillion from government or government-
guaranteed bonds, including the US$ 1.5 billion sovereign Chinggis bond (Dec 2012), a US$500 million
DBM euro bond (March 2012), and a JPY 30 billion government-guaranteed samurai bond (Dec 2013).
In addition, the DBM borrowed MNT 904 billion from foreign banks, most of which were under
government guarantees.

    Monetary conditions have tightened.

Broad money (M2) growth remains subdued in 2015, with slowing domestic credit growth and
declining net foreign assets. M2 growth reached over 40 percent year-on-year in early 2014 despite
sharp losses in net foreign assets1 as domestic credit growth skyrocketed to over 150 percent. M2 growth
has been decelerating since mid-2014 and remained in negative territory since March, with slowing
domestic credit growth and persistent losses in net foreign assets. The growth of domestic credit to the
private sector decelerated to 4.9 percent in September from 21.4 percent in January, reflecting the tighter
monetary policy stance and subdued loan demand. The net foreign assets of depository institutions (the
value of foreign assets of the BoM and banks, less foreign liabilities) continues to drop in 2015, reflecting
central bank interventions in the foreign exchange market and persistent foreign currency demand of the
private sector amid a continued current account deficit. (Figure 20) The liability composition of broad
money shows that local currency deposits have been eroded by slower money supply growth in recent
months while the foreign currency deposit growth remained positive year-on-year. (Figure 21)

The central bank balance sheet rapidly expanded in the previous two years. BoM’s domestic assets
sharply increased in 2013 from MNT 566 billion at the end of 2012 to MNT 4.5 trillion one year later,
driven by BoM’s aggressive quantitative easing programs which injected MNT 3.5 trillion (18 percent of
GDP) at its peak in December 2013. As a result, cen tral bank’s domestic assets reached 46 percent of
total domestic credit at the end of 2013, a substantial jump from 14 percent one year ago. BoM’s
quantitative easing measures were led by two quasi-fiscal lending programs: (i) the Price Stabilization
Program to support the suppliers of key consumptions goods and the construction industry; and (ii) a
subsidized housing mortgage program to support affordable housing to middle-income families and to
boost the construction sector. The BoM also injected MNT 900 billion into commercial banks as one-year
term deposits in 2013.

The phasing-out of the Price Stabilization Program has slowed the balance sheet expansion, but
central bank’s domestic assets remain substantial with the growing housing mortgage program.
Central bank’s outstanding domestic assets declined moderately to MNT 4.1 trillion in September 2015,




1A drop in net foreign assets of depository institutions means that an equivalent amount of domestic currency deposits was
reduced in exchange for foreign currencies needed for external payments, for example imports. This would reduce existing
money supply, by absorbing domestic currency liquidity back into the banking system or the BoM.

from MNT 4.3 trillion at the beginning of the year. (Figure 22) The central bank began to gradually taper
some of its quantitative easing programs in 2014. MNT 900 billion that had been placed at commercial
banks was fully withdrawn by mid-2014. Liquidity injection via Price Stabilization Program (PSP) also
gradually slowed in 2014 and the program has been phased out without further liquidity injection since
early 2015. As maturing PSP loans have been withdrawn, the outstanding BoM credit to PSP substantially
declined to MNT 376 billion in September, from over MNT 700 billion at the end of 2014. The outstanding
PSP loans are expected to decline to MNT 232 billion by the end of 2015 and to be almost fully withdrawn
by the end of 2016. The BoM financing to the subsidized housing mortgage program, however, continued
to grow from MNT 1.7 trillion one year ago to MNT 2.4 trillion in September, including MNT 1.6 trillion of
securitized mortgage loans that were transferred to BoM’s balance sheet from commercial banks. The
BoM also provided a MNT 350 billion liquidity support to the corporate sector late 2014 via banks. With
the growing housing mortgage program and the one-off corporate sector financial support, outstanding
policy loans provided by the BoM still remains substantial, reaching over MNT 3 trillion in September or
22 percent of total domestic credit of the economy. (Figure 23)

The dynamics in the composition of reserve money (or monetary base) illustrate the effect of the
monetary and fiscal policies in the past years. Changes in the net foreign assets of the central bank,
its foreign asset holdings less its foreign liabilities, show the contractionary effect of BoM’s foreign
exchange market interventions on the reserve money supply. BoM’s net foreign assets have been
steadily declining since the end of 2012 when the US$ 1.5 billion proceeds of the Chinggis bond boosted
official international reserves to above US$ 4 billion. Continuous foreign exchange market interventions
by the central bank, however, have reduced the monetary base by absorbing local currency liquidity back
into the central bank vault. The net foreign assets turned negative in 2015 as the central bank foreign
liabilities exceed its foreign assets. The reserve money supply from BoM’s quantitative eas ing (QE)
programs is reflected in the central bank claims on non-government entities which include the financial
sector and the corporate sector. In 2013-14, the monetary base has expanded by more than MNT 4 trillion
due to central bank’s direct liquidity injection to the financial and the corporate sector, accounting for 40
percent of total domestic credit increase of the economy over the same period. Another main factor
behind reserve money supply in the past two years was DBM’s off -budget expenditures financed by the
Chinggis bond proceeds. In December 2012, US$1.5 billion received from the Chinggis bond was placed
(as tugrik deposits) at the central bank, which did not have an immediate monetary supply impact as it
was off-set by a large increase of government deposits (i.e., a big drop in net claims on the government
at end-2012). However, reserve money supply by the government began to expand in mid-2013 as the

                                                                         19
Chinggis bond proceeds were injected into the economy via DBM’s off-budget expenditures, shown in
steady declines in the net claims on the government. The combination of central bank’s quantitative
easing programs and large public spending accelerated the reserve money growth to over 50 percent
(y/y) by the end of 2013. (Figure 24)

Reserve money growth has considerably slowed in 2015. The growth of reserve money or monetary
base began to slow in mid-2014 and remained in a negative territory in most of 2015 due to: (i) declines
in the net foreign assets of the central bank with continued foreign exchange market interventions; (ii) the
phasing-out of the Price Stabilization Program by the central bank; and (iii) the slower reserve money
supply from the government sector amid tighter fiscal conditions. Reserve money growth experienced a
large fluctuation in July and September, reflecting fresh reserve money flows from new external borrowing
and repayment during the period. (Figure 25)

    The banking sector remains under strain with tighter funding conditions and
    deteriorating asset quality.

The year-on-year growth of outstanding bank loans declined to 4.3 percent 2 in September from 18
percent nine months ago. Bank loan growth rapidly accelerated in 2013 and early 2014 on the back of
quantitative easing programs, reaching 60 percent (y/y) in early 2014. As bank loans almost doubled in one
and a half years, the share of BoM credit among total liabilities (or sources of funding) of commercial banks
sharply rose to 21 percent at the end of 2013 from a mere two percent in late 2012. (Figure 26) Growing
dependence on central bank financing became a substantial downside risks to the banking system as
commercial bank’s balance sheet became significantly vulnerable to an inevitable tapering of quantitative
easing programs. In late 2014, the downside risk began to materialize, with bank loan growth steeply
declining as the pace of liquidity injection by the central bank slowed compared with the previous period. In

 Our definition of outstanding loans includes mortgage loans that have been securitized by the Mongolia
Mortgage Corporation since 2013. 90% of the securitized mortgage lo ans (RMBSs) were transferred to BoM’s
balance sheet from commercial banks and are now excluded from commercial banks’ balance sheet.

Funding conditions of banks have considerably tightened. In 2013 and early 2014, massive central
bank funding bolstered banking sector liquidity but the strong deposit growth remained a significant source
of funding for banks. Since late 2014, customer deposit growth has substantially weakened, straining the
banking system liquidity. Local currency deposits have been particularly weaker, showing a negative growth
since March compared with its level of the last year. The growth of foreign currency deposits – which
account for 33 percent of total deposits – has been robust both in US$ and local currency values. External
funding of the banking system substantially increased in May due to fresh liquidity provided by a sovereign-
guaranteed bond issuance of one commercial bank. However, this increased liquidity was mostly absorbed
by increasing excess reserves so far, with only limited impacts on bank loan growth due to weaker loan
demands amid the slowing economy.

Loan-to-deposit ratio still remains high at 125 percent with loan growth exceeding deposit growth.
Loan-to-deposit (LTD) ratio, which is commonly used to assess bank liquidity capacity against possible
withdrawals of deposits, rose from 100 percent at the end of 2012 to 135 percent late 2014 due to large

increases in policy loans funded by the central bank. LTD ratio has been gradually declining with the
withdrawal of PSP loans and slower loan growth, but still remains high with the loan growth exceeding the
deposit growth.

Reserve buffers of the banking system are tighter. Bank reserves excluding central bank bills stood at
19.1 percent of total deposit in September, well above the 12 percent reserve requirement ratio. However,
bank excess reserves have been on a declining trend since early 2014. Tighter excess reserve conditions

Inter-bank market funding costs have been rising. The interbank market rates have been on the rise
since mid-2014 with two hikes in the central bank policy rate in July 2014 and February 2015, from 10.5
percent to 13 percent. Overnight loan rates hiked to 13.7 percent in September from 10.9 in June last year.
Reflecting tighter bank liquidity, the one-year government bond yield also rose to over 16 percent in April
from around 10 percent one year ago. Government bond yields, however, have been gradually falling since
April to 14.4 percent in September, possibly reflecting increased excess reserves since May. Bank deposit
rates are gradually rising amid tighter funding conditions and increased competition to attract deposits.
Domestic currency deposit rates – which were stable at 12.2 percent on average in most of 2014 – have
risen to 13.1 percent in September. Higher deposit rates amid stronger competition among banks would
increase banks’ funding costs and likely push up lending rates in the coming months. Bank lending rates
have also gradually risen in 2015 reflecting growing funding costs. Weighted average lending rates of new
domestic currency loans rose to 20.1 percent in August from 18-19 percent late 2014. However, the
responsiveness of bank lending rates to policy rate changes and inter-bank market conditions have been
limited, possibly due to: (i) substantial loans were issued at fixed subsidized rates under the Price
Stabilization Program and the housing mortgage program; and (ii) the lending rates of commercial loans
seem to have been more affected by deposit rates.

to agriculture and manufacturing remained relatively stable. These sectors have experienced a stable loan
growth even during the excessive credit boom period. Agriculture and manufacturing loans increased by
23.3 percent and 2.7 percent respectively in the third quarter, compared with the same period last year, in
sharp contrast with other key sectors. Diverging credit conditions imply that banks became more cautious
in originating loans to such sectors that are more vulnerable to shocks and have been more dependent on
policy-driven credit support. (Figure 34)

Mortgage loans continued to expand at more than 30 percent annual growth with central bank
funding to the subsidized housing mortgage program. Total outstanding mortgage loans increased by
27 percent in September compared with one year ago and by 16.7 percent over the first nine months this
year. The subsidized housing mortgage program has been driving the mortgage credit boom over the last
two years. Mortgage loans that were originated under the housing mortgage program have reached MNT
2,481 billion in September, accounting for 75 percent of total mortgage loans. Meanwhile, MNT 1,746 billion
of housing mortgage loans were securitized into Residential Mortgage Backed Securities (RMBSs) via
Mongolia Ipotek Corporation (MIK), and the BoM purchased 90 percent of the RMBSs. (Figure 35)

The recent announcement to further boost the mortgage loan demand risks worsening credit quality
of new mortgage loans. The Government announced in August to reduce the down-payment requirement
of mortgage loans from 30% to 10%, by issuing DBM guarantees on the reduced 20% down payment. This
measure intends to boost the gradually slowing mortgage loan demand, thus supporting the property market
and the construction industry. This measure, however, would likely lower the quality of new mortgage loans
by expanding the loan eligibility to borrowers with higher credit risks.

Asset quality deterioration of banks has accelerated. The non-performing loans (NPLs) of banks rose
by 34 percent in the first nine months of the year, reaching MNT 830 billion in September. (Figure 36) The
ratio of NPLs to total outstanding loans, which was relatively stable in 2014, has also been rising fast in
2015. The NPL ratio rose from 5 percent at the end of 2014 to 7.0 percent in September. (Figure 37) The
NPL ratio excluding the NPLs of banks that are in a liquidation process showed a similar trend, climbing to
5.1 percent from 3.1 percent over the same period. A steeper increase in past-due loans is alarming. Past-
due loans – which are over-due for less than 90 days – increased more than twofold in the first nine months,
reaching MNT 829 billion in September from MNT 317 billion at the end of last year. The loan share of past-
due loans reached 7.1 percent in September, a substantial increase from 2.2 percent at the end of 2014.

In response to deteriorating asset quality, several measures were taken to improve the resilience
of the banking system. In July-August 2014, the central bank announced measures to strengthen
prudential regulations. These measures included: (i) imposing higher risk weights (120 percent) on foreign
currency loans to unhedged borrowers; and (ii) raising the general provisioning ratio of normal loans to one
percent from zero. In April 2015, the BoM announced to raise the minimum paid-in capital requirement for
banks from MNT 16 billion to MNT 50 billion, effective from 2016 for systemically important banks and from
2018 for small banks.

 Box 3. Draft Monetary Policy Guideline for 2016

 The new Monetary Policy Guideline for 2016 was submitted to the parliament by the Bank of Mongolia on Oct
 1, 2015. The policy guideline proposed the following measures:

   a. Monetary policy
             To aim inflation at 7 percent by the end of 2016, and 5 to 7 percent in 2017-2018
             To phase out the Price Stabilization Program and transfer the program to the government
             To implement the housing mortgage program until the government takes over the program
             To maintain the exchange rate flexibility in alignment with macroeconomic fundamentals to support
              domestic production, exports and overall competitiveness of the economy.

   b. Banking supervision
             To maintain capital adequacy and financial stability by off-site and on-site monitoring and necessary
              corrective measures.
             To improve the banking supervision and prudential regulations following recommendations of
              international organizations, including bringing regulations on capital adequacy and risk-weights to
              international standards and strengthening loan classifications.

   c. Development of financial infrastructure and institutions
       To improve the payments and settlement system in cooperation with the international organizations.
       To work on a legal framework for an asset management institution to manage growing NPLs.
       To improve the financial literacy of the general public

   d. The monetary policy guideline pointed out that there is limited room for increasing money supply
      through net domestic assets. It noted that increasing net domestic assets would escalate pressures
      on the exchange rate, particularly with declining FDI and exports, balance of payments imbalances, and
      large budget deficit. The guideline expects that money supply and credit growth would gradually recover
      in 2016 as the construction of OT underground mine begins with substantial FDI inflows.

 Adjustment in the current account continues with import compression.

The current account deficit continues to narrow. The current account deficit reached an unsustainable
level in 2011-2013, averaging 25 percent of GDP, with rapid increases in imports of both investment and

consumption goods. Since 2014, the current account has been undergoing a sharp adjustment as imports
continued to drop amid weakening FDI inflows and rapid exchange rate adjustments. The current account
deficit declined to 11.7 percent of GDP in 2014 from 25 percent of GDP the previous year, led by a 14.4
percent drop in imports. (Figure 40) Adjustment in the current account has intensified in 2015. The current
account deficit narrowed to US$ 486 million in the first nine months, a sharp reduction from US$ 1.4 billion
in the same period of the previous year.

An increasing trade surplus has significantly improved the current account balance. The trade
surplus (Free-On-Board terms) rose to US$ 957 million in the first nine months from a US$ 318.3 million
surplus during the same period one year ago. The services account deficit also narrowed to US$ 610 million
in the same period from US$ 1,214 million the previous year. The deficits in transportation, travel, and other
services all declined compared with a year ago, reflecting the weakening external trade and slowing
domestic demand. The deficit in the income account, however, widened to US$ 964 million from US$ 691
million over the same period, with growing investment income payments on external debt and foreigin direct
investment. (Figuer 41)

Tighter economic policies and exchange rate adjustments have contributed to the correction of
large external imbalances. Economic policies have been tighter in 2015, adjusting domestic demand to a
weak exernal account. Domestic credit growth substantially slowed on the back of the tighter monetary
policy stance including the phasing out of the PSP loans. Budget spending growth also slowed amid large
revenue shortfalls, tightening the government consumption and investment compared with the previous
year. Higher import prices induced by a 40 precent depreciation in the nominal exchange rate since mid-
2013 have also significantly contributed to the current account adjustment, by encouraging consumers to

A sharp drop in imports has been driving the improvement in trade and current accounts while
exports have been hard hit by the weak commodity market. Imports dropped by 29.4 percent in the
first nine months compared with the previous year after a 17.6 percent drop in 2014, amid a continued
dampening of FDI and weak real income growth of households. Exports have weakened throughout the
year with declining commodity prices. Total exports declined by 12 percent in the first nine months on a
year-on-year basis, after displaying a 35 percent increase in 2014 on the back of new copper and gold
production of Oyu Tolgoi mine. The weakening of exports intensified in August and September, with total
exports plunging by 35 percent compared with the same period last year. Terms of trade3 has substantially
deteriorated in recent months with sharp drops in commodity prices.

Continued contraction in coal and oil exports and slowing copper exports drag on Mongolia’s
mineral exports. Coal exports fell by 32 percent in the first nine months compared with the same period




3Terms of trade (TOT) is defined as a relative price of exports measured in terms of imports. The TOT is measured by a ratio of
export price index to import price index, which shows the amount of imported goods that can be purchased by a unit of export
goods. Lower terms of trade mean that the same amount of exports can buy less imported goods which would be used for
domestic consumption or investment.

to China – which absorbed almost all of Mongolia’s coal exports last year – dropped by 34.5 percent
compared with the previous year. However, China still accounted for 96 percent of total coal exports in Jan-
Sep. The growth of copper concentrates exports has substantially declined in recent months, slowing to 1.9
percent in the first nine months. In September, copper concentrates exports fell by 36.7 percent year-on-
year. China purchased 99 percent of Mongolia’s copper concentrates exports. Crude oil exports were hit
hard by lower oil prices, falling by 41.4 percent (y/y) in the first nine months. The export volume of crude oil
increased by 16 percent but the average export price plunged by 49 percent compared with the same period
last year.

Imports have been falling in both capital and consumption goods. Imports of capital goods have been
falling since 2012 as sharp declines in FDI continued to dampen investment demand. In Jan-Sep, imports
of machinery and equipment dropped by 25.6 percent from last year’s level, following a 29.5 percent drop
in 2014. Imports of construction materials fell by 32 percent during the same period. Imports of consumption
goods also have been falling since mid-2014, reflecting slowing consumption demand and substitution
effects towards domestic products with continued exchange rate depreciation. Imports of non-food
consumption goods fell by 17.5 percent and imports of food products dropped by 17 percent in Jan-Sep on
a year-on-year basis. Imports of mineral products plunged by 35.5 percent, reflecting over a 40 percent
drop in oil prices.

 Large external financing mitigated the immediate balance of payments pressure,
 at the cost of higher external debt.

Despite the narrower current account deficit, the balance of payments has been under pressure
from falling FDI. Sharp drops in FDI inflows have been severely undermining the balance of payments
since 2013. Net FDI inflows – which had fully financed the current account deficit in 2011-12 – plummeted
from US$ 4.4 billion in 2012 to US$ 382 million in 2014, far below required financing needs for a large
current account deficit. Foreign direct investment has further weakened in 2015: FDI inflows recorded a
US$ 156.5 million net inflow in the first nine months of 2015, down from US$ 526.4 million in the same
period last year. (Figure 50) Inbound foreign investment via equity investment (US$ 227 million) stayed
close to last year’s level, but a US$ 191 million repayment of inter -company borrowing weighed on the
overall net inflow of foreign direct investment.

In response, considerable external financing was mobilized by the government and the central
bank. Mongolia has heavily relied on external debt-financing since late 2012 to cover the persistent large
current account deficit as foreign investment continued to fall. In the second half of 2014, about US$ 940
million was raised via external debt-financing by the public sector and the central bank. The DBM raised
$462 million under government guarantees including: a US$ 162 million long-term loan from China
Development Bank and a US$300 million syndicated loan from Credit Suisse. The central bank drew down
the equivalent of US$ 482 million from the bilateral currency swap facility with the People’s Bank of China
(PBoC) in the last six months of 2014. Large external debt-financing continued in 2015. US$ 660 million
was newly raised via sovereign and sovereign-guaranteed borrowing in May and June. One commercial
bank raised US$ 500 million in international bonds at a 9.375 percent rate under a sovereign guarantee in
May, which intended to replenish BoM’s international reserves via a five-year currency swap arrangement.
The government also directly raised RMB 1 billion (US$ 161 million) in sovereign dim sum bonds in June,
at a 7.5 percent coupon rate. In addition, the central bank drew down over US$ 630 million from the PBoC
swap facility in the first nine months of the year, pushing the total external debt-financing by the public
sector close to US$ 1.3 billion. (Figure 51)

The large external financing has improved the balance of payments significantly in 2015. A US$ 172
million deficit was recorded in the balance of payments during the first nine months, a significant
improvement from a US$ 743 million deficit in the same period last year. After recording a US$ 320 million
deficit in the first four months in 2015, the balance of payments turned into a US$ 445 million surplus in

May-Aug due to the substantial mobilization of external financing despite the persistent current account
deficit and weak FDI inflows. The balance of payments, however, sharply deteriorated into a US$ 298
million deficit in September, reflecting a US$ 300 million external debt repayment of one commercial bank,
despite a large drawdown on the bilateral currency swap line with the PBoC.

International reserves significantly fell in September. Official gross international reserves rebounded
from US$ 1,267 million in April to US$ 1,728 million in August, reflecting the balance of payments surplus
driven by the large external borrowing. Official gross reserves, however, substantially dropped by more
than US$ 300 million to US$ 1,412 million in September, eroded by the US$ 300 million repayment and
increased interventions of the central bank in the foreign exchange market. The current reserve level is
slightly less than three months of imports of goods and services. (Figure 53).

The improving balance of payments came at the cost of higher external debt. Additional external debt-
financing made in late 2014 and early 2015 pushed Mongolia’s external debt close to 180 percent of GDP
in June 2015, from 162 percent one year ago. (Figure 54) While the intercompany loans to foreign-invested
companies remained stable at around 70 percent of GDP, the external debt of the public sector rapidly rose
over the last twelve months. The ratio of government and government-guaranteed external debt to GDP
hiked to 46.5 percent at the end of June, a sharp rise from 41 percent six months ago and from 36 percent
one year before, largely due to increased guarantees issued to new DBM loans in late 2014 and
international bonds of one commercial bank in May 2015. The central bank foreign liabilities has also been
on a steep rise to 15.3 percent of GDP in June 2015 from 8.5 percent twelve months ago due to continued
debt-financing mostly from the People’s Bank of China. In the meantime, the external debt of the private
sector (excluding the sovereign-guaranteed international bonds of one bank) only moderately rose to 30.4
percent of GDP from 29.5 percent one year ago.

Box 4. High vigilance is needed on growing government debt.

The GDP ratio of general government and government-guaranteed debt – which follows the definition
adopted by the government – more than doubled over the last three years from 24.1 percent in 2011 to
58 percent of GDP in 2014. Public debt – which adds SOE debt and the foreign liabilities of the central
bank to the general government debt – also rapidly climbed to 76.6 percent of GDP in 2014 from 32.7
percent in 2011 in nominal terms.

Sharp rises in external liabilities led the fast growth of government and public debts. External government
debt has risen to 42.7 percent of GDP (US$ 5 billion) last year from 20 percent of GDP (US$ 1.9 billion)
in 2011. (Figure 57) Substantial sovereign and sovereign-guaranteed external borrowing was taken to
finance the off-budget expenditures of the DBM, including the sovereign Chinggis bonds (US$1.5 billion),
DBM Euro bonds (US$ 580 million) and Samurai bonds (JPY30 billion), and the government-guaranteed
external loans of the DBM (over US$ 460 million). Another guarantee worth US$ 122 million was issued
to a state-owned airline (MIAT) to finance the purchase of an airplane. While overshadowed by the faster
growth in external debt, government domestic debt has also risen from 4 percent of GDP to 14 percent
of GDP over the same period as the widening on-budget deficit has been mostly financed by the domestic
capital market. Outstanding government securities increased significantly from MNT 0.8 trillion in 2012
to MNT 2.5 trillion in 2014. External public debt also rose to 55 percent of GDP in 2014 from 23 percent
in 2011, due to the growing foreign liabilities of the central bank in addition to the increasing government
external debt.

External government debt structure has rapidly changed towards non-concessional debt. Debt to
multilateral and bilateral creditors, which are mostly on concessional terms, accounted for almost 90
percent of public external debt until 2012. Commercial borrowing has risen substantially since late 2012
as the government and the DBM heavily relied on external commercial borrowing to finance their growing
spending needs. Debt to commercial creditors, including guarantees issued to DBM’s external borrowing,
rose to 24 percent of GDP in 2014 from almost none three years ago while the concessional debt
remained stable at around 18 percent of GDP over the same period. (Figure 56) Debt to multilateral and
bilateral creditors now accounts for only one-third of public external debt.

 Exchange rate adjustment has been limited in recent months.

The tugrik has been under heavy depreciation pressure since 2013, with the balance of payments
deficit reaching an unsustainable level. A sharp adjustment in the exchange rate began in mid-2013.
The nominal exchange rate slid by 8 percent against the US$ in August 2013 when the monthly balance of
payments deficit reached its highest level of US$ 337 million amid a large current account deficit and falling
FDI inflows. Since then through early 2015, the exchange rate stayed on a deprecation trend as the external
imbalance persisted and the FDI prospects continued to deteriorate. Between March 2013 and March 2015,
the local currency value fell by 40 percent against the US$ in nominal terms, from MNT 1,410 to MNT 1,984
per US$. Amid escalating depreciation pressures, the central bank continued to supply foreign exchanges
to banks from its reserves via foreign exchange auctions, with net sales of foreign exchanges reaching over
US$3 billion in 2013-14.

The rate of currency depreciation slowed in recent months despite the weakening currencies of
commodity-dependent economies against the US$. The depreciation trend was reversed in April and
May as the tugrik strengthened by around 7 percent to MNT 1,862 per US$ amid positive developments on
the second phase development of Oyu Tolgoi mine and the issuance of a $500 million international bond
by one commercial bank. As the tugrik appreciation accelerated in late May and early June, the central
bank purchased foreign exchange from banks in early June. Since June, the exchange rate came back
under depreciation pressure as the positive market sentiment buoyed by the agreement on the Oyu Tolgoi
mine development gradually waned and the global commodity market weakened. The tugrik depreciated
by 7 percent between mid-June and end-July, sliding back to MNT 1,985 per US$. As the exchange rate
approached MNT 2,000 per US$, the central bank has supplied a large amount of foreign currencies via
foreign exchange auctions since July, which kept the exchange rate in the range of MNT 1,900-2,000 in
recent months. (Figure 60) As a result, the tugrik depreciated by 5.5 percent in Jan-Oct and by only 1.4
percent in June-Oct against the US$, a far stronger performance compared with the currencies of other
commodity-dependent economies. Most of the currencies in other commodity dependent countries
depreciated at a faster rate than the tugrik in 2015, ranging from 55 percent (Kazakhstan) to 11.4 percent
(Botswana) between Jan-Oct. The currency depreciation in the commodity-dependent economies further
accelerated since July, reflecting the deteriorating commodity market conditions. The local currencies of
Indonesia and Malaysia, which are major resource-rich countries in the region, weakened by 8.3 percent
and 21.8 percent against the US$ in the first ten months of the year. (Figure 59)

The nominal and real effective exchange rates have strengthened since late 2014. The nominal
effective exchange rate (NEER) and the real effective exchange rate (REER) 4 began to appreciate since
late 2014 with slower rate of nominal currency depreciation. The NEER and REER moderately weakened
early this year but has been back on an appreciation trend since April reflecting the strong performance of
the tugrik relative to other currencies. (Figure 61)

4The nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) is a weighted average of exchange rates with major trading partners. The real
effective exchange rate (REER) further adjusts the NEER by accounting for Mongolia’s relative inflat ion level to those of trading
partners. The NEER and REER are measured as an index and regarded as a measurement of the competitiveness of the local
currency, accounting for changes in currency values and inflations of trading partners.

 Growth is expected to remain weak in 2015-16, but a recovery in foreign
 investment would begin to support the non-mining sector growth

Growth is projected to slow to 2.3 percent in 2015, revised downward from 3.3 percent of the last
projection. The downward revision largely reflects weak crop harvests and the slower-than-expected
industrial production in the third quarter. Mining GDP growth will likely remain in double digits in 2015, but
is expected to moderate in the second half of the year. Non-mining GDP growth is expected to further slow
in the second half as investment and consumption demand remains subdued and FDI stays weak. Weaker
crop harvests due to severe droughts are expected to slow agricultural production. There is a risk that
agriculture could be hit harder by weaker crop harvests and harsher winter weather conditions.

There is a risk that the agricultural production could be hit harder by harsher weather conditions in
the coming winter. Mongolia experienced a severe drought in the summer, which reduced cereal crop
harvests substantially during the main harvest season. Continuation of poor harvests in the rest of the year
would further dampen agricultural production, which accounted for 14 percent of GDP in 2014. Each 20
percent further drop in crop harvest would reduce the GDP growth by around 0.4 percentage points from
the baseline projection. There is also an increasing concern about possible harsh winter conditions which
could jeopardize the livestock sector in late 2015 and early 2016. The baseline projections assume no
significant shocks to the livestock sector as the winter weather conditions remain uncertain. However, each
10 percent drop in livestock production could reduce the GDP growth by 1 percentage point from the
baseline projection.

Growth is expected to further slow to 0.8 percent in 2016 due to a sharp contraction in mining
production, despite a gradual recovery of the non-mining sector. Mining production is projected to
decline in 2016-17 with lower mineral concentration in ores produced by OT mine and the weak global
commodity market conditions. Mining production is expected to pick up from 2018, on the back of a gradual
recovery in the commodity market and an improvement in the ore quality of OT mine. Non-mining GDP
growth is expected to gradually recover in 2016 after a sharp slowdown in 2015. The non-mining sector of
the economy will likely remain weak in early 2016, but a recovery in foreign investment in the mining sector
is expected to support the industries supplying goods and services needed for large scale mining
investment projects in the latter of half of the year.



 The fiscal outlook remains weak with the prospect of a slow
 revenue recovery.

The revenue projections of the current fiscal plans for 2015-16 may be difficult to achieve on
account of optimistic assumptions and challenging revenue mobilization plans. Non-mining budget
revenues are expected to gradually recover in 2016 as consumption and import-related taxes pick up in
tandem with increased FDI inflows. However, a drop in commodity exports is likely to continue to dampen
mining-related tax revenues in the next couple of years which accounts for more than 20 percent of total
revenues. Some of the key revenue mobilization measures for 2015-16 may also prove challenging,
including the collection of significant tax arrears this year amid a sharp slowdown of the economy, an
optimistic assumptions of a strong coal export increase and an ambitious privatization plan for 2016.

                                                     34
Accounting for these uncertainties, potential budget revenue shortfalls could reach over MNT 100 billion in
2015 compared with the second supplementary budget, and up to MNT 400 billion in 2016 compared with
the draft 2016 budget. Assuming the current spending plans of the government for 2015-16, the budget
deficit following the FSL definition – which includes the budgetary projects of the DBM – is expected to stay
over 5 percent of GDP in 2015-16, a higher deficit path than the medium term deficit ceilings of the FSL.

The consolidated budget deficit – which adds DBM’s commercial portfolio to the FSL-defined
budget deficit – is expected to decline to 8-9 percent of GDP in 2015 and 6-7 percent of GDP in 2016,
from 11 percent of GDP in 2014. The DBM is expected to provide about MNT 600 billion to its commercial
portfolio in 2015, and to further reduce its commercial spending to MNT 300-400 billion in the next couple
of years due to tight financing conditions. Under these assumptions, the commercial projects financed by
the DBM is expected to be around 3 percent of GDP in 2015, and decline to 1-1.5 percent of GDP in 2016.




 The balance of payments prospects remain weak and the economy is
 vulnerable to shocks
Despite the recent improvement led by large external financing, the balance of payments will likely
remain in deficit in 2015. Although the current account deficit is expected to significantly narrow to about
5 percent of GDP in 2015, a sharp drop in mineral exports and a large deficit in the services and income
accounts will likely keep the current account in the red in the coming months. With weak capital inflows, a
continued current account deficit would translate into a deficit in the balance of payment, unless further
external financing is mobilized.

Mongolia’s external positions are expected to come under elevated pressure in the coming years,
with the widening current account deficit. A continued drop in mineral exports is expected to
substantially increase the deficit in the current account in the next couple of years. Although a recovery in
foreign capital inflows could provide some buffers, growing current account deficit is likely to strain the
balance of payments in the coming years. Compounding the external vulnerabilty is the first large
repayment of public external debt in 2017 amounting to US$ 1,080 million, which will pose significant
challenges to the fiscal and external accounts.

The weak balance of payments will continue to erode international reserves. After rebounding from
US$ 1,267 million in April to US$ 1,728 million in August on the back of large external borrowing, the gross
reserves of the central bank dropped by over US$300 million in September to US$1,412 million, reflecting
the balance of payments pressure and increased foreign exchange market interventions. Foreign exchange
buffers would likely stay under growing pressure in the coming months and the next couple of years unless
a significant correction of external imbalances is made through tighter economic policies and continued
exchange rate adjustment.

Higher external debt makes the economy more vulnerable to external volatilities. As a result of new
external debt-financing, public and publicly guaranteed external debt is expected to climb to over 60 percent
of GDP by the end of 2015. With higher external debt, the fiscal accounts and the balance of payments
became more exposed to external shocks, particularly to an abrupt exchange rate depreciation and a
sharper tightening of external financing conditions. Each 10 percent further depreciation of the exchange
rate against the US$ in 2016 from the baseline scenario is estimated to raise external public debt valued in
tugriks by additional 5 percentage points of GDP in 2016.

 Meanwhile, substantial external downside risks lie ahead

The growth of China, the main trade partner to Mongolia, is itself subject to uncertainty. The East
Asia and Pacific Economic Report of the World Bank (October 2015) assumes that China’s growth will slow
to 6.9 percent in 2015 from 7.4 percent in 2014, and moderate to 6.7 percent in 2016 and 6.5 percent in
2017. Continued reforms will support a further rebalancing of domestic demand. Investment will
decelerate, owing to tighter credit and more subdued property sector conditions. However, the baseline
projections for China’s economy in 2016 and beyond are subject to considerable uncertainty. The pace of
the slowdown will depend on both global developments and domestic structural trends. Continued reforms
are expected to enable further economic restructuring and rebalancing of domestic demand but
accumulated imbalances continue to pose a risk of disorderly adjustments. There is a risk that real and
financial vulnerabilities in the Chinese economy cause a sharper-than expected slowdown in spending,
especially investment.

Slower than expected growth in China would exacerbate downward pressures on the commodity
market. China’s growth moderation and rebalancing to date have already exerted a significant negative
impact on international commodity prices. Even under the baseline scenario, the broad weakness in
commodity prices is expected to persist for the rest of 2015 and most commodity prices are projected to
only moderately recover in the coming years. Additional reductions in Chinese demand would likely further
reduce commodity prices.

A sharper slowdown in China and the commodity market could further undermine Mongolia’s
growth and exacerbate its external risks. Mongolia’s lack of diversification in export products and trade
partners leaves the economy highly vulnerable to a further slowdown in China and the commodity market.
In 2014, exports constituted 48 percent of total production of Mongolia and China absorbed 87.9 percent
of Mongolia’s total exports. Compounding Mongolia’s vulnerability is its high export concentration in
commodities. Commodity exports accounted for 82 percent of total exports and 35 percent of GDP in 2014.
Copper concentrates alone constituted 37 percent of total exports in 2014 and is projected to account for
almost half of total exports by 2017. Almost all of copper concentrates have been exported to China. Coal
exports – almost fully purchased by China – constituted 13 percent of total exports in 2014. A sharp drop
in coal exports to China has been a significant drag on Mongolia’s economy and the external accounts in
the first nine months of 2015. A 10 percent drop in copper and coal export revenues from the baseline
projection would widen Mongolia’s current account deficit by more than 3 percentage points of GDP in
2016.

There is also a risk that a U.S. monetary policy normalization may trigger abrupt market reactions.5
The baseline projections of the World Bank’s regional report (EAP Update, October 2015) assume a
gradual, smooth tightening of external financing conditions, with an orderly normalization of monetary policy
in the United States as the shift in U.S. monetary policy has long been anticipated and the normalization is
likely to occur gradually, and only if the U.S. economy remains robust. However, there is a risk that the U.S.
policy rate “lift-off” will instead trigger abrupt market reactions, causing currencies to depreciate sharply,
bond spreads to rise steeply, and liquidity to tighten.

A possible heightened volatility in the international financial market could further deteriorate
external financing conditions for developing countries that have relied on debt-financing, including
Mongolia. The East Asia and Pacific Outlook of the World Bank (October 2015) pointed out that Mongolia
is one of the countries that is most vulnerable to the possibility of a sharp tightening in external financing
conditions. Mongolia has increasingly relied on external debt-financing to finance current account deficits
over the last three years and will face significant future debt rollovers in 2017 and beyond. A sharp tightening
in external financing conditions could make it more difficult or costly to mobilize external finance needed for

increase the cost of servicing foreign-currency denominated debt which now stands close to 180 percent
of GDP.

Mongolia’s external financing conditions have considerably tightened in recent years. The
benchmark yield of the ten-year sovereign bond of Mongolia (Chinggis bond) has sharply risen from 5.2
percent in December 2012 to around 8.5 percent in early October 2015, an over 300 basis-point increase.
The Chinggis bond had been issued at the end of 2012 under extraordinarily favorable market conditions:
ample financial liquidity injected by quantitative easing measures in major economies increased investment
appetite for higher-yield markets, particularly for emerging economies including Mongolia. The financing
conditions, however, became substantially tighter in 2013 amid growing concerns on possible hikes in the
U.S. policy rate. Mongolia’s ten-year sovereign bond yield also picked up in mid-2013 with a global
tightening and has experienced wide fluctuations following major economic and political developments
since then. The bond yield dropped to close to 6 percent in June, reflecting positive investment sentiment
formed with the agreement on the second phase development of Oyu Tolgoi mine, but the benchmark yield
has steeply risen since July. Fluctuations in Mongolia’s bond spreads – which measure the country risk
premium demanded by investors – have been wider compared with other countries with similar credit
ratings, reflecting uncertainty in investor sentiment towards Mongolia. (Figure 69)

Macroeconomic policy needs to stay focused on restoring sound economic
management
High external and fiscal vulnerabilities and substantial downside risks demand a continued policy
adjustment to restore prudent economic management. Mongolia’s long-term economic prospects
remain promising with and increasingly educated population and vast potential from mineral wealth waiting
to be materialized in the future. In the short-term, however, the economy faces significant challenges.
External financing needs for current account deficit and external debt repayments are expected to grow in
the next couple of years, elevating pressures on the balance of payments. The economy remains vulnerable
to possible external shocks from a sharper downturn in China and the global minerals market. External
financing conditions will likely stay much tighter than in the previous years. Meanwhile, the country lacks
fiscal and external buffers to counter possible shocks with public debt reaching almost 80 percent of GDP
and international reserves declining. The economy is slowing but it reflects an inevitable adjustment in
domestic demand to external imbalances, falling FDI and a negative terms of trade shock. Growing external
and fiscal vulnerabilities call for a continued adjustment on the fiscal and monetary policies to manage
domestic demand at a level that can be sustained without risking balance of payments stability, particularly
considering its high import dependence. Exchange rate flexibility would help correct external imbalances
and safeguard reserve buffers. Revitalizing foreign investment would significantly help reduce the external
risks, mitigate contractionary pressures from policy adjustment, and help materialize the economy’s long-
term growth potential. A combination of prudent macro-economic management and an enhanced
investment climate would strengthen market confidence and replenish policy buffers, thereby building more
favorable external financing conditions for future debt repayment. The recently released Doing Business
2016 report of the World Bank shows that Mongolia’s investment climate continues to improve but there
are areas of further improvement.7

Room for expansionary policy to support growth is limited as the current economic slowdown
largely stems from falling FDI and weakening external demand. External demand is weakening due to
a continued dampening of the commodity market and slower growth in China, translating into a drop in
exports. Domestic demand is slowing largely because of the decline in investment with falling FDI. Declining
investment and weaker mining exports are translating into sluggish real household income growth and
slower consumption. With external demand under pressure from weak global economic conditions, growth
stimulus measures would have to rely on boosting domestic demand by increasing budget spending or
loosening monetary policies. Stronger domestic demand buoyed by expansionary policies, however, would
not be sustainable as it would inevitably be accompanied by higher imports, thereby exacerbating the
balance of payments risks. Loosening fiscal and monetary policies would come at the cost of higher public
external debt and weaker financial soundness, and would further reduce policy buffers that can be used to
counter possible shocks. With weak foreign investment and external demand, the growth impact of policy

stimulus measures would likely be limited and temporary while further elevating the external and fiscal
vulnerabilities of the economy.



Steps have been taken but further actions are needed
Major steps were taken to restore sound economic management framework. The Government
adopted a Comprehensive Macro Adjustment Plan (CMAP) in February with the broad-based political
support of a grand coalition. The CMAP aims to improve the macroeconomic policy framework, while calling
for reducing the balance of payments pressure by unlocking FDI inflows for large foreign investment
projects. Under the CMAP, the government revised the 2015 budget in January to include a large portion
of DBM’s off-budget expenditures, contain the structural budget deficit within 5 percent of GDP, and reduce
the budget deficit to less than 2 percent of GDP by 2018. The monetary policy has tightened, withdrawing
the policy loans that were issued to the Price Stabilization Program in 2013-14. A major development was
made to revive FDI from 2016 as the prolonged negotiation on OT’s underground mine development was
concluded.

Recovery in FDI would help the policy reforms to continue with less adjustment costs. Revamped
foreign capital inflows and improved investor sentiment is expected to support the gradual recovery of the
economy in 2016 against weak external demand. This would provide a good opportunity to solidify policy
reform efforts, which otherwise would come at higher adjustment costs. Revitalizing foreign investment
would also help reduce balance of payments risks, and support materializing the economy’s long-term
growth potential. This would require implementing stable and predictable policies and regulations on
investment including the proper implementation of the Investment Law. Clearing the uncertainty over large
foreign investment projects in a swift and transparent manner would also help improve investor sentiment
towards Mongolia.

Further actions need to be considered to strengthen the credibility and effectiveness of policy
adjustment. The key to a successful adjustment of the economy is to ensure the credibility of policy
adjustment. Despite the commitment of the government to policy reforms, implementation risks to policy
reforms are high as the next election approaches. Maintaining reform momentum and a stable investment
environment during the election cycle is an important task to build a solid footing for a stable and sustainable
growth path against possible external and domestic headwinds. Further actions seem necessary in the
coming months to deliver the fiscal outcomes envisioned by the FSL, to normalize the monetary policy away
from quasi-fiscal operations, and to strengthen the social safety net to protect the poor and vulnerable.



Fiscal consolidation should continue and high caution is needed for further
external financing
Fiscal consolidation efforts should continue. Reducing the budget deficit and consolidating off-budget
expenditures should remain a primary target of the fiscal policy adjustment agenda in the coming years,
particularly in light of growing debt and the volatile external environment.


      Credible fiscal adjustment plans for 2015 and 2016 are needed to restore the prudent fiscal
       path envisioned by the Fiscal Stability Law (FSL). The 2016 budget should adhere to the fiscal
       targets demanded by the FSL, based on realistic revenue projections. One of the major tasks
       needed to adopt a credible 2016 fiscal plan would be avoiding overstated revenue projections which
       have led to repeated downward budget revisions in previous years. Non-tax revenue mobilization

                                                      40
        measures need to be carefully reviewed to ensure proper implementation. A spending prioritization
        plan would also be needed, including giving the highest priority to maintaining or strengthening the
        social safety net.

      Including the commercial portfolio of the DBM would strengthen the credibility and
       effectiveness of the fiscal consolidation plan. The 2015 budget brings the budgetary portfolio
       of the DBM onto the budget and monthly implementation of DBM’s budgetary projects are now
       reported along with other expenditures of the general government, a significant improvement
       compared with previous years. The commercial portfolio of the DBM, however, still remains outside
       the control of the FSL. The commercial loans, which include substantial corporate loans that are
       under government guarantees and financial support to state owned enterprises, are expected to
       reach 3 percent of GDP in 2015. This raises a concern about the effectiveness of the fiscal plan as
       the commercial projects could still function as an off-budget spending channel. All of the
       commercial projects of the DBM have been and will likely be financed by sovereign or sovereign-
       guaranteed borrowing. Considering the significant fiscal implications, excluding the commercial
       portfolio of the DBM could undermine the credibility and effectiveness of the medium-term fiscal
       plan.


Monetary policy should stay focused on maintaining price stability and reducing
external vulnerability
The tightened monetary policy stance since late 2014 has contributed to stabilizing inflation and
narrowing the current account deficit. Continued commitment to price stability would help address
upside risks to inflation and firmly stabilize high inflation expectations towards the central bank’s target
inflation. The central bank’s policy tools to stabilize prices, however, would more appropriately be limited to
conventional monetary operations and avoid liquidity injection to select industries through a quasi-fiscal
program such as the Price Stabilization Program. Measures to address supply-side constraints could be
needed in times of severe supply shocks, but such measures would be more appropriately handled by the
government budget. Excessive intervention in the foreign exchange market against market fundamentals
is unlikely to be a sustainable measure to contain inflation, as the pressures on the exchange rate would
likely build up amid the weak external accounts prospects while available foreign exchanges buffers would
continue to decline due to interventions.

Existing quasi-fiscal operations financed by the BoM should be phased out and transferred to the
government. The phasing out of the Price Stabilization Program, already underway, should continue. The
central bank’s financing of the subsidized housing mortgage program should also phased out and, instead,
the program should be transferred to the government where it competes with other policy needs. These
policy lending programs were launched in late 2012 and 2013 when the political demand for higher
spending mounted. As the budget revenue growth gradually slowed amid declining FDI and the weakening
exports, the currency issuance power of the central bank was seen as a reliable financing source that could
be tapped to support growing spending demand without revenue constraints. This demand was particularly
high with the subsidized housing mortgage program as a previous mortgage program financed by the
government had to be stopped due to revenue shortages. Such quasi-fiscal lending programs implemented
by the central bank blurs the boundary between central bank’s balance sheet and the government budget,
thereby undermining the role of the central bank as an independent keeper of the price stability. New policy
lending programs to support specific industries or policy objectives, if needed, should be implemented by
the government budget, competing with other spending priorities within the fiscal disciplines of the FSL.

Transparency of the central bank’s monetary operations needs to be further enhanced. Transparent
communication of the central bank with the market would enhance the credibility of the monetary authorities.


                                                      41
While conventional monetary operations have been largely transparent and publicly disclosed,
transparency of some non-conventional policy lending operations has been limited. In the same context,
the Bank of Mongolia Law does not have any legal basis for the Monetary Policy Committee which is a key
decision-making body of central banks in most countries. The function of the Mongolia Policy Committee
needs to be strengthened, including providing it with the legal authority on key monetary policy decisions.


Exchange rate flexibility needs to be enhanced

Enhanced exchange rate flexibility will help buffer possible shocks and help the economy better
adjust to external imbalances. Depreciation of the exchange rate both in nominal terms and real trade-
weighted terms significantly contributed to narrowing the current account deficit in late 2013 and 2014, and
would help the economy adjust to weaker terms of trade going forward. Exchange rate adjustment would
also cushion shocks to the fiscal accounts, export revenues, and corporate profits in local currency terms.
Recent increased intervention by the central bank may slow the rate of depreciation and imported inflation
in the short term. However, underlying pressure on the currency is likely to build up in light of the weak
balance of payments prospects and the overall weakening of emerging market currencies in recent months.
The cost of intervention is particularly high for a country with inadequate reserves as it requires losses in
reserve buffers. Monetary policy focused on reducing external imbalances combined with a flexible
exchange rate would help ease underlying pressures on the exchange rate and safeguard foreign exchange
buffers.




The safety buffers of the banking system need to be further strengthened

Further actions are needed to shore up the safety buffers of the banking system in light of continued
deterioration of bank asset quality. Strengthening the bank supervision and prudential regulations may
seem pro-cyclical in the short-term, but maintaining loose prudential regulations could prove more costly
should the banking system soundness be continuously eroded by worsening asset quality. Measures that
may be considered include:
           The NPL recognition rules could be further strengthened, in particular by strengthening the rule
            that allows the first-time rescheduled loans to keep current loan classification, thereby not being
            downgraded to past-due loans or NPLs.

           Loan-loss provisioning could be further strengthened, in particular by applying the one percent
            general provisioning to existing loans and imposing higher provisioning ratio in the riskier
            sectors that show faster deterioration of loan quality.
           The PSP loans have been granted zero percent risk-weighting since 2013, which have resulted
            in overstated system-wide capital adequacy ratios. This regulatory forbearance should be
            immediately lifted to enhance the transparency and credibility of the financial statement of the
            banking system. Continuous monitoring and supervision is needed also on banks’
            concentration risks including their lending exposures to related parties and to large borrowers,
            particularly in light of the previous experience with the failure of Savings Bank in late 2013.

Better targeting of the social welfare programs would help strengthen the social
safety net in an economic downturn
The social safety net could be strengthened and made more efficient by better targeting the social
welfare system to the poor and vulnerable. 8 Mongolia has a well-established social welfare system,
which has significant poverty impact but at a high cost due to the weakly poverty-targeted structure.
According to a recent study by the World Bank, the poorest 20 percent received 34 percent of total social
welfare transfers while approximately 30 percent of the benefits was received by the richest two quintiles.
It is important to note that in European and Central Asian countries, the share of total benefits going to the
poorest 20 percent reaches over 40 percent (e.g., Croatia and Kosovo). In the best-performing countries
around the world, the poorest 20 percent receive over 50 percent of total benefits (e.g., Argentina, Panama,
and Peru). The Food Stamp Program currently remains the only poverty-targeted program. There is an
urgent need to strengthen Mongolia’s social welfare programs with povert y reduction as a key objective.
Specific recommendations include the following:

       Consolidate fragmented programs. Small programs could be consolidated by prioritizing
        program design based on the need to provide comprehensive support to the targeted population
        so beneficiaries do not need to access to multiple programs. Also, need-based programs need to
        be strengthened while gradually phasing out entitlement-based programs.

       Make existing social welfare programs poverty-targeted. To contain costs of social welfare
        programs while making them more effective, programs could be made poverty-targeted. For
        example, benefit amounts for the richer quintiles could be reduced or eliminated, using the readily
        available Poverty-Means-Tested (PMT) household database. The government may consider
        redesigning the Child Money Program (CMP). The CMP alone accounts for half of total social
        welfare transfers and redistributes mineral revenues to all children regardless of the income level
        of their families. Better targeting the CMP to the poor based on the PMT database could be
        considered to increase welfare benefits to the poor while the total budget cost remaining intact.

       The new poverty benefit program stipulated in the Social Welfare Law (2012) could be
        considered to replace some of the existing social programs. Allowance for the households in
        need of social welfare assistance was stipulated in the Social Welfare Law in 2012. The new
        allowance is intended to provide a cash benefit to poor households identified by the Integrated
        Household Information Database. This program, however, is yet to be implemented.

Poverty declined from 27.4 percent in 2012 to 21.6 percent in 2014, representing a 5.8 percentage point
decline in poverty. This is an impressive pace of poverty reduction even though it marked a slowdown from
the 11 percentage points reduction observed between 2010 and 2012. The reduction in poverty was highest
in the countryside and rural areas compared to urban areas in general. The highland region experienced
the sharpest decline in poverty (13.2 percentage points) while Ulaanbaatar had the slowest decline, at just
3.5 percentage points (Table 1). Consequently, rural areas accounted for slightly more than half of the
poverty reduction while the highlands in particular accounted for 44 percent of the poverty reduction (see
Figure 70), despite their respective shares of the population in Mongolia being smaller.

Three major factors explain the recent drop in poverty. First, despite the slowdown in 2014, economic
growth remained positive and the economy still grew by about 20 percentage points during 2012-14. Since
many people in 2012 were just below the poverty line (see Figure 71), even moderate growth in income or
consumption could push them above the poverty line. Second, the pattern of growth was more favorable to
the poor, resulting in a higher impact of growth on poverty (see Figure 72). Agriculture cumulatively grew
by 36 percent during 2012-14, and was the fastest growing non-minerals sector with the exception of
financial services and insurance. Growth was, therefore, highest in areas where the poverty incidence was
highest – i.e., in the countryside and highlands regions in particular – delivering significant welfare gains
where it had the largest impact for poverty reduction in the country. Third, gains from economic growth in
previous periods were preserved rather then reversed. Though non-agriculture employment and real wages
stagnated in 2014, they remained above their levels in 2012 (see Figure 73). That meant wage income on

people moving out of poverty than those falling into poverty, which could be attributed to the preservation
of real wages in non-agriculture sectors and continued growth in agriculture.

The data contains some sobering reminders. Many people who escaped poverty are bunched just above
the poverty line. About 11 percent of the population are within 10 percent of the poverty line for example.
Small negative economic shocks can easily push these people back into poverty, implying that more than
a tenth of the population are highly vulnerable and at risk of falling back into poverty. The risks of stalling in
poverty reduction can therefore not be neglected.

Both income and consumption growth slowed down significantly compared to the 2010-12 period, as Figure
72 also shows. Consumption and income growth were very low in urban areas, in particular, indicating
slower welfare gains there. A large part of this decline was expected, as the largest contribution to
consumption growth during 2010-12 was the universal, one-off, HDF transfers made between 2011 and
2012 which could not have been sustained. The other part could be attributed to slower growth in non-
mining sectors outside agriculture, as evidenced by the smaller contribution of the construction,
manufacturing and retail sectors to income growth (see Figure 74).

Growth among the middle class almost came to a halt as consumption growth was below 3 percent for the
top 50 percent of the population and close to zero for the richest 20 percent. This weak growth in
consumption among the middle class exacerbates vulnerability among the population. It portrays weak
domestic demand, which has a negative impact on future growth prospects of the country. This could lead
to a stagnation or deterioration in real wage growth in retail trade and manufacturing sectors, which could
stall poverty reduction in urban areas. This is already manifested in the slower rate of poverty reduction in
Ulaanbaatar.

Inequality declined as evidenced by the decline in the Gini coefficient from 0.34 in 2012 to 0.32 in 2014.
The decline in inequality is a manifestation of higher growth among the poor and the less well-off well
compared to the well-off. Given that consumption growth dropped overall, however, the observed decline
in inequality is not a healthy development. A healthier pattern of declining inequality would be one in which
average consumption growth increases overall, with a relatively higher increase among the less-off.

The Government of Mongolia, through the Ministry of Population Development and Social
Protection (MPDSP) and the General Office of Social Welfare Services (GOSWS), implements some
70 social welfare programs. While some programs are needs-oriented, others are merit-oriented. All
programs are categorically targeted with one exception: the Food Stamp Program, which targets the
poorest 5 percent of the population based on a transparent poverty targeting mechanism, using the Proxy
Means Test (PMT) methodology.10

To reduce fragmentation, the Government wishes to review and consolidate its social welfare
programs into a more effective and efficient system. As an input to the review process, this note
assesses the social welfare program budgets and design and analyzes the coverage and characteristics of
program beneficiaries. The review utilizes an analysis of PMT data and social welfare program
administrative data (henceforth referred to as the SW Admin/PMT database).

Social welfare programs are defined in the Social Welfare Law (2012) and other legislation detailing
the eligibility criteria for beneficiaries. These programs can be categorized into seven program groups
according to the way the programs are administered:
 Social Welfare Pensions
 Social Welfare Allowance
 Social Welfare Services, including Community-based Services and Specialized Care Services
 Social Welfare Service Allowance for the Elderly with State Merit
 Allowance for the Elderly
 Allowance for the Disabled
 Allowance for Mothers and Children

In addition to these social welfare programs, MPDSP also executes the Child Money Program (CMP),
aimed at redistributing mineral wealth to the next generation . The CMP is funded from the Human
Development Fund, separately from the state budget for social welfare. The program provides cash
amounts of MNT 20,000 (approximately USD 11) per month to all children from 0 to 18 years old. Despite
its objectives and the funding source being separate from the social welfare system, since it is implemented
by MPDSP along with other social welfare programs, it is often (although not always) considered to be part
of the social welfare system. Given the CMP’s large fiscal implications, it is considered critical to include it
in this review.

I. Budgets and Expenditures on Social Welfare and Coverage of Programs

In 2013, the government spent 2.78 percent of GDP on cash transfers for social welfare including
the CMP (1.37 percent excluding the CMP). This amount is relatively generous compared to the average
1.6 percent of GDP being spent by developing and emerging countries. It suggests that the government is

committed to allocating adequate fiscal resources for the social welfare of the population. In 2013, the
largest budget allocation for cash benefits by far was for the CMP, comprising approximately half of the
total allocation for cash grants but also covering the largest number of beneficiaries. The second largest
expenditure was for Social Welfare Pensions (MNT 83 billion, approximately USD 50 million 11), followed by
the Allowance for Mothers and Children (MNT 67 billion, approximately USD 40 million 12). The combined
amount for these two larger program groups was still less than two-thirds of the budgeted amount for the
CMP in 2013.

Excluding the CMP, the expenditures for all programs increased slightly between 2010 and 2013,
taking inflation into account (Figure 75). The largest increase was the two-fold increase for Social
Welfare Pensions. The expenditures on Benefits for Pregnant and Lactating Mothers increased about 40
percent between 2011 and 2013, although the budget for Mother Heroes benefits decreased about 45
percent.

In terms of coverage half (49.4 percent) of all individuals in the SW Admin/PMT database received
at least one program benefit when the CMP is included . This coverage of the CMP is impressive
considering that the poverty rate in Mongolia was 27 percent in 2012. Only a handful of developing and
emerging countries have coverage of social welfare benefits higher than the poverty rate (World Bank,
2014). The analysis confirms the overwhelming coverage of the CMP, with 94 percent of children 0-18
years old receiving the program. Interestingly, children 0-18 years old in every quintile received the CMP.

Coverage drops considerably, however, when the CMP is not included, with only 19 percent of the
population receiving at least one program. Beyond the CMP, the vast majority of individuals (81 percent)
did not receive any social welfare program benefits. Around 14 percent received one program, 3.4 percent
received two programs, and just above 1 percent received 3 programs. Only 0.5 percent received four or
more programs.

Social welfare programs were generally pro-poor, with a larger share of the benefits going to the
poorer segment of the population . According to estimates based on the SW Admin/PMT database, the
largest share of total benefits was received by individuals in the lowest social welfare quintiles, estimated
by PMT scores.13 The poorest 20 percent received 34 percent of total social welfare transfers (Figure 76).
On the other hand, approximately 13 percent of the benefits was received by the highest quintile and 17
percent by the second highest quintile. It is important to note that in European and Central Asian countries,
the share of total benefits going to the poorest 20 percent reaches over 40 percent (e.g., Croatia and
Kosovo). In the best-performing countries around the world, the poorest 20 percent receive over 50 percent
of total benefits (e.g., Argentina, Panama, and Peru).

The largest program that contributed to the share received by individuals in the lowest social
welfare quintile was the CMP (16 percent) . As shown in Figure 76, the next highest contributors were
Social Welfare Pensions (9 percent), Social Welfare Transfers including the Food Stamp Program (4
percent), and the Allowance for Mothers and Children (3 percent).

Although      most     programs         were        Figure 76. Percentage of Benefits Received by Individuals, According

were: the Benefits for the Elderly with State       5%

  The analysis of share of benefits received assumes that those who were listed as program beneficiaries in the
administrative data were indeed receiving the full benefit amounts. For cash benefits, the amounts were
annualized according to program design (benefit amounts and payment frequency). For reimbursements, it is
assumed that all beneficiaries received their full amount in the year of the analysis (for programs that are provided
less frequently than once a year), and the average reimbursement amounts were estimated using the 2012
expenditure figures obtained from GOSWS.

II. Program Participation by Beneficiary Type

The elderly: Around 70 percent of pension-aged individuals benefited from at least one social welfare
program, not including social insurance pensions which are not part of this analysis. About 76 percent of
total social welfare benefits received by the elderly went to those who benefited from multiple programs,
which may be a strong indication of the fragmented nature of programs addressing the needs of the elderly.

The disabled: Around 66 percent of the disabled received benefits from at least one social welfare
program. Around 63 percent of the disabled over 16 years old benefited from at least one program, while
87 percent of the disabled under 16 years old benefited from at least one program. Among the disabled
above 16 years of age, Social Welfare Pensions comprised the largest proportion (76 percent) of benefits
that went to the disabled. Around 43 percent of the benefits were received by those benefiting from only
one program (predominantly Social Welfare Pensions), while those benefiting from multiple programs
received a larger share of their benefits from Social Welfare Transfers and the Allowance for the Disabled.

The disabled under 16 years of age are not eligible for Social Welfare Pensions, and 81 percent of all
benefits to this group were provided by the CMP. Although only about one in five disabled children under
age 16 received benefits from three or more programs, when they did, they received a combination of the
CMP, Social Welfare Transfers, and the Allowance for the Disabled.

The poor: Around 62 percent of individuals from households in the poorest quintile (according to PMT
scores) were direct beneficiaries of at least one social welfare program, but the figure dropped to 29 percent
when excluding the CMP. The majority of the poor received only one program —about 64 percent of total
benefits going to the poorest quintile went to beneficiaries who received only one program, including the
CMP. The largest share of benefits for the poor came mainly from the CMP. The Food Stamp Program was
the only program targeted at the poor: All 15,118 household beneficiaries were among the poorest 2.7
percent (according to PMT scores). Among the bottom 2.7 percent, 85.6 percent of households were
beneficiaries of the Food Stamp Program.

III. Policy Recommendations

A. Consolidating Fragmented Programs

Three strategies are recommended in consolidating the existing social welfare programs:
 Consolidate small programs by prioritizing program design based on the need to provide
   comprehensive support to the targeted population so beneficiaries do not need to access multiple
   programs, while taking into account the different needs of male and female beneficiaries, in addition to
   the specific needs of the target group.
 Strengthen programs that are needs-based and gradually phase out entitlement-based programs.
 In the future, consider transferring health-related benefits to be covered by Health Insurance.

B. Making Social Welfare Programs Poverty-Targeted

To contain costs of social welfare programs while making them more effective , programs could be
made poverty-targeted. For example, benefit amounts for the richer quintiles could be reduced or
eliminated, using the readily available PMT database.

The CMP is expected to have a considerable poverty impact, but the level of program expenditures
may be difficult to sustain. As discussed above, the program has wide coverage and a large benefit
amount. At the same time, the total budget for transfers of this program alone was MNT 240 billion
(approximately US$ 130 million) in 2013, accounting for 51 percent of total transfers made through social
welfare programs in Mongolia. Considering the fiscal deficit faced by the government, this level of
expenditures on the CMP may be difficult to sustain.

Taking these facts into account, possible options going forward include:

    Continue the CMP as is as the program is effectively reaching the poor, if the fiscal environment allows
     for the program to continue;
    Introduce program design features to the CMP such that the poor receive larger amounts, while
     maintaining universal coverage of the program. This could be achieved by using the PMT to identify
     children in poor households or through categorical means of providing larger amounts for children in
     households with many (three or more, for example) children. Reallocation of benefits could be done in
     a cost-neutral way or in a way that reduces total program cost:
     o To maintain cost neutrality, the grant amounts reallocated to the poor would be equal to the
          reduction in grant amounts for the better-off.
     o To reduce program cost, the sum of the grant amounts reallocated to poorer children would be
          lower than the sum of grant amounts reduced for better-off children.
    Terminate the CMP and replace it with a new poverty-targeted cash transfer program.
     Termination of the CMP would give the government fiscal space to design a poverty-targeted welfare
     program, with clear poverty alleviation objectives. Two design options could be:
     o Implement the Poverty Benefit program stipulated in the Social Welfare Law (2012). 14 The new
          program would need to provide significant levels of coverage and benefits to compensate for the
          loss of benefits experienced by poor households due to termination of the CMP. The advantages
          are that the program would have a clear poverty alleviation objective, and, depending on coverage




14
 The direct translation of the program title in the Social Welfare Law from Mongolian is: “Benefit for members of
HHs in need for social assistance” (Poverty benefit).

                                                       52
        and benefit amounts, it could lead to considerable budget savings. The disadvantages are that this
        would be a new program, and as with any new program, considerable operational preparation
        would be required.
    o   Add a child benefit component to the new Poverty Benefit Program described above to maintain
        the focus on providing support to the next generation (as in the CMP). Adding a child benefit
        component to the Poverty Benefit Program would increase the complexity of program design as
        the transfer amounts per household would differ according to the number of children.

Introduction of design changes must be accompanied by strengthening of certain features of
program operations, particularly if poverty targeting will be introduced :
     Strong communication campaigns would be critical.
     Introducing targeting, whether through PMT or other categorical means, is bound to introduce
       exclusion error (eligible beneficiaries being excluded). Therefore, an effective grievance redress
       mechanism would be essential.
     Further simulation analysis is recommended to identify the most effective scenario for poverty
       impact.
     If targeting will be conducted through application of the PMT, continued efforts would be needed to
       ensure that the PMT database is up-to-date and complete and addresses grievances from
       individuals regarding their registered level of welfare according to the PMT scores.

C. Increasing the Generosity and Coverage of Poverty-Targeted Program(s)

Currently, total estimated transfer amounts from all programs going to poor households are small .
The average household transfer amount is approximately 12 percent of household consumption at the
poverty line for a household of five members. Most countries provide social welfare benefits that represent
20-35 percent of the poorest households’ post-transfer consumption, although there is considerable
variation worldwide. The most generous countries in the Europe and Central Asia region provide benefits
that represent between 40-55 percent of the poorest households’ post-transfer consumption (World Bank,
2013).

There is an urgent need to focus the attention of social welfare programs in Mongolia on ensuring
that the poor are better protected from economic shocks. Increasing the generosity and coverage of
programs to protect the poor could involve implementing the Poverty Benefit Program as described above
or (in the short term) revamping the Food Stamp Program.

D. Strengthening Active Labor Market Programs that Serve as a Safety Net for the Vulnerable

To provide an effective safety net for vulnerable workers, it would be important to have effective
and robust Active Labor Market Programs. The current social welfare system provides no safety net
support for those who are poor (but not as poor as the bottom 5 percent) or near-poor who do not meet the
eligibility criteria for existing social welfare programs. Laborers with temporary jobs or seasonal jobs do not
qualify for unemployment benefits due to program design, yet they are the ones who may be most affected
by an economic adjustment or other external shocks.

Similarly, for social welfare beneficiaries who are currently unemployed or under-employed, social
welfare programs could be linked with co-responsibilities for able-bodied beneficiaries to engage
in work/skills accumulation activities. Welfare program beneficiaries are entitled to benefits as long as
they remain within the categorical eligibility criteria. While the government needs to increase the generosity
and coverage of poverty-targeted programs, such programs should not create dependency but encourage
beneficiaries to engage in labor. New generation work activation programs could be introduced for welfare


                                                      53
beneficiaries who are unemployed, seasonally unemployed, or underemployed, applying the principles of
“welfare-to-work” transition approaches proven to be effective in many middle-income countries.

E. Strengthen Monitoring and Evaluation of Social Welfare Programs

Stronger program monitoring and evaluation will enable the government to make more informed
policy decisions. To date, no impact assessment of programs has been conducted, and the government
has little understanding of program impact and how the programs can be improved. To help inform future
decisions, the government could:

•   Request the addition of a specific module focused on social protection to the HSES questionnaire, or
    at a minimum request revision of the HSES questionnaire “other income” section to distinguish social
    welfare and social insurance benefits.
•   Fully utilize the social welfare management information system currently under development for
    monitoring purpose.
•   Conduct periodic reviews of programs by analyzing administrative data to inform decision-making.
