1. Project Context, Development Objectives, and Design2

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Millennium Development Goals
By 2006, Kenya required considerable investment to reach the Millennium Development Goal
(MDG) to provide 72.5 percent of the population with safe water supply access. At the time, safe
water coverage in rural areas was just 52 percent. To meet the MDG required adding infrastructure
providing access to an additional 5.6 million rural residents as well as rehabilitation of existing
infrastructure. Infrastructure in suburban areas also required expansion or upgrading. Kenya’s
government budget was unlikely to meet this level of investment (GPOBA 2006).

Community-managed Piped Schemes
In 2002, community-managed piped schemes provided water to about 30 percent of the eight
million rural Kenyans with access to safe water. Communities, self-help groups, the government,
non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and external support agencies provided the investment
capital for these schemes (Njonjo and Lane 2002, pgs. 5-6). Community organizations with
autonomous legal status typically managed these systems (GPOBA 2006).

Water Sector Reform
The government had been implementing reforms in the water sector when this project began. The
2002 Water Act, which established new institutions to take over much of the responsibility for
service provision from the Ministry of Water and Irrigation. The National Water Conservation and
Pipeline Corporation would play the key role in these reforms.

Key organizations mandated under the 2002 Act include:
       Water service providers: The principal types of providers are public utility companies,
        private operators of small piped networks, and community water users’ associations.
       Water Service Boards (WSB): WSBs have the legal mandate to ensure that water and
        sanitation services are delivered within their jurisdictions. WSBs sign service provision
        agreements (SPAs) with water service providers, and monitor SPA compliance.
       Water Services Regulatory Board (WASREB): WASREB is the national regulator
        responsible for tariff setting, quality standards, and licensing for WSBs.
       Water Services Trust Fund (WSTF): This institution provides grant finance for capital
        investment in rural water supplies.
       National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA): This institution provides
        environmental clearances to water service providers.

  This section of a Completion and Results Report (CR) is usually completed using information drawn from the Project
Appraisal Document (PAD). However, a PAD was not prepared for this project, in line with then World Bank
procedures for small trust fund grants. Therefore, this section has been completed instead using information from the
GPOBA Eligibility Note and its review (GPOBA 2006, 2006b), the original grant agreements and their amendments
(IDA 2006, EU 2007, Bruce 2007), and the Operations Manual (K-Rep 2006).

          Water Resources Management Authority (WRMA): This government authority protects and
           conserves water resources. Water service providers must receive a permit from WRMA to
           abstract a designated volume of water.

The above organizations had begun to transfer assets and responsibility for service delivery to
autonomous local service providers at the start of this project (GPOBA 2006, pg. 6).

Country Assistance Strategy
In 2004, the World Bank issued a new Kenya country assistance strategy (CAS), jointly prepared
with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency
(MIGA). The CAS aimed to mobilize private sector participation in the provision and management
of infrastructure, including water supply. It also aimed to build capacity and to expand the services
of financial institutions. The CAS cited several examples of programs involving Bank and IFC
cooperation in promoting private investment in infrastructure building (World Bank 2004, pgs. ii,
2-3, 7, 15, 22-23).

Project Antecedent
K-Rep Bank Ltd, the grant recipient, isa microfinance institution registered as a commercial bank in
Kenya.

Prior to this project, the Water and Sanitation Program Regional Program in Africa (WSP-AF) and
the Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) had collaborated with the Ministry of
Water and Irrigation, the Nairobi Water Services Board and K-Rep Bank to mobilize market-based
funding for small community-managed schemes in Kenya. The work to-date focused on:
          support in developing credit assessment and appraisal tools for community-managed
           schemes;
          assessment of market lending to community-managed schemes in Kenya;
          assessment of the potential for business development services to assist community-
           managed schemes to develop into small water enterprises; and the
          development and assessment of three subprojects for K-Rep appraisal and preliminary loan
           approval (GPOBA 2006, pg. 9).

Project Rationale3
The project aimed to increase access to water supply services by leveraging community equity
with commercial financing, and by managing the viability of projects in lower income rural
communities with the support of output-based subsidies. To this end, the project sought to
introduce a new way of financing community-based water supply by using both commercial
financing and output-based aid, instead of relying on government grants to self-help groups.

The rationale for taking this approach to providing access was as follows:

    The following paragraphs are based on the Eligibility Note (GPOBA 2004) and Mehta and Virjee (2007).

                                                          2
        Traditional financing was limited and not sufficiently focused on sustainability: Donors,
         NGOs, government allocations, and funds raised by community groups traditionally fund
         community water supplies. These financing sources have several drawbacks. For example,
         external funding sources often prefer new investments instead of improving the operations
         and maintenance of existing schemes. Traditional funders also did not conduct rigorous
         business planning and appraisal of financial viability, nor did they provide communities
         access to professional levels of design, implementation, and management services.
        Microfinance institutions could expand available financing, reduce lag times, and
         introduce commercial rigor to all phases of the project cycle: Microfinance institutions
         provide an alternative and immediately available financing option for community water
         supply projects. This would reduce the time communities spend – often over five years –
         searching for financing to improve water supply. Commercial financing would also
         introduce rigor and professional support to the water supply projects by requiring schemes
         are sufficiently viable to repay the loans.
        Output-based Aid (OBA) subsidies could develop the link between microfinance institutions
         and relatively poor rural and suburban communities: Financial viability studies indicated
         that consumers could afford tariffs sufficient to cover operations and maintenance (O&M)
         costs, and some debt service on capital. However, Kenya’s relatively poor communities
         could not afford the high interest rates associated with commercial capital.

Such an approach was clearly in line with the CAS and its goals of getting the private sector more
involved in infrastructure and service delivery, and building and expanding the capacity of
financial institutions to serve the non-government sector.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

Normally the Project Development Objective (PDO) and key indicators are definitively stated in
the Project Appraisal Document (PAD). However, this project did not have a PAD: at the time of
project approval, PADs were not required for small recipient-executed trust funds such as this one.

The original PDO is clear, despite the absence of a PAD, because the various original project
documents state the project objective in nearly identical language. The original 2006 grant
agreement states:
The objective of the Project is to increase access to and efficiency in water supply services for the
poor in rural and suburban areas of Kenya through investments in selected community subprojects
(IDA 2006, pg. 6). 4




4
  The Eligibility Note (GPOBA 2004, pg. 9), which is the closest equivalent to a PAD available from among original
project documents, uses nearly identical language in stating the objective. “The objective of the pilot is to increase
access to water supply service by the poor in the rural and peri-urban areas of Kenya and to increase the efficiency of
water supply services.” The Note adds that the “purpose of the pilot is to demonstrate that microfinance has an
innovative role to play in financing small water infrastructure in Kenya.”..

                                                           3
By contrast, defining the project’s key indicators and their original target values in the absence of a
PAD is not clear-cut. Various original project documents do not use the same set of indicators, and
often do not set any target values.

The following indicators were selected from various project documents. Appendix J provides the
detailed rationale for their selection. For the purposes of the CR, the first indicator (number of
beneficiaries) has been defined as the PDO indicator, and the remaining indicators as intermediate
outcome indicators.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

The project was restructured on June 29, 2011. The restructuring paper listed three performance
indicators with revised target values, as shown in table 1.2. The target values for these indicators
were expanded due to the increased scale of the project as of 2008 (see Section 1.6 for further
explanation).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

Consumers served by the water schemes that received project financing comprised the main
beneficiaries. The project originally targeted poor rural areas of the country with an estimated
average annual household expenditure of US$150 per month or less (GPOBA 2007, pg. 2).

Beneficiaries would receive two types of benefits:
       Existing consumers would receive better standards of service in terms of quantity and hours
        of supply, due to improvements in the capacity and management of existing schemes.
       New consumers would receive access to water services either from new schemes or from
        the expansion of existing schemes.

The original project targeted 60,000 beneficiaries served through existing or new connections from
the 21 schemes in the districts and city area under the Athi Water Services Board (formally called
the Nairobi Water Services Board (WSB)).

The revised project expanded the number of targeted beneficiaries to 100,000 persons served
through existing or new connections from 40 schemes located in seven of the eight WSB service
areas. Schemes under the Northern WSB were excluded due to logistical difficulties of working in
this area of Kenya.

1.5 Original Components

The grant agreement specifies two parts: investment financing and project management.

Investment Financing
The project was intended to provide output-based aid subsidies to community scheme management
groups that successfully used commercial loans to rehabilitate and augment existing piped water
schemes or to construct new piped schemes.

The community group would provide 20 percent of the financing upfront, and receive a loan for K-
Rep Bank for the remainder. K-Rep Bank followed its normal due diligence process for the loan

                                                     5
appraisal. The community group would also receive a subsidy of up to 40 percent of total capital
expenditure after meeting the output targets, which were an agreed number of connections and a
certain level of monthly revenues from consumer payments for two months following project
completion. This subsidy would allow the group to repay a large portion of the loan immediately.

Project Management
Community groups were eligible for an additional subsidy to pay Project Implementation
Consultants (PICs) for technical services during construction, such as procurement, contractor
supervision, reporting, and building the technical, financial, and organizational capacity of the
users’ associations to manage the schemes.

This component also financed the Project Auditing Consultant (PAC), which prepared the baseline
and Output Verification Reports (OVRs), certifying that outputs had been achieved and a given
amount in subsidies could be disbursed.

1.6 Revised Components

Project components were not redesigned. However, the scale of the project was expanded from 21
subprojects limited to the area covered by the Athi WSB to a nationwide project involving 40
schemes in areas covered by all but one of Kenya’s WSBs.5 A European Union Water Facility
grant that more than doubled the financial size of the original project facilitated this change.6

1.7 Other Significant Changes

Additional Assistance to Prepare Loan Applications: PPIAF awarded a grant of US $523,719 to
finance a Project Development Facility at WSTF after project start-up. The final amount disbursed
under this facility was US$325,951, with the remaining US$197,768 refunded (World Bank
2009b, pg. 3,6; Advani 2011, pgs. 12-13; personal communication with the author).

The facility partly financed the costs of support organizations (NGOs and consultants) to assist
communities with feasibility studies and bankable K-Rep loan applications. WSTF signed a
contract with Price Waterhouse Coopers (PwC) on May 14, 2009, to act as the Project
Development Facility Manager (World Bank 2009b, pg. 3,6; Advani 2011, pgs. 12-13; personal
communication with author).

Ultimately, 35 project development grants of US$9,000 each were awarded to 33 communities (2
communities had 2 grants each) after the management committees submitted viable expressions of
demand and contributed US$2,000 toward the cost of the support organizations to assist in
preparing the loan applications (WSP, GPOBA, et al 2011).

 Schemes under the Northern WSB were excluded due to logistical difficulties in working in that area of Kenya.

Partial Credit Guarantee: K-Rep secured a revolving US$5 million guarantee facility from the
U.S. Development Credit Authority in 2009. The terms allowed for sharing losses on a 50 percent
pari passu basis at a portfolio level (GPOBA 2009; Advani 2011, pg. 12).

Project Closing Extension: The project closing was extended three times, as detailed in Appendix
K.

Allow Municipal Water Service Providers to Participate in the Project: The second supervisory
mission agreed that the project could be extended to subprojects that would be owned and
managed by WSBs and municipal water utilities, rather than limited to schemes in which
community management committees were the designated water service providers.

Seven subprojects had this new type of management structure: Mukangu (KIRIWASCO),
Nyamasaria (KIWASCO), Kenol-Kabati (MUSWASCO), Kiambi Network (EWASCO), Kamweli
(KIRIWASCO), Rabai Power (KIMAWASCO) and Kayole Soweto (NCWSC). In the case of
Nyamasaria, KIWASCO delegated the authority to identify and connect new consumers, and carry
out meter reading, billing and revenue collection to community contractors, or Master Operators.
These operators were identified and trained by KIWASCO (Tertiary Engineering Consultants
2007).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

The project exceeded most target values for its (imputed) PDO and outcome indicators.

First, the project design team correctly identified a niche for providing investment subsidies to
water schemes owned and managed by community organizations through a microfinancing
institution. As a result of this innovative project design, the borrower (K-Rep Bank) and other
banks have become keenly interested in this business line, provided that substantial subsidies are
available for the costs of constructing, rehabilitating, or expanding the scheme networks and main
civil works. The Dutch WASH Alliance and the United States have developed projects with
similar designs, based on the experience with this project.7

Second, the output-based aid approach created incentives for K-Rep Bank to take on a substantial
role in oversight, which in turn led to cost savings and higher construction quality (K-Rep Bank
2013, pgs. 12-13).

Significant preparation work was undertaken before the project was approved, notably:

 K-Rep Bank has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Practical Action to provide loan products to small
and medium enterprises for waste management, water, sanitation, and hygiene. The USAID SUWASA Kenya project
will partner with several commercial banks to provide loan products for water services to the urban poor. K-Rep has
partnered with SUWASA to adapt these loans to financing urban utilities in poor areas. Communication with former
K-Rep Special Projects Depart Head, and former project manager, October 17, 2013, Nairobi, and Samual Baiya,

      the development of credit assessment and appraisal tools for community managed piped
       schemes;
      an industry assessment of the market for financing such schemes in Kenya;
      an assessment of the potential of consultancy firms to provide business support services to
       relevant schemes; and
      the development and assessment of three subprojects for appraisal and preliminary loan
       approval (GPOBA 2006, pg. 9).

Despite this preparation, the project immediately fell behind schedule and faced other challenges,
described below.

Certain relatively small changes in project preparation and design could have mitigated
implementation delays and their consequences, including:
      An evaluation of the capacity and time needed for WSTF and K-Rep to complete all the
       steps leading up to loan appraisal.
      More time allotted to secure ownership of the project processes by the relevant institutions
       and organizations. Stakeholders could have prepared using project documents such as the
       ESMF and Project Operations Manual. Stakeholder participation should have been made
       conditional upon workshops and training sessions attendance.
      A loan disbursement window that ended well before the project closing date.

The above procedures are typical for World Bank projects, particularly when lending to financial
intermediaries. It was not clear at the time of project appraisal that these procedures would be
necessary given the relatively small recipient-executed trust funds. Readers will recall that for this
same reason, no PAD was prepared for this project.

Other factors behind the implementation delays indicate some fundamental weaknesses in the
original project design, including:
      Limited private sector capacity: The lack of capable support organizations and project
       implementation consultants was a major factor in delays.
      Limited demand for financing from community management committees: Identifying
       community-managed schemes with management organizations that were able to present
       adequate loan applications proved difficult. In addition, some communities did not take up
       the loan offers. The World Bank approved a significant change in project design whereby
       loans could be extended to schemes owned and managed by WSBs and municipal water
       utilities, rather than those in which community management committees were the
       designated water service providers. K-Rep Bank, in its final report on the project, stressed
       the potential for lending to water utilities (K-Rep Bank 2013, pgs. 13-16).




                                                  8
2.2 Implementation

The time lag from subproject identification to loan took longer than anticipated during the pilot
phase (2006-2010) due to the time required to:
       obtain community management committees registered as legal entities;8
       sign a Service Provision Agreement with the WSB;9
       fulfill the water abstraction permit requirements from WRMA(World Bank 2009a);
       obtain approval of project reports by NEMA (World Bank 2009a);
       carry out the considerable, unfunded work in developing the proposals initially required
        from the Athi WSB. These responsibilities were later transferred to K-Rep Bank (World
        Bank 2009a); and
       resolve title disputes for the land where the scheme infrastructure would be (WSP,
        GPOBA, et al 2011).

PICs initially performed poorly, partly because they lacked experience. Meanwhile, communities
lacked the expertise to manage PICs, and the contracts were not sufficiently rigorous in terms of
stating outputs and penalties for failing to deliver on time.

As a result, there were considerable delays in planned versus actual achievements for the project as
originally designed. For example:
       One subproject was completed by December 31, 2008, the original project closing, versus
        the planned 21 subprojects (World Bank 2009).
       One year after the original closing date (December 2009), six of the originally planned 21
        subprojects had been completed.
       Ten of the originally planned 21 subprojects were completed by November 2010, about
        two years after the original closing date (Advani 2011, pg. 1). 10




8
  Most community water scheme management committees were registered simply as self-help groups, which was not
sufficient for loan purposes. Legal registration was delayed due to the need to get ministerial signatures (GPOBA
2009a, pg. 5).
9
  Getting SPAs signed was delayed because the WSBs had not resolved how to allow for community management
committees as providers in areas that had been granted to municipal water companies. The WSBs worked out various
arrangements, all of which required approval by the WSRB. The project also encountered situations whether
overlapping SPAs had been issued, and where the exclusivity clauses under SPAs had not been enforced (World Bank
2009a). Simplified procedures and contracts needed to be established (World Bank 2009b, pg. 6).
10
   By January 2009, one subproject had been completed, and seven were in various stages of construction. A total of
13 subprojects (including the preceding 8) had been identified as eligible for loans (World Bank 2009). By December
2009, six subprojects had been completed, with another six loans approved, of which 3 subprojects were under
construction. Meanwhile, the scaling up had begun, with 24 sub-projects under study (World Bank 2009, pg. 4).
Note: A February 2010 GPOBA Semi-Annual Report gave conflicting account of outputs, reporting five completed
subprojects, and nine subprojects under construction (GPOBA 2010, pg. 2-3).

                                                         9
Implementation improved during the second national phase (2011-2013) of the project. The project
team deserves credit for taking steps to incorporate these lessons, notably:
        K-Rep Bank assumed from the communities more contractual responsibilities for the
         management and supervision of PICs, and set more rigorous standards for PIC pre-
         qualification (World Bank 2009a, 2009b, pg. 6). K-Rep Bank branch staff and the Special
         Operations Department devoted considerable staff resources to supervising the project.
        The project began extending loans to communities whose schemes were owned by WSBs
         and managed by municipal water utilities.
        WSP-AF provided technical assistance to K-Rep Bank.

Disbursements indicate that most construction occurred toward the end of the project (see Figure 1
below). Nearly three-quarters of the 25 OVRs for the second phase of the project were conducted
less than one month before project closing. Three OVRs were conducted on the last day of the
project. (Appendix B, table B.1 presents the dates of the 35 OVRs for project phases 1 and 2.)

Implementation delays led to a several negative consequences, namely:
        A number of communities failed to receive the planned subsidies because they had not
         finished the planned number of connections by project closing.
        Some schemes had little to no period of post-implementation management support and
         monitoring, as construction was completed very near to the project closing.11 Revenue
         projections had to be used in place of actual revenue in order to calculate the subsidies.
        Key data with which to evaluate the project outcomes were not available on all or most of
         the schemes. For example, Phase 2 projects had not established whether they could meet
         their target monthly average revenues. Meanwhile, the PAC reported that most subprojects


11
  As will be described in the section on post-implementation support, WSP will try to address this problem through
technical assistance starting in late 2013.

                                                         10
         held their revenues as debt (Tertiary Consulting Engineers 2013, pg. 8). Only eight
         subprojects were able to report on nonrevenue water, and only 24 subprojects could report
         on collection efficiency (See Appendix C).
        Some civil works were apparently not completed by project closing (see Appendix B).

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

(a) M&E Design

The borrower’s M&E system comprised three components:
        Pre-loan monitoring: K-Rep Bank tracked the progress of the subprojects toward a loan
         offer and acceptance. As mentioned above, several of these steps proved time-consuming,
         such as obtaining legal registration for the scheme management committees; receiving
         SPAs from the WSBs; obtaining environmental clearances from NEMA and water
         abstraction permits from WRMA; and securing land (title or access) for the infrastructure.
        Construction monitoring: The PICs were required to provide monthly diagnostic reports.
         This monitoring continued for the 24 months during which the contract with the PICS was
         in effect.
        OBA output monitoring: The process was designed as follows:
            The OBA target outputs, derived from the scheme business plans for each subproject
             were clearly stated in the K-Rep loan.
            Prior to construction, the Project Auditing Consultant (PAC) visited the subproject to
             assess the baseline situation relative to specific outputs, for example the number and
             type of existing connections, and to confirm the eligible project cost, cost per capita,
             and expected OBA subsidy (i.e. 40 percent of the eligible cost).
            Upon completion of construction, the water user association submitted an Outputs
             Report to K-Rep Bank.
            The PAC then revisited the subproject to verify the outputs that had been achieved
             relative to the targets, and to recommend payment of the subsidy based on what
             percentage of the outputs had been achieved.12
            If the outputs were less than 100 percent, the PAC conducted an additional field visit,
             not more than six months after subproject commissioning. The remaining subsidy could
             be authorized if all output targets had been achieved (K-Rep 2006, pg. 17).

In addition to the above M&E system, the schemes were to be supervised by the sector institutions
and NEMA:




12
  Each subproject is assigned a score that weights coverage and service levels achieved against established targets.
The total score is calculated as = (coverage weights x coverage score + service weights x service score).

                                                          11
      Water Service Boards: The WSBs were responsible for requiring WUAs to submit annual
       reports with specific indicators to track performance in sustaining outputs. Recommended
       indicators included:
        number of connections
        revenue
        total number of households benefiting from increased access
        average daily consumption per connected household
        percentage of population in target area with access to water supply
        collection efficiency (K Sh collected/K Sh billed)
        average hours of access to water supply per day
        number of interruptions per given period (K-Rep 2006, pg. 25)
      Environmental Safeguards: NEMA and WRMA were responsible for monitoring
       compliance with the environmental clearance and water abstraction permit. The scheme
       management committees were required to submit an annual audit report to NEMA as part
       of this process.

WSP-AF monitored the major milestones in the loan development and implementation for each
subproject.

(b) M&E Implementation

The M&E system allowed K-Rep Bank and WSP-AF to identify and track problems in the
subproject cycle. For example, it spotted weak operations in the Mataraa scheme and management
problems in the Gitaru scheme (WSP, GPOBA et al., 2011, pg. 3).

However, the M&E system was less effective at collecting data to track the PDO and outcome
indicators. Appendix B details the inaccuracies in estimating the number of connections, and
Appendix J described other challenges in measuring the PDO and Outcome indicators.

A principal problem with the M&E was that it did not track the performance of the schemes
beyond the first two months of operations. For a slight majority of schemes, data on the first two
months of operations are not even available since construction was completed so close to project
closing. There is also no detailed analysis of operations and efficiency for the ten schemes that
have been in operation for over two years. The economic and financial analysis had to rely largely
on data from the OVRs and focus group discussions in six subprojects.

The M&E system was also weak in monitoring the performance of sector institutions. As noted
above, the WSBs, WRMA, and NEMA play critical and ongoing roles in the regulation and
oversight of community-managed schemes. While the M&E system performed well in tracking
whether scheme management applied for SPAs, water abstraction permits, and environmental
clearances, it did not track how well WSBs, WRMA, and NEMA evaluated and monitored
compliances.



                                                12
2.4 Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards
An Environmental and Social Management Framework and a Resettlement Policy Framework
were prepared. The initial prescribed steps in these documents were followed, such as obtaining
water abstraction permits and environmental clearances for each subproject. It is unclear whether
the scheme management organizations submitted the required annual environmental audits,
although for most schemes, the first audits were not due until after project closing.

Fiduciary Compliance
K-Rep Bank submitted quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports on time and with the approval of
the World Bank.

K-Rep Bank submitted a financial audit report covering the period from inception to June 30,
2010. The audit was conducted in accordance with international accounting standards and the
auditor issued an unqualified opinion on the financial statements and special account statements as
of June 30, 2010. No major accounting and internal control weaknesses were noted during the
audit that would affect the project implementation, and the World Bank accepted the report (WSP
et al., 2011).

K-Rep Bank submitted a subsequent financial audit report, covering the period between July 1,
2010, and June 30, 2012 (Kimani and Associates 2012).

The 2011 Supervision Mission attempted a procurement review, although it did not provide all
necessary information. The mission noted the need for K-Rep Bank to (i) improve procurement
filing and record keeping; (ii) adhere to the provisions of Bank’s Guidelines in carrying out
procurement activities; (iii) use Bank’s standard bidding and request-for-proposal documents
wherever possible; and (iv) prepare and submit to the Bank a procurement plan for the proposed
project extension for review and clearance. K-Rep Bank subsequently worked with a World Bank
Procurement Specialist to update the project operations manual according to Bank procurement
procedures.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

WSP-AF recognized that most scheme management organizations lacked the skills and systems to
manage the schemes efficiently, and were unlikely to have sufficient revenue to hire private
operators. WSP-AF therefore plans to recruit a consulting firm to provide technical assistance to
the 33 schemes, and to develop training materials and management systems.

WSP-AF has identified four options for a future project building on this one:
      A repeat project with K-Rep Bank
      Work with WSTF to use donor funding to provide loans to rural community-managed
       schemes
      Work with WSTF to use donor funding to provide loans to rural community-managed
       schemes using an OBA approach

                                                13
        Work with WSTF to borrow funds to provide loans to rural community-managed schemes
         using an OBA approach

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

Relevance of Objectives: The need to improve access and efficiency in schemes owned and
managed by communities remains highly relevant, as this infrastructure will continue to provide
water to a significant portion of the rural and suburban populations.

Improving access in suburban areas to schemes owned by WSBs and managed by water utility
companies also emerged as a relevant project objective.

Relevance of Design and Implementation: Project design has a number of elements.

A key element in the project design was to provide subsidies through commercial banks for
constructing, rehabilitating, or upgrading the network and major infrastructure of the schemes
owned and managed by communities. The subsidies indirectly serve to make the water tariffs and
interest rates affordable to the consumers and management committees respectively, and to reduce
the risk to the bank (K-Rep).13

Donor institutions in the Netherlands and the United States are developing programs with very
similar designs (see Footnote 7).

Implementation through a commercial bank worked well. The OBA approach created incentives
for the borrower to take on more oversight than would otherwise have been the case, which in turn
led to cost savings and higher construction quality (K-Rep Bank 2013, pgs. 12-13). At the same
time, there are limits to a bank’s role, notably the short duration of bank supervision (24 months in
the case of this project), and monitoring environmental and water abstraction compliance.

3.2. Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The project reached 190 percent of the PDO’s target indicator. As explained in Appendices A and
J, this achievement probably underestimates the actual achievement, because new connections
(and therefore additional beneficiaries) were likely added after connections had been tabulated for
the purpose of paying the subsidies.

The project similarly achieved 135 percent of the target value for the number of new connections.
Again, this figure underestimates the number of new connections because it does not include
institutional connections.




13
  The subsidies cover part of the investment costs, thereby reducing the loan amount and limiting the tariff impact of
the investment.

                                                          14
No target values were established for two additional indicators: the numbers of new household
connections and kiosks at agreed working conditions and service standards. The numbers of these new
connections represented a successful outcome, given that the overall target for new connections was
exceeded. On the other hand, the monitoring system did not clearly establish that all these connections
were at agreed working conditions and service standards.

One indicator fell short of the target value: the number of subprojects financed totaled 87.5 percent
of target.

In addition to the PDO and outcome indicators that were selected ex post facto (see Appendix J),
the project documents refer to a number of other efficiency indicators: low rates of nonrevenue
water; monthly revenue targets for all schemes; revenue collection efficiency; population coverage
in the supply areas; etc. Data are not available on these indicators due to an M&E system that
largely ended with the OVR, and the short time between construction completion and project
closing for most subprojects.

3.3 EfficiencyThe present financial projection indicates the total portfolio’s financial internal rate
of return is 18 percent (with the subsidy payments taken into account). This is just at the hurdle
rate equivalent to K-Rep Bank’s lending rate. The portfolio, however, yields a negative net present
value of minus US$50,000. The financial performance of the subprojects is summarized in table
3.1, below:

Despite the portfolio’s weak financial performance, the project’s outcome confirms that
investments in water produce significant positive economic returns. The economic analysis was
conducted based on information collected in focus group discussions conducted in six subproject
areas. The economic internal rate of return of the six subprojects ranged from 64 percent in Hindi
to as high as 392 percent in Nyamasaria. This yielded benefits of between US$2 and US$10 for
every U.S. dollar invested in water. The economic rate of return results are summarized in table
3.2 below for the six subprojects:

3.3 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts




(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Many of the schemes served low-income households. The water provided a basic service and a
productive input to increase livelihoods.

Introducing on-premise connections reduced the burden of water collection, which positively
affected women and children, who traditionally collect water.

Most of the schemes strengthened community-based organizations.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

K-Rep Bank was strengthened in its capacity to provide loans to water schemes (see Section
5.2.b).

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Relatively small changes in project preparation and design, which are usual in World Bank
preparation of financial instruments and investment loans, could have mitigated implementation
delays and their consequences (see Sections 2.1 and 2.2).

(b) Quality of Supervision

A total of three supervision missions were held: two missions in 2009, and one in April 2011. The
aide memoires from these missions provide good documentation on the first phase (2006-2010) of
the project.

Since 2012, WSP-AF has maintained an Excel-based monitoring system to track milestones in the
subproject cycle (see Section 2.3), and employed several local consultants to gather the data for
this system. These consultants also provided technical assistance to K-Rep Bank in the loan
approval process and implementation.


5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

The various government institutions serving the water sector – WSTF, NEMA, WRMA, WSBs,
WASREB – performed their roles in supporting the community management committees in their
role as water service providers. Several utility companies actively worked on implementing
subprojects.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

K-Rep Bank built a competent appraisal team under an experienced engineer, and worked closely
with the communities, SOs, and PICS throughout the loan development process and
implementation. K-Rep Bank eventually had to commit over US$3 million to a water credit
revolving fund in order to generate sufficient funds to cover the costs of managing this portfolio
(Advani 2011, pg.18).


6. Lessons Learned

(1) Subsidies can leverage commercial financing from banks to make pro-poor investments
viable and attract equity from communities to invest in their own future

The project represents additional investments of US$4.2 million in piped water supply, where
public funds shouldered only a third of investments, hence freeing up public resources and
leveraging additional funds from the private sector. Communities that participated in the project
                                                17
reported benefits related to the increase in productivity due to the availability of water supply.
Households reported increased animal husbandry and vegetable farming, which helped them to
generate supplementary income from agricultural products sales. A post implementation review
estimates that every US$1 invested in the subprojects yielded economic benefits of between US$2
and US$10.

(2) Willingness to pay for piped water supply is critical

The willingness and ability to pay for piped water supply was a key factor in identifying viable
subprojects. The lender sought to confirm that target consumers were willing and able to pay the
connection fees and monthly bills, and that demand for piped water would not be eroded by
competing sources. All the subprojects financed installed meters and bill according to volume
consumption, mostly using rising block tariffs. A typical subproject has between 250 and 600
individual connections, and tariffs vary from US$0.45 to US$1 per cubic meter. The average
monthly bill for an individual household connection varies from US$7 to US$18. Poorer
consumers were served through point water sources such as kiosks.

(3) Investment choice and timing of subsidy payments significantly affects the repayment
profile

The lender expressed a preference for subprojects that could be implemented within one year and
quickly scaled up to ensure rapid generation of operating revenues. Linking new connections to
payment of the OBA subsidy allowed the subsidy to be used promptly to pay down part of the
loan, hence easing the expense burden.

Construction delays penalized subprojects due to capitalization on the increase in interest owed. In
cases where turnkey contractors were used, the implementation time was shortened, resulting in
cost saving from lower interest payments.

Rapid buildup of a customer base proved critical for the borrower: significant differences in
financial performance are evident between communities that were able to connect larger numbers
of households at once and those that had problems offering a reliable service to customers at the
outset. Delays also resulted in uncollected grants. Eighteen of the 35 subprojects attained less than
97 percent of the planned subsidy, mostly because they failed to meet the revenue target in time.
This resulted in US$250,000 subsidies that were not drawn. A softer target – or more time to
achieve the target – would have enabled communities to access these funds and reduced their
financial loss without compromising the sustainability of the project. In addition, a higher
proportion of subsidy could have generated more bankable subprojects, resulting in broader
economic impact with positive economic and financial returns.

(4) Labor should not be accepted as a community contribution

Voluntary labor contributions introduced significant uncertainty into the construction timeline;
delays significantly impacted interest owed and therefore the affordability of the schemes and
tariffs. Therefore, K-Rep Bank subsequently required community organizations to make
contributions in cash or tangible in-kind items, such as with construction materials.


                                                 18
(5) Significant technical assistance is required; the lending institution should prequalify
support organizations (PIC), and have a contractual role in supervising these contracts

While communities were keen to participate in the project, many lacked the financial experience to
implement and manage the subprojects efficiently. The project spent a significant percentage of the
investment (22 percent) on technical assistance to support community and on project preparation,
as well as to train K-Rep Bank field staff.

Additionally, numerous private firms proved to be technically incompetent and/or unsuited to
working with WUAs as clients. The WUAs often lacked the technical expertise to select good
consultants and supervise their performance. K-Rep Bank eventually addressed these problems by
prequalifying consultants and having a contractual role in their supervision.

(6) The lending institution needs a particular set of skills and tools, and sufficient capital and
commitment, to manage micro-financing for community water schemes

K-Rep Bank had to build a competent appraisal team under an experienced water engineer and
work closely with both the communities and the PICs throughout the entire loan process. WSP-AF
worked with K-Rep to develop the appraisal tools appropriate for this kind of lending. K-Rep Bank
eventually had to commit US$3 million to a water credit revolving fund in order to generate
sufficient revenues to cover the costs of managing this portfolio (Advani 2011, pg. 18).

(7) Define a loan disbursement window that ends well before project closing

Several communities that had taken out loans during the project period did not complete their
outputs in time to receive subsidies. Other schemes were completed so close to project closing that
estimates had to be used to calculate whether revenue outputs had been achieved. These problems
could have been avoided by closing the loan disbursement window at least 12 months prior to
project closing.

(8) The scale-up of the approach requires it to be embedded in a programmatic water sector
initiative

Kenya hosts dynamic sector institutions that could increase support to service providers to develop
their capacity for self-financing and management. Presently, national institutions focus on
infrastructure construction, but they could move towards providing technical assistance and project
development support, and subsidize financing/grants to counties and communities to tap other
sources of financing, including commercial funds. Such a scheme would help broaden the initiative
and provide incentives for local governments to develop skills and experience in sector planning,
management and investment, while providing checks and balances through national oversight. A
nationally managed subsidy scheme could attract other local lenders to finance investments in
water, thereby increasing competition for financing. It would also facilitate cooperation between
the national government and local institutions to progress towards poverty alleviation and
sustainable development.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Grantee/Implementing Agencies

(a) Grantee/Implementing Agencies

i) Legal registration of the community water projects requires careful attention and early consensus to avoid
regulatory delays in project preparation. This project required a significant amount of time to register
communities to ensure they were recognized as legal entities.

ii) The identification of a competent Project Implementation Consultant was key to improving the rate of
implementation of Phase II projects. The consultant ensured stronger overall project and organizational
oversight.

iii) The Output-based Aid approach led to a greater number of on-budget, outcome-oriented subprojects
than is typical with the upfront grant-financed approach to projects. Incentives for the communities and
financier to pursue savings to fit the project cost to the credit capacity available helped to control costs.

iv) The World Bank’s technical assistance enabled training of the newly prequalified support organizations
and improved consultancy services in managing the 25 projects.

Appendix B. Outputs by Component

The project comprised two components: investments and consultant services. The first three subsections
below describe the outputs for the investments. The final subsection describes the consultant services.

Appendix B.1: Civil Works

The following quotations from the second supervision report describe the types of investments financed
through the project (WSP, GPOBA, et al, 2011, pgs. 2-3):
     Rehabilitation and/ or augmentation projects: Many operational CWPs require investment to upgrade
      or replace existing infrastructure, such as house taps, and/or to expand services to those who do not
      have higher service levels. Such investments will benefit the community through a higher average level
      of service, for example a higher reliability of service for all households, as well as by expanding
      services to additional households. These investments include increased storage facilities, expansion and
      replacement of pipelines or specific new connections.
     New/ Greenfield project: This refers to the establishment of a new water project and would include all
      normal components of a piped community water project. The new project is to be registered as a legal
      entity. Access to the project will be for members who have paid membership fees as suggested by
      project’s by-laws. Such systems serve the entire population through a mixture of service levels, including
      individual connections and shared communal water points.

Below, Table B.1 presents the available information on the status of the civil works. This information
comes from the Output Verification Reports, some of which were completed as long ago as 2009. It
therefore does not present a view of the civil works as of project closing (February 2, 2013) except for the
18 subprojects that were visited in February 2013. The table indicates that:
         20 percent of the subprojects had no outstanding civil works
         26 percent of the subprojects had no available information on the status of the civil works
         54 percent of the subprojects had outstanding civil works

      Household connections: These are connections—usually a standpipe – built within homesteads primarily for
       domestic use, which may include productive uses of water such as kitchen gardens, livestock, etc.
      Agricultural connections: One scheme, Mt. Kenya Buuri, laid pipes to plots primarily for irrigation;
       households also used this water for domestic purposes.
      Kiosks and standpipes: Both represent public water points where people can collect water, primarily for
       domestic use.
      A standpipe is simply a pipe with a tap.
      A kiosk can be any one of a number of designs for a cement structure to protect the pipe holding the tap;
       usually a kiosk will have at least two taps.
     Institutional connections: These are any type of physical connection that was made to an institution, such as
       a health center or school.

The above table is the source for the figures on final achievements reported on three Outcome Indicators in
the Results Framework Analysis.15 These figures are not completely accurate for the following reasons:
        Inconsistent definitions of what constitutes an eligible connection: First, in some schemes
         institutional connections were not counted; in other schemes, they were counted as kiosks. Second,
         the Output Verification Reports (OVRs) indicate the sometimes “inactive” households connections
         were counted, and sometimes not. For the sake of consistency, and because “inactive” was never
         defined, both active and inactive household connections were included in the above table whenever
         the OVRs reported the two figures. However, the OVRs did not systematically report these figures,
         so undetected inconsistencies likely remain in the data.
        Connections were only counted at the time of the output verification, rather than at the project
         closing date: Connections were counted in order to calculate the subsidy payment to each scheme.
         They had to be completed within six months of the end of construction. However, connections that
         were subsequently added to the schemes before project closing (February 28, 2013) were also
         project outputs, since these connections were made possible by the scheme capacity resulting from
         the project. These post-verification connections were not captured in the above statistics, except for
         those in the Kiamumbi scheme.

Appendix C. Economic and Financial Analysis

Background

Maji ni Maisha Financing Product. The Maji ni Maisha is a financing product of the K-Rep Bank
Limited intended to provide loans to communities for water infrastructure where consumers are willing to
pay for clean and safe water. This product addresses a market gap: some communities are not eligible for
public grant funding because they are not situated in arid and semi-arid and flood prone areas, but they are
able to afford a modest level of demand for paid-for water supply. The main product features are
summarized below:

Table C.1: Maji ni Maisha Loan Features
 Loan Value                      K Sh 5 to 10 million
 Borrower                        Legally registered community associations, self-help groups and trusts
 Equity Requirement              20% of project cost in cash
 Interest Charged                Fixed at market rates, presently between 16% and 18% per annum
 Maximum Loan Tenor              Maximum 1 year grace period + 5 year term loan
 Subsidy                         Up to 40% of eligible project costs based on the achievement of the pre-set
                                 connection and revenue targets.

Financing Environment. Kenya experienced periods of volatile inflation during the five years of project
implementation (March 2007 to Feb 2013). In 2008, 2009 and again in 2012, inflation approached 20
percent, versus a historical average of eight percent. Over the same period, commercial bank interest rates
remained steady with base rates around 15 percent, except in 2012 when rates jumped to 20 percent. K-Rep
Bank signed a number of loans at this time, but kept their lending rate for Maji ni Maisha steady at 18
percent. Base rates have since gone back to around 17 percent in the first half of 2013. There are currently
30 active loans with between one-year and four-years repayment periods remaining.

Application and Credit Appraisal. Applications from communities were received at various branches of
K-Rep bank, many of which were referred through the respective water services board in charge of the
region. In total, the project considered over 65 proposals, out of which 35 subprojects were approved for
financing. The bank would usually evaluate the applicant entity’s organizational and leadership status, the
membership’s commitment to the project – especially their willingness to contribute cash equity, and the
likely feasibility of the project, which depended on access to a sustainable source of adequate water. Upon
assessment by the bank that the project has potential merit, it used project-provided resources to mobilize
support organizations (SOs) to assist the communities in developing the technical designs and financial
plans for the subprojects. Communities would share in the cost of preparation with a K Sh 10,000
contribution, or 10 percent of the preparation cost. During the preparation period, communities were
required to meet certain loan conditions. These included the mobilization of 20 percent equity contribution;
special service provider agreement granted by the water services board with concurrence of any existing
licensed service provider in the area; and a permit to extract water from the resources authority. K-Rep
Bank preferred a financial rate of return of higher than the interest rate hurdle (18 percent) and a debt-
service coverage ratio of 1.3.

Portfolio Profile

Investment Cost and Sharing. In total, the portfolio represents new investments in community water
worth US$4.2 million across 35 sub-projects. The number of people benefiting from improved services at
output verification stage totaled 190,119. The subprojects added approximately 115,000 people to the
baseline who gained access to improved water supply. Thus, counting only those people added through the
investment, the unit investment cost per capita is low, at US$48/person. Only 34 percent of the investment

                                                      28
capital was effectively sourced from public funding via the output subsidies ultimately mobilized under the
project. The majority of the finance came from community equity (35 percent) and financing from Maji ni
Maisha (31 percent). Under the project, communities mobilized US$1.70 million of cash to invest in their
own water supply and are poised to service debts in the community association’s name, making the project
predominantly privately financed (66 percent). Cash contributions mostly came from the community’s
savings, while a small portion (18 percent) came from a constituency development fund through Members
of Parliament.

Types of Investment. Investments were made to 18 green field projects and to the rehabilitation and
increasing capacity of existing networks. Works aimed to increase production capacity by rehabilitating
existing boreholes and dams as well as by establishing supplementary water sources, increasing the size of
the distribution network by as much as 14 kilometers of pipes, and augmenting network water storage to a
maximum of 500 cubic meters.

Achievement of Targets. Salient features of the 35 subprojects taken from the baseline and output
verification are found below, indicating significant positive changes.

A large majority of subprojects met or exceeded their targets in water connections, while fewer than half
met their targets for kiosks and average monthly revenues. Kiosk targets were not met mainly due to
increased demand for individual connections. Estimation difficulties resulted in some financial targets not
being met. For example, given a 20 percent margin of error, about 75 percent of the subprojects would have
met or exceeded their revenue generation targets.

Customer satisfaction regarding water supply and management.
Customer satisfaction levels were assessed via participants’ opinions on the continuity of supply, water
quality and the price of water across six project sites. There was a clear shift in opinion before and after the
project in terms of the taste and color of the water. Respondents in all six sites appreciated improved water
quality supplied under the project.

Respondents at five project sites felt that the continuity and reliability of supply attained a satisfactory level
after the implementation of the Maji ni Maisha project; however in Olepolos, a pre-existing project,
respondents rated continuity and reliability of supply as “average” because the project did not meet growing
demand.

Response was mixed regarding the question on connection fees. Beneficiaries in the three brownfield
projects (Olepolos, Hindi and Gitangu) were unsatisfied. Many participants, especially those who depended
on standpipes or intermittent water supply prior to the project, felt that the new connection fees were high.
In cases where the beneficiaries had not had access to piped water, respondents felt that the connection fees
charged were fair.

Feedback gathered from the FGD discussions indicates that beneficiaries ranked their management’s
performance highly. The management teams in five areas were comprised of community members elected
by beneficiaries as well as salaried personnel hired to support the daily operation and maintenance works in
the water supply system. The exception was Nyamasaria, where the local urban water utility manages the
subproject. The subproject experienced long periods without water due to the disconnection of the main
supply pipe to facilitate ongoing road works. Nevertheless, the community acknowledged the efforts made
by the utility to restore supply and ranked its performance favorably.

Financial assumptions and limitations. The financial review was conducted just one or two months after
the 35 subprojects had been commissioned. Therefore, assumptions based on the original factors assigned in
the business plans were used to project revenues and cost escalation. The annual rate for revenue increases
ranged from two percent to 14 percent, while cost escalation rates ranged from one percent to seven percent.
The beginning balances were taken from the average actual operating months of the subprojects, which in
most cases equaled two to three months of operation. A 10-year asset life was assumed.

Financial performance. The financial performance of the portfolio has been only moderately satisfactory.
All 35 subprojects are able to cover the cost of their operation and are likely able to generate enough cash to
cover debt payments throughout their loan life. However, under the current projection scenario, which is
based on only two months of operation, a number of subprojects need to raise revenues by increasing the
number of customers. The current financial projection scenario estimates a financial internal rate of return
of 18 percent for the total portfolio (taking subsidy payments into account). This is just at the point of the
hurdle rate, equivalent to K-Rep Bank’s lending rate. The portfolio, however, yields a negative net present
value of US$–50,000. The financial performance of the subprojects is summarized below:

 criteria

Tariffs, consumption and affordability. The tariff rate in the 35 projects ranged from US$0.4 and US$1.8
per cubic meter. In some cases, a standing charge or a fee was also collected each month. Projects
implemented and managed by the water utilities on behalf of communities had lower tariffs than those
managed by communities themselves.

Information collected from focus group discussions in six project sites indicates that effective tariffs from
piped connections averaged US$0.05 per liter, ranging from US$0.01 to US$0.07 per liter. Effective tariffs
at water kiosk averaged US$0.04 per liter. Households with piped connections reported spending an
average of US$18 per month; the average monthly spending ranging from US$10.60 in Gitangu and
US$23.88 in Nyamasaria. Consumption averaged 3.85 liters per capita per day, with ranges from 1 lpcd in
Gitangu to 6 lpcd in Nyamasaria. Households collecting water from kiosks reported spending between
US$8 and US$9 per month for a consumption of a just over 1 lpcd.

In Koibatek, Hindi and Nyamasaria reported spending a significant portion of monthly household income
on water, at 20 percent, 10 percent and 9 percent, respectively. In the remaining areas, water bills cost four
percent to five percent of monthly household income. Despite the large portion of monthly household
income spent on water, FGDs in Koibatek, Hindi and Nyamasaria were either neutral or satisfied with the
monthly bills. There were no piped water supply in Koibatek and Nyamasaria before the project, so the
level of satisfaction may represent the value the households perceive from the new source. Households in
Olepolos expressed the greatest dissatisfaction with the level of their monthly water bills, which is ironic
given that Olepolos households enjoy the highest income among the six sites (US$446). However, it should
be noted that the standing fee charged in Olepolos (K Sh 500) is more expensive than other vended water.

Households were also generally neutral or satisfied with the level of connection fee charged. Connection
charge ranged from US$24 in Nyamasaria to US$282 in Olepolos. There was greater dissatisfaction
regarding the connection fees in Hindi and Olepolos, where fees were the highest.

Loan financing arrangement. The project had two prominent financing features: a loan and an output-
based subsidy. The efficiency of the subsidy is justified under the project, as discussed in more detail in the
next section. This section looks at the appropriate use of commercial financing in the project. A simulation
of the financial performance of 35 projects using a “no loan” scenario resulted in 20 out of 35 improving
their financial rates of return. This improvement enabled four subprojects to meet the hurdle rate of 18
percent. (Under a “with loan” scenario, 15 sub-projects are able to generate an IRR of 18 percent and above,
while in a “no-loan” scenario, 19 of them can generate an IRR of at least 18 percent..) However, in the case
where loans are not used, the hurdle rate needs to be adjusted to reflect the higher cost of equity as capital.
In this case, we use the assumption of 35 percent. Under this scenario, fewer subprojects (12) would meet
the appropriate hurdle rate compared to a “with loan” scenario (15). These communities are not likely to be
eligible for other funding, since government programs prioritize areas in arid and semi-arid or flood-prone
regions. Thus, evidence suggests that the use of commercial lending as leverage for the modest ability of the
beneficiary communities to mobilize equity was well justified.

The FGDs suggested that community members in all six of the project areas are willing to replicate the
financing model in other projects that address community challenges, such as in agricultural projects, power
supply projects and for sanitation facilities.

Economic Analysis Background

Focus Group Discussions. The economic analysis was conducted based on information collected in focus
group discussions (FGDs) conducted in six subproject areas. These areas were selected to represent the
geophysical conditions of all the 35 subprojects:
     Coastal (1)
     Humid Urban (2)

Officials involved in the community water projects identified households to include in the FGDs.
Respondents were divided into three groups: Group 1 comprised women, Group 2 comprised men and
Group 3 comprised a mix of women and men. A total of 177 respondents participated in the FGDs, with 66
percent male and 33 percent female. The table below provides additional details.

The FGDs primarily focused on collecting and comparing information on residents’ water supply collection
and consumption practices. They also focused on households’ health situation before and after the
introduction of the piped water supply project. The FGD also asked residents to rate the performance of the
water system and its management, which was discussed in the previous section.

Assumptions. Subprojects had been commissioned only two months before this economic review was
conducted. Therefore, this economic analysis assumes that the number of people with access to the system
at the time of verification would increase according to the rates given in the business plan projections. The
sample mean from the FGD respondents was assumed to represent the mean of the population presently
with access to the system and was used to project the benefits for the population universe.

The aspects included in the economic analysis are summarized in the table below:

Economic Analysis Results. Despite the portfolio’s weak financial performance, the project confirms that
investments in water produce significant positive economic returns. In the six subprojects analyzed, the
economic internal rate of return ranged from 64% in Hindi to as high as 392% in Nyamasaria. Every dollar
(US$1) invested in water yielded benefits of between US$2 to US$10. The economic internal rate of return
results for the six subprojects are summarized in table C.7 below:

Health Benefits. Exposure to diarrhea-causing agents is frequently related to the use of contaminated water
and to unhygienic practices in food preparation and disposal of excreta. In the six subproject areas, families
with children under the age of five (CU5) reported between 12 and 14 incidences of diarrhea per year prior
to the project. This dropped to an average of four incidences per year after the project. A portion of this
(based on the WHO Exposure Scenario) was attributed to water. This benefit commonly comprised 12
percent to 64 percent of net inflows of total.




                                                     34
FGDs indicated that the project’s health benefits resulted in greater productivity. FGD participants reported
24 incidence of diarrhea per year on average, causing them to miss work about five to six of those days.
After the project, the average annual incidence of diarrhea decline to 11 for five of the subprojects. In
Hindi, FGD participants reported an average of 12.9 cases of diarrhea per year prior to the project, and
about one case per year after. This benefit comprised less than one percent of total benefits flows.

Income Benefits. Besides Olepolos, where a few households already had a piped connection to the existing
water system, most FGD respondents relied on hand dug wells, boreholes, river and rainwater harvesting as
water sources before the project. They carried water through various modes of transport, including hand
carrying, bicycle and donkey, traveling an average distance of 1.6 kilometers (with distances ranging from
20 meters to seven kilometers). Women and children overwhelmingly comprised water collectors. The
benefit inflows from time saved in water collection after the project ranged between 42 percent and 89
percent of the total flows.

Communities had different experiences on whether they benefited from avoided costs of paying for
alternative sources. Out of the 176 households that participated in the FGDs, 139 typically took water from
distant but free sources so that they did not pay for water prior to the project. Thirty-seven households paid
less for their previous source than what is currently charged under the subproject. This results in negative
net flows of US$65,000. Thus, in all but one case did this benefit result in a positive portion of total
economic benefits.

Economic Activities. In addition to the benefits quantified in the economic analysis, the FGDs also
revealed that a number of households were able to increase incomes due to the availability of water supply.
For example, households reported generating supplementary income by selling agricultural products
derived from increased activity in animal husbandry and vegetable farming, for example. Individual
families and local primary schools also reported making longer-term investments in tree nurseries and fish
farming, facilitated by the availability of water.

Subsidies. The strong economic performance of the subprojects, yielding US$2 to US$10 for every dollar
invested, demonstrates the development cost-effectiveness of the investment, including the subsidy. The
efficiency and incidence of the subsidy is discussed below.

Efficiency. No willingness-to-connect data were available from the project. However, feedback from FGDs
indicate that connection fees in three out of the six project sites were found by residents to be “prohibitive”
or “unsatisfactory” whereas residents in the other three sites found their fees “satisfactory.” The upper
bound of fees in those sites where residents were satisfied with the amount is K Sh 2,500 or US$30 per
connection. We use this as a proxy for what households would have been willing to pay to connect to the
network. The effective subsidy per person is US$16.60, and using the average of six households per
connection, each household benefiting from the project received an effective subsidy of US$100. On the
other hand, the actual cost of the project investment is US$290 per household. If households perceive
private utility to be US$30 per connection (their WTP), this leaves a gap of US$160. The fact that the
US$100 subsidy is much lower than the gap between what households can afford and the actual cost of
investments suggests that the subsidy was efficient.

Incidence of subsidy. Five of the selected sites are located in rural areas; only Olepolos is situated in an
urban setting. Adjusting the 2005 rural and urban national poverty line17 to 2012 prices, the portion of
people represented in the focus group that fell below the poverty line was calculated. In the six areas where

Appendix I. Additional Notes on the Selection and Measurement of PDO and Intermediate
Outcome Indicators

Indicators for the PDO and Intermediate Outcomes are a key input into an CR. Most significantly, the
achieved values relative to target values on these indicators influence significantly the assessment ratings
for project outcomes.

Usually these indicators and the original target values are taken from the Results Framework in the project
PAD, and entered into the Operations Portal at project start-up. A formal restructuring of the project may
lead to formally revised target values, but the original target and baseline values are also reported in the CR
data sheet F: Results Framework Analysis. The CR Team completes the provided table by filling in the
achieved targets plus comments.

However, this project did not have a PAD, because at the time of project approval, PADs were not required
for small recipient-executed trust funds such as this one.

The CR team reviewed project documents in an effort to determine which indicators and values best
represent the thinking at project start-up about how to measure results with respect to the project objective
and intermediate outcomes. These documents comprised the GPOBA Eligibility Note, Project Operations
Manual, original grant agreements, and the formally approved restructuring paper.

This task has proved challenging. The various original project documents do not consistently state the same
set of indicators. Furthermore, there are often no target values given. On the other hand, the restructuring
paper lists three performance indicators, and these must be included among the selected indicators. There is
also a general consensus in the original documents regarding the expected results from the project, with the
exception of the 2007 EU Agreement. This consensus suggests three additional indicators. Therefore, six
indicators were selected, as described in Appendix J, table J.1 below:

Note that the PDO Indicator, “Number of people with access to water under the Project,” measures both
people who gained access to water, and people who already had access to water from existing scheme
connections and kiosks. The project, as stated in the PDO, aimed not only to expand coverage but also to
improve the efficiency of water services, to both existing and new consumers.

Appendix J, Table 2 shows how the number of beneficiaries was calculated, based on the estimated number
of household, agricultural connections used for domestic purposes, and kiosks and communal standpipes.
People served through institutional connections were not counted, partly because this would result in
significant double counting,18 and partly because there was no information available to estimate the number
of people served in this way.

  Many of the people served through institutional connections would also be served through household or kiosk
connections.

Appendix L. Breakdown of Original and Revised Financing Figures Presented in Data Sheet
A: Basic Information

Normally the information in Data Sheet A would be generated by the Operations Portal system.
However RETF Trust Grants with concept notes approved prior to March 31, 2012 were only
required to have ICRs and Implementation Supervision Reports if they were stand-alone projects
above US$5million (RE Product Line - Large).19 Since this project fell into the category of
recipient-executed trust funded projects for which ICRs were not required, the Operations Portal
did not create an CR template with all the attendant data sheets.

Therefore, the CR Team manually constructed Data Sheet A, based on the following information.

Note: The € 1,520,570 which the EU made available to the project through TF070963 from December 28, 2007, was
not incorporated into the amended grant agreement until June 17, 2010 as TF093392. See also Tables B and C below
and Appendix X.

# The grant agreement was not amended to include EU financing until June 17, 2010. At that time, a lesser amount
was included (see Table B above). Therefore, it has not been entered in the Data Sheet A. Basic Information. However
this additional funding had a profound effect on the project, enabling it to scale up from five districts (covered by the
Athi Water Sector Board) to all districts, and to increase the number of projects. The change in geographic scale and
the EU funding were incorporated in the project agreement as amended on December 18, 2008 (World Bank 2011).
See Appendix I for a timeline of project amendments.
