THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practic e or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bo ttom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.

      Notarize articles of association

      Fees to notarize the articles of association depend on the amount of the
      company’s registered capital and on the number of copies of the
      notarial record required by the company's founders. The minimum fee
      is about CZK 5,000, and the maximum is about CZK 113,000 excluding
      VAT. The notary public is responsible for the compliance of the contents
      of the company’s articles of association with Czech law.

      The notary prepares the articles of association according to the
      founders' requirements. Certain notaries public require the following
      documents before executing the articles of association:

       - An affidavit from the company managers.
3      - Confirmation from the owner of premises where the seat will be             1 day       CZK 20,540
      located that the company is entitled to have its seat on those premises,
      along with an extract for the premises from the Real Estate Register.

      The founders must comply with the requirements stipulated by the
      Czech Commercial Code. They must confirm their compliance in an
      affidavit submitted to the City Court. Since January 2012, it is no longer
      required to submit the founders' signatures to the City Court.

      According to Section 47 of the Act 253/2004 Coll, the VAT has slightly
      increased from 20% to 21%.

      Until the company is registered, the paid-in capital is typically blocked
      in the special bank account. Opening a special bank account usually

      to check its compliance with the applicable trade laws (Act No.
      455/1991 Coll., the Trade Act), especially when it is supposed to provide
      services to the public. The applicant himself is liable for ensuring
      compliance with the applicable construction rules (the Building Code).

      Obtain location (zoning) permit

      A location permit grants only the right to build the warehouse on a
      plot; it does not authorize construction. In order to obtain the location
      permit, BuildCo must submit the clearances of the preliminary project
      design by the various agencies, as well as proof of ownership of the
      land.                                                                         37 days      CZK 20,000
8

      The location permit is valid for 2 years, and it is a prerequisite for
      construction and building permits. The statutory period for completing
      the procedure is 60 days. However, in more complicated cases that
      require oral proceedings or local investigations, the statutory period is
      90 days. In practice, it generally takes one week longer than what the
      law prescribes.

      To site a structure, the location permit (or location approval) must be
      issued for simple structures, installations, and maintenance. However, if
      a regulatory plan (a more specific document than the master plan) is
      issued for the area (location), this plan replaces the location permit
      within that area. The regulatory plan is procured and issued by the
      Local Authority. It determines the detailed conditions for the use of the
      grounds, for the location and spatial arrangement of structures, for the
      protection of area’s values and character, and for creating a favorable
      environment.

      * Obtain building permit

      The company must submit to the municipal authority the documents
      specified in the preceding procedures, project design drawings made
      by an authorized designer, and additional documents requested by the
      building authority. The building permit is valid for 2 years. Under the
      new Building Act (2006), the land planning and the building permit
      applications can now be submitted simultaneously. Under the new
      code, the investor may apply for both the land planning permit and the
      building permit applications, simultaneously, on condition that the
      regulatory plan for the area was approved. The regulatory plan is
      procured and issued by the local authority and determines the detailed
      conditions for the use of the grounds, for the structural location and
      spatial arrangement, for protection of the area’s values and character,
      and for creating a favorable environment.

      Most local authorities in the Prague area have already approved a
      regulatory plan. Thus, in practice, the planning and building permit
      applications can now be submitted simultaneously.

      pursuant to the rules of administrative procedure, the building office
      may merge the planning permission proceedings with the building
      permit proceedings, if the conditions within the area are clear,
      especially if there is an approved regulatory plan for the area.

      The building permit application must include, in triplicate :
      • Documents proving the right of ownership
      • Design drawings and an accompanying technical summary report,
      and situation of the building
      • Construction schedule for inspections
      • An estimate of the cost of the building
      • Any binding opinion or decisions by the authorities or other
      documents required by specific legislation
      • The opinion of the owners of public transport and technical
      infrastructure of the possible methods of connection, or the conditions
      of the trade and safety zones

        The request is made to the local water and sewerage provider. The
        costs for establishing a (completely new) water connection is about CZK
        2,500.00 – CZK 3,000.00 per sq. m. for the excavation works (depending
        on the surface material), plus the cost of the actual placing of the new
        water conduct and coverage of the hole, (together, about CZK 4,500.00
        per sq. m.). The costs of establishing a new sewerage connection are
        based on the same criteria, and they can vary substantially, based on
        the relevant circumstances (surface material, depth). The costs for
        establishing the new water connection depends on the time and the
        number of workers needed. The price is about CZK 2,200.00 plus VAT
        (21%), calculated on an hourly basis for two workers. It is assumed this   30 days       CZK 5,500
  24
        would take 5 -- 6 hours.

        For the excavation work, a company is responsible for being in
        contractual relation with the Prague Water Supply and Sewerage
        Company (Prazske vodovody a kanalizace). The fee for the water and
        sewerage connection varies, by service provider. However, the
        approximate cost is about CZK 1,200.00. The cost stated above
        probably includes the cost for constructing the water and sewerage
        connection. However, when constructing a warehouse, the constructor
        also builds a water and sewerage connection.

                    computerization.
                    The Czech Republic speeded up property registration by
DB2012              computerizing its cadastral office, digitizing all its data and
                    introducing electronic communications with notaries.
                    The Czech Republic made registering property easier by
                    allowing the cadastral office online access to the commercial
DB2013              registry’s database and thus eliminating the need to obtain a
                    paper certificate from the registry before applying for
                    registration at the cadastre.

ENFORCING CONTRACTS
Economies in all regions have improved contract                   reducing backlogs by introducing periodic reviews to
enforcement in recent years. A judiciary can be improved          clear inactive cases from the docket and by making
in different ways. Higher-income economies tend to look           procedures faster. What reforms making it easier (or
for ways to enhance efficiency by introducing new                 more difficult) to enforce contracts has Doing Business
