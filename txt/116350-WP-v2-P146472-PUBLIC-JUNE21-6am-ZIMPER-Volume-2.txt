                  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This Local Governance Public Expenditure Review (PER) explores governance structures and
trends in local government financing and service delivery. The PER examines: (1) the governance
structure and systems in place for managing public expenditures at the local level; (2) recent trends
in revenue and expenditure in urban and rural local authorities; (3) the effectiveness, efficiency and
equity of local government service delivery in a set of eight local authorities. The PER also synthesizes
key lessons learned and policy recommendations.

Local government authorities in Zimbabwe play a crucial role in service delivery. Local government
authorities take the lead in providing services for solid waste disposal, public lighting, water provision
and sanitation, housing, and local roads, and are involved in delivering basic health and education
services. These public services play a crucial role in promoting the economic and social well-being of
municipalities, cities, towns, and other categories of local authorities.



KEY CHALLENGES
        1.	 Many Local Authorities face challenges in meeting their service delivery mandates due to
            financial, institutional, and capacity constraints.

        2.	 Local authorities charge a range of user fees and rates to cover service delivery costs;
            changes in rates during the approval processes and low collection rates cause problems
            in achieving cost recovery. Further, revenues are highly dependent on sales, especially of
            real estate, which are not a reliable or sustainable source of financing.

        3.	 Debt cancellation in 2013 caused significant disruption to local government finances, both
            in terms of immediate finances and longer term impacts on ratepayer compliance.

        4.	 Employment costs remain a significant percentage of overall spending, and an even higher
            percentage of total revenues collected, creating significant fiscal risks.

        5.	 General administrative, finance and management costs represent nearly a quarter of all
            spending, and are increasing relative to service delivery spending.

        6.	 An analysis of eight local authoritiesâ service delivery in areas such as water supply, sewerage,
            and solid waste disposal shows low spending on capital and repairs and maintenance.



POLICY OPTIONS
Most legal and institutional foundations for PFM at the local level are in place, but the Ministry
of Local Government and local authorities should strengthen systems and tools to support
strong PFM. The Government should prioritize the development of tools and training on basic PFM
skills, including by finalizing and rolling out the Local Government Accounting Manual being developed
by UCAZ, and expanding investment in local GFMIS systems.

To ensure the sustainability of local finances, local authorities need to develop strategies to
improve collection efficiency on fees and tariffs, and move towards more sustainable sources of
finances. Given their heavy reliance on sales, especially land sales, to mobilize revenue, local authorities
should identify options to improve the performance of other revenues sources. This strategy could

include implementing pre-paid water meters for water rate recovery, depending on the outcome of
initial pilots of such meters in Zimbabwe.

There is also room to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of spending. The Ministry of Local
Government, Public Works and National Housing and UCAZ should examine factors for low unit costs
of service delivery in certain local authorities to promote increased efficiency, as part of the service
level benchmarking process. . They should work with local authorities to improve budget execution for
repairs, maintenance, and capital spending, and separate repairs from maintenance. The service level
benchmarking process has been an effective tool to promote peer learning between local authorities,
and could be expanded to include other local service delivery areas, especially local roads.

The Ministry of Local Government, of Public Works and National Housing and other agencies
that manage transfer and lending mechanisms might improve equity by adjusting how funds
are targeted. The Government might consider increasing allocations of PSIP, ZINARA, and other
funding sources to poorer local authorities with wide service delivery infrastructure gaps, but capacity
to manage such funds.




     1           BACKGROUND & CONTEXT
Local government authorities in Zimbabwe play a crucial role in service delivery in many areas
and, following on the 2013 Constitution, have strengthened their roles and responsibilities.
Local government authorities take the lead in providing services related to solid waste disposal, public
lighting, water and sanitation, housing, local roads, and are involved in delivering basic health and
education services at a local level. These public services play a crucial role in promoting the economic
and social well-being of municipalities, cities, towns and local boards. The new 2013 Constitution
provides for increased devolution of powers and responsibilities to the local level, and sets out the
basis for revenue sharing or transfers to provinces and local government for basic service delivery,
fiscal capacity and developmental needs, among others.

However, many Local Authorities face challenges in meeting their service delivery mandates due
to financial, institutional, and capacity constraints. Results from the annual benchmarking surveys
have shown that many local authorities have challenges in consistently providing basic services, such
as water supply, solid waste disposal, and sewage treatment. For example, in the 2015 benchmarking
survey, only 13 of 32 urban local authorities reporting data could provide 15 or more hours of water
supply per day. Though this performance has improved somewhat since 2011, progress has been
slow. Some reasons for slow progress include: (i) local authorities have been operating at deficits; (ii)
demand has increased for local authority services without matching increases in resources to provide
services; (iii) low effectiveness and efficiency (value for money) in most local authorities; and (iv) weak
governance systems in some local authorities.

Moreover, recent operating conditions exacerbate the challenges faced by local authorities.
The period under analysis for this PER featured a few notable trends and events that significantly
affected local government:

â¢	   Low levels of investment in maintenance of the local government infrastructure;

â¢	   Relatively strong urbanization, especially relative to pre-independence, which has put strains on
     the aging infrastructure;




                                                                                                     2
Local Government Service Delivery




â¢	   The 2008 cholera epidemic, which exposed the degradation of the local water and sanitation
     infrastructure; and

â¢	   Hyperinflation and dollarization that contributed to the dissolution of certain transfer and loan
     facilities that had supported investments at the local level.

Following the cholera outbreak and the stabilization of the economy, the GOZ, local authorities, and
donors have made emergency investments in water and sanitation infrastructure, but much more is
needed to bring adequate, safe, and reliable access to these services to the population.

In this context, the World Bank worked with the Ministry of Local Government, Public Works,
and National Housing (MLGPWNH) to conduct a Local Governance Public Expenditure Review
(PER). This PER has four main sections. The first section examines the governance structure and
systems in place for managing public expenditures at the local level. The second section reviews recent
trends in revenue and expenditure in urban and rural local authorities. The third section examines
service delivery in detail in a set of eight local authorities to evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency and
equity of key areas of local government service delivery, including solid waste disposal, public water
provision, and water sanitation. Survey data is available on these services to support the analyses,
which is unfortunately not the case in other core service delivery areas of local governments. The
fourth and final section synthesizes a few key lessons learned and identifies policy recommendations
to strengthen local government financial management.

Legal and Institutional Underpinnings
The Local Government system in Zimbabwe has several levels, spanning both urban and rural
localities. At the National Level, the Ministry of Local Government, Public Works and National Housing
(âthe Ministry of Local Governmentâ) has purview over Urban Local Authorities. It sets policy, supports
capacity building, and provides oversight, especially on financial management and governance issues. The
Ministry of Rural Development, Preservation and Promotion of Culture and Heritage (âMinistry of Rural
Developmentâ), created in late 2015, plays a similar role for rural local authorities.Â¹ Splitting oversight of
rural and urban local authorities between these ministries can create challenges for policy coordination
and effective management. Provincial Administrators are the representatives of the national government
at a sub-national level and report to the Ministry of Rural Development, except for the two Provincial
Administrators assigned to the Urban Provinces of Harare and Bulawayo, who report to the Ministry of
Local Government. Local authorities are composed of publically elected councils (Rural District Councils
and Urban Local Authority Councils), whose memberships serve on a voluntary basis. Such councils are
supported by secretariats/local administration that run the local government on a day to day basis and




Â¹ Prior to the creation of the Ministry of Rural Development, Preservation and Promotion of Culture and Heritage, the Ministry
of Local Government had jurisdiction over both urban and rural authorities.
Â² Most professional staff of local authorities are hired locally, however the Town Clerk and all Heads of Department are appointed
by the Local Government Board, a committee named by the Ministry of Local Government with representatives from UCAZ,
town clerks, the municipal workersâ union, and the Public Service Commission, among others.

ensure service delivery.Â² Each selected councilor represents a ward, and consults with Ward Development
Committees representing the interests of the ward. Rural development councils may also include chiefs
or headsman as representatives of the traditional leadership.Â³

There are several different categories of local authorities, which are designated based on the
characteristics of the local authority. There are a total of 32 local authorities designated as Urban
Local Authorities. Urban authorities may be categorized as Cities, Municipalities, Towns, or Local Boards,
which range from more complex urban areas (Cities) to less well developed urban areas (Local Boards).
The differences between these designations are not entirely based on population, however, as certain
Local Boards have larger populations (i.e., Epworth) than certain cities (i.e., Gweru). For example, an
Urban Local Authority cannot âgraduateâ from being a Local Board to a Town Council without having
some basic water sanitation infrastructure in place. There are a total of 60 Rural Authorities, consisting
of only Rural District Councils.

Local authorities are supported by a wider eco-system of institutions, including professional
networks, community groups, and resident associations. The two main local government professional
organizations are the Urban Councils Association of Zimbabwe (UCAZ) and the Association of Rural District
Councils of Zimbabwe (ARDCZ). Both are membership organizations representing the interests of local
authorities that organize capacity building and information exchange between local authority staff members.
At the local level, Resident Associations and Ward Development Committees provide opportunities for
residents of a community to engage with local government. Resident Associations, which are mainly in
urban areas, are voluntary organizations with mandates to represent the interests or residents within a
jurisdiction (e.g., a Municipality).â´ Ward Development Committees are present in urban and rural areas,
and represent the interests of a specific geographical area within a jurisdiction, aligning to the political
boundaries for a specific councilor in an urban or rural district council. In some cases, Resident Associations
and Ward Development Committees play a service delivery function in partnership with local councils. For
example, in Epworth, several Ward Development Committees raised special funds from their residents to
partner with the local council to conduct land surveys to formalize the stands of ward residents. Another
Ward Development Committee in Epworth partnered with the local authority to grade certain roads in
their ward, with the local authority providing equipment and the ward materials.

The legal foundations of PFM at the local level are largely already established, but some foundational
elements require update. The major sources of guidance underlying local governance finance include:



         Chapter 14 New 2013 Constitution: This chapter provides for increased devolution of powers
         and responsibilities to the local level, sets out key principles for governance at the local level, and
         defines requirements regarding the conduct of employees of provincial and local governments, as
         well as the composition, powers and general provisions regarding the conduct of provincial and
         local officials, including procedures for removal from office.

         Chapter 17, Section 301 New 2013 Constitution: This section sets out the basis for revenue sharing
         or transfers to provinces and local government, including the purposes of such transfers (i.e., basic
         service delivery, fiscal capacity and developmental needs, among others), and requires that ânot
         less than five per cent of the national revenues raised in any financial year must be allocated to the
         provinces and local authorities as their share in that year.â The Government has not yet fully defined
         this transfer system, including the criteria used for revenue sharing and the types of revenues for
         the pool for shared revenues. A discussion of the status of such allocations is provided in Box 1,
         and international best practice in transfer mechanisms is discussed in Box 2.

Local Government Service Delivery


          The Urban Councils Act (Chapter 29:15): This Act provides for the establishment of cities,
          municipalities, towns and local boards, and provides guidance on their structure, administration,
          powers, and functions. The Act includes a specific guidance on sources of funding, appropriate use
          of funds, auditing, and restrictions on borrowing.âµ It also defines the role of the Ministry of Local
          Government to supervise, monitor and direct local authorities. This Act was updated in September
          2016 to comply with provisions of the new Constitution, notably relating to suspension and removal
          of councilors from office, and procedures for the appointment and conduct of independent tribunals
          charged with reviewing cases for removing mayors, chairpersons, or councilors.

          The Rural Councils Act (Chapter 29:13): This Act provides for the establishment of Rural District
          Councils and provides guidance on their structure, administration, powers, and functions. The
          Act includes a specific guidance on the types of levies and charges the Rural District Councils can
          charge, and provisions on the appropriate use of funds, auditing, and restrictions on borrowing,
          similar to those in the Urban Councils Act. This Act was also updated in September 2016 in line
          with the adjustments made to the Urban Councils Act.

          Public Finance Management Act (PFMA): The PFMA, enacted in 2009, lays out national standards
          and requirements for public accounting, financial reporting of government entities, and audit of
          government accounts. However, the Government has identified several areas for improvement
          in the Act and its regulations. Draft amendments and regulations are under discussion, including
          provisions to strengthen the audit function.

          Procurement Act: This Act governs the processes and procedures for Public Procurement at the
          central and sub-national levels. A new version of the Bill is under discussion, and is designed to
          improve the efficiency, transparency and governance of public procurement through a number
          of measures, including transforming the State Procurement Board into two separate entities for
          regulation and oversight.

          Directives of the Ministry of Local Government and Ministry of Rural Development: As the designated
          oversight ministries, the Ministry of Local Government and the Ministry of Rural Development
          periodically issue directives to local authorities to clarify certain processes, procedures or guidelines.
          One example of such a directive is the guideline that the Ministry of Local Government provided
          requiring a 30:70 ratio between employment and non-employment costs in local government budgets.


Box 1 below discusses Chapter 17, Section 301 of the New Constitution, and provides information about
spending incurred by the National Government to support local service delivery in health and education.



        Box 1: Constitutional Mandate for Revenue Sharing with Local Authorities

   As noted above, section 301 of the new Constitution stipulates that at least five percent of
   national revenue should be allocated to local government, yet there is no formal system in
   place to govern the distribution of national revenue among local authorities. The Government
   has not defined the formula or mechanism used for redistribution, nor the types of revenues
   to be used for the shared pool to be redistributed. This is party due to extremely constrained
   macroeconomic conditions, which severely limit the availability of funds to redistribute to local
   levels. For now, the National Government has relatively limited transfers to local governments
   (primarily through ZINARA and the PSIP investment program), and more significant payments
   of local teacher and health service personnel salaries at the local level. The table below provides
   estimates on the total amounts spent in 2015 towards employment costs, current transfers,
   capital transfers, and special initiatives to support education and health at sub-national levels.



âµ The Act defines specific purposes for which borrowing is allowed, and requires that all loans must be: (1) agreed to by a
majority of the total membership of the council; (2) public notices will have been made without any opposition from the public;
(3) the minister has approved the loan.

The total amounts are equivalent to 27 percent of total revenue, with the majority being spent
on costs of employing primary teachers (16 percent) and secondary teachers (eight percent).

        Box 2: International Best Practice for Intergovernmental Transfers

Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfer systems are a common tool to facilitate fiscal decentralization,
fund priority local service delivery, and promote equalization goals between localities with
different levels of average per capita income. Generally speaking, effective intergovernmental
transfer systems have the following characteristics:




                                                                                                           6
Local Government Service Delivery




  1.	 Clarity in objectives â the objectives of the transfer system should be clear and precise
      to guide design and implementation

  2.	 Autonomy and efficiency â the transfer system should maximize the independence and
      flexibility for subnational governments to use transfer funds in the most efficient way

  3.	 Revenue adequacy â between transferred funds and own revenues, the subnational
      governments should have sufficient funds to fulfil their designated responsibilities

  4.	 Affordability â the transfer mechanism must recognize the fiscal constraints of the country
      and not undermine macro-stability objectives

  5.	 Responsiveness â the transfer program should be flexible enough to adapt to unanticipated
      changes in the fiscal situations of recipients

  6.	 Equity â a higher proportion of funds should be directed to those areas with the highest
      fiscal need and lowest tax capacity

  7.	 Predictability â the formula used for the transfer mechanism should remain relatively fixed,
      and the national government should provide five year projections of anticipated funding
      (including ceilings and floors), to improve the ability of subnational governments to plan

  8.	 Transparency â the formula and allocations should be public and widely disseminated to
      achieve consensus on the objectives and operation of the system

  9.	 Simplicity â the formula should be clear, objective, and based on factors over which the
      subnational governments have little control (to avoid gaming the system)

  10.	Incentive â the design should reinforce incentives for sound financial management and
      avoid specific transfers to finance subnational deficits, a practice that can discourage fiscal
      discipline

  11.	Reach â the design process should examine the winners and losers in the process and
      consider how this may affect the usefulness and sustainability of the program

  12.	Accountability for results â the recipient must be accountable to the national government
      and the countryâs citizens for financial integrity and service delivery results


  Few transfer systems meet all of the characteristics listed above. There are numerous examples
  of different countries that have experimented with transfer formulas, each designed with their
  own goals and objectives. Some countries in the region, such as Uganda, have adopted the
  use of âperformance grantsâ to complement formula based transfers, which have resulted in
  improvements in local government performance. Some recent examples of equalization transfer
  systems, along with their goals and objectives, are provided in the table below:

The following two sub-sections provide more details on the governance of local governance revenues
and expenditures, respectively.


Governance in Revenue Policy and Administration
The local council acts (Urban Councils Act and Rural Council Act) allow councils to raise their
own revenues through several sources. The sources of funds for local authorities can be classified
into internal and external sources. Internally, local authorities mobilize funds through property
rates, levies, sales (for example, of land), fees, fines, permits, and licenses. External sources of
funding include additional funds provided by the central government through transfers, grants and
loans, or in some cases donor funding. The services for which local authorities charge fees or levies
include water for domestic commercial or industrial use, sewerage services, solid waste disposal,
and parking, among others. The other main segment of service charges accrue from user fees/rates
from hospitals, clinics, ambulances services, schools, libraries, or other community services. Some
local authorities also raise funds through income generating activities. The acts give local authorities
statutory powers to levy ratepayer user fees, though the yearly tariff adjustments are regulated by
central government.

The process of setting rates in councils is provided for in Section 288 of the Urban Councils Act
29:15 and Rural District Councils Act 29:13, which states that:

        Section 288 Estimates: (1) Before the expiry of any financial year the finance committee shall draw
        up and present for the approval of the council estimates in such detail as the council may require of
        the income and expenditure on revenue and capital accounts of the council for the next succeeding
        financial year.

Local Government Service Delivery


The same Act empowers local authorities to fix tariff and charges by resolution:

1.	 A local authority may, by resolution passed by a majority of the total membership of the local
    authorityâ
	   a) fix tariffs or charges forâ
      i. 	 the supply of electricity or water or of refuse removal services; or
      ii. 	 the conveyance of sewage or trade effluent in public sewers and its treatment at a sewage
      	 treatment works; or
      iii. 	any other services which a local authority may provide in terms of this Act;

In line with these legal provisions, draft estimates of income and expenditure (budget) are prepared by
LA departmental heads and collated into a consolidated council Estimates of Income and Expenditure.
The budget is then presented to stakeholders through community outreach (consultation) meetings,
whose purpose is to seek residentsâ inputs and agreement on the following yearsâ budgets, including
tariffs. These consultations are central to the rate setting process, and are enshrined in the various
government directives as well as the Prime Ministerâs Directive of 1984. This latter Directive advocates,
among other issues, the broad participation and involvement of the grassroots communities in
governance and other development programs within their localities. At the grassroots levels these
consultations may involve Water Development Committees, Residents Associations and other
community based groups.

There is no uniform way of setting and determining water and sewer tariffs. The processes of
determining tariff levels vary from local authority to local authority. However, the broad categories
of tariff regimes are standardized as follows:

1.	   Industrial/Commercial tariff structure
2.	   Institutional tariff structure
3.	   Residential Low density tariff structure
4.	   Residential High density tariff structure

Section 47 of the PFMA Chapter 22:19 provides that when estimates presented in terms of subsection
(1) have been approved by the council and signed by the mayor or chairman of the council, as the
case may be, the council shall ensure thatâ

â¢	    Copies of the estimates are forthwith made available for inspection by the public; and
â¢	    Three copies of the estimates are forwarded within two months to the Minister for his information.

Tariffs are formally set by passing a Council Resolution, yet in practice are subject to approval
by the Ministry of Local Government. The budget together with tariffs are inspected and endorsed
by residents and forwarded to the Minister for formal approval, as in PFMA Chapter 22:19 is not
legislatively required. The Minister has assumed an approval function, which he has exercised from time
to time to set a pro-poor tariff that ensures cost recovery. This has largely been directed at water and
wastewater tariffs for consumers resident in high density areas. The Ministry of Local Government has
power to refuse approval of a budget where tariff levels are deemed too high or can cause hardships
to residents, particularly in high density areas. When tariffs are too high using a cost-build-up method,
the Ministry directs a downward revision of the tariff by councils before budget approval. The inability,
in some cases, of LAs to provide tariff justification from a proper cost build up analysis, has not helped
resolve a perception issue on roles, leaving some to perceive that the Ministry âsetsâ tariffs, contrary
to the provisions of the Act. Notable efforts are being made through the service level benchmarking
activities and the Urban Council Association Forums to design a standard cost build up template for
water, wastewater and solid waste services.

The Central Governmentâs role in oversight and approval reveals a tension between ensuring
strong PFM practice and allowing for local authority discretion. The Ministry of Local Government
now has a relatively strong oversight role. It has the power to approve each local authorityâs budget
and revenue collection ratesâ· â and to require changes even after the budget and rates have been


â· Under section 229 of the Urban Councils Act [Chapter 29:15].

set by community groups and the local council. In reviewing budgets and proposed tariff levels, the
Ministry of Local Government uses a checklist that provides summary information on the budget,
budget performance, the proposed tariff changes, the level of creditors and debtors, and verifies that:

â¢	   the Chief Executive Officer is using a Performance Contract;
â¢	   there is no budget deficit;
â¢	   the local authority has credible strategies in place to liquidate creditors and statutory obligations
     (and report on outcomes from previous yearsâ strategies);
â¢	   any proposed income generating projects are viable;
â¢	   the local authority is up to date on its audited accounts;
â¢	   ratios related to capital spending (about 15 to 25 percent of total expenditure) and employment
     costs (<30 percent of total expenditure) are met;
â¢	   the full council has adopted the budget; and
â¢	   consultations and public disclosure requirements were met and objections were adequately addressed.

A copy of the checklist used for the review of the 2016 budgets is included as Annex 1.

There are good reasons for this approval process â as evidenced by the low quality of many
budgets produced by local authorities â but the approval process can also lead to unanticipated
outcomes. In some reported cases, community groups have agreed to increased revenue rates (for
example in water provision â see box 3 in the following section) to allow for investment projects to
move forward or to meet the costs of providing water purchased through ZINWA. When rates are
then disapproved by the ministry, and the budgets remain, the local authority is put in an awkward
situation, where it has promised to deliver certain service delivery improvements without being allowed
to raise the requisite funds. A more nuanced analysis of rates may be required to balance the desire
to minimize burdens on households while allowing local authorities to mobilize revenues to make
needed investments.

Governance in Expenditure Policy and Budget Execution
As noted in the introduction, local authorities have a broad mandate for service delivery. Local
government authorities lead the provision of services related to solid waste disposal, public lighting,
water sanitation, housing, and local roads. These areas do not generally overlap with the mandate
of national level agencies, except insofar as local authorities must comply with national regulations
or in cases where a national agency (i.e. ZINWA) provides services to local authorities. The service
delivery categories with the greatest potential for overlap between local authorities and the national
government are basic health and education. In these areas, both local authorities and the national
ministries responsible for health and education are involved in funding service delivery at the local
level. The most important aspect of national level financing is salaries of teachers and health workers,
but these Ministries also provide some limited transfers and grants to local institutions. These issues
are discussed in more detail in the Health and Education PERs. As discussed below, fiscal constraints
have disrupted the transfer system and reduced transfers from the national government to local
authorities, leaving local authorities with less funding despite greater mandates for service delivery.

Local authorities have instituted new systems to strengthen local financial management,
though these systems are not yet fully in use. For example, Promun or other GFMIS platforms are
present in most local authorities, but not all modules are being used, and not all local authorities have
the capacity to use them to reconcile accounts or produce financial reports. Many local authorities
lack effective systems within or outside the GFMIS that can appropriately manage assets throughout
the full lifecycle â from procuring and registering to valuation and eventually disposal. Some core
resources needed to promote effective local financial management (i.e., an accounting manual) are
under development only now.

Discussions with stakeholders in local authorities revealed an uneven application of good
practices in PFM, partly due to capacity gaps in certain local authorities. There is very uneven
capacity to produce financial reports: some local authorities produce financial reports compliant with
IPSAS accrual standards, while others are unable to compile basic income statements. There is some
inconsistency in applying good practices in procurement and auditing.

Local Government Service Delivery


Participatory dialogue mechanisms have been implemented in the past few years to improve the
quality and validity of local authority budgets. These mechanisms hold promise, but are not used to
full potential. A major weakness is that though the process was designed for residents to provide input
in defining priority activities to be implemented in the coming year, some LAs tend to use the process
to seek endorsement of what the Council has already planned and costed. The Full Council, however,
is responsibility for adopting the final budget through a Council Resolution before submitting it for
the Ministryâs approval. During budget execution, feedback meetings with communities are expected
to be conducted. Yet in some LAs, such meetings are limited to elected Councilors and other elected
leadership, in formal Full Council meetings. Participation in dialogue mechanisms varies among LAs,
and this is a major concern of the Ministry for Local Government. In most local authorities, participatory
meetings involve less than 0.5 percent of the community population. Local community groups note
that meetings are often held at inconvenient times, or are announced with little advanced notice,
making it difficult for people to participate. Other groups note that budgets are rarely implemented,
due to low revenue collection and other reasons, and thus not credible.â¸

          3                  FISCAL TRENDS
More stable economic conditions since 2011 enabled local authorities to collect more revenues;
however, increases in expenditure have substantially outpaced such increases, contributing
to greater deficit spending (see Figure 1 and Figure 2). Total revenue increased by 41 percent from
$570 million in 2011 to $804 million in 2014â¹ across the 92 local authorities (32 urban and 60 rural).
During the same period, expenditures increased by 132 percent from $556 million to $1.3 billion. The
large increase in spending in 2013 is at least partly related to a debt cancellation directive from the
Ministry of Local Government, which was recorded as General Expenses in the records of many local
authorities (discussed in more detail later in the report).

The rapid escalation of spending by local authorities, especially after 2012, contributed to
significant fiscal deficits. The local government fiscal deficit increased from 9.3 percent of total
revenue in 2011 to 11.9 percent in 2012âand more dramatically to 69.1 percent in 2013. In 2014, the
deficit fell slightly to 60.7 percent of total revenues. To ensure sustainability, local governments should
contain fiscal deficits to below 10 percent. Figure 3 shows that the deficit is above this threshold from
2012, thus posing high financial risk.

From 2011 to 2014, city councils ran annual operational deficits, performing worse than other
local authorities (see Table 1). Municipalities broke even in 2011, but ran deficits in other years. On
average, town councils and local boards satisfied the benchmark and were not in deficit, except in
2013 when the GoZ issued directives to write off all ratepayersâ arrears. Aggregated together, all local
authorities ran a sizeable deficit below the benchmark, driven down mainly by city councils.

Underperformance on budgeted revenues is a key source of fiscal deficits. Figure 4 demonstrates
that local authorities collected only about 73 percent of budgeted revenues in 2012, falling to 52 percent
and 51 percent in 2013 and 2014, respectively. The ratio of actual to budgeted revenues rebounded to
about 78 percent by 2015. The gap between budgeted and actual revenues appears to be driven by lack
of proper revenue forecasting techniques in some local authorities, and ratepayersâ non-compliance.
Site visits conducted to prepare the PER confirmed that budgeting is conducted assuming 100 percent
compliance with local fees and tariffs, partly to meet Ministry requirements to submit a budget with
no deficit. Yet actual compliance is much lower. For example, all Local Authorities in 2016 budgeted
for surpluses, except for Bulawayo and Zvishavane, which neither budgeted for a surplus nor a deficit.



                                                                                                     12

The compliance of ratepayers was adversely affected by a Ministry of Local Government directive
in 2013. The ministry issued a directive to all local authorities to write off all arrears on outstanding
debts for non- commercial and industrial ratepayers, which since July 2013 has eroded performance.
In particular, the drop in the ratio of actual to budgeted revenues in 2013 and 2014 reflects this policy.
This policy might be leading residents, who may be hoping for further debt relief, to habitually not
pay for council services in certain local authorities. From 2011, the difference between actual revenue
collected and budgeted revenue was more than 20 percentâreaching the highest in 2013 at 49 percent.

Underperformance in revenue also stems from difficulties in setting rates permitting cost
recovery in major services. For example, certain local authorities whose water supply is provided
by ZINWA may be charged a higher rate than they are able to pass on to consumers, leading to
operating losses. Box 3 provides a summary of the different pathways for water supply, and some
cost recovery issues faced by different local authorities. Ten of Zimbabweâs 32 urban local authorities
are piloting pre-paid meters, which should reduce non-revenue water, and reduce costs across the
system. In Bindura, the community agreed to pay a portion of water rate arrears along with pre-paid
water, demonstrating that this approach can be used to both collect current funds and arrears. It will
be important to monitor this innovation to assess whether the approach should be replicated across
local authorities.



                 Box 3: Zimbabweâs Water Supply Service Pathways and
                             Related Cost Recovery Issues

  There are different institutional pathways by which water is supplied to urban residents in
  Zimbabwe. According to the Water Act, all water belongs to the State, and ZINWA is mandated
  to develop and supply raw water. However, beyond this premise, there are a variety of different
  models for water supply and distribution in the country, including the following:

  1.	 ZINWA supplies treated water to the consumer directly, such as for Karoi, Mvurwi, Lupane
      and Chirundu local authorities. The challenge here is that LAs are denied water sale revenues,
      and cannot use water disconnections as an instrument to enforce non-payment of other rates.

  2.	 ZINWA sells treated water to a Local Authority for distribution to residents, such as in
      Beitbridge and Gwanda LAs. A major challenge is slow payments to ZINWA for water. ZINWA
      has limited options available to enforce payments, as it cannot switch off a whole city. ZINWA
      tariffs are, however, not subject to same approval processes as the LA, which may cause an LA




   13
                                                                    Local Government Service Delivery




      to operate at a loss. Moreover, the LA must receive approval for rates charged to consumers
      from the Ministry Local Government, which can oblige the LA to charge consumers a rate
      lower than set by ZINWA, and approved by the Minister of Environment, Water and Climate.
      For example, Gwanda gets its water at $0.85c/m3 from ZINWA and sells to consumers at a
      Ministry-approved rate of $0.81c/m3, to cushion low income consumers in high density areas.

  3.	 A local authority treats raw water and supplies directly to customers, such as in Harare,
      Bindura, Bulawayo, Gweru and Mutare. This is a common arrangement for most major
      local authorities, including Harare and Bulawayo that partly own supply dams. The LA is
      accountable for water services, owns water assets, and is responsible for water revenues.

  4.	 A local authority treats water and sells bulk treated water to another local authority
      for final distribution to residents, such as Harareâs supply of treated water to satellite cities
      of Chitungwiza, Norton, Ruwa and Epworth local authorities. Challenges in this arrangement
      include high inter-LA water debt, and limited guaranteed water supply in the receiving LA. For
      example, satellite cities owe Harare large sums, and do not have a guaranteed water supply.

  5.	 A local authority treats water and sells it to a private company, which sells it to another
      local authority for distribution to residents. This arrangement applies in Kwekwe and Red
      Cliff, and Shurugwi. The Red Cliff municipality receives water from Kwekweâbut via Ziscosteel.
      A challenge has been resolving debt, as there are no formal agreements between cities.

  6.	 A private company treats and distributes water directly to residents, such as the case
      of Hwange Colliery. Much of Hwange town receives treated water from Hwange Colliery,
      which is not charged for.

  7.	 A local authority outsources the treatment of water to a private company, which
      returns treated water to the LA for distribution, such as in Chiredzi LA. A key challenge
      is without metering, the Chiredzi LA has been charged based on treatment plant design
      capacityânot on actual costs and volumes.

  The financial and operating efficiency of water delivery channels in Zimbabwe can be compared
  with models in other countries. In Kenya, the Bank has worked with the national regulatory
  authority to benchmark the financial and operating performance of water utilities owned by local
  governments. Relevant data is published and updated periodically for the public, contributing to
  greater transparency and efficiency. In Zimbabwe, the World Bank is supporting the implementation
  of a peer-reviewed Service level Performance Benchmarking process (SLB) for all 32 urban LAs.


To address revenue shortfalls, some local authorities are accruing significant salary arrears,
payment arrears (especially for water), and taking expensive short term bank loans or overdraft
facilities to finance recurrent spending. The most common strategy to manage fiscal deficits since
2009 is accumulating salary arrears. Figure 5 shows that most big local authorities (Harare, Bulawayo,
Mutare, Gweru and Chitungwiza) had high salary arrears. In 2015, about 66 percent of local authorities
had salary arrears. Local authorities have started owing salary arrears since 2010. The only councils
without arrears are Beitbridge, Chegutu, Chirundu, Epworth, Lupane, Masvingo, Mvurwi, Rusape,
Ruwa, Victoria Falls, and Zvishavane.

Accumulating debt has also been a means to bridge the financing gap. In 2015, total debt across
all local authorities was estimated at about $555 million, representing 105 percent of total revenues
collected by local authorities. In this case, debt is defined as the total amount the local authority owes
to all creditors, including bank debt, payment arrears, and salary arrears, among others. On average,
debt of all local authorities increased by about 21.2 percent between 2014 and 2015. Figure 6 shows
debt each local authority owed to all of its creditors in 2014 and 2015. All local authorities increased
their debt between 2014 and 2015, save Chirundu, Chipinge, Harare, and Rusape. To curtail excessive
borrowing by local governments, the Ministry of Local Government may consider implementing a
âtraffic light systemâ similar to a system in Colombia, which regulates the ability of local authorities to
assume debt based a transparent and objective evaluation system. Information on how this system
works in Colombia is in Box 4.

         Box 4: Colombiaâs Traffic Light System to Control Local Borrowing
 To shore up local finances, Colombia implemented a âtraffic light systemâ for subnational debt
 in the 1990s and early 2000s. The adoption of the Traffic Light Law 358-1997 (Ley de SemÃ¡foro)
 was the first major step. This law introduced a system where local governments were classified
 in three categories â green, yellow and red â based on measures of their liquidity and solvency,
 as summarized below. Highly indebted local governments were prohibited from borrowing (red
 light), less extreme cases required prior approval from the Ministry of Finance (yellow light), while
 low risk cases could take on debt autonomously (green light).

 * Operational savings is defined as current income minus operational expenses and transfers paid by the subnational
 government. Current income mainly includes tax revenue, nontax revenue, royalties and fees, transfers from the
 central government, national revenue sharing, and interest income. Operational expenses include wages and salaries,
 honorariums, social welfare benefits, and social security expenditures.


 After this system did not prove sufficient to contain local government debt, Colombia passed a
 subsequent law (Law 617), which served as a sub-national fiscal responsibility law, and introduced
 the following additional constraints on sub-national borrowing:

 â¢	   Primary current expenditure cannot exceed non-earmarked current revenues, and
      cannot exceed a fixed percentage, depending on the category of the state or municipality;
      governments must make additional cuts when effective non-earmarked current revenues
      are lower than budgeted;

 â¢	   States and municipalities cannot make transfers to their public entities;




                                                                                                                16

  â¢	    Strict limits apply to creating new municipalities, and non-viable municipalities must be
        merged with others;

  â¢	    If a sub-national governments is out of compliance with the lawâs fiscal rules, it must adopt
        a fiscal rescue program to regain viability within two years;

  â¢	    Expansion of the rules and requirements surrounding the election of governors, mayors,
        congressmen and their relatives to promote transparency.

  These two laws -- and a broader Fiscal Responsibility Law passed in 2003 that among other items
  eliminated the âyellow lightâ category â have led to a reduction in fiscal deficits and/or fiscal
  surpluses in sub-national government balance sheets.

Revenue Trends
Benefitting from economic stability, total revenues have increased since 2011, though much of
this is due to growing sales. As noted above, total revenue increased by 41 percent from $570 million
in 2011 to $804 million in 2014. From 2011, the main source of funds for local government was sales,
which constituted over 40 percent of total revenue. As revenues from sales rose by 73 percent from
2011 to 2014, the contribution of sales to total local revenues rose from 40.4 percent to 44.3 percent
(see Table 2). Sales are mainly for residential and industrial stands. The rapid growth in sales is partly
due to upward adjustments in prices of residential stands. The second largest source of funding is
property rates: the rates paid by owners of fixed property (land, houses, factories, and office blocks)
based on property value. Property rates represented more than 20 percent of local revenue, and
increased by 54 percent in absolute terms from 2011 to 2014. However, many local authorities do not
have functional property registration systems, and suffer from incomplete or outdated valuations.
Additional investments in this area could result in better revenue outturn for property rates. The third
largest source is fees, fines, permits and licenses, which represented about 15 percent of revenues
and rose by about 37 percent in absolute terms over the period (see Figure 7 and Table 2).

Local authorities rely on sources of revenue differently. Cities and town councils rely foremost on
sales, while municipalities and local boards rely most on fees, fines, permits and licenses. Towns and city
councils rely on property rates as the second largest source of revenue. The second highest revenue source
for municipalities is property rates followed by sales, which slumped in 2012. For local boards, sales and
property rates contribute almost the same revenue (see Figure 8).
Local authorities are permitted to raise revenue from income generating projects, such as beer
halls and farming activities. In 2015, about 69 percent of Urban Local Authorities had Income Generating
Projects in their books, though most projects are poorly managed and not profitable. Some of the projects
also did not have Ministerial approval.

Grant and investment transfer programs funded from the central government contribute little
to local government finances, leaving the local authorities reliant on local sources of financing. In
2014, grants accounted for 2 percent of overall funding, and this share has been somewhat flat in recent
years. As shown in Table 2, internal sources account for almost all funding for local government. The local
authorities, especially urban local authorities, used to receive a larger share of capital finance from the
central fiscus through the Public Sector Investment Programme (PSIP) and other grant programs, but due
to fiscal constraints this source of revenue has fallen in recent years. Facing fewer government grants and
dwindling fiscal resources, local authorities are struggling to provide services to constituencies. As a result,
capital development funds are often diverted to fund recurrent expenditures. Sometimes, even donor
funds are illegally diverted to cover recurrent expenses.

Local authorities have lost a major source of revenue: issuance of vehicle licenses. Since 2009, local
authorities have no longer been responsible for issuing vehicle licenses, which had been the major source
of funding for road maintenance projects. Central government took over the collection and distribution of
vehicle licensing fees, which is housed under the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure Development,
and managed by Zimbabwe National Road Administration (ZINARA). The funds are disbursed on a quarterly
basis, after the council prepares a program of work and submits it to ZINARA for funding. ZINARA officially
disburses funds on the basis of the class of roads in an area, traffic levels, road condition, and whether
funding is needed for routine or periodic maintenance.Â¹â° In reality, ZINARA funding for local authoritiesâ
road maintenance work is reportedly lower than it had been prior to the transfer of this function to ZINARA,
appears to go predominantly to larger urban areas, and is generally considered to be inadequate.

Overall, current collection rates across local authorities are insufficient to cover full service delivery.
Local authorities have thus incurred huge debts, and are having difficulties providing services. Key reasons
for lower revenues include excessive control by central government over raising fees or rates; declines
in grants from central government; adverse macroeconomic conditions; and sometimes lack of financial

management capacity in local authorities. Macroeconomic conditions limit options for raising revenue.
One factor exacerbating fiscal constraints is government debt due to local authorities, which was US$36
million in March 2016.

Expenditure Trends
Recurrent expenditure dominates local authoritiesâ expenditure. Employment costs, which have
consistently increased, is the largest expenditure categoryâsave in 2013 when general expenses
were the highestÂ¹Â¹ (see Figure 9). Employment costs have dominated local government expenditure,
making up more than 40 percent on average since 2011. Because high employment costs have been
problematic, the Ministry of Local Government set a criterion to maintain a 30:70 ratio of employment to
non-employment costs,Â¹Â² with a view to reduce fiscal risks when revenues are lower than budgeted, and
increase resources for maintenance and repairs. In addition to instituting controls over employment


Â¹Â¹ The increase in General Expenses in 2013 is largely due to the directive on debt forgiveness in that year, as debt forgiven
was classified as a general expense.
Â¹Â² The Ministry of Local Government considers non-employment costs to represent âservice delivery costsâ.

costs, local governments must expand the use of results based management techniques for assessing
staff and increasing employee incentives for productivity. High employment costs have left little fiscal
space for repairs and maintenance, which comprised only 7.0 percent of local government expenditure
from 2011 to 2014, partly explaining dilapidated council roads and other services. In general, capital
expenditure for Local Authorities is supposed to range between 15-25 percent of total expenditure.
In 2016, about 72 percent of local authorities met this criterion for their budget estimates. Those not
meeting this criterion included Bulawayo, Chegutu, Epworth, Gweru, Harare, Lupane, Marondera,
Plumtree and Rusape.

From 2011 to 2014, employment costs followed by general expenses represented the two highest
expense categories in municipalities, city councils and local boards. Town councils, however, spent
the most on general expenses followed by employment costs, which started to decline from 2013 (see
Figure 10). The ratio of employment cost to total expenditure breaches the 30 percent benchmark
across all local authorities. Municipalities recorded the highest breach, followed by local boards (see
Table 4). The average ratio for all local authorities was 40 percentâwith the highest ratios in 2011
and 2012.

The analysis of local government service delivery draws from a sub-set of eight local authorities.
The sub-set has detailed, continuous data covering 2012 to 2015 on budgeted and actual expenditures
in key service delivery categories. The local authorities include two cities (Kadoma and Mutare), four
municipalities (Bindura, Chegutu, Kariba, and Victoria Falls), one town council (Norton), and one local
board (Epworth). As these local authorities were selected based on data availability rather than
representativeness, care should be taken to not overgeneralize findings. The sample has somewhat
higher levels of poverty and smaller populations than average urban areas, largely because the sample

The following sub-sections discuss how efficiently local authorities balance competing demands for
service delivery (allocative efficiency), and explore issues of effectiveness and technical efficiency in select
service delivery areas: water provision, waste water treatment, and solid waste disposal. These three
areas were selected based on their importance to urban development and data availability. The section
concludes by discussing equity of service delivery between more and less well-off local authorities.

Overall Allocative Efficiency
Local Authorities provide diverse services to their communities, including public water provision;
waste water treatment; local roads construction and maintenance; solid waste disposal; police, fire,
and ambulance services; and maintenance of public spaces and community infrastructure, such as
public parks. Local authorities have a role in providing local health and education services, although

the national government also provides public resources to these services. Figure 11 and Figure 12

Administrative, finance, and management costs are the largest category of costs, averaging
about 21 percent of budgeted resources and 23 percent of actual spending between 2012 and
2015. Administrative, finance and management costs include cross-cutting administrative costs, and the
costs of maintaining the council and managing staff working for the local governments who do not have
specific service delivery functions (e.g. housing or health). On a budgeted basis, administrative costs fell
from about 30 percent of the overall budget in 2012 ($19.7 million) to about 26 percent of the budget
in 2015 ($17.0 million). On an actual basis, however, the share of expenditures spent on administrative
costs increased from 21 percent in 2012 ($11.2 million) to 26 percent in 2015 ($16.0 million).

The next largest category of spending is Roads and Works, though spending in this area has fallen
significantly. From 2012 to 2015, Roads and Works represented on average 22 percent of budgeted
expendituresâbut dropped annually from 25 percent to 16 percent. Actual expenditures fell from 24
percent in 2012 to 16 percent in 2015. Drops in expenditures may be partly due to ZINARA replacing local
governments in collecting vehicle license fees, which are used for road investment and maintenance.
Since 2014, ZINARA has been mandated to redistribute funds to local governments, but many local
authorities have received comparatively fewer funds, decreasing expenditure and needed investment

to maintain roads.Â¹âµ Budget execution for Roads and Works was lowâaveraging 57 percent from 2012
to 2015 (see Figure 13). Factors for low execution partly include un-predictability of ZINARA transfers,
and weak capacity in certain local authorities to implement complex roads projects.

Water provision and water sanitation comprise sizeable shares of public funds at the local level. On
average, water provision made up about 18 percent of budgeted expenditures and 15 percent of actual
expenditures between 2012 and 2015. Water sanitation represented about 5 percent of the budget and 5
percent of expenditures in the same period. Except in 2013, budget execution in water provision and water
sanitation was below 75 percent over the period (65 percent on average). The high budget execution in 2013
was driven by mandated debt forgiveness, which was recorded as an expense under general expenses.

Education and Health are key service delivery areas for local governments, yet much funding is paid
through the central fiscus or directly by households to schools. Education and Health together represented
on average 7.7 percent of budgeted expenditures and 11.2 percent of actual expenditures from 2012 to 2015.
But most of this expenditure was programmed for health initiatives: Health made up about 95 percent of
budgeted expenditures for Education and Health; and 98 percent of the combined actual expenditures. Partly,
both Education and Health Salaries are paid for by the central fiscus (see Box 1). Household contributions largely
fund general expenses, maintenance, and CAPEX. See Volume 4 for more details.

The remaining 26 percent of the budget and 28 percent of actual expenditures were allocated
to other local services. The largest shares of this remaining budget were spent on housing and public
buildings (7 percent budget/8 percent actual), police and emergency services (7 percent budget/8 percent
actual), and solid waste disposal (4 percent budget/5 percent actual). Figure 11, Figure 12, and Table 6
provide more information on relative shares of these service delivery areas. Details are also provided later
in this volume on financing issues in solid waste disposal.

Analysis of Key Services Delivered By Local Authorities
Public Water Supply and Distribution

Among the local authorities considered in this analysis, budgeted spending on water supply and distribution
rose by 90 percent from 2012 to 2015, and actual spending by 46 percent (see Figure 14). Spending was
higher in 2013 and 2014, largely due to the debt forgiveness policy, which covered, among other things,

local water charges, and ballooned spending in those years. For example, Mutare forgave more than $3.2
million in outstanding water supply debts in 2013, and Kariba forgave debts of about $3.0 million in 2014.

General expenses make up most water supply costs, followed by CAPEX, repairs and maintenance, and
employee costsâthough budget execution of the capital budget is very low. Public water supply and
distribution is highly dependent on general expenses, given needs to purchase bulk water, water treatment
chemicals, and electricity and fuel. Between 2012 and 2015, general expense made up on average 43 percent
of budgeted expenditure and 74 percent of actual expenditure. Such allocations are distorted, however, by
the noted debt forgiveness.Â¹â¶ Data is not uniformly available across all local authorities on how much debt
was forgiven and how this affected annual expenditures. Yet if deductions are made for the combined $6.2
million in debt forgiveness for Mutare and Kariba, goods and services fall to 65 percent of actual expenses.
Capital outlays is the next highest share of the water supply budget, representing 27 percentâthough capital
spending made up less than one percent of actual spending from 2012 to 2015. Repairs and maintenance
performed somewhat better,Â¹â· representing 13 percent of the budget and 9 percent of actual spending, while
Employee costs represented 11 percent of the budget, and 15 percent of actual spending.

Â¹â¶ For example, Mutareâs forgiveness of outstanding water supply debts resulted in 887 percent of the budget for general
expenses for water supply to be spent in that year, and Karibaâs debt forgiveness (booked under 2014 expenditures) resulted
in a budget execution rate of 448 percent in that year for general expenses.
Â¹â· The bulk of this expenditure is on repairs, rather than maintenance. Most local authorities either do not have or do not adhere
to planned maintenance plans, resulting in disruptions to service delivery and higher repair costs.


                                                                                                                          26

As shown in Table 7, actual spending on water provision varied between the eight local authorities
in the sample. Total average actual expenditures ranged from a high of $2.4 million in Victoria FallsÂ¹â¸
to a low of $223 thousand in Chegutu.Â¹â¹ In addition, local authorities have varying capacity to execute
their water provision budgets. Budget execution in Kadoma and Kariba averaged above 100 percent
and Victoria Falls above 80 percent. Yet execution rates in Bindura, Chegutu and Norton fell below
25 percent.

While local authorities that spend more per capita on water supply tend to be high performers,
some high performers are able to deliver at lower per capital cost. Kariba and Victoria Falls, which
spend more than $70 per capita annually on water supply services, score well on coverage of households,
overall liters of water supplied per day, hours of water supplied, and water quality. Though no local

authority with lower spending does as well on hours of water supply, several moderate spenders,
such as Kadoma and Bindura, score well on other measures, while maintaining lower per capita costs.
Though costs of water provision vary by local authority based on their capital infrastructure and access
to water sources, there may be room for mutual learning on how to improve cost-effectiveness of public
water delivery. Costs also vary based on geographic characteristics. Mutare, for example, has access
to a clean source of raw water located upstream, and therefore does not incur high pumping costs.

       All Urban Local Authorities                    (SLB) Survey reveals that increases in a local
                                                      authorityâs cost recovery for public water supply

                                                  utilities should consider structural reforms.

                                                  volume on SOEs (Volume 3), water utilities would
                                                  benefit from instituting more robust corporate

Sewerage and Sanitation

Budgeted spending on sewerage and water sanitation rose steadily from 2012 to 2015, though
actual spending varied substantially between years. Aggregated budgeted expenditure on sewerage

among selected local authorities rose from $3.9 million in 2012 to $5.1 million in 2015âan increase
of about 31 percent. Actual expenditures rose 42 percent from $2.1 million in 2012 to $3.0 million in
2015. However, spending peaked in 2013 to $5.8 million, before falling to $1.9 million in 2014. Most
of this increase is due to large increases in Kadoma and Mutare, which executed large debt write-offs
for sewerage customers in 2013 of about $1.6 million and $2.1 million, respectively. In 2014, spending
on sewerage fell below the level in 2012 to $1.9 million across local authorities.

To maintain their financial viability, and improve the efficiency of service delivery, local water
utilities should also consider more structural reforms. In line with the recommendations made in
the following volume on State Owned Enterprises, water utilities would benefit from instituting more
robust corporate governance practices, such as improving the quality and independence of their board,
improving the transparency of their financial disclosures, and implementing performance contracts at
the institutional and management levels. More details are provided in Volume 3.

Though budgeted allocations are reasonably balanced between categories of expenditure, actual
spending demonstrates low budget execution in capital spending and repairs and maintenance
(See Figure 19 and Figure 20). Budgeted expenditures are well balanced between Employee Costs (31
percent), General Expenses (23 percent), Repairs and Maintenance (25 percent), and Capital Outlays
(20 percent)âwith a small allocation for Debt Charges (1 percent). Actual spending is much more
heavily weighted to General Expenses and Employee Costs, due to the effects of debt forgiveness on
General Expenses, and weak budget execution rates of 27 percent in Repairs and Maintenance and
10 percent in Capital Outlays.

Local authorities with higher cost recovery and spending per capita generally have better
coverage and quality of sewage services. Data from the Service Level Benchmarking survey suggests
that cost recovery generally enables wider coverage of sewage servicesâthough some local authorities
with high cost recovery did not manage to expand coverage (see Figure 21). Kariba, which spends the
most per capita, scores well on access to toilets and coverage of the sewerage network (no data was
available on the quality of sewage treatment in Kariba). Other local authorities performed relatively
well on access, coverage, and quality measures, with much lower unit costs, such as Bindura. As
above, differences in performance may be due to characteristics of local authoritiesâ infrastructure.
In any case, these experiences may provide useful insights on how to improve the cost effectiveness
of sewerage services.

Solid Waste Disposal

In the eight local authorities, the budgeted and actual spending on solid waste disposal rose
slightly between 2012 and 2015, but actual annual spending varied. Across all local authorities,
budget allocations rose by about 15 percent from $2.8 million in 2012 to $3.2 million in 2015. Actual
spending increased about nine percent from $2.4 million to $2.7 million. Spending spiked to $5.0
million in 2013, then fell dramatically to $2.3 million in 2014. The increase in 2013 was largely due
to the debt forgiveness effort, especially in Kadoma and Mutare, which âspentâ $1.6 million and $1.0
million on debt forgiveness, respectively, which collectively offset increases in that year.

The distribution of budgeted and actual expenditures is heavily weighted towards employment
costs and general expenses (See Figure 23 and Figure 24). Employment costs represented 43 percent of
budgeted expenditures and 46 percent of actual expendituresâmuch higher shares than in water provision
or sewerage services. The heavy reliance on labor may be appropriate: recent evidence suggests that
using more labor, including from the informal sector, is the most cost effective way to provide solid waste
management services and increase recycling,Â²â° and can create jobs in local markets. After employment
costs, the next largest distribution is General Expenses, which made up 22 percent of budgeted and 37
percent of actual expenditures. Much of the general expenses budget for refuse removal is used to
purchase waste receptacles; fuels and oils for machinery and vehicles, and pest control chemicals. Repairs
and maintenance represented about 17 percent of the budget and 14 percent of actual spending. Capital
outlays represented about 12 percent of the budget, but only three percent of actual spending.

Both total spending and budget execution for solid waste disposal activities vary significantly
between local authorities. From 2012 to 2015, budgets for solid waste disposal ranged from $309

thousand in Victoria Falls to $1.1 million in Mutare, and actual spending ranged from $215 thousand
in Kariba to $1.3 million in Mutare. These figures are somewhat misleading, however, given the size of
the two localities. Per capita spending on solid waste disposal was $8.15 in Kariba and $6.69 in Mutare.
The lowest per capita spending occurs in Norton and Victoria Falls, which recorded average spending
of $3.37 and $2.86, respectively. Budget execution was highest in Kadoma and Mutare, though these
rates are affected by their large debt write-offs, which were recorded as spending. Kariba recorded
budget execution of 102 percent on average from 2012 to 2015. The lowest rate of budget execution
was in Victoria Fallsâonly about 31 percent. Across local authorities, budget execution was strongest
on employee costs and general expenses, and weakest on capital outlays. See Table 11 for more details.

There is generally a positive relationship between cost recovery and coverage of waste collection services,
though outliers demonstrate significant inefficiencies in certain local authorities. As shown in Figure 25,
local authorities with at least full cost recovery in waste collection tend to collect the majority of waste

produced in their communities. Yet numerous outliers with 300 percent or higher cost recovery suggest
that waste collection revenue is used to subsidize other activities in many local authorities.

Generally, higher per capita spending on solid waste disposal is associated with better coverage
in communities, but this is not universal. Some local authorities, such as Kadoma, with high per
capita spending have achieved good coverage by collecting waste twice a weekÂ²Â² and collecting a high
share of waste, but other high spenders do less well. Certain moderate spenders, such as Chegutu, do
well on coverage, collecting at least once a week and a high share of waste, but do much worse on use
of acceptable receptacles (see Table 12).

Poorer, recently established local authorities face bigger challenges in providing services given
lack of infrastructure. An outlier among all service delivery areas, Epworth has low levels of access
in all categories of services, which stem from how Epworth was established. Other local authorities
existed at Zimbabweâs independence, and had already established water and sanitation systems.
Such local authorities mainly needed to maintain, expand, or upgrade systems. Epworth, on the
other hand, formed from an informal settlement during the independence struggle. Epworth faced
three factors making it difficult to establish a strong service delivery system. First, Epworth did not
inherit infrastructure at Independence. Second, as Epworthâs residents were largely informal, their
settlements need to be formalized before certain investments in properties were possible. Third,
Epworthâs population has high poverty rates, making it more difficult for them to shoulder high
investment costs to build new systems. The GoZ should consider such situations when designing the
transfer system, with a view to helping less developed local authorities address their service delivery
infrastructure gaps.




    5             CONCLUSION & POLICY OPTIONS
Summary of Major Findings
The analytical findings presented in previous sections identify several key major findings regarding the
public financing of local government service delivery in Zimbabwe. These include:

        Employment costs remain a significant share of overall spending, and an even higher share
        of total revenues collected, creating significant fiscal risks.

        General administrative, finance and management costs represent nearly a quarter of all
        spending, and actual spending on administrative costs increased relative to service delivery
        costs, even though their share in approved budgets fell over the period.

   35
                                                                     Local Government Service Delivery


       In eight local authorities surveyed in key areas such as public water provision, solid waste
       disposal, and wastewater treatment and sewerage, spending on capital and repairs and
       maintenance was low, particularly relative budgeted amounts, undermining the longevity
       and quality of services provided in these areas.

       Higher per capita spending on water supply, sewerage, and solid waste disposal is generally
       associated with better access to and quality of local services, yet some local authorities appear
       to achieve good performance at a relatively lower cost.

       There is no clear correlation between local authoritiesâ poverty rates and performance on
       service delivery, except for recently established local authorities with high poverty, which
       tend to have weak service delivery infrastructure, and difficulties mobilizing needed funds to
       make investments.


Identification of Areas for Further Policy Dialogue
These findings indicate several reforms for further policy dialogue and partnership, including:

       Prioritize the development of tools and training on basic PFM skills â including the Local
       Government Accounting Manual developed by UCAZ.

       Invest in expanding efforts to implement GFMIS systems in local authorities, including reworking
       training programs to ensure that local authorities are able to use all relevant modules, and
       produce in-year and end of year financial reports.

       Review the types of approvals required by the Ministry of Local Government to approve rates
       and budgets, especially where reductions in rates mandated by the Ministry reduce cost
       recovery for service delivery functions.

       Clarify the institutional framework for decentralization, to ensure that all local government
       service delivery mandates are aligned, with no overlap between central and local authorities,
       and that oversight mechanisms for urban and rural local authorities are well coordinated.

       Develop and discuss potential models for a future transfer system, with a view to building
       consensus on a transparent and equitable formula for distribution.

       Identify alternatives to many local authoritiesâ relying on property sales to generate revenue,
       as sales of property are not a sustainable source of financing.

       Assess the effectiveness of pre-paid meters for improving water rate recovery, and consider
       replicating pilots in additional local authorities.

       Examine factors for low unit costs of service delivery in certain local authorities, to identify ways
       to increase efficiency across the country as part of the service level benchmarking process.

       Identify strategies to improve the execution of budgets for repairs, maintenance, and capital
       spending, and separate repairs from maintenance, to ensure assets are maintained before
       they break down.

       Expand the use of performance measurement and management systems at the local level,
       including results based management of personnel, and extend the service level benchmarking
       mechanism to include other areas of local service delivery, especially local roads.

       Increase allocations of PSIP, ZIMRA, and other funding sources to poorer local authorities with
       a wide infrastructure gaps but with capacity to manage such funds.
