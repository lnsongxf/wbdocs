Every year, vast sums of taxpayers’ funds are spent on public goods and services by
national and subnational entities. An unknown percentage of these funds, unfortunately,
are not used for their intended purposes because funds are illegally diverted. According
to a 2013 study commissioned by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), the direct
public loss encountered within five selected sectors of the economy where EU funds are
spent in eight member States amounts to 18% of the overall project budgets concerned.1

Considering the scale of the problem of fraud and corruption in public procurement,
pessimists argue that the idea that it can be prevented from happening seems futile.
There is, indeed, no fail-proof solution against the hidden schemes, whose organizers
always seem to be one step ahead of the corruption hunters. However, public officials
and other concerned stakeholders have been successfully improving their ability to
detect, prevent, and punish fraud and corruption, where it is uncovered.

The procurement process has proven particularly vulnerable to fraud and corruption,
because that is the point in the investment cycle where money changes hands. In order
to prevent misconduct, one must have a keen understanding of the inner workings
of the many fraud and corruption schemes that occur. This handbook offers some
insights about fraud and corruption in public investments in Poland as well as in World
Bank-financed projects; how it happens and how it can be detected before it negatively
impacts investments. Early detection through paying specific attention to red flags in
the procurement process can prevent the corrupt parties from succeeding, as multiple
examples over the past years have shown.

Much of what we know about fraud and corruption is the direct result of the reporting
of alleged fraud and corruption by public sector employees; they are the first-and best-
line of defense when it comes to protecting funds from misuse. Bidders, civil society
representatives and other stakeholders as well are an important source of complaints,
which underscores the crucial role of effective complaint handling mechanisms to
elicit, channel and respond to complaints.

     Fraud and Corruption Awareness Handbook



     This handbook was written with the intent to raise awareness and encourage public
     sector employees to be alert to potential malfeasance in the management of public
     investments. Published in 2011 by the World Bank’s Integrity Vice Presidency, this
     publication builds on the experiences gained by Poland’s Anti-Corruption Bureau and
     the World Bank with a view to share lessons learned from investigative activities of
     both organizations.

     Bringing integrity to our public investments requires a shared commitment. To this
     end, we continue to work to ensure that the lessons learned today, help us prevent the
     risks of fraud and corruption tomorrow.

What is the purpose of this handbook?

This handbook is intended for government employees involved in public procurement.
It provides some insights into how fraud and corruption schemes work in public
investments. The handbook identifies a range of fraud and corruption indicators, or red
flags, and relevant schemes that may become apparent during the life of an investment, from
design to implementation. The primary focus of this handbook is fraud and corruption
in procurement, with some coverage of general governance issues. It is based on the
experience of Poland’s Central Anti-Corruption Bureau and the World Bank’s Integrity Vice
Presidency, and it presents examples referring both to public investments implemented
under Polish public procurement law and international competitive bidding.

While carrying out the tasks imposed by the legislature, the Central Anti-Corruption
Bureau seeks to draw attention to irregularities that may occur while spending public
funds for the purchase of goods and services, and investment projects. Non-observance
by the procuring entity of the provisions regulating public spending may have negative
economic consequences for the unit finances and may result in disciplinary measures
and possible criminal prosecution. This handbook aims to provide support to the
managers of procuring entities in conducting public procurement by identifying
frequently occurring irregularities and suggesting methods of preventing them.


What are the definitions of fraud and corruption?

In Poland, the national Criminal Code prohibits providing or promising a material
or personal benefit to a public official in connection with their office. The law does
not require that the benefit or promise thereof is granted with a view to a particular
purpose, only that it is granted in connection with the public function of the recipient.
Bribery of public officials is punishable by imprisonment for up to 12 years.2 If the bribe
aims to influence a public official to act contrary to the law, the offender is liable for
imprisonment for up to ten years.

il and disciplinary liability, see The Anti-Corruption Handbook for Entrepreneurs, Warsaw 2012, Cen-
tral Anti-Corruption Bureau, pp. 13–52.


                                                                                                                 1

    The Central Anti-Corruption Bureau of Poland defines corruption as “an act which
    involves promising, proposing or giving […] of any undue advantage to a person
    performing a public function for themselves or any other person, in return for acting
    or omission to act in performing the person’s function […].”

    Polish law provides other useful definitions of practices that may occur in public
    procurement by certain persons:

        ■■   A financial advantage is any benefit satisfying a particular need, the value of which
             may be expressed in money. It can be an increase in assets but also profitable
             contracts, e.g., on preferential terms, donation, assignment of receivables, or
             discharge of debt.
        ■■   A personal advantage is a non-financial allowance, which improves the situation
             of the person who obtains the allowance (e.g., a promise of promotion, a job,
             honoring with a medal, mastering the profession, apprenticeship, a favorable
             image in media, acceleration of surgery term, sexual favors, etc.).
        ■■   A person performing a public function is, inter alia, the director of a state
             enterprise within the scope of management and representing the enterprise
             outside; the chairperson of the Board of Cooperative Housing within the scope
             of activities associated with the disposal of public funds; or an authorized
             representative of an energy enterprise, who controls the legality of electricity
             consumption.
        ■■   A public official is a person who has been legally elected or appointed to office
             and who exercises a government function, e.g., president, senator, member
             of parliament, judge, prosecutor or any person employed by the government,
             including a person performing a managerial position in a state agency, body
             responsible for securing public safety, penitentiary or military.


    The Council of Europe Civil Law Convention on Corruption of 4 November
    1999, article 2 stipulates that “corruption means requesting, offering, giving or
    accepting […] a bribe or any other undue advantage or prospect thereof, which
    distorts the proper performance of any duty or behaviour required of the recipient
    of the bribe, the undue advantage or the prospect thereof.” The Explanatory Report
    (paragraph 24) to the Council’s Criminal Law Convention against Corruption of 27
    January 1999 lays down a provisional definition of corruption as “bribery and any
    other behavior in relation to persons entrusted with responsibilities in the public
    and private sector, which violates their duties that follow from their status as a
    public official, private employee, independent agent or other relationship of that
    kind and is aimed at obtaining undue advantages of any kind for themselves or
    for others.”

The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OECD) Anti-Corruption
Action Plan describes bribery as “a violation of duties of civil (public) servants or
responsible persons in private and public sector as well as the benefiting from such
activities, caused directly or indirectly as the result of promise, offered, expected or
given reward for yourself or other persons.”3 A foreign public official, according to the
OECD Anti-Bribery Convention, is “any person holding a legislative, administrative
or judicial office of a foreign country, whether appointed or elected; any person
exercising a public function for a foreign country, including for a public agency or
public enterprise; and any official or agent of a public international organization.”4 An
overview of International Anti-Corruption Initiatives can be found in Annex 1.

The World Bank Group has adopted four standardized definitions relating to fraud and
corruption that are subject to administrative sanction. These are: corrupt practice, fraudulent
practice, collusive practice, and coercive practice. In addition, the World Bank may also
sanction a firm or individual for having engaged in ‘obstructive practice’ in connection
with a Bank investigation. Collectively, the Bank refers to all five as ‘sanctionable practices’.5

    ■■   A corrupt practice is the offering, giving, receiving, or soliciting, directly or
         indirectly, anything of value to influence improperly the actions of another party.
    ■■   A fraudulent practice is any act or omission, including a misrepresentation, that
         knowingly or recklessly misleads, or attempts to mislead, a party to obtain a
         financial or other benefit or to avoid an obligation.
    ■■   A coercive practice is impairing or harming, or threatening to impair or harm,
         directly or indirectly, any party or the property of the party to influence
         improperly the actions of a party.
    ■■   A collusive practice is an arrangement between two or more parties designed to
         achieve an improper purpose, including influencing improperly the actions of
         another party.6

    Firms and individuals that are found to have engaged in any of these practices in
    connection with the procurement of goods or services, the selection of consultants, or
    the execution of any resulting contracts, are subject to one of five possible sanctions,
    including debarment, i.e., ineligibility to be awarded a Bank Group-financed contract.

    Where are public investments most vulnerable to fraud and corruption?

    Procurement and contract management under public investments are particularly
    vulnerable to fraud and corruption. This vulnerability is primarily due to the large
    amounts of money involved and the difficulties, at times, to effectively supervise a
    large number of contracts. In addition to procurement, vulnerabilities in contract and
    financial management are common. The schemes one often encounters occur in the
    following areas:

        ■■   Procurement: corrupt payments to government officials and steering of contracts
             to favored bidders (see Chapter 2); collusion among bidders in obtaining
             contracts (see Chapter 3); and submission of fraudulent bids (see Chapter 4)
             intended to circumvent the competitive bidding process.
        ■■   Contract management: fraudulent implementation including misrepresentation
             of work, goods and services as having been delivered according to specifications
             (see Chapter 5).
        ■■   Financial management: embezzlement of project funds through fictitious
             invoices and the diversion of funds/assets.

    Is the prevalence of corruption the same across sectors?

    The prevalence of corruption may vary widely across sectors. There may appear
    indicators of systemic corruption in one agency, while activities in another agency
    are untainted. The manifestation of corruption may also vary from one investment
    to another, and component to component, depending on the opportunities and the
    strength of internal controls and accountability measures. For example, the risk of
    money marked for the purchase of school books being diverted is low when information
    concerning direct payment to the school is publicly available to the parents. In contrast,
    the risk of a government official steering a contract for the construction of an office
    building for the Ministry of National Education to a friendly contractor may be high if
    the requirement for transparency of budgets is limited.

    Why is it important to fight fraud and corruption?

    Recovery of illicit payments often leads to incomplete or unsound public investment
    outcomes. Since bribe-paying firms must find a way to recover these illicit payments


4
                                                                                    Introduction



and, where possible increase profits, they will often resort to defrauding the project,
thereby threatening its effectiveness. Audits have uncovered a number of methods that
private firms have used for recovering these costs:

   ■■   Charges for goods, works, and services are inflated.

   ■■   Goods and services are invoiced but never delivered (or quantities greatly reduced).

   ■■   Contract specifications are not met, resulting in substandard work or hazardous
        conditions.

   ■■   Products are substituted for inferior, less expensive and lower quality material
        than specified in contracts. For consulting contracts, the project is billed for the
        cost of senior consultants, when lower paid employees are actually performing
        the work, or billing for “ghost employees” is found.

Moreover, competition is reduced in a corruption-prone environment. More competent
firms that refuse to make illicit payments have no chance to win contracts, leaving less
capable companies to win contracts at higher prices and deliver lower quality.

Which actors most frequently engage in fraudulent or corrupt
practices?

Government officials, companies or their agents, and supervision consultants
most frequently engage in the corruption schemes. These actors play various roles
as illustrated below.

   ■■   Government officials often play a central role in corruption schemes by being
        in a position to influence the award of contracts, the processing of invoices for
        payment, and the signing of licenses and approvals.

   ■■   Local and international companies (contractors and sub-contractors) organize
        or participate in illicit arrangements in order to win contracts. They divert
        project funds to project officials, with the bribes usually disguised as ‘legitimate’
        payments for goods, works or services. Frequently, subcontractors—actual or
        fictitious—are used to channel funds to project officials.

   ■■   Contractors’ independent agents may play a role in brokering the illicit
        arrangements and shielding the contractors from legal action.

   ■■   Supervision consultants may also be corruptly induced or pressured to sign-off
        on substandard work.

   ■■   Senior government officials may provide protection or seek their share of the
        corrupt payments.


                                                                                                   5

    What are red flags and how are they used?

    A red flag is an indicator of possible fraud or corruption. There are hundreds of red
    flags that can appear in various types of public investment projects. They can show up as
    anomalies in bidding documents, such as bids from purportedly different bidders faxed
    from the same telephone number; in financial records, such as invoices paid in amounts
    that exceed the contract value; or complaints about agency officials, who, for example,
    might pressure the Bid Evaluation Committee (BEC) to select a certain company to win
    a contract. In some cases, deviations from national procurement rules indicate not just
    non-compliance, but also a heightened probability of fraud or corruption.

    Some red flags are more ambiguous than others. Some red flags are quite “bright”
    and compelling—such as supposedly competing bids sent from the same fax machine,
    while others are more ambiguous and difficult to interpret, at least in isolation, such as
    receiving fewer than the expected number of bids in response to a tender.

    A red flag is usually a sign that closer scrutiny is needed. This extra scrutiny might
    involve asking for more documents or information from the bidder or, as is often the
    case, looking for other related red flags. Receiving fewer than the expected number
    of bids, for example, could be an indicator of rigged specifications or other measures
    intended to exclude qualified bidders. If detected, government officials should look for
    other indicators of such schemes, as listed in this guide. Similarly, a poorly prepared
    bid from a previously unknown company might prompt one to look in the telephone
    directory or on the Internet to see if the firm is listed, or call or visit the purported
    business premises to confirm the company’s existence. Government officials should
    not, however, undertake an investigation of a possible or suspected wrongdoing. If
    serious concerns remain after a preliminary review, the matter should be referred to
    the appropriate agency staff or to the Central Anti-Corruption Bureau of Poland for
    further investigation.

               Corrupt Procurement Practices                                                   2
How does a corruption scheme in procurement work?

A corruption scheme often involves more than one type of misconduct. A corrupt
scheme in procurement often begins with a demand for, or offer of payment, followed
by bid rigging and finally fraud to cover up the scheme:

   ■■   Demand for payment. A government official demands a bribe or kickback from
        a firm or individual, or a firm or individual offers a bribe, in exchange for a
        contract award. In most cases, the corrupt official will permit the bribe payer to
        inflate the price to cover the bribe and preserve its profits.
   ■■   Bid rigging. To ensure that the contract will be awarded to the bribe-paying
        firm (whose prices are now inflated to cover the cost of the bribe), government
        officials manipulate the bidding process to exclude other (presumably cheaper)
        competitors.
   ■■   Fraud. To recover the cost of the bribe, and to exploit the corrupt relationship,
        the firm, usually with the knowledge and complicity of government officials,
        inflates prices, bills for work not performed, fails to meet contract specifications
        or delivers substandard product during implementation. This often requires
        further corrupt payments to inspectors or auditors.

What are the goals of any procurement-related corruption strategy?

The aim of the corrupt party is to steer the contract to the favored bidder without
detection. This is done in a number of ways, including:

   ■■   Avoiding competition through, e.g., unjustified sole sourcing or intimidating

    What are typical bribes?

    The type and value of bribes vary widely depending on circumstances. Not all bribes
    are monetary, particularly in the early stages of a corrupt relationship. For example, there
    are cases where a designated international contractor could provide temporary lodging
    at company-owned villas, free transportation on corporate aircraft and paid weekend
    vacations. Some international contractors paid for “plant inspections” or “study tours”
    for project personnel and their spouses early in an investment to attractive destinations
    that were, in fact, expense-paid vacations and shopping expeditions. In several cases,
    road construction and construction companies paid for female companionship for
    inspectors and gave them gifts and small amounts of cash to induce them to approve
    substandard works. In World Bank–financed projects, different types of corrupt
    payments that have been identified include:

        ■■   Corrupt payments for contract awards. Corrupt payments in exchange for
             contract awards often vary from 5–20 percent of the contract amount. The
             payments typically were divided among ministry, other government and project
             personnel, including Bid Evaluation Committee members.
        ■■   Facilitation payments. These are typically 2–5 percent of the invoice value.
             Many contractors had to make additional payments to project staff to approve
             invoices during project implementation. In some instances, auditors demanded
             bribes from contractors to refrain from reporting corrupt payments or other
             irregularities they discovered. In one Region, contractors on a road project
             paid one percent of the contract value to a supervisory Non-Governmental
             Organizations (NGOs) and an additional one percent to a representative of the
             local media to suppress reports of corruption.
        ■■   Additional indirect payments. Government officials may also demand that
             contractors procure from certain firms or contribute to special funds. For example,
             in one case, a project director rented “office space” to a contractor, which turned out
             to be two windowless, empty, dirt floor rooms without electricity in his mother’s
             house. The contractor never occupied the rooms. In other instances, project officials
             asked contractors, or contractors offered, to pay for the education of project officials’
             children at foreign universities. It is also not uncommon for government officials to
             ask bidders to contribute to local “social funds” and “charitable foundations.”

    How are bribes paid?

    Local contractors usually pay corrupt officials directly. Whereas international contractors
    tend to pay through a middleman, local contractors usually make their bribe payments

                                                                        Corrupt Procurement Practices



in local currency directly to the corrupt officials. International firms tend to pay by wire
transfers through a local subcontractor, agent, or middleman, and record the payments on
their books as legitimate expenses or commissions. This makes many such payments more
easily detectable through the exercise of audit rights of contractors’ records.

Which agency in Poland is responsible for detecting and preventing
corruption in the public sector?

The Central Anti-Corruption Bureau (CBA) is responsible for audits of public
investment activities. The CBA is the only agency, which apart from analytical,
investigation and pre-trial activities, can also carry out proactive reviews. The aim of
the audits is to reveal corruption in state and territorial government bodies as well as
the abuse of power by public officials. The Bureau examines, inter alia, asset declarations
submitted by public officials as well as decisions concerning:

    ■■   Privatization and commercialization
    ■■   Financial support
    ■■   Public procurements
    ■■   Disposal of state or municipal property
    ■■   Concession awards, permits, exemptions and deductions, preferences, quotas,
         warranties and credit guarantees

    The subjects of control can be:

    ■■   Persons performing public functions
    ■■   Units of the public finance sector
    ■■   Units not belonging to the public finance sector but receiving public funds
    ■■   Entrepreneurs

Multiple public offices have a distinct role. To prevent or detect corruption, the
CBA and other state agencies examine decision processes and their implementation
in public procurement. In the course of such controls, each of the competent bodies
deals with a different aspect. The Supreme Audit Office (Najwyższa Izba Kontroli – NIK)
conducts holistic controls of state institutions; the Public Procurement Office (Urząd
Zamówień Publicznych) examines the compatibility with procedures7; the Regional

     Audit Chambers control public procurement with reference to the infringement of the
     Public Finance Act; and the Office of Competition and Consumer Protection (Urzędzie
     Ochrony Konkurencji i Konsumentów – UOKiK)) deals with tender collusion. The
     CBA focuses on the consequences resulting from any violation of the law, mainly by
     reviewing the implementation stage and settling public procurement contracts.

     The CBA carries out regular and ad-hoc audits. The CBA carries out regular audits
     on the basis of control schedules approved by the Head of the CBA, and ad-hoc audits
     initiated in case of circumstances justifying immediate actions. Ad-hoc audits may
     result from cooperation between different units of the CBA or be triggered by external
     factors (civil notifications, cooperation with other agencies or state authorities). Audits
     may be initiated in connection with analytical or operational activities as well as at
     different stages of investigation activities. The CBA may use its control, analytical, pre-
     trial and investigative powers alternately, as appropriate.

     How can corruption be detected?

     While it is difficult to prove that someone has paid a bribe, there are related activities
     that can be uncovered more easily. Complaints from disgruntled [losing] bidders and
     the paper trail left by a government official steering a contract to a favored bidder are
     common starting points. The following section in this handbook deals with indicators,
     or red flags, which public officials can look for when supervising contract awards. A
     combination of certain red flags should alert them that a bid rigging scheme may be
     affecting their investment. Corrupt practices and bid rigging can take place at any stage
     during the procurement cycle. Sophisticated planning of corrupt activity usually starts
     at the project design stage when the activities are determined and contracts planned.
     Officials generally have a level of discretion in drafting specifications or qualification

criteria, which provides the opportunity to steer contracts to the favored bidder.
Figure 1 shows the procurement process divided into four phases.

For each procurement action leading up to the contract award, this section highlights
the red flags that can be identified as well as related fraud and corruption schemes. The
following bid rigging schemes will be presented:

   ■■   Unnecessary items (see page 12)
   ■■   Unjustified sole source awards (see page 12)
   ■■   Contract splitting (see page 13)
   ■■   Inappropriate bundling (see page 14)
   ■■   Restricted circulation, short notice, inadequate information (see page 16)
   ■■   Unnecessary or inappropriate line items (see pages 17)
   ■■   Rigged specifications (see page 17)
   ■■   Biased evaluation criteria (see page 18)
   ■■   Unbalanced bidding (see page 19)
   ■■   Leakage of confidential information (see page 21)
   ■■   Inappropriate contractual terms (see page 21)
   ■■   Hidden interest in a company (see page 23)
   ■■   Exclusion of qualified bidders (see page 24)
   ■■   Late bids, bid tampering and other forms of manipulation (see page 26)

For each procurement action, suggestions will be outlined for easier identification of
red flags and measures that might strengthen procurement controls. Various contract
management issues related to fraudulent implementation are addressed in Chapter 5.

     1. Procurement Plan
     The Procurement Plan should be scrutinized for the justification of items,
     procurement methods, review thresholds, and possible contract splitting. The plan
     should include agreements on the contract packages for procuring the identified goods,
     works, services and consulting services; and the methods for procuring them. It should
     also list the respective timetables for the various procurement activities.

     Scheme: Unnecessary items. In one case, a road was constructed that only benefitted
     a local politician’s constituency, reflecting undue political influence. The case illustrates
     the risk of political pressures adversely impacting sub-components or potentially the
     entire project.

     Red flag indicating unnecessary items
      Unnecessary items      The list of contracts for goods, works and services is not consistent with the project
                             requirements


     Scheme: Unjustified sole sourcing or direct contracting. Direct contracting of goods
     and works and sole sourcing of consultants may be legitimate contracting methods.
     However, these contracting methods may also be used to steer contracts to favored
     companies by avoiding competitive bidding. In some instances, the scope of work of a
     consultancy contract has been expanded significantly after contract award, taking the
     contract amount from just below to considerably above the threshold for competitive
     bidding.

     Case 1: Unreasonably low quality specifications
      For a number of years, Joseph, an entrepreneur running a large IT company, had been participating in public
      tenders for the supply of computer equipment. He had become close friends with Roman, the deputy head of
      the IT Department at the local Town Office.
      Occasionally, when travelling abroad, Joseph would buy 1,000 computer notebooks hoping to sell these for a
      quick profit in his home country. However, notebooks of the type he had in stock had become readily available
      on the market and their price had dropped significantly, leaving him with a large stock of unsold notebooks.
      Moreover, notebooks with a new operating system were being introduced in the market, which made Joseph’s
      equipment even less attractive to potential buyers.
      Fortunately, for Joseph, when the local authorities announced a tender for the supply of notebooks, the
      specification of the essential terms of the contract corresponded exactly to the equipment he wanted to offload.
      Hardware and software requirements as well as the required quantity were described in such a way that, with
      the price being the only criterion for bid selection, his product had the only chance of winning the tender.
      During the course of an audit, Roman, who was responsible for drafting the specifications of the contract
      tender, admitted that by specifying the requirements he did a favor to his friend, Joseph, allowing him to
      dispose of the residual equipment without incurring a loss.

Red flags indicating unjustified sole sourcing or direct contracting
 Non-              Use of sole sourcing or direct contracting when the procurement plan calls for use of
 compliance        more competitive methods
                   Use of sole sourcing or direct contracting method for new procurement actions (not listed
                   in the Procurement Plan) without obtaining a no-objection
 Inadequate        Inadequate or misleading justification or documentation as required by procurement
 justification     guidelines (e.g., stating that the equipment is proprietary when, in fact, it is not)
 Multiple sole     Multiple sole source awards or direct contracting to the same company or within the
 source awards     same procuring unit
                   Certain contract amendments that would benefit from competition or where the items
                   should have been procured separately (e.g., the additional activities are not a natural
                   continuation of the existing contract)


Scheme: Contract splitting. The packaging of contracts is designed to attract as many
qualified bidders as possible in order to secure the best price and quality. Legitimate
considerations regarding decisions to package certain contracts include: (i) capacity
of potential bidders to deliver the outputs specified; (ii) risks related to the bundling
or unbundling of items; (iii) centralized versus decentralized procurement; and
(iv) sequencing of procurement actions in line with needs.

Contract splitting is the deliberate attempt to limit or entirely avoid competition.
By splitting contracts into smaller packages, the need for a greater degree of review
and less competitive procurement methods are made possible. For example, splitting
road contracts in unusually short segments, which would allow for the use of direct
contracting for minor works rather than a competitive bidding method. Case 2 below
illustrates indicators of contract splitting in tenders for a new customer service system
in a Polish government agency.

Case 2: Contract splitting
 In the course of the computerization of his office, the Director-General of a national agency requested a new
 customer service software system. The purchase was to be made without public tendering as the amount of
 the purchase was below the public procurement threshold of €14,000. The agency acquired the system
 introduced by company A at a cost of €13,500.
 One month after the introduction of the new system, company A offered to expand the new customer service
 system application with an archiving module. The national agency agreed to purchase the module for the
 amount of €50,000. The agency justified the award of the contract without public tender to the same contractor
 for technical compatibility reasons and because of the copyright held by company A.
 Later, company A presented another offer, this time to incorporate an electronic mail handling services
 application. Once again, the national agency agreed to purchase the application on a non-competitive basis.
 In the following months, the system was further expanded with more functional modules purchased without
 public tendering for the benefit of company A. In total, beyond any competitive mechanisms, company A was
 paid over one million euros for a system which, in fact, simply met ordinary office requirements.

     Red flags indicating contract splitting
      Unusual splits       Issuing two or more contracts for identical items over a short period of time for no
                           apparent reason, resulting in the application of a less competitive procurement method
                           Procuring items by each subunit that should have been procured jointly (e.g., each territorial
                           office procures its own vehicle rather than the national agency procuring all vehicles)
                           Splitting items that are normally procured together in order to keep individual package
                           values below thresholds (e.g., procurement of computers and related accessories is split
                           into separate contracts)
      Many awards just Awarding an unreasonably large number of contracts just below public procurement
      below thresholds thresholds
      Excessive use of     Using shopping procedures excessively for the purchase of identical or similar items
      shopping             Two or more related and simultaneous purchases from the same supplier in amounts
                           just under the legal procurement threshold


     Scheme: Inappropriate bundling. This scheme is the opposite of contract splitting, yet
     yields the same result of reduced competition. The public tender bundles a wide variety
     of goods that have no relation with each other, into one lot (e.g., computer equipment,
     copper wires, and video equipment) with a particular provision stipulating that
     incomplete lots are not allowed and would be considered non-responsive. This makes
     the bidding process biased since not a single manufacturer or authorized dealer is likely
     to meet the requirements of the entire lot. Typically, the contract will be awarded to a
     favored bidder at a price well above the estimates.

     Case 3: Inappropriate bundling
      A local hospital intended to purchase highly specialized oncologic radiotherapy equipment in a national tender.
      The public procurement specifications stipulated that the equipment needed to be of the same brand as the
      equipment already in use in the hospital. Due to this restriction, only one supplier was able to meet the
      specifications. However, in order to install the equipment correctly, the existing facilities needed a significant
      refurbishing, involving slab reinforcement, the addition of new walls, lining the new walls with protective lead
      plates, the delivery and installation of new doors and, finally, extensive finishing works.
      The entire contract was awarded to the single equipment supplier. In response to a complaint, the audit carried
      out by the CBA revealed infringements of the rules for the award of public contracts, including an improper
      combination of supplies and construction works within a single procurement. Moreover, the contractor applied
      the preferential tax rate for medical equipment to the entire contract, including the construction works. These
      irregularities were reported to the Office of Fiscal Control.

     Red flags indicating inappropriate bundling
      Inappropriate      Complaint from one or more bidders about the bundling of goods, works and services
      bundling           Items to be procured within a proposed bundle are not related
                         There is a significant reduction in the number of potential or actual bidders resulting from
                         the bundling
                         The agency cannot justify the bundling on the basis of cost savings or reduced integration
                         costs or risks

     2. Advertisement
     Advertisements can be manipulated to exclude bidders. To inform as many qualified
     bidders as possible, national law may require the advertising for all large consultancy
     and international competitive bidding contracts.8 For national competitive bidding,
     the procurement action should be advertised in a widely circulated national or official
     gazette or on a free and open access website for a reasonable time. Advertisements can
     be manipulated by limiting the circulation of the request for expressions of interest.

     Red flags in advertisement
         Restricted circulation   Not advertising the request for expressions of interest (as required under
                                  national procurement rules)
                                  Limiting circulation by posting the advertisement in a local rather than national
                                  newspaper, when a national newspaper would have resulted in more bids
         Short notice             Period between the advertisement and the bid submission deadline is very
                                  short
         Inadequate information   Providing incomplete contact information so that potential bidders do not know
                                  where to submit bids or from whom to request clarification
                                  Drafting overly vague descriptions of the work, goods or services required so
                                  that bidders cannot determine their interest
                                  Drafting overly narrow descriptions of the work, goods or services required to
                                  exclude qualified bidders


     Suggestions

           ■■   Review past advertisements in similar procurements to identify and possibly
                follow-up on any red flags

           ■■   Encourage that the procuring agency consistently keeps a file of actual newspapers
                showing the advertisements and date of publication




     8Article 13 of the Public procurement Act stipulates that for contract amounts exceeding the thresh-
     olds defined in the Prime Minister’s Ordinance of 16 December 2011, the procuring authori-
     ty may advertise the information on public procurements planned for the following 12 months.
     However, procurement for contracts under World Bank loans must comply with World Bank proce-
     dures.

                                                                                        Corrupt Procurement Practices




3. Bidding Documents
Bidding documents must be prepared for each proposed procurement action. The
bidding documents, issued by the public agency or department, inform potential bidders
how bids should be prepared, the evaluation criteria, and the contract requirements. In
providing inadequate or erroneous information for the preparation of bids, corrupt
officials may effectively exclude qualified bidders.

Scheme: Unnecessary or inappropriate line items. In order to pad the contract, the
corrupt official may add unnecessary items that can later be omitted (without reducing
the contract amount) or just to boost the revenue for the designated winner. In other
cases, items may be added that duplicate existing work, creating a conflict of interest
(e.g., requiring a contractor to pay for a supervision consultant).

Other examples of red flags indicating potentially unnecessary and inappropriate
line items include: (i) large number of four-wheel drive vehicles to be used
by the supervision consultants, though many would be stationed at the
same location; (ii) the number of vehicles in the bill of quantities (BOQ)
did not vary according to the length of the road or size of the contract;
and (iii) training abroad for government officials was included in the scope of the
contractor’s work.

Case 4: Unnecessary items
 The head of the Civil Service Office in a small town prepared a tender procedure for the purchase of five
 desktop computers. The computers were to be used for the city hall’s customer service desk and equipped
 with software that met the special needs of the office. The tender specified that each computer was to be
 equipped with the most elaborate professional office program, and each computer was to have its own licensed
 program which was to be copied on a separate CD.
 The auditors checked the requirements in the procurement documents with the actual needs of the awarding
 authority and discovered that the software programs had never been installed on the office computers.
 Moreover, two CDs had found their way to the private computers of the head of the Civil Service and his wife.

Scheme: Rigged specifications. In a competitive market for goods and services, any
specifications that seem to be drafted in a way that favors a particular company deserve
closer scrutiny. For example, specifications that are too narrow can be used to exclude
other qualified bidders or justify improper sole source awards. Unduly vague or broad



                                                                                                                        17

     specifications can allow an unqualified bidder to compete or justify fraudulent change
     orders after the contract is awarded. Sometimes, project officials will go so far as to
     allow the favored bidder to draft the specifications.

     Scheme: Biased evaluation criteria. Instituting biased evaluation and qualifications
     criteria is another method used to steer contracts to a favored bidder. For example,
     in an international competitive bidding contract for the procurement of computers
     it would be inappropriate to require that the goods be delivered within three weeks
     of contract effectiveness, as this would exclude many international bidders whose
     overseas shipments would take longer.

     Case 5: Manipulation of bid evaluation criteria
      An airport maintenance company decided to invest in the construction of an extra runway. In addition to the
      price criterion, the advertisement for the tender indicated that the contracting authority would take into account
      the time it would take to execute the project. Due to the fact that area adjacent to the airport was covered by
      the Nature 2000 Networking Programme, the application required an environmental impact assessment of
      the project.
      Despite the strict maximum time limit required for project completion (to the extent that the task could be
      undertaken only by large project studios), the contracting authority gave 20% extra points for shortening the
      time of execution of the project. The contract was awarded to the only contractor who offered a shorter contract
      execution time at a price that exceeded the lowest evaluated bidder by $100,000.

 The auditors later discovered that what mattered most was the time it took the contractor to obtain an
 environmental compliance certificate—a specific condition that had to be satisfied prior to starting the works.
 The specification in the tender stipulated that in the event the certificate was not released within the indicated
 period, the time limit of the execution of the contract would be extended by the time necessary to obtain the
 decision. Immediately after signing the contract, the winning contractor withdrew the request for the
 compliance certificate. The time it took to reapply for and obtain the certificate delayed the project execution
 by almost three months.


Scheme: Unbalanced bidding. Under this scheme, project officials provide a favored
bidder with inside information that is not made available to other bidders, for example,
that one of several line items in a request for bids will not be called for after the contract
has been awarded or that a certain low-cost solution will be acceptable. This information
invariably gives the bidder an unfair advantage by allowing the company to lower its
price or otherwise tailor its bid to defeat its uninformed competitors. Project officials
can facilitate the scheme by drafting vague specifications to further disadvantage
competitors (see Case below).


Case 6: Secret arrangement allowed bidder to “low ball” item
 A “representative” of an agency promised an international bidder for a multimillion agricultural testing
 laboratory that it would win the contract provided that it would hire him as a “consultant” to help prepare its
 bid. The consulting fee would be 20% of the contract value, which he would share with project officials.
 Intrigued, the bidder wondered how he would be able to pay the bribe and still be the lowest qualified bidder.
 The representative claimed that the project would remove certain line items that called for expensive humidity
 and temperature control equipment once the contract had been awarded. The bidder could thus “low ball”
 this item in its bid, be the lowest bidder, and still have sufficient funds to pay the bribe. Additional contract
 amendments would be processed as necessary. The bidder agreed to the scheme, but lost the contract after
 the representative negotiated an even more lucrative deal with another bidder.


Unbalanced bidding is also used to describe the practice of bidders quoting prices
significantly below cost for some line items and prices significantly above cost for others,
in the expectation that the procuring authority will request many more items for which
prices have been inflated. As a result, the lowest responsive bidder as determined at the
time of contract award may not constitute the lowest-cost solution.

Case 7: Abuse of inside information
 The auditors checked a public procurement for the construction of a school soccer field. While analyzing the
 tender documents, they noticed specific and repeating dots on the pages of both the investment estimate
 (drawn up by the contractor’s building inspector) and on the cost estimate enclosed with the winning bid.
 The two documents were supposed to derive from different sources so the dots aroused the auditors’ interest
 and therefore were submitted to an expert’s analysis. The expert concluded that it was indisputable that the
 two documents had been printed on the same device.

      In a tender for the construction of an administration building, the procuring entity received three bids. Company

      a low price for this item and win the tender.

Scheme: Leakage of confidential information. Information about cost estimates and
competing bids may be leaked by government officials to favored bidders to give them
an unfair advantage, e.g., enabling them to tailor their bid so as to secure contract award.

Case 9: Leakage of information
 Thanks to his position as unit head in a local government, Bogdan reserved an entry in the budget to purchase
 five new cars. His brother-in-law, Adam, happened to own a car sales dealership of popular brand cars, and
 he made a deal with Bogdan to sell him the five cars. In order to do this, Bogdan would have to manipulate
 the procurement process in a way that would prevent other car dealers from submitting competing bids.
 The specifications in the tender involved the typical minimum parameters for similar tenders. However, they
 also contained an uncharacteristic requirement for a specific security system, a feature which was usually
 offered as an option by car manufacturers. By adding this specification, each bidding car dealer would have
 no choice but make a special order of the cars in their country of origin. Taking advantage of this insider
 information, Adam ordered the cars with the added feature well in advance of the tender.
 Although the purchase of the cars had been provided for in the budget at the very beginning of the fiscal year,
 Bogdan launched the tender procedure only late in December. The open invitation to tender specified the
 minimum time limit for submissions and the commitment to deliver the vehicles not later than 31 December.
 As a result, only one bid was submitted, namely by the firm of Bogdan’s brother-in-law. During the ensuing
 audit, Bogdan was unable to justify the reason why the tender and award of the contract were delayed until
 late December.

Red flags indicating leakage of confidential information
  ■■   Inadequate bidding procedures, e.g., failure to enforce bidding deadlines, taking breaks during the open-
       ing of bids (to provide opportunity to share the content of certain bids and amend others), etc.
  ■■   A bid closely tracks the project’s preferred solutions, budgets, estimates, etc.
  ■■   The winning bid is just under the next lowest bid
  ■■   A questionable “consultant” or “middleman” is involved in the bidding process
  ■■   Project officials and the favored bidder communicate (e.g., by email) or socialize during the bidding
       period


Scheme: Inappropriate contractual terms. There are instances where officials change
the standard contract clauses in order to reduce outside scrutiny. For example, they
may omit the standard audit clause, make changes to contractual remedies, or remove
the requirement for an advance guarantee and performance bond.

     Case 10: Inappropriate change to contractual terms
      A government agency announced a tender for a donor-funded project aimed at developing and conducting a
      number of e-learning courses. The objective of the grant was the training of 20,000 participants from small
      and medium-sized companies. The contract was awarded to company E. The firm offered to train 25,000
      participants, which exceeded the target numbers presented by the other bidders.
      Because the project was donor-funded, the agency undertook to monitor and verify the outcome by way of
      regular reports prepared on the basis of data presented by the contractor. The report analysis showed that
      there appeared to be problems with the reported achievements and indicators, especially those referring to
      the number of persons trained.
      An audit by the Polish Central Anti-Corruption Bureau revealed that the agency had made changes to the grant
      application requirements with respect to, among others, the criteria for achieving the project indicators and
      results. The criterion of completing the course by 20,000 trainees was replaced with the requirement for the
      trainees to commence the course and participate in it. Thus, one single login by a participant was sufficient
      to be considered as full participation in the training course. As a result, the contractor could execute the
      procurement and receive the funds. As the reports indicated, the training courses were completed by only
      4,000 trainees, while the remaining had only participated in some of the training.



     Suggestions

         ■■   Review bidding documents for red flags and ensure that audit rights and
              contractual remedies are included, as appropriate
         ■■   Ensure that the specifications, BOQ, and Terms of References (TORs) for large-
              value and high-risk contracts are reviewed by an independent expert and that
              they are not altered at a later time without the agency ’s approval

4. Short-Listing and Prequalification
Short-listing and prequalification process can be used to exclude qualified
competitive bidders. For contracts where prequalification is required, prior review by
agency staff should be mandatory for all documentation and proposals related to the
pre-qualification process. The same holds true for the short-listing of firms for large
consultancy contracts. The exclusion of qualified bidders could ensure that only the
preferred bidder, in whose bidding a government or project official may have a hidden
interest, will submit a bid that fulfills the requirements.

Red flags in short-listing and prequalification
 Questionable        Unusual or unreasonable evaluation criteria

                     Short-listed firms do not have similar qualifications or there is a wide gap in qualifications
                     Highly qualified firms have expressed interest and are not shortlisted

Case 11: Manipulation of bid criteria
 A college organized an annual tender for its security services. It was common practice that the college’s
 Administrative Director was appointed as the chairman of the tender committee. Other members of the
 committee were his departmental subordinates. The Director was a bossy character and, boasting his
 experience as an army officer, he introduced military discipline among his subordinates, few of whom dared
 to question his decisions. Thanks to his position, the Director laid down the conditions for participation, the
 procedure and criteria for the evaluation of the bids.
 In the course of a review of the tender procedures, the auditors found that for eight years the same firm had
 been providing security at the college. Further scrutiny revealed that the owner of the firm had been close
 friends with the Administrative Director since they had previously served in the same military unit.
 The mechanism used to ensure that the security firm won the tenders proved to be quite simple: a gradual
 increase in the requirements for experience, equipment and human resources. At the very beginning, when
 the friend’s security firm had just been set up, the requirements were set very low allowing him to win the
 contract, build the business, invest in increasingly sophisticated equipment and employ more people.
 As the business was growing, the requirements of the college were increasing as well. Over the years, the
 qualification requirements for the bidders had became so demanding that local entrepreneurs running similar
 businesses had no chance of winning a contract. At the same time, the favored firm turned from being the
 cheapest bidder to becoming a very expensive one, with prices much above the average.

     Suggestions

         ■■   Ensure the prequalification or expression of interest contains sufficient
              information for the prospective companies to determine their eligibility
         ■■   Assess the qualifications criteria used for short-listing in order to determine
              whether they are in line with the contract requirements
         ■■   Review the prequalification and short list evaluation report to ensure that the
              short-listed companies or firms have the required expertise
         ■■   Review the reasons for the rejection of the submitted expression of interest
         ■■   Check whether there are any indicators of hidden interests (use of shell
              companies)

     Scheme: Exclusion of qualified bidders. Officials can facilitate the selection of a
     favored bidder by improperly excluding other qualified bidders. This can take place
     at any time from the drafting of the bidding documents to the receipt of bids. The
     exclusion of qualified bidders often triggers complaints as the potential bidders invest

5. Pre-Bid Conference
Pre-bid conferences can be used to facilitate unbalanced bidding. Pre-bid conferences
and site visits are often scheduled during the bidding period to clarify any ambiguities
or discrepancies in the documents and to give potential bidders information on the
bidding process and on the government’s expectations. The pre-bid conference is usually
followed by a clarification letter or modifications to the issued bidding documents
which must then be sent to all the companies that bought the bidding documents.
However, government officials may refrain from sharing timely, sufficient or correct
information with all the bidders in order to give an unfair advantage to the favored
bidder (see page 19).

     6. Bid Submission
     Corrupt procurement staff may accept late bids, tamper with bids, or
     exclude valid bids. Bids must be received by the agency prior to the date and
     time indicated in the bidding documents. Corrupt project staff may: (i) accept
     late bids submitted by favored bidders with inside information about prices
     from other bidders; (ii) tamper with the bids received, e.g., by discarding
     elements of the bid in order to disqualify the bidder; or (iii) exclude bidders
     by denying access to drop-off points or by failing to open bids.

7. Bid Opening
A key risk in the bid opening phase is the manipulation of bid prices. The bid
opening must be conducted in public at the address, date and time specified in the
bidding documents. The bids should be opened immediately after the bid submission
time. Various tactics may be used to steer contracts to favored bidders, e.g., the price
read aloud for the favored bidder does not match the actual bid price or a “new” price
is later written into the bid.

      ■■   Ensure the project procurement officer is aware of the appropriate bid opening
           procedures including:
           ■■   Ensure control of the bid opening and keep minutes of the opening
           ■■   Check attendance sheets for names and signatures of all bidder representatives
                (including printed names)
           ■■   Verify that each bid was sealed and accompanied by a bid security, if required,
                utilizing the assistance of a randomly selected representative




9In some cases, the national laws require the members of the Bid Evaluation Committee (BEC) to be present, or
the implementing agency may be too small to have sufficient manpower to separate these functions. Accordingly,
when this red flag is present, other due diligence needs to be carried out to determine the legitimacy of the process.

     8. Bid Evaluation Committee
     Inadequate technical competency of BEC could pose a corruption risk. Bid Evaluation
     Committees review and evaluate the submitted bids and recommend to which company
     the contract should be awarded. The BEC has wide discretion in excluding bidders and
     can abuse this authority as part of a corrupt scheme. On occasion, government officials
     purchase a position on the BEC to influence the decision making.

     Case 12: BEC rubberstamped the selection of a favorite bidder
      The city council of this town conducts a public tender for the procurement of security services every year.
      Tomas is always in charge of the tender procedure, which he usually carries out by copying and pasting the
      specifications and contract terms of the previous year. However, these specifications contain a provision which
      states that potential contractors, when evaluating the bids, can receive extra scores when they can demonstrate
      that:
       ■■   they possess at least 10 vehicles with intervention crews;
       ■■   the distance from their head office to the seat of the city council is less than two kilometres;
       ■■   they have a minimum of three years experience in public offices protection, documented by submitted
            references.
      On the basis of the above criteria, the bidders can receive 30 additional scores—10 for each criterion.
      After the bids had been reviewed, only company A, which has been providing security services to the city
      council for many years, received the maximum score. The company owns ten vehicles (purchased from the
      local police) that are left in the city council’s car parking, at the company’s seat that is rented from the city
      council.
      Although the wording of article. 5 of the Act on Public Procurement Law with regard to security services allows
      the commission to determine the evaluation criteria based on the properties of the contractor, they effectively
      eliminated all competing companies from accessing the procurement.
      The audit of the contract revealed that because of the smooth execution of the contracts in the past it appeared
      that the head of the responsible unit failed in his due diligence obligations by ignoring the fact that Tomas
      was on friendly terms with the head of company A. It also observed that other members of the BEC, recognizing
      they had no influence on the procedure’s outcome, simply signed the tender documents without properly
      reviewing the documentation and procedure.

     9. Bid Evaluation Report
     Questionable evaluation and unusual bid patterns may emerge in the BER. After the
     completion of the evaluation process, the Bid Evaluation Committee should present to
     the implementing agency its BER, which describes the results and the process by which
     the BEC has evaluated the bids received. The BER may include a number of indicators
     of bid rigging, e.g., questionable disqualifications, and unusual bid patterns.

     Case 13: Lack of appropriate due diligence
      A procuring entity conducted a tender for the delivery of printer and photocopier paper. The tender was directed
      to the required number of potential bidders, along with precise parameters regarding the specification and
      deadline for submitting the bids. Because of the very detailed features of the product, which did not allow any
      deviations, only two bids were submitted before the deadline.
      In the course of the audit, it turned out that the requirements could be met only by producers in two European
      countries. One of the bidders had requested an extension of the deadline, because he was negotiating with
      a producer in one of those countries. The request was submitted about six days prior to the deadline, yet the
      procuring entity did not reply.
      The manager of the procuring entity was unable to provide the auditors with a reasonable justification for
      introducing the strict specification that led to a limited competition, other than that the standards were „the
      best”. In a subsequent written justification provided to the auditors, the entity noted that the specified paper
      decreased dusting by 10%, which had a beneficial impact on the maintenance and life-cycle of the printing
      equipment. The auditors, however, were of the view that this argument could not be taken into consideration
      as it was not the subject of the evaluation with respect to satisfying the criteria in the course of the bid analysis.
      As a result, the auditors gave a negative assessment indicating that because of the excessive requirements
      the procuring entity had purchased paper at a price that was 25% higher than it could have purchased from
      other suppliers offering competitive products.

What is collusion?

Collusion can be defined as “an arrangement between two or more parties designed to
achieve an improper purpose, including influencing improperly the actions of another
party.” This definition includes collusive bidding schemes in which two or more bidders
agree to manipulate the bidding process, e.g., to fix prices. These schemes are designed
to undermine competitive bidding, a cornerstone of public procurement. When
collusive bidding schemes are able to operate, the result is inevitably higher costs as
prices are artificially inflated.

Where are the risks of collusion the highest?

Collusion risks appear to be the highest in the construction sector and sectors where
there are few qualified bidders compared to the number of contracts being let. In many
countries, the construction sector (e.g., roads) is dominated by a few large companies.
Often, domestic preferences price-out international competitors in order to enable a local
cartel to operate; or business associations are set-up to coordinate bids or to represent
local companies facing debarment action. Other examples are international bidders that
collude with local firms offering to represent them locally or serving as subcontractors;
politically connected companies using their influence to steer contracts to the cartel
and to coerce other firms to join the cartel or to refrain from bidding; small local shop
owners colluding for the bidding of office supplies; and site inspections or pre-bidding
conferences used to organize an ad-hoc collusive arrangement.

In general, collusion risks appear to be higher when procuring in sub-sectors with few
potential bidders (e.g., four or less), compared to the number of contracts being let. This
concentration of market share among a few companies in turn may be the result of high
barriers to entry and exit or large economies of scale. The risk of collusion has not been
found to be limited to any region or country. Rather, it is an often-used strategy for bidders
to undermine competition.

     What is the impact of collusive schemes?

     Collusive bidding schemes can have substantial negative impact on the investment.
     The direct impact of collusion is higher prices of goods and services procured. The
     impact of collusion may span beyond one tender; it could: (i) negatively impact price
     levels in the entire sector in the country, resulting in inflated market prices; (ii) over
     time reduce competitiveness of the local industry; and (iii) distort investment decisions
     through undue influence by politicians and government officials.

     Case 14: Unreasonable specifications in favor of one bidder
      In a short period of time, company X became a leading company specializing in sports facilities construction
      for local governments. It always offered a fairly low price for project execution, thus winning all tenders.
      An audit of one pool construction project revealed that the owner of company X had an agreement with the
      head of company Z, a producer of water treatment technology, that for construction projects of public swimming
      pools he would determine the parameters associated with water treatment technology in such a way that they
      could only be met by that supplier. In return, company X would receive a commission, specified by a percentage
      of the contract price, from company Z. Thus, during the tender process competing firms were rejected as they
      did not satisfy the specifications. Once the contract was signed, company X could inflate its prices, allowing
      the owner of company Z extra financial benefits.
      During the course of the audit, the employees of the public procuring entity could not explain why the
      parameters for water treatment technology were set at such strict levels. However, the proactive review did
      not obtain sufficient evidence.


     How are collusive schemes organized?

     Public investment projects can be vulnerable to various types of collusive schemes.
     These schemes can range considerably from simple, ad hoc collusive arrangements
     among local bidders to well-connected cartels involving high-ranking politicians. To
     remain in operation, a collusive scheme depends on its ability to eliminate competition,
     generate high profits for participants, and avoid detection and sanctions.

         ■■   Coordinate and organize the collusive scheme. A cartel must possess information
              about upcoming bids, have convening power to coordinate the bids, and often
              also assist with logistical support to carry out the scheme, e.g., by purchasing
              bid securities on behalf of the designated losers and drafting large parts of their
              bids. In addition, business associations may be used as a front by assisting in the
              coordination of bids, lobbying vis-à-vis government officials on matters related
              to laws and licenses, or by defending companies facing legal action.
         ■■   Generate and allocate supra-normal profits to retain cartel members. The livelihood
              of collusive bidding schemes depends on their ability to achieve supra-normal
              profits. Such profits are often attained by inflating bid prices and then allocating
              the profits among the cartel members and corrupt officials. The designated

        winning bidder usually pays-off designated losing bidders by employing them
        as subcontractors, allowing them to win in subsequent bids, or granting them a
        small share of the bid prices (normally around two percent).
   ■■   Eliminate competition. The successful execution of a collusive scheme requires
        the exclusion of competitors that could break the scheme by submitting
        lower-priced bids. Tactics to eliminate competition can include: (i) enticing
        or coercing competitors to join the collusive arrangement; (ii) suppressing
        bids through threats of physical or economic harm; (iii) conspiring with
        government officials to exclude competitors from shortlists, establish biased
        qualification criteria or specifications, or to declare their bids non-responsive;
        and (iv) creating anti-competitive conditions, e.g., by restricting the issuance
        of licenses and permits.
   ■■   Evade detection. Cartels evade detection by executing their scheme in a manner
        that gives the appearance of competition, e.g., by cartel members submitting
        complementary bids, also known as “protective” or “shadow” bids. Since
        complementary bids will never be successful, designated winners can use
        shell companies, fictitious firms, or subsidiaries as designated losing bidders.
        Alternatively, cartels may bribe government officials to ignore red flags.
   ■■   Avoid sanctions. Cartels may avoid effective legal and administrative sanctions,
        because of: (i) inadequate legislation prohibiting collusive practices; (ii) lack of
        experience or capacity of the national investigative body(ies); (iii) ineffective
        prosecution; (iv) insufficient severity of the punishment; (v) lack of political will
        to prosecute, particularly large domestic firms; and (vi) undue political influence
        on the investigative, prosecutorial, and adjudicative processes.

Players in a collusive bidding scheme
 There may be several different kinds of actors playing a role in a collusive scheme. The main actors typically
 include a designated winning bidder, designated losing bidders and government officials.
   ■■ The ring leader organizes the scheme and often also determines who will win the bid

   ■■ The designated losers submit higher cost “protective” bids to give the appearance of competition

   ■■ The designated winner, which may be a shell company, is awarded the contract and may outsource the

      work to one or more colluding members, in order to share profits and work
   ■■ Government insider(s) provide(s) privileged information to prospective bidders about cost estimates, com-

      petitive bids, and upcoming contracts
   ■■ Divers are companies outside the control of the cartel seeking to win the contract by placing

      a lower and often competitive bid.


What strategies can cartels pursue?

Cartels can pursue various strategies, requiring different levels of coordination. The
most common types of collusive bidding schemes include: (i) market division; (ii) bid
rotation; and (iii) price fixing:


                                                                                                                   35

         ■■   Market division occurs when cartel members agree to divide their market (e.g.,
              geographical territories and client segments) thereby restricting competition.
         ■■   Bid rotation refers to an agreement among bidders to take turns in winning
              contracts.
         ■■   Price fixing refers to an agreement among competitors to fix prices at which
              goods and services are sold in a specific market.

     How are collusive schemes detected?

     Collusive bidding schemes can be detected through a review of procurement
     actions and interviews with industry representatives. Conversations with industry
     representatives can help identify the operation of collusive arrangements or cartels in
     key sub-sectors. In many cases, collusive practices are so entrenched that they are an
     open secret among contractors, officials and the industry in general.

     Besides such conversations, government officials may seek to identify red flags such as
     those listed and described in more detail in the table on page 37 through the review of
     procurement documents and the analysis of past contract awards.

     Case 15: Bid rigging scheme between three companies
      The national market for the supply of medical equipment used in a particular therapy has been dominated by
      three companies: A, B and C. For many years, it appeared that all subsequent tender procedures organized by
      medical centers were carried out in compliance with the applicable procedures, providing a guarantee of
      obtaining the best offers.
      However, during an audit, it appeared that, from year to year, the price of the equipment was higher and higher
      even though nothing justified such rapid growth. Moreover, the winner of the contracts for the most valuable
      supplies of a certain type of equipment was always company A. The other companies won only minor tenders.
      A deeper analysis revealed the existence of a bid-rigging scheme between the three companies whereby the
      companies used to fix the prices before each tender and agreed who would be the winning bidder before the
      tender. Regardless of which company won the bid, company A was the dominating partner and exclusive
      importer of the equipment. Even when they did not win the tender, the two other companies had to purchase
      the equipment from company A.

     Case 16: How a politically connected group of national and international
     companies colluded in a roads project
      Investigators received allegations of suspected collusion among a group of local and foreign companies, as
      well as allegations regarding the involvement of politicians and government officials in the tender for two
      road rehabilitation contracts in a developing country. More than a dozen witnesses told investigators that
      under the collusive arrangement, uncooperative potential bidders were disqualified during the prequalification
      process, and winners were chosen by their willingness to pay large bribes. Losing bidders were allowed to
      participate in exchange for small payments. Witnesses said that as a result of the collusive activity, contract
      prices were routinely inflated by 20 to 30 percent. Furthermore, multiple witnesses stated that the existence
      of the collusive activity was an “open secret,” in fact being referred to as the “SOP” – Standard Operating
      Procedure.
      The investigation uncovered a pattern of inconsistent prequalification results, suggesting that agency officials
      may have engaged in bid rigging. Project officials disqualified numerous competitive bidders without reasonable
      explanation and sometimes for vague reasons such as failure to “fit the contract profile”.
      An analysis of bidding documents provided significant indicators of collusive practices. Some bids showed
      abnormally high unit costs, which is one way to inflate bid prices to levels beyond that of the designated
      winner. In addition, bid patterns indicated coordination among the bidders. Examples of unusual bidding
      patterns included: very close bids (bids US$31 apart on a US$26 million contract) with widely disparate
      subtotals; bids with lockstep relations to the engineer’s estimate; and numerous, large bid calculation errors
      suggesting last-minute revisions. In addition, multiple companies submitted fraudulent bid securities, indicating
      that they had no intention of winning the contracts. Some of these red flags are illustrated below.


                                                                               Above cost

                                                    Fraudulent Bids                           4
What is a fraudulent bid?

For the purposes of this handbook, fraud is defined as “any act or omission, including
a misrepresentation that knowingly or recklessly misleads, or attempts to mislead, a
party to obtain a financial or other benefit or to avoid an obligation.” As used here, a
“fraudulent bid” is a bid or proposal that contains knowingly or recklessly misleading
information, submitted in order to gain an unfair advantage in the selection process.

What is the purpose of a fraudulent bid?

The evaluation of written submissions to bid solicitations is the foundation of a fair
procurement system. A prominent risk to the procurement system is the undermining
of the evaluation process by bidders providing false or misleading information in their
bids and supporting documentation. When false information is relied upon to make
procurement decisions, the impact is often manifested in poor quality of works, goods
and services, and failure to meet developmental objectives.

There are a number of “benefits” firms may seek to obtain by making fraudulent bids.
For example, they may want to meet qualification criteria, e.g., by exaggerating financial
statements and past performance; they may simply seek to save costs by falsifying rather
than buying a bid security; or bids may be submitted from a shell or entirely fictitious
firm in order to hide its true ownership, e.g., by government officials. Consequently,
frauds are usually made with respect to the ownership of the bidder, its capacity, and
the bid security.

   ■■   Ownership. Concealed or misrepresented ownership of the bidder: bids or
        proposals are submitted by firms that are secretly owned, in whole or in part, by
        government or project officials.
   ■■   Financial capacity. Exaggerated financial resources of the bidder, such as inflated
        annual turnover or balance sheet amounts. Those bids often are accompanied by
        false or forged audit reports.
   ■■   Technical capacity. Falsified or exaggerated information about the firm’s
        professional credentials or prior project or sales experience. Such bids often


                                                                                              39
     Fraud and Corruption Awareness Handbook



              include forged or fraudulent end-user certificates, manufacturer’s authorizations
              and product certifications.
         ■■   Bid security. Bidders submit false or forged bid securities in order to save costs.
              These may include securities without a serial number, or issued on a fake bank’s
              letterhead, or without the required signatures.

     How are fraudulent bids detected?

     The following is an overview of the different indicators that should raise suspicions of
     possible fraud in the submission of bids with regard to ownership, financial capacity,
     technical capacity and bid security. Typically, additional due diligence through database
     or Internet searches and document checks would be sufficient to clarify matters.

     Ownership
     Fictitious companies are by definition fraudulent and may also serve as fronts
     for government officials. The typical scheme involves corrupt government officials
     creating a fictitious company that will serve as a “vehicle” to secure contract awards.
     Often, the fictitious—or ghost—company will subcontract work to lower cost and
     sometimes unqualified firms. The fictitious company may also utilize designated losers
     as subcontractors to deliver the work, thus indicating collusion.

     Shell companies have no significant assets, staff or operational capacity. They pose a
     serious red flag as a bidder on public contracts, because they often hide the interests of
     project or government officials, concealing a conflict of interest and opportunities for
     money laundering. Also, by definition, they have no experience.

     Red flags related to fictitious or shell companies
      Fictitious or     Complaints from other bidders that a competitor is a shell company
      shell company     or unknown in the industry
                        The bidder does not appear on the Internet, is not listed in telephone
                        or business directories, or is located in a residence or non-business location


     Financial capacity
     The most common form of misrepresentation of bidders’ financial data is the
     submission of falsified audit reports. The purpose is to make the bidder appear to be
     a larger well-established company supported by strong financial statements.

Red flags related to financial capacity
 False or forged   Audit reports are not signed or attested
 audit reports     The audit company does not exist
                   The audit report is not in line with auditing standards
 False or          The reported financial information is contradicted by Dun & Bradstreet or other reporting
 exaggerated       agencies
 financial data    The reported financial information contradicts that provided under prior contracts


Technical capacity
As a part of the pre- and post-qualification process, companies are often required to
submit information on their past experience. Misrepresentations commonly relate to
the volume of work within a specified period or years in business as indicated in end-
user or performance certificates, manufacturer’s authorizations, product certifications
and personal credentials.

   ■■   End-user certificates. As a part of the post-qualification process, the client
        may request bidders to submit end-user certificates as a means of confirming
        past experience of the firms, and document sales and service claims. Often,
        companies that cannot meet such requirements resort to falsifying the requested
        documentation.
   ■■   Manufacturer’s authorizations. Bidders who are not the original manufacturer
        may be required to submit manufacturer’s authorizations for the goods they
        offer. When these authorizations are falsified, it may increase the risk of product
        substitution.
   ■■   Product certifications. Product certifications are used to ensure the goods offered
        meet the performance requirements as stated in the bidding documents. Some
        bidders falsify the required certifications, claiming to meet international or
        country standards, when in fact the product is of a lower quality.
   ■■   Personnel credentials. Bidders and consultants may be required to provide CVs
        of the personnel they are proposing to work on the contract. The personnel must
        have the minimum qualifications as stated in the issued bidding documents.
        Falsified credentials of key personnel, such as educational degrees, years of
        experience and language skills, or use of CVs without the individuals’ consent,
        are among the most common approaches.

     Case 17: Contractor misrepresents its technical capacity
      In the public procurement for a wastewater treatment plant, the winning company did not comply with the
      deadlines set out in the schedule. The works were to be completed in mid-September. However, they were
      delayed till the winter season and then suspended due to severe frost and snowfall. In the end, it took until
      the spring to complete the project. According to the firm’s owner, the initial delays resulted from the fact that
      the firm’s excavators and bulldozers had been out of order, which made timely implementation impossible.
      The auditors established that the firm’s heavy equipment had been utilized in good working order at other
      construction sites. In the tender procedure for the construction of the wastewater treatment plant, the company
      had made a ​​ false representation that it had adequate equipment and technical personnel to accomplish the
      task on time. In reality, all of the firm’s equipment and workers were employed on other construction sites that
      were not related to the wastewater treatment plant


     Bid security
     Agencies may require the submission of bid securities as part of the bid package to
     ensure that bidders are serious about their bids. It is not unusual for bidding companies
     to forge bid securities for two purposes: (i) to meet qualification requirements of the
     bid solicitation; and (ii) to avoid the cost and inconvenience of purchasing the security
     (see Case 18).

     Red flags related to bid security
      Forged or         Securities do not have a serial number
      fraudulent bid    Securities are copies rather than originals
      securities
                        Securities are not on original letterhead of the issuing bank and lack the required signatures

     Case 18: Bidder scans letterhead of commercial bank to forge bid securities
      The procurement agent for an urban development project suspected potential bid fraud by a local company. Due
      to concerns about widespread forgery of bids, the procurement agent contacted all commercial banks that had
      issued bid securities, performance bonds, and advance payment guarantees to determine whether the documents
      presented by bidders were, in fact, legitimate. The agent discovered that a local bidder had not been issued any
      bid securities from the commercial bank as claimed in its bid.
      A review of the bids established that the local company submitted three forged bid securities and two forged
      advance payment guarantees to secure five contracts. The company had simply scanned the commercial bank’s
      letterhead and produced both sets of false documents to support its bids.

                         Fraudulent Implementation                                             5
What is fraudulent implementation?

The term “fraudulent implementation” denotes any fraud taking place after contract
award in the physical implementation of works and delivery of goods and services.
During the implementation phase, firms may deliberately fail to deliver the number
and quality of goods, works or services stipulated in the contract in order to save costs
and increase profits; abuse contract amendments to increase the scope or volume of
work or to avoid competition; and claim or bill for additional goods, works or services
not carried out or not needed. Such efforts are often facilitated by bribe payments to
agency officials for the approval of work completion certificates and the processing of
invoices.

What is the difference between poor and fraudulent implementation?

Fraudulent implementation occurs when firms knowingly or recklessly misrepresent
their work as being delivered according to specifications. Poor implementation,
as judged by substandard quality works, goods and services is an indicator of fraud.
However, poor local capacity may result in quality problems as well. Hence, the question
arises as to whether the implementation of a given contract is the result of poor capacity
or fraud. The implementation is deemed fraudulent when the firm’s acts or omissions
mislead or attempt to mislead the agency to obtain a financial or other benefit, or
to avoid an obligation. For example, fraud occurs when a contractor represents that
it constructed a building according to specifications, when in fact it used thinner
reinforcing bars (to anchor and reinforce concrete and masonry in construction) and
less cement than required by the contract specifications. By committing the fraud, the
contractor obtains full payment while lowering his costs. Another example includes the
delivery of old equipment presented as new or no delivery at all.

What can fraudulent implementation lead to?

Implementation frauds may impact service delivery, health, and safety. The impact
of false claims is mostly financial. However, failure to meet contractual specifications has
a range of impacts, and since such schemes are often not discovered until after project
implementation, remedies may be limited. For example, as the option to reconstruct a


                                                                                               43
     Fraud and Corruption Awareness Handbook



     civil works project compromised by implementation fraud may be too expensive and
     not practical, project beneficiaries are forced to accept a product of substandard quality,
     unlikely to deliver its projected utility. For example:

         ■■   Health. Health clinics can be unusable due, inter alia, to poor sanitary installations
              and lack of electricity. Faulty equipment may pose a health risk. A leaking roof
              may result in the destruction of needed medical equipment.
         ■■   Transportation. A road can disappear after one particularly rainy season due to
              poor drainage; or it may not wide enough for two vehicles to pass at the same
              time, thus increasing the risk of traffic accidents. Missing shock absorbers from
              a bridge could have consequences for its lifespan and public safety.

     How is fraudulent implementation detected?

     This section discusses the detection of fraud during contract management and more
     specifically the draft contract, contract delivery and contract changes stages (see Figure 2):

10. Draft Contract
Questionable deviations from the bidding documents may signal fraud to benefit a
contractor or government official. Regardless of which procurement schedule is used,
the terms and conditions of a contract cannot, without the contracting agency’s prior
approval, materially differ from those on which bids or proposals were asked.

     11. Contract Delivery
     Scheme: Failure to meet contract terms. Firms may deliberately fail to comply with
     contract requirements. The contractor will attempt to conceal such actions often by fal-
     sifying or forging supporting documentation and bill for the work as if it were done in
     accordance with specifications. In many cases, the contractors must bribe inspection or
     project personnel to accept the substandard goods or works, or supervision agents are
     coerced to approve substandard work. Listed below are common frauds committed by
     companies failing to meet their contractual obligations.

     Red flags indicating failure to meet contract terms
      Failures          Discrepancies between inspection findings, test results, or contract specifications and the
                        contractor’s claims for payment
                        Failed tests or inspections
                        Complaints about poor quality from users
                        Increased or accelerated product failures or repair costs
      Inadequate        Absent, inadequate or altered documentation submitted by the contractor to support
      supporting        billings
      documentation     Indications from the contractor’s expenses, payroll, and other records that it did not incur
                        costs necessary to comply with contract specifications. For example, the contractor did
                        not:
                          ■■   purchase the quantity or quality of materials required under the contract
                          ■■   own or lease all the required equipment to carry out the work
                          ■■   have the necessary labor with required skills on the job site
                        The contractor resists government inspection of its books and records
      Delays            Delayed start of works or the delivery of services beyond normal timeframes
                        Long delays in implementation of the contract
      Poor reputation The company is known to be a poor performer
      of the firm     The company has exaggerated or falsified its prior experience


     a) Product substitution. Contractors may substitute inferior and often cheaper
     products than those specified in the contract.

Case 19: Substitution of methods
 In a tender for the renovation of the roof of a public building, the bill of quantity specified the technology and
 performance criteria of the contract.
 To implement the project in a safe manner, scaffolding reaching the third floor of the building would have to
 be installed as the building was located adjacent to two pedestrian sidewalks. This would also require the
 relevant authorities to close part of the impacted the street and sidewalks. The cost of the scaffolding material
 and installation was estimated at US$18,333.
 Upon completion of the project an inspection revealed that, rather than erecting scaffolding, the contractor
 had carried out the renovation works from a truck equiped with an extension arm. However, the auditors found
 that the contractor had obtained full payment from the contracting authority despite of the fact that the works
 were not carried out according to the specifications, using cheaper technologies without the necessary permits.
 The audit also concluded that the contracting authority had unreasonably restricted the execution of the
 procurement through the need to erect scaffolding.


b) Deviation from specifications. Companies may seek to deviate from their
contractual obligations. In one case, the TOR of a consulting firm required that it
analyzes various cost estimation packages and recommends three options. The firm
failed to do so, recommending only its own solution. In civil works, contractors may
seek to reduce the thickness of a road surface, fail to sufficiently compact the soil, avoid
costs by vibrating the cement resulting in air pockets, thereby reducing the load bearing
capacity and the width of the road.

Case 20: Review finds discrepancy with contract specification
 A city mayor announced a tender for the construction of a municipal road. The road was designed to be 5
 meters wide. One of the requirements for the potential contractor was to have a 4.5 meter-wide asphalt paver.
 Six bidders participated in the tender, with prices for the overall execution of the contract that were similar.
 The lowest cost bidder was selected as the winner of the contract. The works were delivered on time.
 In the course of a review of the project, the auditors became interested in the discrepancy between the assumed
 width of the road (5 meters), and the requirement for the contractor of having an asphalt paver with a width
 of only 4.5 meters.
 Their measurements of the new road eventually revealed that the road was, in fact, only 4.5 meters wide.
 Thus, the audit report concluded that the road works did not comply with the terms of the tender and project
 assumptions. It also found that a certified appraiser had estimated that by reducing the works, the amount
 due to the contractor should be lowered by at least US$133,000. Having taken into account the work actually
 performed, the bid turned out to be the most expensive of all the submitted offers.


c) Substandard work. Failure to exercise key controls, lack of independent oversight,
and bribery of the supervision agent are the main elements allowing for this type of
scheme.




                                                                                                                       47

     Case 21: Contractor overcharges
      During the implementation of a highway construction project, the contractor’s laboratory determined that three
      sections of the highway of a total length of 800 meters could be covered with an asphalt substance without
      having to change the road bed. However, in the report to the representative of the company running the
      investment supervision, an entry was made stating that the road bed had been replaced along the entire road.
      The investor paid for the full cost of the works, including for the 800 meters of road bed that had not been
      treated as stated.


     d) Failure to deliver. Contractors sometimes leave project sites without completing
     the civil works they have committed to. In other cases, the training, equipment and
     consultant reports are not delivered at all.

     Scheme: False Statements. Contractors and consultants can submit a wide variety of
     false statements, such as false time sheets for a company’s employees (to support inflat-
     ed invoices); false claims that soil conditions were more difficult than those anticipat-
     ed at the time of bidding (to justify improper contract amendments); false CVs of staff
     not on their payrolls; or junior staff substituted for the senior staff presented in their
     bid proposals.

     Red flags indicating false statements
      Discrepancies     Discrepancies between statements and supporting documentation or site visits
      in supporting     Inconsistent, missing or apparently altered supporting documentation
      documentation     Discrepancies between statements and the results of background or due diligence checks

     Case 22: Conflict of interest
      The procuring entity of this municipality engaged company Z to supervise the construction, contractors and
      subcontractors at a bridge construction site. The value of the contract amounted to PLN220 million. The
      compensation to be paid to company Z was determined at the level of 3% of the amount received by the
      contractors—contract terms which did not motivate the supervisor to adopt an economic approach, i.e., the
      more expensive the construction, the more company Z would be earning. Thus, company Z requested additional
      expensive expert opinions, resulting in changes of designs. As a result of the conflict of interest between the
      supervisor and the procuring entity, the final cost increased two-fold to PLN400 million.


     Scheme: False Claims and Invoices. This type of fraud frequently occurs in projects
     with weak financial control systems whereby the project officials receive kickbacks for
     approving or processing falsified claims and invoices. Alternatively, the contractor may
     recognize the weak control environment through its previous interactions with the im-
     plementing agency and—acting alone—submit duplicate, inflated invoices or unsub-
     stantiated claims with the intention of defrauding the project.

Case 23: Work not carried out
Peter, a public procurement chief specialist employed in a hospital, had awarded multiple contracts to the
same company that provided medical products. An analysis of the latest contract award carried out by the
auditors indicated that shortly after the contract had been awarded to the medical products company, Peter
received a payment from that company. The payment was made under cover of a contract to conduct training
courses on public procurement. The audit concluded, however, that no training course took place at the time
and place specified in the agreement between Peter and the company. Instead, an integration meeting had
taken place at which Peter was not present.

12. Contract Changes
Scheme: Abuse of contract amendments and change orders. Contract amendments
and change orders usually represent legitimate modifications to the signed contracts.
However, they can be abused. A common scheme involves collusion between a favored
contractor and project officials to award a contract to the contractor at a low price, fol-
lowed promptly by one or a series of change orders (often just below the change order
no-objection threshold of 15% of the original contract value).

Case 24: Abuse of change orders
 A company won a tender for the maintenance, development, and modification of an IT system. The contract
 value amounted to approximately US$2.7 million. The officials responsible for the contract had been colluding
 with the winning company in order to increase the contract value. They signed four annexes, which almost
 doubled the original contract value. When questioned about the annexes, the officials alleged that the increased
 value was caused by additional modification works, not provided for in the agreement.
 This is one of many examples in IT procurement where the contracting authority becomes dependent on the
 system contractor by not protecting themselves against intellectual property rights or IT system source codes.
 Thus, each extension or modification is introduced in a non-competitive, unrestricted mode, and allows the
 contractor to dictate prices. It is recommended to promote procurement for open source IT systems based on
 standards instead of products that are protected by intellectual property rights.

                                                                                              6
Development of anti-corruption programs

Anti-corruption programs can provide guidance to officials on the way to conduct
business activities. Corruption is a serious crime that undermines social and
economic development and weakens the fabric of modern-day society. It hinders social
and economic development by diverting national investment away from its intended
purposes; it weakens education and health systems, and it undermines government
institutions, which can lead to political instability.

In the absence of a level playing field, entrepreneurs or public officials involved in
public procurement can never be certain whether or not the contract proposals they
have prepared in good faith will have a chance of success because of the potential
corrupt or collusive activities of officials and competitors. The intentional distortion of
the competitive process caused by a few makes it hard for honest firms to survive and
leads to significant losses to the entire national economy.

Taking the above into consideration, it is useful for any public and private organization
that is committed to operate according to best business practices to adopt an internal
ethics and compliance program (also called anti-corruption program) that provides
clear guidance to its employees regarding the way the organization expects them to
conduct business activities. The adoption of such program does not suggest that there
are any instances of corruption in the organization. On the contrary, such programs
can serve as a protection for employees who may be confronted with unscrupulous
behaviors of colleagues, superiors, or clients.

When implementing an anti-corruption program, which should be led by the senior
leadership of the organization, particular attention should be paid to training and
awareness programs covering employees at all levels of the institution. As well, targeted
communications should be directed at contractors and business partners to ensure
understanding of and compliance with the institution’s program.

     Anti-corruption program creation and management

     The System of Prevention of Corruption Threats is a good starting point. When
     developing an effective anti-corruption program, it is recommended that the
     organization adopts the requirements of the PNEN ISO 9001:2009 certification norm,
     supplemented with additional requirements connected with anti-corruption processes.
     In Poland, this is described by the Polish Centre for Testing and Certification (PCBC)
     as the System of Prevention of Corruption Threats. It is a system developed jointly
     by the National Chamber of Commerce and the PCBC. The norm aims to support
     the performance of companies and institutions that want to increase confidence in
     the fairness of their operating practices, and may be applied in entities which have a
     certified quality management system.

     Thanks to the application of its unique risk analysis, the System of Prevention of
     Corruption Threats may help to identify and manage the risks of fraud and corruption
     inside the enterprise, and serve as a basis for developing solutions to ensure that all
     decisions in the organization are reliable and, as far as possible, impartial.

     To ensure that the entire organization buys into the anti-corruption program, the
     initiative to install the program should be taken at the level of the board of directors.
     Moreover, the chairman of the board should announce the official launch of the
     program with a formal communication to all employees explaining why and how
     every employee, at every level, has an obligation to observe the rules of ethical business
     practices as outlined in the program. To emphasize the seriousness of the issue, this
     communication could also refer to the state’s latest anti-corruption strategy and
     overview of its activities undertaken nationwide.

     Finally, in order to be effective, the anti-corruption program should also include a
     procedure for managers to analyze thoroughly the symptoms of corruption in particular
     areas connected with the company’s activity as well as a sanctions system governing
     infringements of the anti-corruption program rules.

     The key to an effective, successful anti-corruption program lies in the hands of the
     organization’s management team. Without an explicit decision, a company will not
     eliminate improper conduct. Critical success factors include:

         ■■   Recognition of the benefits of adopting ethical business practices
         ■■   Identification of potential threats
         ■■   Presentation of the anti-corruption program to business partners (everyone
              should operate on the basis of the same good practices/principles)
         ■■   Systematic and sustained professional communication and training programs


54
                                                                 Anti-Corruption Policies and Programs10



     ■■   Effective problem-solving
     ■■   Environment of open and candid discussion of problems
     ■■   Effective complaints handling and/or whistle-blower mechanism
     ■■   Ongoing analysis of the implemented program in order to increase effectiveness

According to Poland’s Transparency International, the motto of an entrepreneur who
intends to create an effective system of prevention should be: “Decide, Pass, Register,
Train, and Monitor”.11 The company’s senior management team should be responsible
for making the staff aware of and buy into the importance of good corporate and
personal ethical behavior.

The fraud and corruption risk analysis should cover all business processes. In order
to identify potential sources of threats as well as possible mitigation measures and
controls all business processes should be analyzed. The responsibility for this work
should be assigned to an expert manager, who would be in charge of the program’s
implementation, which would include:

     1.	 Familiarization of the employees with the organization’s anti-corruption
         policy standards and procedures; creation of an active system of training, and
         continuous upgrading of the employees’ skills

     Principles of anti-corruption policy

         1.	 The policy objective is to eliminate any corruption activities that may occur in
             connection with the operation of the organization
         2.	 The policy takes into consideration the strategy and operation of state bodies
             which aim to eliminate corrupt behaviors from all spheres of the economic and
             social life
         3.	 The implementation of the provisions of the policy should rest on all participants
             of the business process—all customers and contractors should be familiarized
             with the policy
         4.	 In corruption cases, the persons who accept and who give the bribe are treated
             equally
         5.	 Employees are not allowed to participate in any corrupt behavior, including
             demanding a financial or personal advantage
         6.	 Customers and contractors are not allowed to acquiesce to an unethical proposal
             or demand put forward by an employee of the organization
         7.	 Hospitality information (e.g., board and transportation) offered by a potential
             customer or contractor must be explicit and available (communicated) to
             ensure the transparency of the business process
         8.	 Customers and contractors are not allowed to offer financial or personal
             advantages to employees
         9.	 The organization should implement separate regulations regarding giving and
             accepting gifts, participation in sponsored entertainment events and incurring
             representation expenses
         10.	 If the customer/contractor suspects that a corruption-featured behavior may
              occur, they should immediately provide relevant information to the organization’s
              management. If such suspicion relates to a company’s management team, the
              information should be passed to the relevant law enforcement agencies

International Anti-Corruption Initiatives



UN Convention against Corruption

The United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) was adopted in 2003
by more than one hundred and sixty (160) State signatories, most of which are Member
States of the World Bank Group (see Table 1 for States that have not yet ratified or
acceded to UNCAC). UNCAC calls for State Parties to adopt preventive and punitive
measures against corruption as well as to cooperate with non-State Parties. The key
commitments under UNCAC are listed below.

   1.	 Assign institutional accountability for prevention. At the national level, each
       State Party must assign to a body or bodies the responsibility for the prevention
       of corruption, including: (i) the carrying out of oversight functions and the
       coordination of preventive policies; (ii) knowledge dissemination; and (iii)
       training of personnel responsible for preventing and combating corruption
       (§6(1) and 60). The anti-corruption body(ies) must be independent, and should
       be free from ‘any undue influence’ (§6(2)).

   2.	 Review preventive measures. The State Parties have agreed that there should
       be periodical reviews in each State to ensure the “adequacy [of legal instruments
       and measures] to prevent and fight corruption” (§5(3) and 63(1)).

   3.	 Establish a Code of Conduct and disclosure regime. State Parties have each
       committed to promulgate a code of conduct (§8(2)) “for the correct, honorable,
       and proper performance” for all public officials, and to require officials to
       disclose outside activities, employment, investments, assets, or gifts that may
       point to a conflict of interest.

   4.	 Improve access to information and involve civil society. Whereas Article 5
       of UNCAC (see also §13) sets forth a commitment by each State Party to adopt
       preventive and anti-corruption practices that promote the participation of civil
       society, Article 10 calls for enhanced transparency in public administration
       by the adoption of such measures as publishing information and “simplifying
       administrative procedures” for attaining access to “competent decision making
       authorities.”




                                                                                           61
     Fraud and Corruption Awareness Handbook



         5.	 Establish a mechanism for reporting UNCAC violations. Each State Party has
             committed to establish measures and systems for reporting acts of corruption
             and create disciplinary actions against public officials who “violate the codes or
             standards established” under UNCAC (§8(6)).

         6.	 Protect whistleblowers. UNCAC obliges State Parties to take measures in their
             respective jurisdictions to protect from “unjustified treatment” whistleblowers
             who report in “good faith” (§32 and §33).

         7.	 Adopt merit based hiring. UNCAC requires each State Party to adopt
             municipal laws for equitable and merit-based hiring and promotion of staff
             in the public service, relying on established procedures for the selection and
             training of civil servants, especially for those appointments that are “vulnerable
             to corruption.” (§7(1)) The same treaty provision also includes a requirement
             for each State Party to implement education and training programs to “enhance
             awareness of the risks of corruption.”

         8.	 Institute legal recourse for procurement violations. Under UNCAC, each State
             Party commits to create a public procurement system based on transparency,
             competition, and objective selection criteria with “legal recourse and remedies”
             for violations and to allow for public access to procurement information (§9(1)).

         9.	 Strengthen judicial integrity. Further, each State Party commits to adopt
             measures to maintain an independent judiciary, as well as to strengthen the
             integrity and to prevent opportunities for corruption among members of the
             judiciary (§11(1)).

         10.	 Promote private sector integrity. Also, each State Party to UNCAC commits
              to: (i) take measures to prevent corruption involving the private sector; (ii)
              enhance accounting and auditing standards in the private sector; and (iii)
              implement penalties and prohibit corrupt financial practices (§12).

         11.	 Deter and detect all forms of money laundering. UNCAC obliges State Parties
              to take measures to prevent money laundering in their respective jurisdictions
              by instituting comprehensive regulatory frameworks for the prevention of
              money laundering as well as creating financial intelligence units to receive,
              analyze, and disseminate reports of suspicious transactions (§14).

         12.	 Criminalize six (optionally eight) practices. Each State Party to UNCAC
              commits to criminalize under its municipal law the following six practices: (i)
              bribery of national public officials (§15); (ii) active bribery of foreign public
              officials (§16, para. 1); (iii) embezzlement, misappropriation and other diversion
              of property (§17); (iv) laundering of proceeds of crime (§23); (v) obstruction of
              justice, including of investigations (§25 and §29); and (vi) participation in the
              above offences (§27, para. 1). In addition, UNCAC encourages State Parties to
              consider criminalizing: passive bribery of foreign public officials (§16); trading

          in influence (§18); abuse of functions (§19); illicit enrichment (§20); bribery in
          the private sector (§21); embezzlement of property in the private sector (§22);
          and concealment (§24 and §27(2)(3)). UNCAC, however, does not define the
          term ‘illicit enrichment’ other than to elaborate through an illustration (§20).

Open Government Partnership
Established pursuant to the Open Government Declaration of 2011, the Open
Government Partnership (OGP) consists of 44 States that have “delivered” their OGP
commitments under the said partnership arrangement as well as 12 other States that
are in the process of doing so.

The aim of the Open Government Declaration is to “increase the availability of infor-
mation about governmental activities”, “support civic participation”, and “implement
the highest standards of profession integrity throughout [its] administrations”.

    13.	 Develop an Action Plan. Participating States in OGP pledge to deliver country
         action plans that elaborate concrete commitments on open government. The
         commitments are structured around: improving public services, increasing
         public integrity, more effectively managing public resources, creating safer
         communities, and increasing corporate accountability. States report on their
         progress and cooperate with the independent reporting mechanism. The
         minimum eligibility criteria for States to join OGP listed below.


                                                                                                                           63

         14.	 Have an access to information law. The law should guarantee the public’s right
              to information and ensure that access to government data remains essential to
              the spirit and practice of open government.

         15.	 Disclose assets and income. The law should develop rules that require
              public disclosure of income and assets for elected and senior public officials
              as an essential element in the country’s efforts for anti-corruption and open,
              accountable government.

         16.	 Provide access to civil society in policy making. States must provide openness
              to citizen participation and engagement in policymaking and governance,
              including basic protections for civil liberties.

         17.	 Earn a minimum score. States can earn a total of 16 points for their performance
              against the OGP minimum standards of open government. In order to
              participate in OGP, each State must score at least 75% of the total possible
              points available to it (e.g. 12 out of 16, or 9 out of 12). Using the 2010 Economist
              Intelligence Unit (EIU) Democracy Index’s Civil Liberties sub-indicator, where
              10 is the highest and 0 is the lowest score (with 4 points accorded to States
              scoring above 7.5, 3 points to States scoring above 5, 2 points to States scoring
              above 2.5, and 0 points otherwise), an independent group of experts oversees
              the minimum criteria for each State’s participation in OGP to ensure that all
              OGP participating States remain in good standing and that the performance
              measures are up to date.

     OECD Anti-Bribery Convention

     The OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International
     Business Transactions was adopted in 1999, and signed by all OECD countries as
     well as by five non-OECD countries (see Table 3). Unlike UNCAC, the OECD Anti-
     Bribery Convention criminalizes bribery of foreign officials and prohibits accounting
     manipulation (see below). The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) of 1977 and
     the U.K. Bribery Act contain broadly consistent provisions. For the OECD Convention,
     the OECD Working Group on Bribery has established a peer-driven monitoring
     mechanism.

     A. Criminalize and sanction bribery of foreign officials. State Parties commit to
     criminalize the: (i) bribery of a foreign official, regardless of whether undertaken
     directly or through an intermediary (§1(1)); (ii) incitement, aiding and abetting,
     or authorization of bribery (§2); and (iii) attempt and conspiracy to bribe (§1(2)).
     These crimes are also predicate offenses (i.e. the underlying primary offence) for
     money laundering (§7). The term ‘Officials’ is defined as persons holding a legislative,
     administrative or judicial office, as well as persons in a public enterprise and those
     employed with an international organization (§1(4)). Sanctions to be meted out under
     the Convention must be comparable to those of domestic bribery (§3(1)), and the
     municipal laws of State Parties should contain provisions for the seizure, confiscation,
     or that monetary sanctions should be comparable to the effect of the bribery (§3(3)).

     B. Prohibit and penalize accounting manipulation. State Parties also commit to
     “prohibit the establishment of off-the-books accounts, the making of off-the books or
     inadequately identified transactions, the recording of non-existent expenditures, the
     entry of liabilities with incorrect identification of their object, as well as the use of false
     documents… for the purpose of bribing of officials or of hiding such bribery.” (§8)

     AU Convention on Corruption

     The African Union (AU) Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption entered
     into force in 2006, and facilitates State co-operation within the African region against
     corruption. It also aims at harmonizing regional anti-corruption policies and legislation.
     Like UNCAC, the AU Convention covers both public and private sector corruption,
     and establishes corruption a predicate offence of money laundering, while prohibiting


66
                                                              International Anti-Corruption Initiatives



the use of bank secrecy laws or practices as a shield against investigations of corruption.
A total of 31 of the 53 AU states have ratified the AU Convention, while 22 have not (see
Table 4). In contrast to UNCAC, the AU Convention adds the following key provisions.

A. Make “illicit enrichment” an offense. First, unlike UNCAC, the AU Convention
has a definition of the term ‘illicit enrichment’, postulating that the said term refers to
significant increase in the assets of a public official or any other person which he or
she cannot reasonably explain in relation to his or her income (§1). Secondly, the AU
Convention places a treaty obligation on all State Parties to adopt measures—subject to
their domestic laws—to establish “an offence of illicit enrichment” (§8(1)), which “shall
be considered an act or corruption or a related offense” (§8(2))

B. Declare and monitor asset disclosures. Public officials are required to “declare their
assets at the time of assumption of office, during and after their term of office” (§7(1)).
In addition, the State Parties commit to “create an internal committee or similar body
to monitor its implementation, and sensitize and train public officials on matters of
ethics” (§7(2)).

C. Develop investigative procedures. In order to keep up with technology and
increase efficiency, the State Parties commit to developing “disciplinary measures and
investigation procedures in corruption and related offenses” (§7(3)).

D. Outlaw illegally acquired funds for political financing. Each State Party commits
to adopt legislation to “proscribe the use of funds acquired through illegal and corrupt
practices to finance political parties” (§10(a)) and to “incorporate “transparency into
funding of political parties” (§10(b)).

E. Combat corruption in and by the private sector. The State Parties to the AU
Convention commit further to “adopt legislative and other measures to prevent and
combat acts of corruption… in the private sector” (§11(1)), in particular to “prevent
companies from paying bribes to win tenders” (§11(3)). They also commit to encourage
the sector’s participation “in the fight against unfair competition, respect of the tender
procedures and property rights” (§11(2)).

F. Enable civil society to hold governments accountable. Closely related to the
foregoing, the State Parties undertake to “create an enabling environment that will
enable civil society and the media to hold governments … accountable” (§12(2))
as well as to ensure their participation “in the monitoring of the implementation of
this Convention.” (§12(3)) The media will be given “access to information in cases
of corruption and related offenses” as long as such access does not “adversely affect
investigations and the right to a fair trial.” (§12(4))



                                                                                                          67

                                               Tunisia


     In addition to the AU Convention, a number of African countries have adopted the
     Economic Community of West African States Protocol on the Fight against Corruption
     and the Southern African Development Community Protocol against Corruption. These
     conventions largely reiterate the commitments made under UNCAC and the AU
     Convention.

     Inter-American Convention against Corruption

     The Organization of American States (OAS) Convention against Corruption entered
     into force in 1997. The Convention represents a regional consensus on what State Parties
     should do in the areas of prevention, criminalization, international cooperation and
     asset recovery. The Convention has been ratified by all OAS members except one (see
     Table 5).

     A. Establish “illicit enrichment” as an offense. Subject to its Constitution, each
     State Party commits to establish “as an offense a significant increase in the assets of a
     government official that he cannot reasonably explain in relation to his lawful earnings
     during the performance of his functions.” (§IX)

     B. Punish and prevent bribery of foreign officials. State Parties agree also to “prohibit
     and punish” the bribery of foreign officials (§VIII) and to establish “mechanisms to
     ensure that publicly held companies and other types of associations maintain books
     and records which, in reasonable detail, accurately reflect acquisition and disposition



68
                                                             International Anti-Corruption Initiatives



of assets, and have sufficient internal accounting controls to enable their officer to
detect corrupt acts.” (§III(10))

C. Define related acts as offenses. State Parties undertake to consider criminalizing:
(i) the “improper use” by a governmental official of “classified and confidential
information” obtained in the course of his work (§XI(1a)); (ii) “improper use” of
“any kind of property belonging to the State or to any firm or institution in which the
State has a proprietary interest” (§XI(1b)); (iii) obtaining of a decision from a public
authority whereby he or she illicitly obtains for himself, herself or another person any
benefit or gain” (§XI(1c)); and (iv) diversion of any movable or immovable property,
monies or securities belonging to the State (§XI(1d)).

D. Require officials to report corruption. State Parties agree also to consider “requiring
government officials to report to appropriate authorities acts of corruption in the
performance of public functions” (§III(1)) and to establish “mechanisms to enforce
these standards of conduct.” (§III(2))

E. Register officials’ income and assets. State Parties commit to consider adopting
“systems for registering the income, assets and liabilities of persons who perform public
functions in certain posts as specified by law and, where appropriate, for making such
registrations public.” (§III(4))

F. Deter corruption in revenue collection. State Parties agree to consider adopting
“revenue collection and control systems that deter corruption” (§III(6)) and “deny[ing]
favorable tax treatment for any individual or corporate for expenditures made in
violations of the anticorruption laws”. (§III(7))

G. Encourage civil society participation. State Parties commit further to consider
adopting “mechanisms to encourage participation by civil society and nongovernmental
organizations in efforts to prevent corruption.” (§III(11))




                                                                                                         69

     ADB and OECD Anti-Corruption Initiative

     The Anti-Corruption Action Plan for Asia and the Pacific is the main instrument of
     the Asian Development Bank (ADB) / OECD Anti-Corruption Initiative. The Action
     Plan, agreed upon in 2001, defines the  participating countries’ objectives in building
     sustainable legal and institutional frameworks for fighting corruption. The Plan
     constitutes a non-binding framework, and has been endorsed by 29 States (see Table 6).

     In contrast to UNCAC, the Anti-Corruption Action Plan for Asia and the Pacific is
     not only a non-binding document, but it also does not cover corruption involving the
     private sector. The Action Plan focuses mainly on setting forth principles and standards
     for policy reform in the area of anti-corruption in the Asian-Pacific States.

A. Institute job rotation. Develop “personnel systems that include regular and timely
rotation of assignments to reduce insularity that would foster corruption.” (ACAP,
Pillar 1)

B. Promote disclosure and monitoring of assets. Establish “systems to promote
transparency through disclosure and/or monitoring of, for example, personal assets
and liabilities.” (ACAP, Pillar 1)

C. Ensure officials report corruption. Institute “measures which ensure that officials
report acts of corruption…” (ACAP, Pillar 1)

D. Conduct public awareness campaigns. Initiate “public awareness campaigns at
different levels.” (ACAP, Pillar 3)

E. Prepare education programs. “Prepar[e] and/or implement… education programs
aimed at creating an anti-corruption culture.” (ACAP, Pillar 3)

F. Provide access to a variety of information. Establish “measures and systems to
provide timely reporting on performance and decision making” as well as “application
processing procedures, funding of political parties and electoral campaigns and
expenditure.” (ACAP, Pillar 1)

G. Involve NGOs in monitoring. Involve “NGOs in monitoring of public sector
programmes and activities.” (ACAP, Pillar 3)

H. Strengthen accountability institutions. “Enhanc[e] institutions for public scrutiny
and oversight” (ACAP, Pillar 1) and empower them “to order that bank, financial or
commercial records be made available or be seized and that bank secrecy be lifted.”
(ACAP, Pillar 2)

I. Reduce “red tape” for businesses. Simplify “the regulatory environment by
abolishing overlapping, ambiguous or excessive regulations that burden business.”

     Council of Europe Convention on Corruption

     The Council of Europe (CoE) Criminal Law Convention on Corruption has been signed
     by all CoE Member States as well as Belarus, Canada, the Holy See, Japan, Mexico,
     and the US (see Table 7). This convention entered into force in 2002 and has since
     been complemented by the Additional Protocol to the Criminal Law Convention on
     Corruption (2003) and the Civil Law Convention on Corruption (2003). The ratification
     of these conventions signals States’ commitment to incorporate the conventions in
     their respective laws.

     A. Institute corporate liability for corruption offences. State Parties must enact
     domestic legislation for corporate liability regarding corruption offenses committed
     by officers of a company (legal person) for their benefit, acting either individually or
     as part of an organ of the company, as long as such individual “has a leading position
     within the legal person, based on: (i) a power of representation of the legal person; or
     (ii) an authority to take decisions on behalf of the legal person; or (iii) an authority to
     exercise control within the legal person.” (CoE Criminal Law Convention §I8.2)

     B. Enable victims of corruption to sue. State Parties are to provide in municipal law
     the right to initiate an action in order to obtain full compensation for and by persons
     who have suffered damage as a result of the alleged corruption. Such compensation
     can cover material damage, loss of profits and non-pecuniary loss (CoE Civil Law
     Convention §3).

C. Invalidate corrupted contracts. Also, each State Party is to provide in its municipal
law for any contract or clause of a contract providing for corruption to be null and
void as well as “for the possibility for all parties to a contract whose consent has been
undermined by an act of corruption to be able to apply to the court for the contract to
be declared void, notwithstanding their right to claim for damages.” (CoE Civil Law
Convention §8)

Like the African region, the European region has several other anti-corruption
conventions and protocols. These include:

   ■■   Model Code of Conduct for Public Officials covering such issues as conflict of
        interests, outside interests, background checks prior to hiring, duty to complain,
        treatment of confidential information and addressing improper offers.
   ■■   Agreement Establishing the Group of States against Corruption (GRECO),
        which in effect is a monitoring mechanism for the above conventions.
   ■■   Twenty Guiding Principles for the Fight against Corruption are quite general,
        but add new dimensions compared to UNCAC, e.g., a call for a code of conduct
        for elected representatives, rules on political financing, research on corruption,
        and the need to take into account ties with money laundering and organized
        crime.
   ■■   Framework decision on combating corruption in the private sector 2003
        aims at ensuring that both active and passive corruption in the private sector as
        criminal offences incur effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties.
   ■■   Convention on the Fight against Corruption involving Officials 2005 requires
        Member States to ensure that any conduct constituting an act of passive or active
        corruption as well as participating in and instigating these acts is punishable by
        criminal penalties.
   ■■   Convention on the Protection of the European Communities’ Financial
        Interests 2002 requires that each State Party takes the necessary measures to
        tackle fraud affecting the financial interests of the European Communities as

             well as ensures that participating in, instigating or attempting such conduct,
             are punishable by effective, proportionate and dissuasive criminal penalties.
             The Convention adds that, in cases of serious fraud, the penalties must include
             custodial sentences that can give rise to extradition.
