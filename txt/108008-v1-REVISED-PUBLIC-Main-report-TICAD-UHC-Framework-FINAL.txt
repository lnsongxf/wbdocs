Why Invest in UHC?




Investment in Africa’s health systems is key to inclusive and sustainable growth.

Strong economic growth in recent years has helped reduce poverty to 43 percent of the population.
Yet, as Africa’s population expands—it is estimated to reach 2.5 billion by 2050—the region faces a critical
challenge of creating the foundations for long-term inclusive growth. Many countries still contend with
high levels of child and maternal mortality, malnutrition is far too common, and most health systems are
not able to deal effectively with epidemics and the growing burden of chronic diseases, such as diabetes.
These challenges call for renewed commitments and accelerated progress toward Universal Health
Coverage (UHC)—the principle that everyone receives needed health services without financial hardship.

Investing in UHC pays off.

The primary reason for investing in UHC is a moral one: it is not acceptable that some members of
society should face death, disability, ill health or impoverishment for reasons that could be addressed at
limited cost. However, UHC is also a good investment. Prevention of malnutrition and ill health is likely
to have enormous benefits in terms of longer and more productive lives, higher earnings, and averted
health care costs. Effectively meeting demand for family planning will accelerate the fertility transition,
which in turn will result in higher rates of economic growth and more rapid poverty reduction. And strong
health and disease surveillance systems halt epidemics that take lives and disrupt economies. In 2015,
the forgone economic growth due to Ebola amounts to more than a billion US$ in the three countries hit
by the epidemic.

  UHC in Africa:
  Progress and Challenges



     Health expenditure in Africa have increased significantly, but domestically financed government
     spending has stalled.

     Total health expenditure has grown rapidly over the last two decades, in particular in middle-income
     countries. But this increase has been driven mainly by out-of-pocket spending by households and
     development assistance, about half of which was earmarked spending for HIV/AIDS. In contrast,
     government spending on health as a share of total government spending has decreased in half of the
     countries in the region (figure 1). Only four countries met the Abuja target of 15 percent of general
     government spending in 2014. Limited commitment of domestic resources is often reflected in shortages
     of critical inputs such as human resources for health and pharmaceuticals.

     Coverage of key health services has increased but critical gaps remain.

     Africa has seen rapid improvement in coverage of insecticide treated bed nets for children, which
     accounts for an important share of the decline in child mortality. Other indicators related to maternal and
     child health services, such as antenatal care and skilled birth attendance have also improved. Yet, wide
     disparities remain within countries, and coverage gaps remain large for many critical services. Access
     to HIV, TB, and malaria services also remains uneven and is lower than for other core indicators of UHC
     progress. Progress has also been slow in the case of improved water and sanitation, and the region is far
     from reaching the 2030 Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) basic essential health services objective of
     80 percent population coverage.

     Millions of Africans fall into poverty due to high out-of-pocket health payments.

     Financial protection is generally low in Africa, requiring most patients to pay for health services from
     their own household income, so-called out-of-pocket (OOP) payments. Patients in low-income and
     lower-middle-income countries are less protected against high OOP than those in higher-middle-income
     countries. Out-of-pocket payments have increased in nearly all countries, and the regional average has
     increased from US$15 per capita in 1995, to US$38 in 2014. As a result, 11 million Africans are falling
     into poverty every year due to high out-of-pocket payments. Protecting people against the impoverishing
     effect of health payments is a cornerstone of UHC and will help prevent poverty in Africa.

Accelerating Progress toward UHC:
Opportunity, Directions and the
Way Forward


Accelerating progress toward UHC in Africa is within reach but will require political leadership and a
clear strategic vision.

Most African countries have integrated UHC as a goal in their national health strategies. Countries that
achieve their UHC targets by 2030 will eliminate preventable maternal and child deaths, strengthen
resilience to public health emergencies, reduce financial hardship linked to illness, and strengthen the
foundations for long-term economic growth. Yet, progress in translating commitments to UHC into
expanded domestic resources for health, effective development assistance, and ultimately, equitable and
quality health services, and increased financial protection has been slow.

There is no one-size-fits-all approach to achieving UHC—strategies will depend on local
circumstance and national dialogue.

Despite the great diversity of African countries, many are facing common challenges. This framework
proposes a set of actions for countries and stakeholders involved in the UHC process. It is intended to
stimulate action by demonstrating that progress toward UHC is not only possible, it is also essential.

During the past 15 years, many parts of Africa1 have experienced rapid economic growth
and impressive poverty reduction.

Between 2001 and 2014, gross domestic product (GDP) grew by five percent per year in real terms,
compared to just over two percent during the 1980s and 1990s (International Monetary Fund 2016).
Economic growth has contributed to poverty reduction in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) as the percentage of
the population living below the international poverty line dropped from 57 percent in 1990, to 43 percent
in 2015 (World Bank and International Monetary Fund 2016). Progress has been uneven, reflecting
conflict and instability in parts of the continent. Yet, despite weakness in the global economy, strong
domestic demand, improved macroeconomic management, and dynamic business environments are
keeping the promise of an African renaissance alive.

Africa has also seen impressive gains in health outcomes.

Between 1990 and 2015, Sub-Saharan Africa and North Africa experienced child mortality reductions of
54 and 67 percent respectively (UNICEF 2015) (figures A1 and A2). During the same period, the maternal
mortality ratio (MMR) fell by 45 percent in SSA, and 59 percent in NA. The number of AIDS-related deaths
decreased significantly between 2010 and 2015 in SSA, the most affected region (from 1.13 to 0.8
million) (UNAIDS 2016b). This progress reflects substantial expansion of key maternal and child health
interventions, as well as significant improvements in prevention efforts, and access to HIV/AIDS treatment
across most African countries. Economic growth has been an important enabler of this progress, but
many countries have made important health gains despite economic headwinds (figures A3 and A4).

Although there has been progress, many countries face large, unmet health needs, and pressures
on health systems are expected to increase.

In many African countries, reductions in child and maternal mortality fell short of the Millennium
Development Goals (MDG) targets and achieving the SDG targets represents a daunting challenge
(figure A5). Moreover, the prevalence of HIV/AIDS and malnutrition remains stubbornly high. Globally
new HIV infections have stagnated at 2.5 million a year three quarters of which are in SSA. Furthermore
health disparities along economic, social, geographic, gender, and ethnic lines remain unacceptably large
(Heaton et al. 2016). There are also other important emerging agendas. The recent Ebola and yellow
fever outbreaks in Africa highlighted the vulnerability of countries to public health emergencies. Chronic
non-communicable diseases are growing at an alarming pace, and present a challenge in terms of both
prevention and treatment. These challenges are emerging in a context of high fertility and population
growth: current United Nations estimates suggest that Africa’s population will expand from 1.2 billion in
2015, to 2.5 billion in 2050.

Progress toward Universal Health Coverage (UHC) is critical to promote equity, basic rights, and
human security in health, but it will also bring significant economic gains.

Many countries in Africa have shown impressive leadership on the health agenda, underpinned by
commitments under the MDGs and, more recently the SDGs. The commitment to UHC – the idea that
everyone should receive the health services that they need without financial hardship – is based on the
recognition of the intrinsic value of health and the right to health. Put more simply, it is not acceptable
that some members of society should face death, disability, ill health or impoverishment for reasons that
could be addressed at limited cost. However, UHC is also a good economic investment. Prevention of
malnutrition and ill health is likely to have enormous benefits in terms of longer and more productive
lives, higher earnings, and averted health care costs. Safeguarding against impoverishment due to
medical spending will contribute to social stability which is prerequisite of sustained economic growth.
Effectively meeting demand for family planning will accelerate the fertility transition, which in turn will result
in higher rates of economic growth and more rapid poverty reduction. Stronger health systems that are
able to prevent, detect, and respond effectively to pandemics or other public health emergencies can
dramatically reduce the disruptions and economic costs of such events. And access to health services
at affordable costs help reduce the financial hardship related to illness and contributes to social cohesion
and poverty reduction. Finally, the health sector is increasingly contributing directly to economic growth
and job creation. In short, UHC is not merely a social equalizer, but also a sound investment in human
capital, health security, and a driver for employment creation in the health sector.

Increasingly, UHC is a political imperative as citizens in the region expect improved access to and
quality of health services.

Given what is at stake, it is not surprising that health is a prominent political issue in countries across the
world. Africa is not an exception. The most recent Afrobarometer opinion poll, which was conducted in
36 African countries, highlighted the importance assigned to health by the African population. Similar to
opinion polls from other continents, the survey painted a picture of significant frustration and concern
with health systems in the region. Respondents noted long wait times, high costs, a lack of respect from
providers, and high levels of foregone care when they or family members experience illness or injury.
Health is consistently identified as one of the top challenges that African countries face, and was rated
as one of the top two priorities for more government spending in 27 out of 29 countries in the 2014/15
Afrobarometer survey.

This document provides a framework for action toward UHC in Africa.

It highlights progress in expanding coverage of key health services, protecting against the financial risk
from health care payments and enhancing health security over the last couple of decades. Although there
have been notable gains, enormous challenges remain. There is no blueprint for how these challenges
should be addressed – countries will need to chart their own course based on country-led strategies
or roadmaps that reflect the needs, aspirations, and constraints of the diverse set of countries in the
region. Yet, African leaders have made shared commitments to UHC through the SDG process, as well
as through regional bodies and declarations, and national policies and legislation.2 Building on these
commitments, this framework is intended to stimulate action by demonstrating that progress toward UHC
is not only possible, it is also essential.

Progress toward UHC is measured by the coverage of key services or interventions and
financial protection.

The UHC monitoring framework, developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World
Bank (WB), covers promotion, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and palliation services for maternal,
neonatal and nutritional diseases. It also assesses protection against financial hardship caused by high
OOP, using the incidence of catastrophic payments and of impoverishing expenditures (World Health
Organization and World Bank Group 2014).3 Indicators on health system capacity (e.g. infrastructure,
human resources or pandemic preparedness) and the amount of financial resources dedicated to health
are also critical in understanding progress toward UHC.

    Health Expenditures Have Increased
    Despite Stagnant Government Financing



    Between 1995 and 2014, total health expenditure (THE) per capita (at 2011 PPP factors) has
    increased on average from US$113 to US$306

    Currently, total health expenditure in Africa is on par with that of low-income countries worldwide.
    However, regional averages hide substantial heterogeneity across the continent, and the degree of
    inequality in total health spending across countries has increased over time (figure 2). On average, THE
    has grown more rapidly than GDP—five percent per year over the last two decades, compared to two
    percent for GDP (figure A6). As a result, THE as a share of GDP has increased from five percent in 1995
    to six percent in 2014 (figure A7), albeit with significant variation across countries.

        Government spending on health has grown slowly and is far from the aspirational goals of the
        Abuja Declaration.

       In 2014, government revenue as a share of GDP, ranged from 10.5 percent (Nigeria) to 60.5 percent
       (Lesotho) in Africa. Relatively low levels of government revenues in many countries (figure 3) result in
       low government health spending. Most countries in the region committed to increase public health
       spending to at least 15 percent of the government’s budget through the 2001 Abuja Declaration.
       However, between 2002 and 2014, the share of government spending allocated to health decreased
       in about half of African countries. Only four countries were above the Abuja target in 2014, even
       though some development assistance for health (DAH) is included in estimates of government
       spending 4 (figure 4). None of the five countries that achieved the 15 percent target in 2002 were able
       to maintain the target level of domestic health spending.

 There has been significant growth in development assistance for health amidst growing concerns
 about sustainability, effectiveness and the displacement of domestic financing for health.

 DAH in Africa grew rapidly in recent decades (figure 5). The growth in DAH to the region has been driven
 in large part by spending on HIV/AIDS and malaria. The share of DAH allocated to HIV/AIDS rose from
 seven percent of total DAH in 1990, to a peak of 54 percent in 2010. Similarly, DAH for malaria increased
 from one percent of THE in 1990, to 13 percent in 2010 (figure 6). However, at the same time as DAH has
 increased in Africa, domestic spending has stalled, particularly in low-income countries (LICs). As a result,
 the share of DAH in total health spending has increased from 20 percent in 2000, to 35 percent in 2014
 in LICs 5 (figure 7), raising concerns that DAH may be substituting for domestic resources (i.e. fungibility)
 (Dieleman, Graves, and Hanlon 2013) as well as questions amongst development partners about the
 effectiveness and the long-term sustainability of DAH-funded priorities. Direct funding for health systems
 strengthening also has not increased during that period.

Service Delivery Capacity has Expanded,
But Not Sufficiently to Meet Current and
Future Needs


Health professionals are the most critical input in the delivery of health services.

The density of health workers is a good proxy for a country’s capacity to deliver health services. The
shortage of skilled health workers has been a consistent bottleneck to achieving UHC across the
continent, and is particularly severe in SSA. SSA supports 24 percent of the global disease burden
but only maintains 3 percent of the global health work force (World Health Organization 2006). The
estimated shortage of doctors, nurses, and midwives in WHO AFRO countries below the SDG Index
threshold (4.45 physicians, nurses and midwives per 1000 population) was about 2.7 million in 2013.
When all categories of health workers are included, the shortfall is estimated at 4.2 million. This total
shortfall is expected to increase to 6.1 million in 2030. Shortages of health workers at the country level
are exacerbated by severe imbalances in the density of skilled health workers: it is estimated that over
90 percent of pharmacists and dentists practice in urban areas, other cadres have similar distributions
(World Health Organization 2016a). Furthermore, accurate, updated, and nationally consistent information
on health workforce is not always available, highlighting the need for strengthening essential countrywide
information systems.

A diverse group of non-state health providers plays an active role in the UHC agenda.

About 40 percent of patients’ out-of-pocket spending for health goes to non-state health service providers,
including faith-based organizations, NGOs, not-for-profit institutions, and for-profit private providers. There
is increasing experience of realizing synergies and efficiencies between state and non-state provision of
healthcare. However, it has proven challenging for governments to provide the necessary stewardship
to scale up and sustain such partnerships. There are also a growing number of examples across the
continent of working with the private sector to influence markets in key commodities and medical
equipment as well as in distribution and maintenance. Finally many countries have started to successfully
contract out specific services such as transport and medical waste disposal to non-state sector.

Access to safe, affordable, and quality essential medicines and technologies remains a challenge.

Despite progress in some areas, access to medicines in Africa remains low. The availability of selected
medicines was found as low as 21 percent in the public and 22 percent in the private sector in some
African countries.6 Common challenges include high prices, inadequate financing, weak pharmaceutical
regulation, inadequate procurement and supply systems, limited access to information, and inappropriate
use. In addition, the region has an increasing circulation of counterfeit or substandard medical products
due to the weak performance of national regulatory authorities.7 When medicines are not covered
by health insurance or in public facilities, out-of-pocket payments can be significant and vulnerable
populations are exposed to financial hardship and impoverishment.

     Coverage of Key Health Services and
     Interventions: Mixed Progress



     There has been mixed progress on service coverage.

     For some critical health services and interventions, there has been impressive progress in both coverage
     and equity over the last couple of decades (figure 8). Most of the service coverage tracers remain
     concentrated toward the better-off population, but the degree of inequality declined slightly. The most
     rapid improvement has been the change in coverage of insecticide treated bed nets for children, which
     increased on average by about 15 percent per year between 2006 and 2014. All of the maternal health-
     related indicators have also improved over the past 20 years (figure 9). Antenatal care visits (at least
     four) and skilled birth attendance have also both increased from about 40 percent in 1990, to around
     60 percent in 2014. Wide disparities remain within countries especially for access to more complex
     interventions such as skilled birth attendants and treatment for severe illnesses. Even for more routine
     services such as immunizations, very few countries are achieving universal coverage.

      Gaps in access to essential HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria services remain important barriers to
      achieving UHC in many countries.

      SSince 2002, significant increases in coverage of critical health services for these diseases have occurred.
      Increases in coverage of prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV has resulted in a 60 percent
      reduction in new infections among children in Africa. By the end of 2015, programs supported by the
      Global Fund and other partners contributed to African countries providing 7.7 million patients with
      antiretroviral treatment, detecting and treating 4.2 million TB cases and purchasing more than 550 million
      insecticide treated bed nets. Improved access to AIDS treatment has resulted in a 36 percent decrease in
      AIDS related deaths since 2010 in Eastern and Southern Africa (ESA). However, access to HIV, TB, and
      malaria services remains uneven and lower than for other core indicators of UHC progress (figure A8).
      For example, in ESA, approximately 56 percent of People living with HIV have been diagnosed, and 54
      percent of them are on treatment compared to 36 percent and 28 percent diagnosed and on treatment
      respectively in West Africa and 36 percent and 17 percent diagnosed and on treatment respectively in
      North Africa (UNAIDS 2016a).

Access to improved water sources and sanitation has increased, although at a slow pace over the
past two decades.

The trend in access to improved water sources has only slightly improved in Africa between 1991 and
2014 (by about 0.9 percent per year on averag). The trend in access to improved and unshared sanitation
has increased at a faster pace around 2.5 percent annually (figure A9 and A10). Once again, positive
trends for the continent as a whole hide important differences across economic groups, sub-regions and
countries. Overall, the region is far from reaching the 2030 SDG basic essential health services objective
of 80 percent population coverage.

Poor quality of health care undermines UHC in many countries.

Poor quality 8 of care costs lives and wastes scarce resources. Significant deficits in essential drugs
and medical equipment availability, and in the knowledge and practices of frontline health workers are
highlighted in recent Service Delivery Indicator (SDI) surveys (page 23). Achieving SDG mortality targets will
not be possible unless quality gaps in a broader range of interventions are addressed.

Key Findings of the Service Delivery
Indicators Initiative



Comparable data on quality of care in African countries are extremely limited. To help fill this
information gap, a program of nationally representative Service Delivery Indicator (SDI) surveys have
been implemented to measure three aspects of health services that can influence quality of care at the
frontline: (i) health workers’ absenteeism and case load; (ii) the availability of key infrastructures and
inputs for health workers to do their work; and (iii) health workers’ knowledge (as measured by clinical
vignettes). As of June 2016, SDI surveys have been conducted in nine African countries and data is
currently available for seven countries (table 1).

In the surveyed countries, the level of health workers’ absenteeism is high, ranging from 20 percent
(Senegal) to almost 50 percent (Uganda). For those who show up for work, their average caseload is
often low, between five and seven patients per day in Uganda, Tanzania, Togo, and Nigeria. Heath
workers’ ability to deliver care is also handicapped by the lack of other inputs such as essential drugs
and medical equipment. On average, in all the surveyed countries, except Senegal and Tanzania,
only half or less essential drugs are available in a health facility. In Uganda and Nigeria, only a fifth
of facilities meet the minimum requirements for medical equipment. In Nigeria, less than one in four
health facilities simultaneously have water, sanitation, and electricity. Finally, the indicators reveal
that health workers’ basic clinical knowledge is inadequate in many countries. Given the well-known
fact that health workers usually do much less than what they know (the “know-do” gap), the quality of
care is most likely even lower than the unfavorable results reflected in the knowledge testing.

     High and Rising Out-of-Pocket Spending
     is Contributing to Impoverishment



     Out-of-pocket spending on healthcare by households remains high in Africa.

     While the share of OOP over THE has decreased in most countries, the level of OOP has increased,
     and the need to strengthen domestic mechanisms for prepaid funding remains a priority for African
     health systems. In most countries in Africa, coverage through social health insurance and other forms of
     insurance is low. Government spending on health therefore represents the most important form of resource
     pooling for health services, and is a key means of promoting access and financial protection. However,
     due to low levels of government spending, a large share of the financial health burden falls on patients in
     the form of out-of-pocket payments for health services. In absolute terms, OOPs have increased in nearly
     every country in the region, from US$15 in 1995, to US$38 in 2014 (constant US$). Given that THE has
     increased at a more rapid rate over the same period, in most cases driven by increases in DAH, the share
     of OOPs in total health spending has declined, from 44 to 34 percent (figures 10 and 11).

      High and rising levels of OOPs represent a significant strain on households in Africa and are a major
      and growing cause of impoverishment.

      Based on household surveys conducted across African countries during the past 25 years (1990–2014),
      millions of households reported catastrophic and impoverishing health spending, with households in
      LMICs and LICs being more vulnerable than those in HMICs. On average, 3.2 percent of the population
      (ranging from 0.8 to 5.4 percent across countries) – 35 million individuals – experienced catastrophic
      health payments in a given year (figure 12a). Similarly, almost 1.2 percent of the population – roughly
      14.4 million people – in LICs and LMICs fell into poverty9 because of health payments during the survey
      year (figure 12b).10 The share of the population with catastrophic health payments (15 percent threshold)
      has increased from 1.2 to 5 percent over the last 25 years (figure A11), while available data suggest that
      the share of the population pushed into poverty as a result of health spending has also grown from 0.6
      percent in 1990 to 1.5 percent in 2014 (figure A12).

Shortcomings in Preparedness
for Public Health Emergencies



The risk to human security of not having sufficient capacity to respond to pandemics has
become paramount.

As witnessed in the last few years, outbreaks of Ebola, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS),
avian influenza and the Zika virus can devastate communities through loss of life and severe social and
economic impacts. The recent Ebola outbreak in western Africa showed how an epidemic can proliferate
rapidly in the absence of a strong health system that provides effective coverage of services not only
for the better-off, but also for rural populations and marginalized groups. Recent outbreaks have also
highlighted the importance of Essential Public Health Functions (EPHF) – the responsibility of the state to
improve, promote, protect, and restore the health of the population through collective action – as the most
cost-effective way to enhance population and individual health (World Health Organization 2016b). The
ability to address social and environmental determinants of health also contributes to the prevention of
public health emergencies.

Health system preparedness for public health emergencies is still in its infancy.

To date, Morocco is the only country on the continent that has conducted a EPHF assessment (Martin-
Moreno et al. 2016), which suggests serious lack of attention to public health on the continent. Also,
International Health Regulations (IHR) have a role in reducing the risk of emergencies and minimizing
their potential damage, but recent assessments highlight important shortcomings in IHR core capacity in
African countries.11 For example, a recently completed Joint External Evaluation (JEE) in Ethiopia identified
critical challenges in multi-sectoral engagement, integration of surveillance functions in human and animal
health systems, and strengthening of laboratory capacity.

The elimination of preventable maternal and child deaths, AIDS, TB, and other diseases in Africa
is within reach.

Recent analysis by the Lancet Commission on Global Health showed that countries that achieve their
UHC targets by 2035 will eliminate preventable maternal and child deaths – saving over 10 million women
and children (Jamison et al. 2013). The commission also showed that many low- and middle-income
countries already have the technology, experience and know-how to make UHC a realistic target for
Africa. At the same time, recent events, like the Ebola virus outbreak, emphasize that the cost of failure
is higher than ever. The lost economic output and direct costs for Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia
amounted to US$1.6 billion in 2015 alone (World Bank 2014).

There is no one-size-fits-all approach to achieving UHC – strategies will depend on local
circumstance and national dialogue.

Despite the great diversity of African countries, many are facing common challenges. This framework
proposes a set of actions for stakeholders involved in the UHC process. It focuses on five areas:

1   /	        Financing	
2   /	        Services	
3   /	        Equity

1   Financing:
    More and Better Spending
    and Effective Financial Protection


    KEY ACTIONS

    >>      Improve efficiency of public and private health spending for better outcomes and resource 		
            expansion

    >>     Increase government spending on health through budget re-allocation and increased
           domestic resource mobilization

    >>     Use budget resources to reduce financial barriers to health care and make services
           affordable to everyone

    >>      Ensure that the poor, and the informal sector benefit from pre-payment schemes, and that
            providers get a fair deal

    >>      Improve the effectiveness of development assistance for health through improved
            coordination and use of country systems


    Gains in the efficiency of public and private health spending will be critical to improve outcomes
    and expand resources over time.

    Many health systems in Africa are characterized by significant inefficiencies.12 In a context of tightening
    fiscal space, the health sector will have to increase and demonstrate efficiency and improved health
    outcomes to advocate for additional resources. Key approaches for improving technical and allocative
    efficiency are well established. They include allocating resources toward services and inputs that generate
    better results at lower cost, pooling of funds, increasing transparency and accountability, introducing
    strategic purchasing, and strengthening managerial capacities at both government and facility level.
    In some contexts, there may be opportunities to expand resources for health and other priorities by
    identifying inequitable budget items, such as fuel and food subsidies.

Sustained progress toward UHC will depend on improved domestic resource mobilization.

As populations in most countries continue to expand, demand for health services and health
expenditures are expected to grow. Moreover, health systems will need to meet changing health needs,
including chronic non-communicable diseases. The United Nations (UN) Conference on Financing for
Development agenda established in Addis Ababa in July 2015 called for domestic resource mobilization
as central to the SDG agenda (United Nations 2015). Countries agreed to an array of measures aimed
at widening the revenue base, improving tax collection, and combatting tax evasion and illicit financial
flows. Strengthening the tax administration will therefore be critical for financing UHC. Even modest
improvements would be significant. If developing countries could increase their revenue collection by two
to four percent of GDP, they would surpass the amount of development assistance currently received
(World Health Organization 2014). In the post-2015 period, increased “health taxes”, including tobacco
taxation, could represent an additional domestic revenue stream to help finance the SDGs.

DAH will likely remain important in parts of the region through 2030, but needs to be re-positioned
to better support countries’ efforts toward UHC.

During the Addis conference on financing for development, countries reaffirmed their commitment to
official development assistance and pledged to increase South-South cooperation. Most low-income
countries in Africa will require sustained DAH to continue to accelerate progress toward UHC, but DAH
must contribute to domestic resource mobilization rather than crowding it out (Evans and Pablos-
Méndez 2016). The policy convergence around domestic financing also increases the importance for
countries and partners to improve coordination of development assistance and expand the use of country
systems (page 32). Overall, five shifts in health financing are needed : value for money, domestic revenue
generation, innovation, integration and fragility (Lie, Soucat, and Basu 2015).

Effective Development Cooperation:
Making it fit for
purpose in the SDGs


As levels of DAH increased during the MDG era (2000-2015), concerns about the effectiveness of
DAH due to fragmentation, lack of coordination, and use of parallel systems or approaches grew. Four
consecutive High Level Forums on Aid Effectiveness to enhance the effectiveness of development
cooperation took place in Rome (2003), Paris (2005), Accra (2008), and Busan (2011).

More specific to health, the International Health Partnership (IHP+) was established in 2007 to
foster more effective development cooperation to achieve the MDGs through giving priority to
national strategies and improving donor behaviours. IHP+ today has 66 partners which agreed to
support comprehensive, country-led national health strategies in a well-coordinated way. Progress
on these behaviours has however been mixed, suggesting that aid effectiveness is a process that
requires persistence, sensitivity to context, and sustained effort (IHP+, 2015). IHP+ has started its
transformation process to the International Health Partnership for UHC 2030, which will broaden
its scope and membership. The Harmonization for Health in Africa (HHA) mechanism, which is
coordinating the action of development partners in Africa, will also be reshaped as part of the UHC
2030 partnership to ensure better coordination of technical assistance and policy advice to countries
as well as of health systems investments.

Corresponding with the IHP+ principles, and the new agenda on financing for development, there are
concerted efforts to develop more fit-for-purpose DAH. For example, the Global Financing Facility
for Every Women and Every Child (GFF) is a multi-stakeholder partnership that supports country-led
efforts by aligning DAH with explicit strategies on domestic resource mobilization for high impact
interventions. Development partners also increasingly support African countries’ UHC plan in their
respective areas of expertise. The Global Fund, for instance, is a key partner to achieve UHC targets
related to HIV, TB and malaria services.

Expanding pre-payment for health care is critical for eliminating impoverishing health expenditures
and achieve UHC.

High financial barriers for health services can have catastrophic consequences for households, either
because they end up forgoing care they need, or because they become indebted or impoverished.

There are different approaches to organize pre-payment for health care, but no silver bullet.

Countries differ in how funds for health care are collected (e.g. general tax revenues, earmarked taxes, or
mandatory of voluntary health insurance contributions), who manages the funding for health (e.g. Ministry
of Health, local governments, a single public agency, or multiple health insurance funds), and how health
services are paid for (e.g. budget allocations to government providers or payment to public and private
providers for specific services). In many countries, different models for financing health care co-exist –
for instance, government budgets to public facilities, social health insurance for formal sector workers,
and voluntary health insurance for the informal sector or the better-off. There is no single best way to
finance health care – each modality comes with its set of challenges, and contextual factors such as
administrative capacity and the extent of formalization of the labor market are important factors.

As countries try to expand pre-payment, it is critical to ensure that the poor and the informal sector
are included, and that providers get a fair deal.

One approach to reduce financial barriers is to abolish user fees. This approach has been tried in several
countries, and it can have important benefits. In Malawi, user fee exemptions led to increased maternal
health care utilization (Manthalu et al. 2016). In Zambia however, the elimination of user fees benefitted
richer groups only (Lagarde, Barroy, and Palmer 2012). Simply eliminating fees will be a short-lived
measure unless backed by government funding to replace forgone income and incentives from user
fees (Mathauer, Mathivet, and Kutzin 2016). Financial barriers can also be reduced through insurance
coverage. However, in order for insurance to be affordable for low-income groups, their enrollment will
need to be subsidized. Several countries have already been doing this, notably Ghana, Kenya, Morocco,
Rwanda, and Senegal. As a result, enrollment in pre-payment mechanisms has increased among low-
income groups in these countries, and access to care improved - an important step toward UHC. In
Ghana, the insured poor have greater access to health services, lower copayments, and better health
outcomes than the non-insured poor (Nguyen, Rajkotia, and Wang 2011).

Financing models that promote equity and inclusiveness are likely to put pressures on the
public purse.

Expanding coverage and financial protection will require country-tailored approaches using a combination
of supply and demand side financing. However, experience from the region and globally suggest that
the scope for broad-based and equitable coverage through traditional social health insurance or other
contributory mechanisms for the informal sector is limited in most countries. In those contexts, public
financing will be the main route to reduce reliance on out-of-pocket payments and expand coverage of
services and interventions, either through financing for the provision of care, or significant subsidies for
health insurance. Either way, expanding coverage of pre-payment across the population in a way that
ensures that service providers have sufficient resources to provide quality services will need to be backed
up by significant budgetary resources.

2   Services:
    People-Centered Services,
    Quality and Multisectoral Action


    KEY ACTIONS

    >>      Establish people-centered health services to improve quality of services and patient safety

    >>     Prioritize investments in community and primary health care services within the framework
           of viable local governance systems

    >>     Partner with civil society and non-state providers to expand access to key services and 	
           interventions

    >>      Invest in pre-service education, particularly in underserved areas

    >>      Engage in multisectoral action to address determinants of health


    Citizens are at the center of UHC

    With increasing interconnectivity, individuals are more aware of health issues than ever before. People-
    centered care13 can produce better outcomes and reduce costs by improving the quality of the
    relationship between health providers, patient and family.

    Countries can expand coverage and improve outcomes by strengthening community and primary
    care services

    Services should be organized within the framework of viable local governance systems such as health
    districts or equivalent structures. Today, technological innovations in diagnostics and treatments
    allow community and primary care workers to provide nearly all of the essential interventions required
    to substantially reduce preventable deaths for women and children. Countries that have invested in
    establishing a solid community health platform have achieved substantial drops in mortality. These
    community health models rely on various mechanisms of community empowerment in health service
    delivery including community ownership, community management, and community monitoring
    (pages 35 and 36). Scaling up a community-based and primary care workforce will require some level of
    affirmative action, e.g. selecting students from underserved areas and creating training facilities in those
    areas. Networks of competent community and primary care providers are currently being created in many
    settings across Africa. Major investment is needed to scale up skilled community-based health workers
    including doctors, nurses, midwives, assistant nurses, and other frontline health service providers.
    Supporting functions such as supportive supervision, mentoring, continuous professional education and
    referrals need to be strengthened for the community-based health workers to perform better, together
    with provision of adequate incentives.

       Scaling up of HRH:
       A Key Strategy to achieving Universal
       Health Coverage in Ethiopia


       In 2005, the Government of Ethiopia produced a national health strategy entitled “Health Sector
       Development Programme III.” This strategy identified health worker shortages and poor incentives
       as key bottlenecks to achieving MDGs 4, 5 and 6. Efforts to scale up health professionals in the
       cadres of health extension workers, midwives, doctors, health officers, and emergency obstetric
       surgeons, included:

1 /	   A collaboration between the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Education to produce more than
	      30,000 health extension workers (HEW) in five years.

2 /	   Establishing Integrated Refresher Training for HEWs to create sustained delivery capacity of
	      16 health service packages.

3 /	   Transforming selected hospitals into medical and health science training colleges; increasing
	      the number from five to 10.

4 /	   Improving human resource management and incentives.  

       The government demonstrated its commitment by creating fiscal space for salaries and health worker
       incentives in the priority cadres. Development partners also rallied behind the national strategy by
       supporting the health infrastructure, medical equipment, drugs and supplies.

       Almost five years after its initiation (in EFY 2002), Ethiopia has nearly 35,000 rural health extension
       workers staffing over 12,000 health posts in rural kebeles. An additional 3,400 urban health extension
       workers were deployed in urban centers. Ethiopia also expanded other cadres, including emergency
       surgery and obstetrics professionals and midwives.

       Ethiopia’s strategic investment in HRH has contributed to remarkable achievements in health
       outcomes. The Ethiopia Mini Demographic Health Survey (EMDHS) 2014 showed a steep increase in
       the contraceptive prevalence rate from 28.6 percent to 41.8 percent, and a decrease in total fertility
       rate from 4.8 to 4.1 children per woman.

The Community-Based
Health Planning and Services:
A key strategy toward UHC in Ghana


In Ghana, the Community-based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) strategy was adopted in
1999, based on the experiences of the Community Health and Family Planning Project launched in
Navrongo in 1994. This national strategy aims to improve geographical access to basic health care
by delivering essential PHC services at the community level, with planning and service delivery based
on community initiative. Its primary focus is to serve communities in deprived areas and bring health
services close to the community. CHPS involves mobilization of community leadership, systems for
decision-making, and the placement of frontline health staff – known as Community Health Officers
– with logistics support and a community volunteer system to support them. Key interventions at
community level include reproductive and child health services, family planning, health promotion and
control of communicable and non-communicable diseases. The district hospitals serve as referral
centres for these community level service delivery points.

The number of functional CHPS zones has steadily increased and has generated positive results. In
2016, the new national CHPS policy was launched to “attain the goal of reaching every community
with a basic package of essential health services toward attaining UHC and bridging the access
inequity gap by 2030.”
ACCELERATING PROGRESS TOWARD UHC

Innovative partnerships with the non-state sector can potentially be scaled up to accelerate UHC.

The private sector in Africa is very diverse, including for-profit organizations, not-for-profit, and faith-
based providers ranging from individual drug merchants to large corporations. As a recent Lancet series
summarized, government policies play a crucial role to support widespread availability of financially
accessible and competent providers, whether public or private, and hence ensure that services reach the
population as a whole (McPake and Hanson 2016). There are multiple examples of innovative partnerships
across the continent, ranging from social health franchises in East Africa, to contracting of specific
services in North Africa and social marketing of health commodities in West Africa. However moving from
promising initiatives to scaled up and cost effective programs has proven challenging. Ensuring good
quality services and products in the non-state sector will require investing in health governance, including
stronger regulatory framework, accreditation systems, and enforcement capacity.

Quality and patient safety is integral to UHC.

Approaches such as performance-based financing, clinical audits, quality improvement processes
and accreditation have shown that quality can be improved in a relatively short time, even in highly
constrained settings and without major additional investments in other health inputs. Achieving and
sustaining such gains requires additional policies that address some of the systems constraints. These
include common definition and monitoring of quality of care, strengthening professional associations
and regulatory bodies, increasing the voice of users, and more inclusive governance and accountability
systems for health facilities.

Access to affordable medicines and health products is critical for the provision of quality
health services.

Investments to enable countries’ strengthen their pharmaceutical systems are key for improving access
to quality assured medical products. Support is needed to develop and implement evidence-based
pharmaceutical policies, strategies, and plans; to create a mechanism for policy dialog to involve
stakeholders in the pharmaceutical sector, establish the cooperative regulation of medical products across
the region, build capacity in management and use of health products. Some innovations are currently
being tested: for example, the Global Fund developed an algorithm for more efficient use of technology,
offering explicit and specific combinations of 10 innovative detection technologies.

Improvements in health services should be complemented by multi-sectoral action to address
determinants of health.

Environmental and social factors influence individual and community health. Expanding access to clean
water and sanitation is paramount if further progress in health status is to be achieved. Addressing these
health challenges requires the collaboration of different sectors to increase knowledge, establish strong
partnerships, and drive innovation in addressing cross-cutting issues. The development of an Essential
Public Health Functions framework for the African region would be a first and essential step.

3   Equity:
    Targeting the Poor and Marginalized
    and Leaving No One Behind


    KEY ACTIONS

    >>      Target vulnerable populations and design programs tailored to their needs

    >>      Expand service delivery to marginalized groups and settings

    >>      Scale-up pro-poor interventions such as demand-side incentives, including vouchers
            and conditional cash-transfers

    >>      Ensure the rights and entitlements of women, children and minorities, particularly during
            vulnerable parts of the life course


    Appropriate targeting and design of interventions can help address the need of vulnerable
    population groups.

    Certain population groups such as displaced people, deep rural and peri-urban populations, and
    adolescent girls are consistently underserved. Expansion of primary health care services needs to be
    targeted to the most under-served geographic areas, and the design and implementation of programs
    tailored to meet the needs of specific vulnerable groups. This includes ensuring the availability and
    acceptability of key services for women, in particular during vulnerable parts of the life course, such as
    adolescence. Policy commitments, strong information systems, and fine-grained data and analysis will be
    critical components to meet the needs of population groups.

    Technology and operating models, and organizational insights can be particularly important for
    reaching marginalized groups.

    A mix of innovations in the way health services are delivered will be required to build a 21st century health
    care system in Africa. From e-learning nursing programs to the use of new diagnostic tools, countries
    across Africa are using new approaches to improve their health systems. More than 400 hospitals in
    Africa, mainly public, are now applying continuous quality improvement (CQI or kaizen) as an innovative
    means of realizing quality and efficient health service delivery. More than twenty countries in Africa have
    experimented with performance-based payment to incentivize greater productivity and quality of health
    services. Other strategies that have been tested include public and community information about life
    saving behavior (e.g. hand washing and nutritional practices), expansion of outreach services including
    mobile clinics and home visits, and the development of community-based services. Increased technology
    usage through mobile phones, social media, and traditional media, provide policy makers with a much
    wider set of channels to communicate effective behavioral interventions, especially for the poor (page 39).

    Conditional cash transfers (CCT) and other financial incentives for uptake of health services are
    increasingly common in Africa and can help expand access and outcomes for the poor.

    In Malawi, the introduction of a cash incentive doubled the number of individuals attending a Voluntary
    Counselling and Testing (VCT) center (Thornton 2008). In Uganda and Kenya, vouchers also led to
    promising results in the utilization of reproductive health services and health outcomes (Bellows, Bellows,
    and Warren 2011, Warren et al. 2011). Mobile payments can be used to target cash transfers and
    e-vouchers to the poor.

4   Preparedness:
    Strengthening
    Health Security


    KEY ACTIONS

    >>      Improve national preparedness plans including organizational structure of the government

    >>      Promote adherence to the International Health Regulations (IHR)

    >>      Utilize international framework for monitoring and evaluation of IHR

    >>      Enhance relevant partners’ and across countries’ collaboration to prepare for and respond
            to public health emergencies


    Investing in critical core public health functions is important in preventing and managing
    future pandemics.

    To date, two-thirds of countries worldwide, most of them in Africa, are not compliant with International
    Health Regulations and have not met their core capacities. Pandemic preparedness requires adequate
    institutional arrangements combined with actionable plans, strong multi-sectoral action, and resource
    mobilization. Enhancing collaboration among countries, relevant partners, and global initiatives including
    the programs by WHO and World Bank is crucial for building capacity in emergency preparedness,
    response, and recovery. Regional collaboration is needed to increase heath systems resilience beyond
    national borders, including strategic investment in highly specialized laboratories and surveillance
    networks to benefit the entire African continent.

    Financing is a critical element of the health security and preparedness agenda.

    The recent Ebola and yellow fever outbreaks highlighted the core responsibility of African governments to
    invest in financing public goods such as preparedness and response to epidemics. Currently, the WHO,
    with the support of the World Bank and other partners, is reorganizing its emergency programs to provide
    faster and more effective assistance to countries in cases of pandemic.

5   Governance:
    Political and Institutional
    Foundations for the UHC Agenda


    KEY ACTIONS

    >>      Establish platforms and processes to foster societal dialogue

    >>      Enhance effective mechanisms for inter-sectoral dialogue and action

    >>      Establish systematic monitoring and reporting on progress toward UHC

    >>     Ensure that all citizens have access to data and information on UHC, as part of societal
           dialogue and participatory processes

    >>      Strengthen national institutions and organizations to lead implementation of reforms for UHC


    Ensuring universal access and guaranteeing the right to health requires citizens to voice their
    choices in terms of public policy and priority setting.

    Universal Health Coverage is the outcome of a country-level social contract. Coalitions and coordination
    mechanisms are necessary to foster societal dialogue; ensure robust political commitments to UHC; and
    translate such commitments into funding, actions, multi-sectoral coordination and results. The National
    Conference on Health in Tunisia provides an instructive example of societal dialogue (top of page 42).
    Experience shows that this exercise must be as inclusive as possible involving grassroots community
    organizations, professional organizations, private sector providers, and academic institutions.

    Development and implementation of UHC strategies depend on effective mechanisms for inter-
    sectoral dialogue and action.

    Africa has made significant progress in this area since the joint Tunis Declaration of Ministers of Finance
    and Health (page 43). The activities of the joint Value for Money (VfM) program will have to be sustained
    and expanded, particularly with the Africa Union and regional economic communities.

    National capacity to generate and use high-quality data for measuring progress toward UHC is
    critical for accountability.

    Across Africa, there has been a data revolution in the health sector, and there are opportunities to build
    on this progress, expand operational research and learning, and increase accountability toward UHC.
    Through the Health Data Collaborative (HDC), countries, and other stakeholders, are capitalizing on such
    opportunities (bottom of page 42). While tracking of indicators is important, indicators can only describe
    change, not explain it. It is essential to build and institutionalize national capacities for applied policy
    research and evaluation, and to use findings in decision-making. As part of this process, countries are
    encouraged to formally adopt a core set of indicators to monitor UHC progress and incorporate them in
    national monitoring and evaluation systems. It is also important to ensure that all citizens have access
    to data and information on UHC, as part of societal dialogue and participatory processes. Moreover,
    systematic UHC monitoring also needs to be complemented by strong capacity in Ministries of Health in
    the areas of planning, finance and metrics.

Societal Dialogue in Tunisia:
Population Participation in
Health Policy-making


Tunisia made headlines when citizens engaged in civil resistance, leading to the “Arab Spring.” The
transition government of Tunisia decided that an in-depth population consultation was crucial to
capture people’s views, needs, and daily challenges. In 2012, a program called “societal dialogue”
was launched, with technical support from the WHO. The population consultation in Tunisia was done
with the simultaneous goals to capture population opinion, and provide people a new platform to
express themselves.

The first-ever ‘Citizens’ Estate General of Health’ (“Etats Généraux de la Santé”) was organized in the
24 Tunisian administrative regions. Citizens and civil society organizations shared key health sector
challenges, and their values, attitudes, and views on how to improve health services. Approximately
100 people, selected by lottery from each of the administrative regions, formed a “Citizens’ jury” (“Jury
Citoyens”) and were tasked with answering specific questions around these themes:

>>     Health system financing
>>     Neighbourhood health services
>>     Promoting healthy lifestyle choices
>>     Revitalizing and rebuilding confidence in the health sector

The population consultation events were captured in a “White Book”, the first, comprehensive health
sector diagnostic. It has served as a basis for the next five-year National Health Plan, which is being
discussed and finalized.

Launch of the Kenya Health
Data Collaborative (HDC)


The HDC is a joint effort by countries, development partners, civil society, and academia to strengthen
national health information systems, improve the quality of health data, and track progress toward
UHC and the other health-related SDGs. In 2016-17, Collaborative partners will respond to five to
eight country requests for engagement and joint action, through provision of technical support and
better alignment of financial support with national plans.

As one of the HDC’s pathfinder countries, Kenya launched its own HDC at the country level on May 18
in Nairobi. Kenya’s Ministry of Health has developed a roadmap for its Collaborative, which articulates
priority areas around strengthening its health information system. These include data analytics, quality
of care, civil registration and vital statistics, a new national health data observatory, and informatics.
The roadmap also outlines the roles and responsibilities from government, global and regional
partners, civil society, public health institutions and other stakeholders.

       The Value for Money (VfM)
       in Health Programme:
       A Call to do More with Less


       In July 2012, the African Development Bank (AfDB) hosted the Tunis Conference on Value for Money,
       Sustainability and Accountability in the Health Sector. The conference brought together 62 African
       Ministers of Finance and Health, together with heads of institutions, and CSOs for a high-level
       dialogue. The conference culminated in the Tunis Declaration on Value for Money, Sustainability
       and Accountability in the Health Sector, which is a call for collaboration between the two ministries,
       development partners, parliamentarians, and civil society to deliver equitable, efficient, and
       sustainable health services in Africa while ensuring accountability at all levels of the health system.

       To respond to the multifaceted and complex needs of countries to improve VfM in health sectors, and
       translate the Tunis Declaration into action, AfDB partnered with the WHO, the World Bank, and UN
       organizations (UNICEF, UNFPA and UNIFEM) with the support of NORAD and GAVI Alliance and set
       up a trust fund, of about US$6 million over five years, for VfM Program implementation.

       Targeting those who make the most difference with the right tools: The VfM Program targets key
       stakeholders that play pivotal roles in improving VfM in health. The program supports regional
       economic communities, such as the EAC, SADEC and ECOWAS in increasing the capacity of their
       budget officers in health planning, budgeting, and purchasing. The program supports both training
       and technical assistance and works in close partnership with African technical networks such as
       CABRI (Africa Network of Budget Officers), AHEA (African Health Economics Association), and civil
       society groups such as the Africa 15% campaign. Some of the accomplishments include:

A /	   The Ministerial Forum on VfM Program: Designed for serving ministers of finance in collaboration
	      with Harvard University

B /	   Capacity building for parliamentarians. Parliamentarians are key decision makers regarding social
	      sector financing and also have a key role in the design of legislation that impacts social sectors.

C /	   Capacity building for senior officials and civil society organizations: One of the strategies for
	      improving value for money is building the capacity of senior officials from the concerned ministries 	
	      and institutions.

D /	   Generating evidence for policy formulation at the country level. The program supported Tanzania in
	      generating evidence on fiscal space and exploring innovative financing strategies toward UHC.

E /	   Exploring the potential links between domestic public health expenditure and foreign
	      direct investment.

Moving Toward UHC




Africa has experienced unprecedented economic growth, poverty reduction, and improvement in
health outcomes, but progress has been uneven.

Economic and population growth combined with an evolving disease burden will continue to increase
demand for health services and put pressure on health systems. To respond to these challenges,
countries will need to invest in their health systems. This calls for renewed commitments and accelerated
progress toward UHC across Africa.

African governments and development partners have made significant commitments to UHC.

Financing for health has increased, however, this increase was mainly driven by development assistance.
Service delivery capacity has expanded but human resources for health remain insufficient. Recent
epidemics revealed that many health systems are not prepared to manage such outbreaks. Coverage
of maternal and child health services and other key interventions have expanded and become more
equitable, but most countries did not achieve the health-related MDGs. OOP spending on health care is
high and represents a significant strain on households, contributing to impoverishment.

Accelerating progress toward UHC in Africa is within reach but will require political leadership and a
clear strategic vision.

Most African countries have integrated UHC as a goal in their national health strategies. Yet, progress
in translating these commitments into expanded domestic resources for health, effective development
assistance, and ultimately, equitable and quality health services, has been slow. Countries that achieve
their UHC targets by 2030 could eliminate preventable maternal and child deaths, strengthen resilience to
public health emergencies, reduce financial hardship linked to illness, and strengthen the foundations for
long-term economic growth.

This framework (page 47) proposes a set of actions for stakeholders involved in the UHC process.

UHC will require the strengthening of existing institutions such as National Health Insurance Agency,
National Purchasing agencies, National Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Health Policy Unit of
Ministry of Health, professional associations, licensing and accreditation bodies, tort mechanisms and
training and research institutions. Institutions involved in training and research are particularly important
as high quality health workers and know-how are critical inputs for UHC. The establishment of new legal
and regulatory institutions and mechanisms for citizen participation and progress monitoring may also be
necessary in some countries. Development partner support will be critical to help countries in the region
push the UHC agenda forward.

 2.   At the global level, the UHC movement can be traced back to the 1978 Alma Ata Declaration, which advocated for the strengthening
      of primary health care. More recently, UHC has been the focus of several UN resolutions to which all African countries are signatories,
      including the 2012 UN General Assembly resolution on ‘The Future We Want”, the 2012 UN resolution on UHC and the 2015 UN General
      Assembly resolution 70/1 on “Transforming Our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” (World Health Organization 2005,
      2009, 2011, 2016b). Moreover, numerous regional initiatives have promoted UHC in Africa: the 2001 Abuja Declaration on HIV/AIDS,
      Tuberculosis and other related infectious diseases, the 2009 Ouagadougou Declaration on Primary Care and Health Systems in Africa, the
      2012 Tunis Declaration on Value for Money, Sustainability and Accountability in the Health Sector, the 2014 Luanda Commitment on UHC
      in Africa, and the Africa Health Strategy 2016-2030. Complementing global and regional commitments, nearly all countries in the region
      have made explicit country-level commitments to UHC through their constitutions or health-specific legislation or strategies.

 3.   The incidence of catastrophic expenditure is a headcount indicator calculated as the proportion of households in the population for
      which health expenditures are equal to or greater than a threshold expressed in terms of total consumption expenditure. In this paper, we
      consider here two thresholds: 15% and 25% of total consumption expenditure. The second key indicator relates to impoverishing health
      expenditures, or the proportion of households pushed below the poverty line because of OOP payments. We use the absolute international
      poverty line of $1.90 per person per day in 2011 PPP factors, as well as the $3.10 poverty line. Furthermore, in order to assess the extent
      to which those households already below the poverty line and incurring OOP payments for health contribute to increasing poverty, we also
      look at the effect of OOP on the poverty gap. Finally, since OOP only informs about financial protection insofar as households actually are
      able to afford to pay for health services, we also use available information on health care use and non-use to assess the extent to which
      households might actually forgo care because of financial or geographical barriers.

 4.   These estimates have to be treated with some caution as NHA estimates of government spending in many cases include expenditures
      financed by DAH. General government expenditure on health presented in the NHA database is “the sum of health outlays paid for in
      cash or supplied in kind by government entities, such as the Ministry of Health, other ministries, parastatal organizations or social security
      agencies (without double counting government transfers to social security and extrabudgetary funds). It includes all expenditure made by
      these entities, regardless of the source, so includes any donor funding passing through them. It includes transfer payments to households
      to offset medical care costs and extrabudgetary funds to finance health services and goods. It includes current and capital expenditure”
      (WHO 2015).The numbers cited here are hence not estimates of domestically financed government spending on health.

 5.   This average is driven by the high level of aid dependence of 9 countries where DAH exceeds 40% of THE (Burundi, CAR, Ethiopia,
      Gambia, Liberia, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, South Sudan)

 8.   A commonly used definition of quality of health care is as “the degree to which health care services for individuals and populations increase
      the likelihood of desired outcomes and are consistent with current professional knowledge” (Lorh, 1990, Institute of Medicine 2001, WHO
      2006).

 9.   Defined as $1.90 a day.

10.   Longitudinal data would be needed to examine the poverty impact of health payments and households’ income smoothing over time.

11.   The strategic Partnership Portal provides country level data on the JEE: for instance for Tanzania see:
      https://extranet.who.int/donorportal/jeeta/tanzanias-jee-assessment-scoring; for Ethiopia see:
      https://extranet.who.int/donorportal/jeeta/ethiopias-jee-assessment-scoring#; for Mozambique see:
      https://extranet.who.int/donorportal/jeeta/mozambique.

12.   Between 20 and 40 percent of total health spending is wasted, with inefficiencies related to human resource management, inappropriate
      use of medicines, medical errors and suboptimal quality, and corruption and fraud being the main sources (World Health Organization
      2010).

13.   People-centred care is an approach to care that consciously adopts individuals’, carers’, families’ and communities’ perspectives as
      participants in, and beneficiaries of, trusted health systems that are organized around the comprehensive needs of people rather than
      individual diseases, and respects social preferences. People centred care also requires that patients have the education and support they
      need to make decisions and participate in their own care and that carers are able to attain maximal function within a supportive working
      environment. People-centred care is broader than patient and person-centred care, encompassing not only clinical encounters, but also
      including attention to the health of people in their communities and their crucial role in shaping health policy and health (Framework on
      integrated, people-centred health services. http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA69/A69_39-en.pdf?ua=1 )
