         1. Introduction



1.	 The issuance plan sets out the government’s intentions for the issuance of its debt
    securities in the domestic capital markets. It includes the bonds and bills to be issued
    and the timing of issuance, and may include general information on other operations
    that the government intends to undertake with its debt securities, such as buybacks
    and exchanges. The issuance plan is part of the government’s annual borrowing plan,
    which presents information on the government’s total financing strategy, including in
    the domestic capital markets but also borrowing from commercial banks, multilateral
    development banks, and the external capital markets.
2.	 Designing and implementing an issuance plan for government securities (GS) is an
    ongoing activity for the government debt manager. A well-designed issuance plan takes
    account of the government’s objectives for financing, managing risk, and developing
    the domestic market. It considers investor preferences and the macroeconomic
    environment,2 and is implemented in close coordination with monetary policy.3
    The issuer benefits from potential cost-savings and enhanced potential for secondary
    market liquidity in its instruments. Investors benefit from the greater transparency
    and predictability that the issuance plan provides as they are better able to plan their
    investment in GS.
3.	 This guidance note describes the key considerations for the debt manager and the steps
    involved in developing and implementing the issuance plan. It is structured as follows:
    Section 2 provides the context; Section 3 outlines the scope; Section 4 discusses the
    main steps in developing and implementing the issuance plan; Section 5 describes
    key linkages between the issuance plan and other relevant activities; and Section 6
    concludes. The Annex provides an illustration of the steps discussed in Section 4.

  	 Strong macroeconomic fundamentals, including sound fiscal and monetary policies and foreign
    exchange regimes, provide the issuer greater degrees of freedom in choosing instruments and
    tenors, and supporting regularity and predictability in implementing the issuance plan. However, debt
    managers need to make tactical decisions on financing under myriad macro and market conditions.
    The optimal conditions are country-specific and the ultimate financing choices are based on the debt
    manager’s judgment and subject to the constraints faced.
3
  	 The note generally attributes the debt management function to the Ministry of Finance (MoF),
    specifically the Debt Management Unit (DMU), and the monetary policy implementation function
    to the Central Bank. It is worth noting that the role of the Central Bank in debt management differs
    across countries; in some cases it houses the debt management function (e.g. Denmark, Sri Lanka)
    and in others it acts as the agent of the MoF for debt issuance (e.g. Turkey, Romania).

         2. Context



4.	 Domestic capital markets have become a major source of financing for EMEs where
    around 85 percent of government debt outstanding is in the domestic market. The
    domestic market offers greater flexibility in the amount and timing of government
    borrowing. As the borrowing is predominantly in the domestic currency (DX) it helps
    to reduce the currency mismatch between the governments’ assets and liabilities.4
5.	 Despite the impressive growth of domestic government debt markets in EMEs, most
    markets are plagued by illiquidity arising from a high degree of debt fragmentation5
    and a narrow range of investors. The result is that EME governments (and ultimately
    tax payers) pay a premium to investors for the risk of their holding relatively illiquid
    securities. Moreover, lack of liquidity in the secondary market for GS inhibits the
    building of a reliable government yield curve that could provide a risk-free reference
    for other borrowers and financial products.
6.	 GS liquidity6 is dependent on many factors such as the structure and characteristics
    of the investor base and their incentives to trade, the efficiency of the trading and
    settlement infrastructure, and the quality of the outstanding debt portfolio. For
    example, a market dominated by one or two large investors, or one where most
    investors share the same risk preference and investment horizon, may not see much
    secondary market activity. There may also be barriers to trading, such as a high cost of
    financing trading portfolios, transaction taxes, etc.




4
  	 As EME domestic government debt has become an investable asset class for global investors, EME
    governments are more exposed to global changes and may face volatility in government financing
    as a result. However, a discussion on how to monitor exposure to non-resident investors and manage
    associated risks is beyond the scope of this note.
5
  	 In a fragmented market there are a large number of debt securities of small amounts outstanding
    and different characteristics that make it difficult to actively trade those securities.
6
  	 This note distinguishes between liquidity in the market for GS (“GS liquidity”), which refers to the
    ability to trade GS with immediacy and without significantly moving the market, and liquidity in the
    financial system (“systemic liquidity”), which refers to the volume of cash and cash-like instruments
    available in the financial system.

    7.	 While many of these factors may not be under the                          the legal, regulatory, and accounting framework do not

        lines8 of GS at key tenors. The large size improves the
        potential for wider distribution of the security among               10.	 The structure of the investor base and role of market
        different types of investors with different incentives                    intermediaries also influence the instruments, size,
        to trade, thereby increasing trading opportunities                        and timing of GS issuance. Certain investor segments
        and reducing the liquidity premium demanded by                            may experience seasonal fluctuations in their liquidity
        the market. With this objective, developed markets                        profile (e.g. pressures on bank liquidity or outflows
        and several EME government issuers have adopted a                         from the pension system) affecting systemic liquidity

       	 The World Bank and International Monetary Fund implement a program in EMEs to develop a medium-term debt management strategy

        	Simulations of different issuance plans using Microsoft Excel or other appropriate software help to ensure that the chosen issuance plan
         is coherent with the ABP and advances the governments’ considerations for development of the domestic GS market.

    Issuance Plan               Sections IV.A. and VII.A.)
                             •	 Proportion and weekly breakdown of gross borrowing requirement to be
                                financed with domestic marketable debt
                             2. Select instruments (refer Sections IV.B. and VII.B.)
                             •	 Instrument types and tenors (e.g. 6-month treasury bill, 12-month treasury bill,
                                3-year bond, 5-year bond)
                             •	 Number and size of lines (e.g. 2 new lines of 3-year bonds every year with target
                                size of DX 10 billion each)
                             3. Organize auctions (refer Sections IV.C. and VII.C.)
                             •	 Auction size (e.g. DX 800 – 1,000 million offered at each auction of the 3-year bond)
                             •	 Frequency and sequencing (e.g. bills auctioned every week, 10-year bond
                                auctioned every quarter)
                             4. Organize maturities (refer Sections IV.D. and VII.D.)
                             •	 Standard maturity months (e.g. 2 lines of 3-year bonds maturing in March and
                                September every year)
                             •	 Specific maturity dates (e.g. 3-year bond maturing March 5, 2017)
                             5. Determine liability management operations (refer Sections IV.E. and VII.E.)
                             •	 Securities and timing of buybacks and exchanges, if any (e.g. 5-year bond
                                maturing October 2014 to be bought back starting April 2014 for up to a
                                maximum amount of DX 5 billion)
                             6. Develop auction schedule (refer Sections IV.F. and VII.F.)
                             •	 Timing of each auction, and the instrument and amount to be issued at that
                                auction (e.g. Week of Jan 1, 2014 – offer DX 800 – 1,000 million of 3-year
                                bond maturing on March 5, 2017)
                             7. Determine frequency, format, and detail of market communication (refer Sections
                                IV.G. and VII.G.)
                             •	 Announcements: indicative annual auction calendar (e.g. global issuance
                                volume, general plans for LMOs), more detailed quarterly calendar (e.g. specific
                                instruments and indicative volume for the period), more details/adjustments
                                on a monthly/weekly basis (e.g. indicative auction volume for each instrument,
                                instrument for buyback)
                             •	 Reporting: auction results, monthly and annual reports on issuance plan
                                implementation
                             •	 Consultation: quarterly or monthly meeting with primary dealers and/or other
                                investors, ad hoc consultation before auctions and on special operations (e.g. LMOs)
                             8. Review and adjustments (refer Sections IV.H. and VII.H.)
                             •	 Periodic (e.g. quarterly, monthly/weekly) review of the issuance plan based on
                                market consultation and updates to the gross borrowing requirement and cash

         3. Scope



13.	 The issuance plan covers marketable debt instruments of the central government issued
     in the domestic capital markets14 (refer Figure 2). Marketable debt in the external
     capital markets tends to be issued on a more opportunistic basis making it difficult to
     be incorporated in a pre-announced issuance plan. However, the ABP may indicate
     the government’s intention, if any, to raise finance in the external capital markets at a
     time that it deems appropriate.
14.	 The issuance plan is typically developed for at least a one-year period, with necessary
     periodic adjustments (e.g. quarterly, monthly or weekly). While the design of
     an issuance plan may begin with the budget cycle it will need to be updated on a
     rolling basis in order to ensure continuity in its implementation. Ideally, the debt
     manager would consider a medium-term planning horizon in line with the DMS and
     benchmark building strategy. In particular, the gross borrowing requirement over the
     medium-term may determine the number of benchmarks that can be issued and rolled
     over, and the structure and expected growth of the investor base may impact the tenors
     that can be consistently offered. However, the feasibility of a medium-term planning
     horizon depends on the availability of reliable forecasts and the stability of fiscal and
     macroeconomic policy. Therefore, it is necessary to keep this process dynamic.
15.	 Within the debt management unit (DMU), the front office (FO),15 as the market-
     facing entity, is best suited to take the lead on developing and implementing the
     issuance plan, although it will necessarily work closely with other entities (refer Figure
     3). The FO interacts with the market to gather information on investor preferences and
     market liquidity, and perspective on the scope for benchmark building, targeting new
     investor segments, etc. It is then responsible for periodically updating this information
     and making necessary adjustments to the issuance plan, in coordination with the MO.


14
   	 While the guidance note discusses DX instruments issued in the domestic market, the steps outlined
     in Section IV can be extended to FX instruments issued in the domestic market. FX instruments
     add the element of FX risk management to both debt and cash management operations, and have
     different implications for domestic financial market development.
15
   	The terms front office (FO), middle office (MO), and back office (BO) refer to the individual(s) or teams
     responsible for carrying out the respective functions.

        DMS and the compilation of financing and cash flow                  coordination include public sector agencies involved

        4. Steps in Developing
        and Implementing the
        Issuance Plan

A. Financing Need
17.	 Objective: To determine the proportion of the government’s gross borrowing
     requirement that needs to be financed through GS issuance in the domestic market, as
     well as the timing of the financing need.
18.	 Information required:
    18.1.	 Gross borrowing requirement and DMS targets (if any) for domestic market
           financing
    18.2.	 Projections of cash flow, ideally (at least) monthly for the next 12 months, and
           weekly for the next three months
19.	 Analysis: The government’s projected budget and debt servicing needs, and debt
     management objectives (e.g. to increase the proportion of DX borrowing, to increase
     portfolio ATM, etc.) help to determine the desired amount of GS to be issued in the
     domestic market during a particular period. However, the actual volume of GS that
     can be issued may be limited by demand side considerations (e.g. the domestic market’s
     absorption capacity, seasonal liquidity factors, etc.) Therefore, historical analysis of
     market demand and liquidity trends, and forward-looking market consultation and
     coordination with the central bank, are necessary to ensure the feasibility of the
     domestic market financing strategy. A high-level demand side analysis is conducted
     during the development of the DMS. However, this needs to be fine-tuned during
     the development of the issuance plan to determine the amount to be offered at each
     auction/placement of GS.
20.	 Credible projections of cash flow, i.e. revenue and expenditure, at least on a weekly
     basis in the short term and monthly for the budget cycle, are necessary to determine
     the timing of the financing need, which impacts the timing and pace of GS issuance.
     In the absence of such projections, the debt manager may begin with historical
     trends in revenue and expenditure flows, complemented by available forward-looking
     information (e.g. anticipated tax and privatization receipts, inflow from other sources
     of financing, etc.) Further, the government’s ability to borrow short-term to manage

         22.2.	Investor preferences for instruments, tenors,                tenors that are strategic (e.g. the 10-year benchmark

        outset, particularly at the longer end. It is important                    The longer a security’s remaining time to maturity, the
        to note that the chosen benchmark tenors are not too                       more opportunity the debt manager has to build its

        issuance), and do not cannibalize demand from each                         of the debt manager’s ability to manage refinancing
        other. It is also important to note that the lengthening                   risk. Improvements to debt management capacity over
        of benchmark tenors needs to take place gradually,                         time, including the ability to undertake buybacks and
        building upon shorter tenors. For example, it would                        exchanges, build cash balances in anticipation of a

        bond. The considerations for issuing treasury bills are                    allowance for periods of market stress). With expected

26.	The debt manager may also consider externally                                 unless the government adopts a policy to maintain
    generated limits when determining the target size.                            a certain number of benchmarks for the purpose of

    a small overall size of the GS may be unattractive                            size and frequency of individual auctions) there is a
    for the investor. Certain electronic trading systems                          risk that the coupon of that benchmark security goes

    Some debt managers aim to have their GS included                              that line even before its target size is reached in order

     	 An on-the-run security is the most recently issued/reopened GS for a particular tenor and is typically the most actively traded GS for that
       tenor. This is because its coupon is likely to be close to the market rate for that tenor enabling market participants to trade close to par
       value, which they prefer, and a substantial portion of the security is likely to be held in trading portfolios as opposed to held-to-maturity
       portfolios. When this security is replaced by a new on-the-run security or as time passes, the old security is likely to see less and less
       activity in the secondary market.

Norway opens a new benchmark line every two years with 11 years remaining till maturity. For example, NST471 maturing in 2015 was first launched in
2004 and reopened over the course of 2004-05. It then serves as a market reference for the period equivalent to its remaining time to maturity, i.e. in 2005 it
is the 10-year benchmark, in 2006 the 9-year benchmark, in 2007 the 8 year benchmark and so on. A new benchmark with 11 years till maturity is launched
in 2006 and reopened over the course of 2006-07. This strategy requires a mature market that is able to accurately price the 11-year bond and periodically
offer fresh prices for the bonds outstanding.
Singapore launches new benchmark lines at strategic tenors of 2, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20 and 30 years at different frequencies. It would be important to keep track
of the benchmarks outstanding before launching new bonds. For example, in 2012 two new benchmarks of original maturity 2-year and 30-year were
launched. However, the outstanding instruments provided references for 15, 10, 7 and 5 years as well. Similarly, a 5-year benchmark could be provided
by launching a new instrument of original maturity 5-year, as was the case in 2008, 2009, and 2011, or based on the remaining maturity of outstanding
instruments such as the 7-year benchmarks launched in 2008 (N708100S) and 2010 (N710100Z), which became 5-year references in 2010 and 2012.
Interestingly, in 2011 Singapore announced that it would discontinue the issuance of 7-year benchmarks. The obvious challenge with this strategy is the
accumulation of refinancing of several benchmarks. For example, in 2013 the debt manager would have to refinance two bonds, the first of original maturity
10-year (NX03100Z) and the second of original maturity 5-year (N508100V).

          or may have been fiscally prudent for a sustained period            can adopt several measures depending on the purpose:
          (e.g. Singapore, Hong Kong), obviating the need for debt

        5. Key Linkages



A. Cash Management
62.	 Cash forecasting and cash management capabilities of the government are critical
     to how well the debt manager can design and implement the issuance plan, and
     how sensitive the issuance plan should be to volatility in financing needs. They are
     significant for the pace of GS issuance and benchmark building, and for minimizing
     the cost of carry on cash balances that the government may choose to maintain.
63.	 Most EMEs face challenges in forecasting cash for a sufficiently long period, say for the
     next three months, with a certain degree of reliability. The challenges often go beyond
     the direct responsibilities of the DMU. However, the debt manager can highlight
     the importance of adequate and reliable cash forecasts and coordinate with relevant
     agencies to obtain necessary information. Such coordination needs to take place within
     MoF, between the FO and the unit responsible for cash forecasting and management,
     as well as between MoF and those responsible for budget execution elsewhere in the
     government ministries. Weekly cash flow projections should be generated and updated
     at least for the next three months to identify whether the issuance plan will sufficiently
     support budget financing and debt servicing or, if it needs to be adjusted and/or if the
     debt manager needs to tap other sources of funding to satisfy cash needs in the short
     term.
64.	The debt manager’s and the cash manager’s judgment on the feasibility and
    appropriateness of cash management operations are important inputs to refining the
    issuance plan. In addition to compiling reliable forecasts, the unit responsible for
    cash forecasting and management needs to develop, in coordination with the debt
    manager, short-term borrowing instruments. For example, cash management bills and
    repos to manage a temporary cash shortfall, or invest short-term surplus cash using
    (collateralized) deposits or reverse repos at close to market rates. This is necessary to
    smooth the government’s cash balance, which allows a lower average level of cash
    balance, and to minimize the cost of carry on the government’s cash balance. The
    strength of cash management capabilities greatly influences the degree of regularity
    and predictability that the debt manager can provide in implementing the issuance
    plan.

        6. Conclusion



69.	 Developing and implementing an issuance plan for GS is an important ongoing activity
     for EME debt managers, with implications for the government’s cost of financing,
     managing risks in debt servicing, supporting monetary policy implementation and
     financial stability, and promoting financial sector development. It is based on the
     principle of offering greater transparency and predictability to the market on the
     government’s debt issuance, while building and maintaining the DMU’s credibility
     with respect to debt management operations. A well-designed issuance plan takes into
     account the government’s objectives, investor preferences and the macroeconomic
     environment. Implementing an issuance plan is a dynamic process that requires
     close coordination with investors and market intermediaries, with other public sector
     agencies responsible for fiscal and macroeconomic projections, and with the central
     bank. With consistency in planning and implementation over a medium- to long-term
     horizon, the government as the issuer can hope to reach a better cost-risk tradeoff in
     its financing activities and contribute to financial sector development and stability.

        7. Annex: Illustration of
        Steps in Developing an
        Issuance Plan


Background
•	 The government’s debt management objectives include issuing regular benchmark
   securities and gradually lengthening the tenors of the benchmarks offered; issuing and
   maintaining a steady volume of shorter-term (less than one year) treasury bills; and
   gradually increasing the proportion of gross financing met from DX fixed-rate GS
   issuance in the domestic market.
•	 Debt rollover will be financed through issuance of GS in DX in the domestic market
•	 A portion of the budget deficit (including interest payments) will be financed through
   issuance of GS in DX in the domestic market
•	 During the previous year, the government raised around DX 40.0 bn through GS
   issued in the domestic market. The gross financing need this year in DX in the
   domestic market is larger but systemic liquidity is expected to be favorable, helping to
   satisfy the increased financing needs.
•	 During the last year the debt manager has been able to issue between 500 mn and 1.0
   bn at each auction; auctions are held weekly with T+2 settlement

A. Financing Need
•	 Gross financing need for 2014 in the domestic market from issuance of GS = 46.0 bn,
   of which
   •	 Portion of budget financing (including interest payments) = 18.0 bn
   •	 Debt refinancing = 28.0 bn

     C. Organization of Cuctions
     •	 An indicative pattern of auctions of different instruments may be announced to the market with the actual auction
        calendar announced periodically

D. Organization of Maturities
•	 The different lines of each tenor are arranged systematically such that the redemption of large benchmarks does not
   bunch in any given year.
•	 This organization represents a steady state and it would need to be adjusted during the transition to this steady state to
   avoid bunching of redemptions with already outstanding GS.

E. Liability Management Operations
•	 Large benchmarks maturing within the next 12 months would be considered for buybacks during times of relatively
   lower cash needs
•	 The DMU will begin with buyback transactions, since they are simpler to execute than exchanges

     F. Auction Schedule
     •	 An auction schedule is generated for the next year with the planned instruments, amounts and timing of issuance and
        after modeling the various inputs in a spreadsheet (such as the analytical tool that is part of the Toolkit); the planned
        auction schedule for the first quarter is provided below
     •	 The issuance week for each instrument is based on the organization of auctions
     •	 The maturity month of each instrument is based on the organization of maturities
     •	 The planned auction amounts for each week are calibrated to promote competitive price formation, and to be within
        market absorption capacity
     •	 A new line is launched when the target size of the previous line is expected to be reached
