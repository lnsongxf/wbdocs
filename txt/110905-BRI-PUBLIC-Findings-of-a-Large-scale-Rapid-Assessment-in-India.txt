  In 2012, the national flagship rural sanitation program, TSC, was restructured into NBA including new guidelines being issued for the NGP. In the process of restructuring, NGPs were not given
in 2012. In 2013, applications were invited for the NGP and verified along with the 2012 applicants.

  Post 2012, the eligibility criteria were modified to include process indicators as well such as communication outreach activities, in addition to outcomes. Since this assessment focuses on
winners from 2009-11, eligibility criteria up to 2012 are included.

  ODF is understood as the complete elimination of open defecation within the jurisdiction of the PRI, which implies that all residents have access to and, more importantly, are using a safe
sanitation facility; all schools, pre-schools and public buildings have safe and functional toilets; and there is no open defecation by anyone including the floating or visitor population.

   As per the sampling plan, one school and one anganwadi were to be surveyed in each of the 2,603 GPs selected as the sample for this assessment.
However, due to school holidays and unavailability of staff, in some cases, it was not possible to survey one school and one anganwadi in each GP.

   Admittedly, national guidelines of subsequent CSS for rural sanitation have emphasized that the funds for hardware are intended as a post-construction incentive. Many states, however, used the funds
as an upfront hardware subsidy to build toilets, often with limited involvement of the community or PRIs.

   A global review of financing onsite sanitation in six countries (including Maharashtra, India) notes that, “All… reviewed projects assumed that the poor can contribute to their own sanitation facilities,
and in several cases they paid the bulk of the hardware costs” (Tremolet, Kolsky and Perez, 2010). An earlier review of scaling up sanitation in South Asia, in fact, found that high hardware subsidies
were correlated with poor performance of sanitation programs rather than the converse (WSP 2005).
