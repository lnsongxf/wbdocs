 Executive summary




To make growth         Pakistan’s growth accelerated in FY16, driven by consumption while investment
matter, Pakistan       remained low. Exports continued to fall when soft global demand exacerbated the
needs to invest its    effects of Pakistan’s long-term decline in competitiveness. After achieving
economic gains in      macroeconomic stability, the government continued to deliver on its structural
health, education      reform agenda in FY16, but much remains to be done if growth is to be
and nutrition          strengthened and sustained. The government’s next challenge will be to invest in
                       health, education and nutrition; Pakistan’s staggering fall in poverty over the last 14
                       years has not been accompanied by a similar improvement in wellbeing. The
                       country’s long-term growth depends on this investment in its people—this is what
                       will make growth matter for Pakistanis.

Pakistan’s growth is   Pakistan’s growth started to catch up with its regional neighbors in FY16 with gross
beginning to catch     domestic product (GDP) expanding at 4.7 percent—the highest rate in eight years
up with its regional   and a significant increase from the previous year’s 4.0 percent. While India’s growth
neighbors              (7.6 percent) continued to lead the pack in South Asia, Bangladesh and Pakistan
                       began to strengthen relative to others. The South Asia region grew by 6.8 percent
                       year-on-year in the second quarter of 2016, continuing to outpace East Asia and the
                       Pacific (6.3 percent) while other regions experienced slow or negative growth.

Growth in FY16 was     Amidst an environment of soft global demand, Pakistan’s growth in FY16 was
driven by strong       driven by strong domestic demand. Consumption accounted for an overwhelming
domestic demand        92 percent of GDP in FY16, and contributed 7 percentage points towards GDP
                       growth (moderated by a negative contribution of 2.2 percent from net exports),
                       supported by sustained growth in remittances. Strong aggregate demand and
                       improving business sentiments were evident in private sector credit growth of 12
                       percent, expanding by Rs. 461 billion in FY16 compared with Rs. 224 billion in
                       FY15. Low inflation and low interest rates also contributed to higher credit growth.

                       An increase in foreign investment flows from China (to fund CPEC projects) made
                       a small contribution to growth. The government’s efforts to stabilize the
                       macroeconomic environment provided a better footing for economic activity, while
                       marginal improvements in energy supplies facilitated manufacturing growth in
                       particular.

Low rates of           The low and stagnant investment rate, however, continues to pose significant
investment continue    challenges. After strong growth in FY15 of 13 percent, investment grew by only 5.7
to constrain growth    percent in FY16. The ratio of investment to GDP is 15.6 percent—compared with
                       an average rate in South Asia of 34 percent between 2010 and 2015. Pakistan’s
                       much lower rate of investment is driven by its volatile security situation, energy
                       shortages and poor business regulatory environment (now ranked 144 of 190
                       countries). The World Bank’s 2017 Doing Business report found that Pakistan
                       improved four ranks in 2017—placing it among the top ten ‘most improved’
                       countries—although this was preceded by a fall of 72 ranks between 2008 and 2016.
                       The implementation of the federal and provincial governments’ joint action plan to
                       improve the investment climate will be one important step towards reversing this
                       long-term trend.

Exports continued to   FY16 saw the continuation of a longstanding decline in Pakistan’s share in global
fall—highlighting      trade. This trend is a combined reflection of Pakistan’s weakening export
Pakistan’s worrying    competitiveness and soft global demand in key sectors. Food and textiles, in
decline in export      particular, are key contributors to Pakistan’s exports and continue to suffer from a
competitiveness        decline in international prices and demand. For example, although Pakistan
                       exported more rice in FY16 than in FY15, lower international prices translated to a
                       lower total value of rice exports. More generally, Pakistan’s decline in
                       competitiveness has been driven by poor trade facilitation, infrastructure gaps,
                       inefficient logistics and a poor investment climate.1 Pakistan has also lagged behind
                       its competitors in trade openness, reducing its prospects of regaining export
                       momentum. The simple average tariff has fallen only slightly from 14.4 percent in
                       FY13 to 13.4 percent in FY16.

The budget deficit     The government continues to make progress on fiscal consolidation, reducing the
has shrunk as          consolidated2 fiscal deficit from 5.3 percent of GDP in FY15 to 4.6 percent in
revenue growth has     FY16. The FY17 budget implies a further fall in the fiscal deficit to 3.8 percent of
outpaced               GDP. Revenue growth is underpinning the falling deficit, driven in FY16 by a 20
expenditure growth     percent increase in the Federal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) collection. Some of this
                       collection may, however, affect the progress of other reform efforts. For example,
                       in contrast with efforts to reduce Pakistan’s trade tariffs, FY16 saw a 32.7 percent
                       increase in customs duties collection as a result of FBR’s attempts to meet revenue
                       targets. Similarly, the recently-introduced withholding tax on financial deposits may
                       have driven customers to circumvent formal banking channels, as the currency-
                       deposit ratio has increased from 0.29 to 0.35 in just one year. A series of new tax
                       measures in the FY17 budget will broaden the tax base and are expected to
                       contribute to another significant increase in FBR revenues. On the expenditure side,
                       the development budget has grown faster than the recurrent budget. In the FY17
                       budget, an expected reduction in state-owned enterprise subsidies and interest
                       payments has created space for an increase in infrastructure spending, including on
                       CPEC projects. See Section A2 for a FY16 fiscal analysis and Section C4 for a
                       FY17 budget analysis.

The government has     The end of the IMF’s Extended Fund Facility program in September 2016 marked
continued to deliver   significant progress in achieving macroeconomic stability over the last three years.
on its structural      Fiscal deficits are significantly reduced, foreign reserves have returned to
reform program,        comfortable levels and inflation is in-check. There remains, however, a significant
although challenges    agenda of economic reform to be implemented. The energy sector has reduced
remain                 financial losses and load shedding—particularly for industry—but investments in
                       transmission and distribution are desperately needed. The government has also
                       made solid progress on financial sector reforms, but will need to continue to
                       strengthen and diversify the sector and improve its governance and transparency.
                       Continued improvements in tax collection will also be essential for the
                       government’s economic agenda, particularly those that widen the tax net and
                       increase provincial revenue collection. See Section B2.

Pakistan’s recent      The government recently set a new national poverty line that identifies 29.5 percent
growth has been        of Pakistanis as poor (using the latest available data from FY14). By back casting
accompanied by a       this line, the poverty rate in FY02 would have been about 64.3 percent. This means
staggering fall in     that poverty has more than halved between FY02 and FY14, even according to this
poverty                new and higher metric. The new poverty line was introduced in April 2016 precisely
                       because of Pakistan's success in reducing poverty over the last decade and a half.
                       Using the old national poverty line, set in 2001, the percentage of people living in
                       poverty fell from 34.7 percent in FY02 to 9.3 percent in FY14—a fall of more than
                       75 percent. Other sources of data corroborate this decline—ownership of assets and
                       dietary diversity also increased over this period. For example, in the bottom income
                       quintile, motorcycle ownership increased from 2 to 18 percent between FY02 and
                       FY14. See Section C1. 	

But growth and         Progress on social sectors has, however, stagnated since FY10. Between FY02 and
poverty reduction      FY08, school enrolment rates increased significantly, coinciding with a rapid
have not translated    reduction in poverty. Gross enrolment rates for girls between age 5 and 9, for
to sustained           example, increased by 22 percentage points in this period. Since FY10, however,
improvements in        Pakistan has seen little progress across a number of key human development
wellbeing              indicators. Literacy has remained between 58 and 60 percent since 2010. Enrolment
                       rates for primary school, middle school and matric level have remained constant and
                       only 52 percent of schools are equipped with basic facilities. Stunting remains very
                       high, and the related problems of water quality and poor sanitation are either failing
                       to improve or worsening. These disadvantages are far more concentrated in rural
                       areas than in urban areas, and vary widely between provinces. See Section B3.

Malnutrition is a      At 43.7 percent, Pakistan has the third-highest rate of stunting in the world.3 In

                       budgets are being diverted to addressing it. However, a concerted effort at all levels
                       of government is needed to exert a meaningful impact on national stunting rates.

Another challenge –     A recently completed diagnostic study of Karachi city catalogued its immense

levels of government    national economy as a manufacturing and logistics hub, the city’s shortcomings have

planning and            ranked as one of the least livable cities in the world. It is characterized by informal
infrastructure          settlements (that house a majority of the city’s residents), a proliferation of informal
                        service providers and a highly centralized but fragmented governance structure. The
                        diagnostic identifies a reform agenda that aims to build inclusive, coordinated and
                        accountable institutions and address Karachi’s critical shortfall in transport, water
                        and sewage infrastructure and services. These efforts will need to seek private sector
                        involvement and introduce greater sustainability and inclusion. See Section C3.

Pakistan’s growth is    In the medium-term, Pakistan’s growth is expected to continue to accelerate,
expected to continue    reaching 5 percent in FY17 and 5.4 percent in FY18. A moderate increase in
to accelerate in FY17   investment (related to CPEC projects) is expected to supplement growth driven
and FY18                primarily by public and private consumption. Energy reforms are expected to
                        support higher growth in the industry and services sectors. The agriculture sector is
                        forecast to recover from its poor performance in FY16. Subdued growth in exports
                        and accelerated growth in imports are expected to lead to a widening of the current
                        account deficit from 1.1 percent in FY16 to 1.7 percent in FY17. Like in previous
                        years, this will be offset by remittance inflows so foreign exchange reserves are
                        expected to continue to accumulate. See Section B1.

But for sustained       But Pakistan’s continued growth is not guaranteed. In the short- to medium-term,
growth, Pakistan        sustained progress on energy reforms, CPEC implementation and widening the tax
must implement          net will be important. Without these structural reforms and other efforts to improve
structural reforms      the investment climate, Pakistan’s rate of investment will remain weak and its
and improve             consumption-driven growth will eventually slow down. In addition, the 2018
wellbeing for all       election may have implications for the pace of reform implementation while ‘Brexit’
                        and the imminent US interest rate hike may affect the overall macroeconomic
                        environment. In the longer-term, Pakistan’s economic and human development
                        relies heavily on better nutrition, health and education outcomes—which would in
                        turn lift the productivity of the workforce. Using Pakistan’s economic gains to
                        invest in health, education and nutrition would also significantly lift wellbeing,
                        making growth matter for all Pakistanis.

     A. Economic Update




   1. Real sector
South Asia continues 2016 has so far seen South Asia continue on a stable growth trajectory, in stark
to lead global growth contrast to the economic performance of the rest of the world4. The region has
                      remained sheltered from global headwinds such as China’s economic sluggishness
                      and monetary policy uncertainty in advanced economies and has benefited from the
                      positive terms of trade shock from lower global oil prices. South Asia continues to
                      be the fastest growing region in the world, as it has been for eight consecutive
                      quarters. This is largely due to growth in public and private consumption, moderate
                      optimism in industry, stable exchange rates, and inflation rates that—despite a
                      modest pickup—remain historically low. This allowed the region to grow by 6.8
                      percent year-on-year in the second quarter of 2016,5 led by strengthening economic
                      activity in India, Bangladesh and Pakistan.

Nevertheless, several Fiscal consolidation across South Asia continues to focus on expenditure cuts rather
downside risks        than revenue generation, in spite of low tax-to-GDP ratios. Debt-to-GDP ratios
persist               remain relatively high, political uncertainty persists and expenditure cuts in Gulf
                      Cooperation Council (GCC) countries have led to a decline in remittances inflows
                      in India and Nepal, while Pakistan’s remittance growth has slowed.

Pakistan’s growth is    Pakistan’s economy may have begun the long process of catching up to its regional
starting to catch up    neighbors in FY166 with GDP growth reaching 4.7 percent—the highest rate in
to its neighbors,       eight years and a significant increase from 4.0 percent growth in FY15. While this
driven by strong        improvement is a positive sign, the economy could be growing faster; see Section

                        4 While East Asia and the Pacific still managed strong growth of 6.3 percent, Latin America and
                          Caribbean and Sub-Saharan Africa suffered from negative growth with Europe and Central Asia

stable                                construction and manufacturing activities fed into and supported strong domestic
macroeconomic                         public and private consumption. Although large cotton crop losses led to a
environment                           contraction in agriculture production, this was more than offset by a strong recovery
                                      in industry and robust growth in services. A relatively stable macroeconomic
                                      environment—due to better fiscal management, low inflation, a stable exchange rate
                                      and an accommodating monetary policy—supported this outcome. A marginal two
                                      percent increase in electricity supplies also contributed to industrial and services
                                      growth.7 China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects are generating much
                                      higher foreign direct investment (FDI) flows from China8, but the substantive
                                      benefits of these investments will be felt over the medium-term.

On the demand side,                   It is quite typical for consumption to be the largest component of aggregate
consumption                           demand.      However, in the case of Pakistan, consumption constitutes an
remains the largest                   overwhelming 92 percent of GDP and contributes 7 percentage points towards
contributor to                        GDP growth (see Figure 1). This has been driven mostly by private consumption,
growth                                supported by sustained growth in remittances—leading to a record high US$ 19.9
                                      billion of remittances in FY16 (discussed in Section A3). In the last fiscal year, the
                                      contribution of government consumption to growth has been strong at 1.7 percent.
                                      On the other hand, weak performance in net exports dragged down growth by
                                      about 2.2 percent.

Investment                            In real terms, investment growth in FY16 decelerated sharply to 5.7 percent from 13
continues to stagnate                 percent in FY15. The ratio of investment to GDP remains relatively low at 15.6

                                      in general government investment. Pakistan’s investment rates are low even
                                      compared with the South Asian average, which is well below other regions’.10
                                      Between 2010 and 2015, South Asia’s average investment rate was around 34
                                      percent while Pakistan’s was less than half that, at 15 percent. A number of factors
                                      are responsible for this including: (a) a volatile security situation in Pakistan which
                                      has only recently started to improve; (b) the global slow-down, which is affecting
                                      foreign direct investment and limiting domestic demand; (c) energy shortages that
                                      prevent full capacity utilization and (d) a steady decline in the ease of doing business
                                      in recent years. Pakistan’s low rate of investment is one of the most significant
                                      challenges facing the economy today.

Domestic savings are                  Inextricably linked with investment, savings pose another long-term challenge for
growing slowly and                    the economy. National savings reached 14.6 percent of GDP in FY16, only 0.1
contributing to a                     percentage point higher than that in FY15 and only 1 percentage point higher than
saving-investment                     that in FY10 (see Figure 2). The slow growth of domestic savings is especially
gap                                   disappointing as they are generally a reliable and consistent source of funds for
                                      investment. Domestic savings were 9.8 percent of GDP in FY10 and have been
                                      falling steadily to a low of 8.3 percent in FY16. Real interest rates, which were very
                                      low until the recent fall in inflation, may partly explain the low rate of household
                                      savings.11 The recent imposition of withholding taxes on financial transactions—
                                      although positive in terms of creating incentives for taxpayer registration—may also

                       as sugarcane and corn14. In addition to cotton, rice production also suffered in FY16
                       due to depressed prices, heavy downpours in July 2015 and abundant rice stocks.
                       Although sugarcane and wheat production increased, this was not sufficient to
                       compensate for the crop sector shortfall.

Industry performed     Industry, contributing 21 percent of overall GDP, grew by 6.8 percent compared to 4.8

                       prices of raw material, relatively improved energy supply, and high private sector credit
                       flows15 allowed some LSM sub-sectors to grow particularly rapidly, aided in some cases
                       by government subsidies. These include automobiles (16.1 percent), fertilizers (13.8
                       percent) and cement (10.1 percent). The automobile sub-sector benefited from strong
                       sale of cars, cheap auto financing16, demand under the Apna Rozgar Scheme17, and
                       stronger trading activities. Cement production enjoyed growth on account of strong
                       public18 and private construction activities and lower production and distribution costs.
                       Other sub-sectors of industry, such as construction and mining and quarrying, grew by
                       13.1 and 6.8 percent respectively, both surpassing their respective Annual Plan FY16
                       targets. The upward momentum of industry is expected to continue in FY17 on the
                       back of consistent energy supplies and CPEC-related construction.

The services sector    The services sector is generally the engine of Pakistan’s growth on the supply side with
continues to perform   its share in GDP reaching about 59 percent in FY16.19 The services sector grew by an
consistently,          impressive 5.7 percent during FY16, the highest growth rate of the last decade. This
contributing to the    growth was broad-based and supported by wholesale and retail trade, finance and insurance,
growth uptick          and general government services sub-sectors. The performance of wholesale and retail trade, the
                       largest sub-sector20, was particularly notable as it recovered from 2.6 percent in FY15 to
                       4.6 percent. Finance and insurance grew by 7.8 percent in FY16 compared to 6.5 in FY15
                       as banks enjoyed higher pre-tax profits while growth in general government services
                       recovered strongly from 4.8 percent in FY15 to 11.1 percent in FY16 owing to an
                       increase in government salaries.21 The second largest sub-sector within services, transport,
                       storage and communication, however, suffered a setback when its growth fell by 0.7
                       percentage points to 4.8 percent on account of road transport, railways, pipeline
                       transport, and water transport.22 This occurred in spite of the communications industry
                       enjoying growth of 10.9 percent in FY16 compared with 2.6 percent in the previous
                       year. Going forward, growth in the services sector is expected to slow as base effects in
                       wholesale and retail trade fade, although further government salary increases will likely
                       moderate this somewhat.

budget deficit                  in FY16—the lowest in nine years. Fiscal consolidation is the lynchpin of the

The consolidated                The fiscal deficit of the consolidated government was 4.6 percent of GDP in
deficit has fallen to           FY16 (see Table 1), the smallest deficit of the last nine years. Total expenditure
4.6 percent of                  grew by 7.6 percent while total revenue increased by a robust 13.1 percent as a
GDP, in spite of                result of tax revenue growth. The federal government held recurrent spending
higher provincial               under tight rein—recurrent spending grew by only 3.5 percent compared to 7.3
recurrent                       percent last year. On the other hand, provincial recurrent spending registered an
expenditure                     increase of 11.7 percent. As a result, the government generated a primary deficit
                                (excluding grants) of 0.3 percent of GDP during FY16 compared to 0.6 percent in
                                FY15.24

                                24   However, an amount of Rs. 212 billion (0.7 percent of GDP) has been parked in the statistical
                                     discrepancy – if included, it raises the deficit of the consolidated government by 0.7 percentage of
                                     GDP to 5.3 percent of GDP. Statistical discrepancies have increased significantly in the past few
                                     years. It will be important to monitor this in the future as it may have implications for the overall
                                     fiscal stance of the government.

FY16 has seen a               The total revenue of the consolidated government improved in FY16 due to a
strong increase in            strong performance by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR). FBR tax collection25
FBR revenue due               grew by 20 percent, surpassing its target of Rs. 3,104 billion by Rs. 8 billion (see
to reduced tax                Table 2). Progress in reducing tax expenditures by removing concessions granted
expenditures and              through statutory regulatory orders (SROs) have contributed to this strong
higher customs                performance.26 Recent initiatives such as the withholding tax on immovable
duty collections              property transactions based on improved valuations will also contribute to
                              increased revenues in the near future. However, it is important to flag that direct
                              taxes continue to underperform and FBR has significantly increased its reliance on
                              custom duties27. To compensate for below-target performance during the first
                              quarter of FY16, the government resorted to increasing import taxes to cover the
                              gap.28 Pakistan’s average tariff rates remain very high (see Section A3). These high
                              tariffs are protecting inefficient domestic industries and amplifying the existing
                              anti-export bias (in part because it increases the cost of imported inputs for firms
                              hoping to join global value chains). The use of regulatory duties also makes the
                              tariff structure more complex, reversing the progress of previous tariff
                              simplification efforts.

Revenues are                  Sales tax continued to dominate tax collections, contributing more than 40
skewed towards                percent of FBR’s collections in FY16. Interestingly, more than one third of the
indirect taxation             sales tax collection from imports and domestic sales was from petroleum
and some                      products.29 Collection from direct taxes are low and much of it—about 70
measures may                  percent—has been gathered through the withholding mechanism. While all
have unintended               countries rely on a withholding mechanism to some extent, the unprecedented
consequences on               reliance in Pakistan suggests weaknesses in the direct tax collection mechanism.30

                              25 FBR tax collection comprises 85 percent of total tax revenues. Total tax revenues grew by 21.3
                                 percent in FY16 compared with the previous year.
                              26 About 1 percent of GDP has been recouped through removal of SRO concessions.
                              27 The share of customs duties in FBR taxes has increased from 10.6 percent in FY14 to 13.1 percent
                                 in FY16. This increasing trend has been evident since FY11.
                              28 These include: (i) imposition of regulatory duty in the range of 5 to 10 percent on 61 new imported
                                 items (projected to yield Rs. 4.5 billion); (ii) enhancing regulatory duty by 5 percent on 289 imported
                                 items (Rs. 4.5 billion); (iii) increasing Federal Excise Duty on cigarettes (Rs. 6.5 billion), (iv)
                                 additional one percent customs duty across the board except the exempted items (Rs. 21 billion); and
                                 (iv) additional regulatory duty on imported used and old cars (Rs. 2.5 billion).
                              29 Part of this performance can be attributed to increasing sales tax rate on petroleum products over the
                                 course of the year.
                              30 The level of direct taxes in Pakistan (33 percent of tax revenue) remains unfavorable compared to

                             compared to last year. These shortfalls created a gap that was not adequately met
                             by an increase in provincial non-tax revenue collection (by 23.4 percent) and
                             higher profits, interest and dividends received from PSEs and others (increasing
                             by almost Rs. 90 billion collectively).

Restraint in federal         Total expenditure of the consolidated government increased by 7.6 percent in
recurrent spending           FY16, in line with the previous year’s growth (see Table 4). Federal recurrent
has kept                     spending grew by only 3.5 percent due to a lower interest payment on domestic
expenditure                  debt (as a result of the benign interest rate environment). This, combined with a
growth relatively            marginal increase in defense spending and grants to provinces,31 compensated for
low, but the federal         higher growth in pension payments and grants to SoEs. On the other hand, the
deficit nonetheless          federal government directed significant resources towards Public Sector
exceeded its target          Development Program (PSDP) spending. Federal PSDP grew by almost 20
                             percent in FY16 while non-PSDP development spending (comprising largely of
                             the Benazir income support program, which accounts for 80 percent) contracted
                             by 7.8 percent. Similarly, net lending fell from Rs. 27 billion in FY15 to Rs. 13
                             billion in FY16. However, despite this effort, the federal fiscal deficit for FY16
                             stood at 5.75 percent of GDP – exceeding the target and representing a marginal
                             improvement of 0.2 percent of GDP over last year.


                              31   Together these three items constitute almost 60 percent of Federal recurrent expenditure.

Provinces fell short          The government’s fiscal consolidation program initially assumed that provincial
of their budgeted             governments would contribute a combined surplus of 0.9 percent of GDP (or Rs.
surpluses because             297 billion) in FY16. In reality, however, the provinces’ combined surplus stood
of high recurrent             at just 0.5 percent of GDP (or Rs. 142 billion). This was largely due to provinces
spending                      overspending on recurrent expenditures, which exceeded their budgets by
                              29 percent. Consistent with a recent trend, much of the growth in expenditure is
                              directed towards higher salaries and pensions, while almost all provinces were
                              unable to execute their development budgets in full. Provincial development
                              expenditure was 27 percent below budget, although it represented a 19 percent
                              increase on FY15. This gap can be attributed to Punjab (50 percent), KPK (29
                              percent) and Sindh (20 percent) while Balochistan was the only province to spend
                              more than it budgeted on the development side.

Pakistan’s                    Pakistan’s federal and provincial budgets feature high rigidity in recurrent
recurrent spending            spending compared with the rest of South Asia. Around two-thirds of
is highly rigid               consolidated recurrent expenditure is required for debt servicing, wage payments
                              and defense spending. After Sri Lanka, Pakistan has the most rigid recurrent
                              budget over the last five years (see Figure 5). It is partly because of this rigid
                              portion of expenditure that Pakistan has struggled to create the requisite fiscal
                              space to meet its public investment needs.

Total public debt                   Over the last five years, public debt has remained above the 60 percent limit
increased in FY16                   stipulated in the Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation Act (FRDLA) of 2005.
                                    As of end-June 2016, total public debt stood at 67.4 percent of GDP, an increase
                                    of 3.3 percentage points from June 2015 (see Figure 6). Domestic debt continued
                                    to dominate the total stock in FY16.32 However, foreign currency public debt also
                                    increased significantly by 1.6 percentage points. This was likely due to the slight
                                    depreciation of the Pakistani Rupee against US Dollar33, sizeable revaluation
                                    losses as a result of the depreciating US Dollar against Japanese Yen34,

current account           Table 5). The key drivers of continued progress are (i) growing workers’
deficit                   remittances which continue to offset the trade deficit and (ii) robust financial
                          inflows due to growing FDI and loan receipts from IFIs. Pakistan’s official reserves
                          reached US$ 18.2 billion by end June 2016, which are sufficient to cover almost 4
                          months of imports of goods and services. The nominal exchange rate experienced a
                          slight depreciation of 2.7 percent. Pakistan’s international credit rating also
                          improved.

Pakistan continues       Pakistan’s current and capital accounts yielded a combined deficit of US$ 2.9 billion
to be a net borrower     in FY16, increasing from US$ 2.3 billion in FY15. This occurred primarily due to a
                         larger trade deficit and lower receipts in the capital account compared to the
                         previous fiscal year. As a result, Pakistan continues to be a net borrower from the
                         rest of the world.

The trade deficit        Exports continued to shrink during FY16, recording a decline of 8.8 percent
widened and              compared to a 3.9 percent fall in FY15. FY16 imports also contracted by 2.3 percent
contributed to a         primarily due to lower international oil and commodity prices (see Table 5). This
higher current           resulted in a slight widening of the trade deficit as a percentage of GDP from 6.3
account deficit          percent in FY15 to 6.5 percent in FY16. Remittances, in line with the trend of the
                         last six years, grew solidly and reached an all-time high of US $19.9 billion—more
                         than offsetting the trade deficit. However, higher repatriation of profits led to an
                         increase in the primary income deficit. This resulted in an overall current account
                         deficit of US$ 3.3 billion—about US $0.6 billion higher than FY15.

Non-oil imports          Imports declined by 2.3 percent during FY16, compared with 0.9 percent in the
continued to rise in     previous year. Continuing the trend seen in FY15, this contraction can be attributed
FY16, offsetting the     to a decrease in the value of petroleum group imports—which declined by 35.5
decline in the value     percent (US$ 4.2 billion) in FY16.36 This was largely due to a 32.7 percent fall in
of petroleum imports     petroleum group prices.37 Non-oil imports other than agriculture saw an increase in
                         volume, which significantly diluted the impact of the declining value of oil imports.
                         In particular, imports of raw cotton and power-generating machinery increased
                         significantly as a result of a poor local cotton crop and ongoing investments in
                         energy throughout Pakistan.

Weak global demand       Pakistan’s exports declined again in FY16 as weak global demand exacerbated the
and persistent           effects of Pakistan’s long-term decline in export competitiveness. Food and textiles
competitiveness          are key contributors to Pakistan’s exports and continue to suffer from a decline in
issues resulted in a     international prices and demand. For example, although Pakistan exported more
sharp decline of         rice in FY16 than in FY15, the value of rice exports fell due to a decline in
Pakistan’s exports       international prices. The textiles sector, which accounted for 60 percent of total
                         exports during FY16, saw a contraction of 5.6 percent compared to FY15. This
                         decline was broad-based and affected both high- and low-value textile exports. The
                         only exceptions were knitwear and cotton carded, both of which grew due to higher
                         global prices in these sub-categories (see Figure 8).38 Although ‘Brexit’ has not yet
                         affected exports, the EU accounts for 23.4 percent of Pakistan’s exports and the
                         UK 7.4 percent, suggesting that potential future impacts could be significant.

Pakistan is losing its FY16 saw the continuation of a long-term decline in Pakistan’s share of global trade
share in international (see Figure 9). This has been driven by poor trade facilitation, infrastructure gaps,
trade                  inefficient logistics and a poor investment climate.39 Pakistan has also lagged behind
                       its competitors in trade openness, which reduces its prospects of regaining
                       momentum in export growth (See Figure 10).

Rising remittances                                    The secondary income surplus increased to US$ 23.3 billion during FY16 from
continue to support                                   US$ 22.0 billion in FY15. This increase is mainly supported by continuous growth
the current account                                   in workers’ remittances which grew by 6.4 percent during FY16 (see Figure 11).
                                                      These flows continue to play a major role curtailing the current account deficit by
                                                      financing about 49.2 percent of the import bill in FY16. However, growth in
                                                      remittances from GCC countries, which accounted for almost 65 percent of
                                                      remittances during FY16, has started to decelerate due to a slowdown in public
                                                      investment in these economies as oil prices remained depressed. Consequently,
                                                      remittance flows from GCCs grew by 6.0 percent in FY16 compared with a 24.1
                                                      percent increase in FY15. Remittances from the United Kingdom and the United
                                                      States, also major sources of remittance flows, displayed signs of slowing by
                                                      recording 8.5 percent and -6.7 percent growth respectively during FY16. The
                                                      slowdown in remittance flows has continued in Q1FY17, with remittances declining
                                                      by 5.4 percent compared to 4.0 percent growth in Q1FY16.

The financial                    The financial account recorded an inflow of US$ 5.5 billion (2.0 percent of GDP) in
account enjoyed                  FY16, reflecting an increase compared to last year’s US$ 5.0 billion (1.8 percent of
healthy inflows                  GDP). This increase can be attributed to (i) foreign direct investment of US$ 1.9
during FY16                      billion in FY16, US $1.0 billion higher than the previous year; and (ii) disbursements
                                 by multilateral development banks worth US $3.6 billion. FDI flows increased to 1.3
                                 percent of GDP in FY16, the highest rate since FY10 (see Figure 12). The dramatic
                                 increase in FDI cannot be taken at face value, however, as the data collection
                                 methodology was improved in FY16 compared with FY15.40 Notwithstanding this,
                                 there was a more-than-doubling of foreign investment from China in FY16, which
                                 is attributable to CPEC rather than the data update.41 These financial inflows more
                                 than offset the deficit in the current and capital accounts. As a result, official
                                 reserves reached US$ 18.2 billion by end-June 2016 from US$ 13.5 billion at end-
                                 June 2015 (see Figure 13).

The Pakistani Rupee Supported by strong foreign reserves accumulation, the Pakistani Rupee
was stable in FY16  experienced another year of stability with a small depreciation of about 2.7 percent
                    against the US dollar. A stable nominal exchange rate and relatively low inflation
                    resulted in the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) appreciating by 0.84 percent
                    in the period under review (see Figure 14).




                                 40 The government undertook a foreign investment survey during FY16 which identified previously
                                    unrecorded FDI arising from reinvested profits by foreign investors. The survey identified US$ 746
                                    million in reinvested profits (out of total FDI of US$ 1.9 billion). These reinvestments were mainly
                                    from financial, power and telecom sectors. See the footnote in SBP’s summary balance of payments:
                                    http://sbp.org.pk/ecodata/Balancepayment_BPM6.pdf.
                                 41 Net investment from China increased from US$ 257 million in FY15 to US$ 626 million in FY16.
                                    Because there are few established Chinese multinational firms operating in Pakistan, we can assume

                         borrowed about Rs. 791 billion from the banking system—Rs. 70 billion less than in
                         FY15 (see Table 6). The slower growth in government credit allowed for strong growth
                         of 12 percent in private sector credit. Private sector growth was aided by low interest
                         rates and improved economic activity. Continuous reserve accumulation by the central
                         bank resulted in an expansion of net foreign assets (NFA), although the growth was
                         slower than in the previous year.

SBP’s explicit          Liquidity conditions in the banking system tightened in FY16, driven by increased
targeting of policy     private sector credit demand, substantial borrowing by the government from
rates led to            scheduled banks to compensate for retirement to the central bank, and a higher
substantial liquidity   currency-deposit ratio. This is visible in the overnight repo rate, which on average
injections through      remained between the interest rate corridor ceiling and the policy rate. To keep the
open market             overnight rates closer to the explicit policy rate, SBP stepped up its liquidity
operations              injections through open market operations (OMOs). Figure 16 shows that SBP has
                        increased these injections since the beginning of FY16, when the new interest rate
                        corridor was implemented. The outstanding level of net OMO injections increased to
                        an average of Rs. 662.7 billion during FY16 compared to Rs. 343 billion in FY15.
                        SBP’s higher injections led to a reduction of the spread between the overnight repo
                        rate and the policy rate (see Figure 17).

year low in FY16,                                         FY16 due to a stable currency and falling international oil prices. Average inflation

government                                                      government borrowing. Commercial banks hold about Rs. 6.5 trillion of government

                                  continues to significantly reduce the risk-weighted assets of the banking system. As a

Bank profitability is             The significant pressures expected on bank profitability in the current low interest
deteriorating in a low            rate environment have been somewhat eased by a decline in deposit rates. As a

                                  trend is still expected to weaken on the back of lower yields on government
                                  securities (see Figure 22 for yield curve).

          1. Outlook
GDP is projected                Pakistan’s growth is expected to continue to accelerate, reaching 5 percent in
to grow at 5.0                  FY17 and 5.4 percent in FY18 (see Figure 23 and Table 9). On the demand side,
percent in FY17,                growth is expected to be primarily driven by public and private consumption,
reaching 5.4                    supported somewhat by a moderate increase in investment (see Figures 24, 25).
percent in FY18                 Pakistan’s low investment to GDP ratio is expected to increase due to
                                infrastructure projects under CPEC and other public investment. These projects,
                                if delivered on schedule, are expected to accelerate growth in the domestic
                                construction industry and expand electricity generation. Improved electricity
                                availability would, in turn, support growth in the industry and services sectors.

Current account           The current account deficit is expected to widen from 1.1 percent of GDP in FY16
deficit is projected to   to 1.7 percent in FY17. The key contributor to this will be a widening of the trade
widen in FY17 but         deficit due to moderate growth in exports (because of weak global demand and
strong financial          appreciation of the real exchange rate) and likely higher growth in imports (due to
flows will support        increased economic activity and a marginal rise in international oil prices). However,
reserve build up          ongoing remittance inflows will support the current account. It is also expected that
                          FDI flows will strengthen due to the accelerated implementation of CPEC projects.
                          Therefore, like previous years, foreign exchange reserves are projected to increase.

Fiscal consolidation      The fiscal deficit is projected to be 4.2 percent in FY17, 0.4 percentage point lower
is expected to            than the revised estimates of FY16, which already represented the lowest deficit in
continue                  nine years. This decline in consolidated fiscal deficit is primarily driven by an
                          increase in government tax revenues (both federal and provincial) and a further
                          rationalization of government current expenditures including subsidies. The
                          provinces are also expected to supply a small surplus to support this effort. Federal
                          and provincial governments are, however, expected to continue increasing their
                          development expenditures. See Section C4 for a further discussion of the FY17
                          federal budget.

Inflation is expected     Inflation has already bottomed out. Projected increases in economic activity and an
to rise moderately        expected marginal rise in global oil prices will push up domestic prices. Inflation is
                          projected to grow from 2.9 percent in FY16 to 4.6 percent in FY17 and 5.0 percent
                          in FY18.

      2. Progress and next steps on structural reform
Three years into its      Over the past three years, Pakistan has successfully implemented an economic
tenure, the               reform agenda with a strong focus on achieving macroeconomic stability,
government                achieving both external and internal balance. As a result, Pakistan was able to
continues to              complete a stabilization program with the International Monetary Fund after
implement an              several failed attempts. The three-year Extended Fund Facility, which closed in
ambitious economic        September 2016, contributed to significant improvements in reducing fiscal deficits
reform program            and the accumulation of reserves. Structural reforms supported in this program
                          focused on energy sector reforms, privatization and improvements to the business
                          environment. Acknowledging the significant progress made over the past three
                          years, there remains a significant agenda of economic reform to be implemented—
                          and the government continues to be committed to its implementation.

Energy reforms have       Energy subsidies and the accumulation of arrears in the energy sector pose fiscal
reduced load-             costs and risks, while insufficient amounts of energy limit the ability of the
shedding, losses and      economy to prosper. The government’s plans to reform the energy sector were laid
subsidies but delays      out in its July 2013 policy, including raising electricity tariffs while reducing
in the privatization of   subsidies and reforms to improve technical and commercial efficiency. There has
distribution              been progress: at the end of FY16 government reported losses at 17.9 percent,
companies may affect      down from 18.6 percent in FY13, while bill collections rose from 88.7 percent to
the sustainability of     94.6 percent over the same period. Load shedding now averages about 6 hours a
these results             day and has been largely eliminated for industry. The government has also
                          managed to attract significant private investment into electricity generation,
                          especially through the China Pakistan Economic Corridor program. Investments in
                          transmission, on the other hand, will mostly be public and are urgently needed to
                          cope with the pipeline of new generation projects. Delays in the sale of three of
                          the best-performing distribution companies in Faisalabad, Lahore and Islamabad,
                          and the government’s preference to sell shares through Initial Public Offerings
                          (IPOs), means that a different approach will have to be adopted. Investment in
                          distribution to reduce technical losses and improve metering, billing and collection
                          is badly needed and is now likely to fall on the public purse.

Pakistan is also          Over the past three years, Pakistan has renewed efforts to develop its financial sector
implementing a far-       and increase access to finance. The government’s National Financial Inclusion Strategy
reaching reform of its    (NFIS), developed in FY15, has provided a comprehensive framework for reform
financial sector          efforts on financial inclusion and aims to increase access to finance for underserved
                          market segments such as women, SMEs, and rural geographies. Several weaknesses in
                          basic financial sector infrastructure and in the legal and judicial framework have
                          constrained lending to the private sector, including: the absence of an appropriate
                          insolvency framework; deficiencies in credit information; the lack of a secured
                          transactions framework and electronic collateral registry for moveable collateral; and
                          difficulties in enforcing collateral outside of the judicial system. Recent measures taken
                          to redress long-standing legislative issues include amendments to the Financial
                          Institutions (Recovery of Finance) Ordinance 2001 to improve the recovery of NPLs
                          without court intervention; enactment of a new legal framework for secured transactions;
                          passage of a new and strengthened Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan
                          Act; enhancements to the Credit Bureau Act; and passage of the Deposit Protection
                          Corporation Bill to implement a deposit insurance scheme. Reforms have also focused
                          on broadening the financial sector. Pakistan Microfinance Investment Company has
                          been set up as the wholesale microfinance lender, non-bank financial institutions
                          (NBFI) regulations have been modernized, and the stock exchanges have been
                          demutualized and unified under a stronger governance and risk management
                          framework.

Institutional and          There is a need to continue efforts to strengthen and diversify the financial sector
legislative reforms        and improve its governance and transparency. The legislative agenda includes the
will need to continue      Corporate Rehabilitation Bill, which deals with bankruptcy, and the Deposit
in the financial sector    Protection Corporation Bill, a deposit insurance scheme. Institutional reforms
                           include the setup of the Pakistan Development Fund (to finance infrastructure) and
                           the unified Shariah Board for the financial sector. Together, these reforms will
                           contribute to a stronger and more inclusive financial sector.

Fiscal reforms have        Tax revenues have increased from 10 percent of GDP in FY13 to 12.4 percent in
successfully               FY16. This progress was achieved through a combination of eliminating tax
increased revenues;        exemptions and strengthening tax administration. The successes in broadening the
the government will        tax net have been more mixed—only a very small number of Pakistani businesses
continue with a            and people pay taxes, and this number has increased only slightly in recent years.
gradual fiscal             Going forward, efforts may need to focus on strengthening the authorities’
consolidation effort       capacity to monitor and enforce compliance through market analysis, access to
                           data and information as well as increased recourse to tax compliance audits. A
                           careful examination of the balance of revenue sources may also be helpful,
                           including the mix of direct and indirect taxes and the impact on other policy

                           of regulatory duties. The provinces’ contribution to tax revenues remains limited,
                           with several taxes under the responsibility of the provinces (agricultural income
                           tax, urban property taxes) significantly underperforming. Improved coordination
                           between the federal government and the provinces (and among provinces) will be
                           necessary to deal with double taxation and increasing tax compliance costs. On the
                           expenditure side, recent amendments to the Fiscal Responsibility and Debt
                           Limitation Act will contribute to medium term debt sustainability but it will be
                           necessary to continue strengthening debt management given persistently high debt
                           levels and high financing costs.

results                    affect the country’s competitiveness. The 2013 Enterprise Survey conducted by the
                           World Bank identified infrastructure and electricity, corruption and governance,
                           and taxes as major constraints to private sector investment. The economic reform
                           program being implemented by the government addresses a number of these
                           constraints. Similarly, recent reforms in the financial sector (see above) will also
                           have a positive impact on the business environment. The federal and provincial
                           governments have developed a joint time-bound action plan to improve the
                           investment climate and start addressing some of the key constraints for doing
                           business (accessing credit, starting a business, registering property). The
                           government has also simplified the tariff structure, bringing the tariff slabs from
                           six to four. Results of tariff simplification efforts have been more mixed, though,
                           with the simple average tariff reducing only slightly from 14.4 percent in FY13 to
                           13.4 percent in FY16. While tariffs declined marginally, the use of regulatory duties
                           expanded significantly (in order to achieve revenue targets), with almost 10 percent
                           of imports paying regulatory duties in FY15, up from below 1 percent in FY13.
                           The tension between revenue objectives and trade competitiveness may warrant

      3. Progress on social indicators
Progress is mixed on Pakistan’s progress on social indicators over the last decade has been mixed. While
social indicators over monetary poverty has fallen substantially, improvements in stunting, education and
the last decade        health indicators remain sluggish. The following discussion draws on the indicators
                       listed in Annex A.

Pakistan has had        Pakistan has made significant progress in reducing poverty over the last decade.
great success in        Based on the poverty line set in 2001, the percentage of people living below the
lowering poverty        poverty line decreased from 34.6 percent in FY02 to less than 10 percent in FY14.
                        Moreover, these gains in income were shared with everyone; even the poorest 5
                        percent of the population saw real improvements. Data from the household income
                        and expenditure survey (HIES) shows that in the year 2001, some 14 percent of the
                        population had a real per capita expenditure level of Rs. 550 per person per month.
                        By 2014, this was down to just 2 percent. In April 2016, the government announced
                        a new national poverty line, which sets a higher standard for wellbeing at the
                        poverty line, identifying 29.5 percent of the population as poor (see Section C1).

Maternal and infant     Pakistan is moving in the right direction—albeit slowly—on reducing maternal and
mortality rates are     infant mortality rates. The infant mortality rate fell from 80 to 66 deaths per 1000
also slowly             births between 2005 and 2015, while maternal mortality fell from 249 to 178 per
improving               100,000 live births. Life expectancy at birth has also improved for both males and
                        females.

Nutrition and water     Rates of stunting (a nutritional deficiency also called chronic malnutrition), however,
& sanitation            have remained extremely high, and have not changed much over recent decades—
outcomes have           Pakistan now has the third highest number of stunted children in the world at 43.7
shown little            percent, and the highest stunting rate in South Asia (see Section C2). As stunting is
improvement over        strongly correlated with access to safe drinking water and availability of adequate
the last decade         sanitation facilities, Pakistan needs to prioritize improvements in these services. The
                        current situation of water and sanitation facilities is clearly insufficient to reduce
                        stunting to its desired levels. Although the number of households with access to an
                        improved water source has remained more or less stagnant over the past 15 years,
                        the percentage of households with access to piped water or tap water has reduced
                        over time. The proportion of households with access to piped water fell from 29
                        percent in 2005 to 27 percent in 2010, while the percentage of households with
                        access to tap water fell from 34 percent in 2005 to 32 percent in 2010, and to a
                        further 27 percent by 2015. Sanitation facilities also show a similar picture, where
                        the percentage of households with a flush toilet has increased from 52 percent to 73
                        percent between 2005 and 2015, but the proportion of households that have a
                        flushing toilet connected to a piped sewerage system is still less than one quarter.

Significant gains       While education indicators improved in the early 2000s, they have largely stagnated
were achieved in        since 2010. For instance, literacy rates increased from 53 percent to 58 percent
education in the        between 2005 and 2010 but have remained within the 58 to 60 percent range since
early 2000s but         2010. Similarly, gross and net enrollment rates for both primary and middle school
progress has stalled    saw an increase between 2005 and 2010, but have stayed more or less constant
                        thereafter. More importantly, gross enrollment rates for middle and secondary
                        school still remain low at 62 percent and 58 percent respectively in 2015.

The quality of         Available data suggests that the quality of education has also not improved in recent
education has also     years. Learning outcomes—as measured by the proportion of year five students
failed to improve      who can read a story in Urdu, Sindhi or Pashto—has seen little change since 2010,
                       hovering around 50 percent. Moreover, a large number of schools in Pakistan still
                       lack basic facilities like drinking water, electricity and toilets. At the national level, 52
                       percent of the schools are equipped with electricity, running water, toilets and a
                       boundary wall.

Provinces have had     Pakistan’s provinces have experienced very different levels of progress in human
varying success at     development over the last decade. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) seems to have made
improving social       the most progress in a number of areas. The gross primary enrolment rate in the
indicators over the    province increased three percentage points between 2010 and 2015, in a period
last decade            when other provinces were deteriorating. The child immunization rate in KP
                       increased from 40 percent in 2005 to 53 percent in 2013 and 58 percent in 2015, the
                       largest increase of all provinces over that time period. Sindh, on the other hand,
                       appears to be flat-lining across the same indicators. Child immunization was lower
                       in 2015 than it was in 2005 (45 and 46 percent respectively) and the gross primary
                       enrolment rate also fell from 82 percent in 2010 to 79 percent in 2015. Stunting in
                       Sindh also remains very high. Sindh continues to face large differences in urban and
                       rural outcomes, which are most stark in water and sanitation where only 31 percent
                       of rural households have a flushing toilet compared with 97 percent of urban
                       households. Only 23 percent of Sindh schools are equipped with basic facilities
                       compared with 93 percent in Punjab, 44 percent in KP and 26 percent in
                       Balochistan.

Punjab has had         The data suggests that Punjab is also stagnant in some of the social outcomes over

Balochistan has        progress on child malnutrition (particularly stunting), as well as child immunization
struggled              and rural sanitation while making little or no progress on enrolment rates and the
                       quality of learning outcomes. Balochistan has struggled to increase its particularly
                       poor outcomes, seeing a deterioration in learning outcomes (only 33 percent of year
                       5 children could read a story in 2014) and child immunization.

Gender equality is     Progress on women’s empowerment is also mixed. While gender inequalities persist,
improving somewhat     women are slowly participating more in education and work. Female labor force
– from a low base –    participation is slowly increasing, albeit from a low base (from 19.3 percent in 2005
in education and the   to 24.8 percent in 2014) and more girls are completing lower secondary. The ratio of
workforce              female to male literacy is steadily improving, with seven literate women for every ten
                       literate men in 2015. This ratio differs wildly across provinces, however, with
                       Balochistan exhibiting only four literate women for every ten literate men.

Population growth is   Looking forward, population growth presents a key challenge for all areas of human

                       to take a long-term view if services are to capture a greater share of a growing
                       population while also improving quality.

1. Poverty in Pakistan: settling an old debate and establishing a
   more inclusive poverty line
Until April 2016, the most recent official poverty data available in Pakistan were from FY06. The
Government of Pakistan, supported by the World Bank, recently undertook a validation exercise to
substantiate the poverty data from the intervening years, identify key shortcomings in the methodology and
to lay out the next steps for creating a credible and autonomous system for monitoring poverty and inclusion.
This exercise found that Pakistan has indeed achieved remarkable success in reducing poverty from 34.7
percent to 9.3 percent between 2001 and 2014 (using the poverty line determined in 2001). This success, and
changing community perceptions of wellbeing, led the government to update its poverty measurement
methodology and define a new, more inclusive poverty line in April 2016. The new poverty line identifies 29.5
percent of the population and 6.8 to 7.6 million households as poor, setting a higher, more inclusive standard
for pro-poor policies. This note discusses the evidence corroborating the fall in poverty, explores two
important critiques of the declining poverty trend and finishes with a description of the new methodology
and the resulting poverty trend.49

Pakistan has seen a      Using the poverty line set by the government in 2001, the percentage of people
steep decline in         under the poverty line has fallen from 34.7 percent in FY02 to well under 10
poverty since 200150     percent in FY1451—a 75 percent reduction in poverty over 14 years (see Table 10
                         and Figure 27).

                            Bureau of Statistics (PBS) to produce national, regional and provincial poverty rates. The data is

and administrative            While there were a number of reasons for this, including the changing political

concerns have been                   The first is the suggestion that the decline in the share of food in the poor
raised regarding the                 households’ budgets has occurred due to a ‘food squeeze’ rather than an increase in
declining poverty                    wellbeing. The second is that the CPI data used to inflate the poverty line
trend                                underestimates inflation, particularly for poorer households. The following
                                     addresses each in turn.

Is there evidence of a The ‘food squeeze’ argument stems from the lack of improvement in nutritional

                       improvement in child stunting and wasting indicators? This line of argument
                       assumes that nutritional deficits are due to a lack of access to adequate food, both in
                       terms of quantity and quality. However, there is now a considerable body of
                       research suggesting that the link between food availability and nutritional status is
                       weak, and is mediated by the ambient disease environment and the quality of water
                       and sanitation.

                            detrimental heath behaviors in households and communities, it is unclear that a rise

Calorie-consumption         The final question in exploring a possible food squeeze is whether the poor
decreased, but this         consumed fewer calories over the reference period. While measured calories in the
was due to a shift          HIES did indeed decrease over time—only in rural areas across all income
from cereals to more        quintiles—the wealthiest rural quintile reduced their calories the most. Further, the
nutritious foods            only items for which calories declined were cereals, which are also the cheapest
                            foods. Rural households apparently chose to move away from cheap calorie-dense
                            foods towards more nutritious and lower-calorie foods—and their consumption
                            patterns also became more closely aligned to those of urban households.

There is no evidence        Ultimately, a ‘food squeeze’ story does not appear to be credible for Pakistan. A
of a food squeeze—          more likely explanation of the reduced calories is that food consumed away from
surveys need to             home—a category of expenditure that is currently poorly captured in the HIES—
better capture food         has increased substantially as poverty has fallen and labor has moved into non-farm
consumed away from          work. Non-agricultural wage workers tend to purchase their lunchtime meals, and
home                        roti and daal is the most common lunchtime meal among workers!

Does the CPI                The CPI is used to inflate Pakistan’s 2001 poverty line to current-year values. Some

perceptions change      aligns it with perceptions of what is required for a basic level of wellbeing in a
                        country that is undergoing rapid changes. It is precisely Pakistan’s success in
                        reducing poverty on the 2001 metric that made this the right time for raising the bar
                        on whom is considered disadvantaged, thereby committing to a more robust
                        response to poverty and exclusion. Setting a new poverty threshold also allowed for
                        a re-evaluation of the estimation methodology to bring it in line with international
                        best practice.

The FY02 poverty        Pakistan’s poverty line was last determined in FY02 using the Food Energy Intake
line used the Food      (FEI) method, with a reference group that included the bottom three quintiles of
Energy Intake           the distribution of consumption expenditure. It was anchored to a minimum caloric
method                  threshold of 2,350 calories per adult equivalent per day. The FEI method assumed
                        that the expenditure level at which 2,350 calories can be consumed by the reference
                        group covers necessary food and non-food expenditures adequately. This approach
                        produced a poverty line of Rs. 723.40 per adult equivalent per month in 2001, which
                        produced a headcount rate of 34.6 percent at the time.

and better captures     thereby excluding both the poorest and the wealthiest households as recommended
non-food needs          by best practice. It retained the normative metric of 2,350 calories per person per
                        day to maintain consistency. For a country like Pakistan, the Food and Agricultural
                        Organization (FAO) recommends a daily caloric threshold of 2,150 calories per
                        person per day, so the standard set in Pakistan substantially exceeds FAO’s

2. Overcoming Pakistan’s nutrition challenge: An essential step for a
   healthy economic future
Pakistan has the third-highest rate of stunting in the world and, unlike its regional peers, has not made
progress on nutrition indicators in recent decades. Poor nutrition exerts a heavy toll on health outcomes and
economic activity, and Pakistan’s stunting rates are likely driving significant economic losses. Pakistan’s public
policy discourse has begun to give more attention to nutrition in recent years, and small but growing shares of
provincial and federal budgets are being diverted to nutrition-specific interventions. However, a concerted
effort at all levels of government is necessary to exert a meaningful impact on national stunting rates. This
brief provides an overview of Pakistan’s undernutrition challenge, discusses the economic implications of
widespread malnutrition and concludes with current policy initiatives and priorities going forward.54

Pakistan’s stunting       Around the world, undernutrition represents the single largest killer of under-five
rate is among the         children, and is responsible for the death of 3.1 million children each year, or nearly
highest in the world      half the total.55,56 Globally approximately 162 million children under the age of 5
                          years are stunted. Pakistan accounts for up to 12 million of this total, and its
                          stunting prevalence of 43.7 percent57 represents the highest in South Asia and third
                          highest in the world (see Figure 34). A growing body of evidence suggests that
                          addressing the nutrition challenge will be essential to ensure a healthy economic
                          future for Pakistan.

                          1,000 days, also called the ‘window of opportunity’. Chronic malnutrition affects an
                          individual’s health and increases morbidity and mortality, brain development,
                          intelligence, educability, and productivity. Beyond the age of two years stunting is
                          irreversible. In brief, malnutrition has severe consequences on an individual’s
                          wellbeing and on a nation’s socio-economic development as a whole.

                          children reach their full physical and cognitive capacity to lead a healthy and
                          productive life.

Malnutrition is         The causes of malnutrition in Pakistan are complex. Immediate determinants are
caused by disease       related to disease and inadequate food intake, which are in turn caused by
and inadequate food     inadequate care and feeding practices, poor hygiene and sanitary practices, access to
intake, which are       health services, and unhealthy household environments. Some of these factors may
affected by water       be exacerbated by the low rates of female literacy. Over 20 percent of the rural
quality, feeding        population and 82 percent of the lowest income quintile in Pakistan defecate in the
practices, sanitation   open.62 Stunting rates are exacerbated by unfavorable infant and young child feeding
practices and poor      practices (only 12.8 percent of children are exclusively breastfed63) and poor
maternal health         maternal factors such as early and frequent pregnancies, inadequate diet, and a lack
                        of access to proper health care. These factors are further complicated by low birth
                        weight (LBW, newborns weighing less than 2,500 grams at birth), high rates of open
                        defecation and high rates of maternal underweight. The prevalence of stunting is
                        markedly higher in children with LBW than those with normal birth weights; in
                        Pakistan, LBW is both alarmingly high64 and deteriorating (increasing from 25
                        percent of newborns in 1996 to 32 percent in 2008)65.

cost                    Research shows that stunted children start schooling later and are less likely to go
                        on to higher education or graduate.66 Studies have also shown that non-stunted
                        children earn up to 40 percent more in adulthood and are 33 percent more likely to
                        escape poverty, compared with stunted children.67,68 As a result, populations with
                        higher rates of stunting face significant annual GDP losses.

Malnutrition reduces                 Malnutrition slows economic growth and perpetuates poverty through three routes;
labor productivity                   i) direct losses in individuals’ productivity from a poor physical state; ii) indirect
directly and                         losses from poor cognitive developments and deficits prior to and during schooling
indirectly, and drives               including the consequent lower skill level of the future workforce; and iii) losses due
higher health care                   to increased health care costs as a result of the higher morbidity and mortality
costs                                associated with undernutrition in early childhood, including from non-

major economic                       education and health is one of the lowest in South Asia (less than 3 percent of GDP
challenge                            combined), and allocations to nutrition are modest. Historically, nutrition—as well
                                     as early childhood education and development—have received little attention in
                                     Pakistan. The attention nutrition has received has been delivered through a project-

                                     donors and implemented by NGOs.

But impetus is          Political awareness of nutrition has, however, grown in recent years as leaders have
building for action     recognised the potential of nutrition to reduce poverty through improved human
on nutrition            and social capital. The release of the National Nutrition Survey 2011 by the Ministry
                        of Planning, Development and Reforms (MoPDR) and the decision to join the
                        global movement of Scaling-Up-Nutrition (SUN) in 2013 underscored the
                        government’s commitment to addressing this issue. Nutrition became an important
                        subject of Pakistan’s Vision 2025, and the MoPDR established a secretariat to
                        coordinate and support its scaling-up. Development partners have jointly carried
                        out a dialogue on undernutrition and prepared policy papers to support each
                        province to develop inter-sectoral nutrition strategies. In FY16, Pakistan allocated
                        1.06 percent of consolidated federal and provincial budget expenditure to nutrition-
                        specific interventions,74 an encouraging improvement from the previous year’s
                        allocation of 0.34 percent75. As a comparison, most developing countries are
                        spending less than 1 percent of their budgets on nutrition and, similarly, nutrition
                        accounts for less than 1 percent of official development assistance76.

Federal and             Following the 2010 devolution of responsibilities from federal to provincial
provincial              governments, Pakistan’s provinces have put in place institutional arrangements and

                        WB with contributions from Australian Department of Foreign Affairs & Trade
                        (DFAT) and UK’s Department of International Development (DFID) provides
                        grants to fund selected key interventions. The World Bank is also making significant
                        funding available to support nutrition-specific and multi-sectoral actions in Sindh
                        and Punjab and has recently provided technical support to the governments of
                        Sindh and Punjab to develop a more ambitious multi-sectoral response, increasing
                        investment in early years. In addition, the EU is providing financial support for
                        nutrition in four districts of Sindh and USAID is supporting Sindh in another four
                        districts.

programs, focusing     include:
on needy districts     • Ensure that provincial governments commit the required resources, build
and effective               institutional structures and capacities to plan and implement quality services at
institutional               scale.
coordination           • Establish high-level political coordination committees at federal and provincial
                            levels that include a diverse group of stakeholders. Strengthened institutional
                            structures are urgently required to implement, coordinate, supervise and
                            monitor the varied multi-sectoral activities to improve nutrition. A successful
                            coordination mechanism would need sufficient influence to be able to create
                            accountability within line ministries and the capacity to enable coordination
                            between development partners.
                       • Expand and scale up well-proven direct nutrition interventions targeted to
                            vulnerable populations and the ‘golden 1,000 days’, and implement—through a
                            phased approach—additional nutrition-sensitive interventions focusing on the
                            50 most under-developed districts of south Punjab, north/south Sindh,
                            Balochistan and south KP in the next two to three years with full expansion in
                            five years.
                       • Employ bolder and innovative interventions on a large scale including greater
                            use of private sector skills, conditional cash transfer programs targeted to the
                            poor, and multi-sectoral interventions with priority to health, water and
                            sanitation, nutrition-sensitive agriculture, education and early childhood
                            development, and social protection.
                       • Significantly enhance Pakistan’s own investment in nutrition programs as well
                            as seeking support from development partners.

action on              challenge. Following the 2010 devolution of responsibilities to provincial
malnutrition           governments, momentum around nutrition has built steadily: nutrition is part of the
                       Pakistan Vision 2025 and provincial strategies are in place. Pakistan’s FY16
                       allocation to nutrition-specific interventions was an encouraging improvement from
                       the previous year and programs are now being rolled out in a number of districts.
                       This impetus needs to continue, with additional attention on the critical
                       interventions outlined above. Nutrition interventions also need to be complemented
                       by other investments in the early years, including in early childhood education. An
                       increased funding commitment from the government will be of utmost importance.

3. Karachi City Diagnostic: livability, sustainability and growth in
   the city of Karachi
Karachi’s population and economy have grown rapidly since Pakistan’s independence in 1947. It is the
country’s economic hub, and a strong industrial base. Yet the city’s infrastructure and institutions have failed
to keep pace with its physical growth. Karachi is ranked as one of the least livable cities in the world. It is
characterized by informal settlements in central areas and on the fringes, a proliferation of informal service
providers, a highly centralized but fragmented governance structure, and declining manufacturing and trade
sectors. The city’s security and livability are also under threat from regional conflicts in northwest Pakistan
and Afghanistan, organized crime linked to drugs- and arms-trade, and social and ethnic tensions stemming
from multiple waves of immigration. The Karachi City Diagnostic (KCD), prepared jointly by the World
Bank and the Government of Sindh, is a comprehensive effort to highlight the metropolitan region’s key
challenges and opportunities, through comprehensive data collection on physical infrastructure, business
environment, social inclusion and livability. The KCD presents a number of recommendations to elevate
Karachi to “world-class city” status, based on three pathways for transformation: growth and prosperity;
livability, and sustainability and inclusiveness78.

                         employment in Karachi. Finance and real estate also play an important role in the
                         economy.

least livable cities in       Urban planning, management and service delivery have not kept pace with
the world due to              population growth. The city may be headed towards a spatially unsustainable,
poor services and             inefficient, and unlivable form. More than half the residents live in informal
urban planning                settlements, or katchi abadis, which grow at double the rate of the city at large. Public
                              open spaces and cultural heritage sites are under threat from modern, high density
                              luxury developments. Other new formal developments have begun to leapfrog past
                              city limits, eschewing underutilized sites near the center and on the waterfront (see
                              Figure 40). A critical spatial mismatch is emerging between this new peripheral
                              development and the high-skilled jobs concentrated in the central business districts.

                              uncoordinated, with a persistent focus on extension over preventive maintenance or
                              rehabilitation. These agencies also control nearly 90 percent of land in Karachi, but
                              are reluctant to make it available for development.

A comprehensive               No cohesive transportation policy exists for Karachi, even as a thousand new
transport policy              vehicles are added to the roads each day. Traffic congestion and road safety are both

to address Karachi’s          upon by vendor carts and stalls. There is also no official public transit system. Other
significant                   forms of mass transportation (minibuses, rickshaws, etc.) account for 42 percent of
congestion and                travelers but just 5 percent of vehicles, and shrinking. Walking remains the

Similarly, a formal       Karachi is experiencing a water and sewerage crisis that stems largely from
policy for water          governance shortfalls. Neither Karachi nor Sindh province has a formal policy for
supply and sewerage       water supply and sanitation. Financing is typically ad hoc and aimed at addressing
is needed                 immediate needs, rather than achieving long-term goals. Only 55 percent of water
                          requirements are met daily. Rationing is widespread, and leakages and large scale
                          theft is common. Non-revenue water from physical losses reached 192 million
                          gallons per day (43 percent of revenues), not counting commercial losses from
                          unmetered water provision. Private tankers are a major source of water supply,
                          especially in informal settlements. Karachiites also face limited access to sewerage
                          and solid waste management. Up to 475 million gallons of raw sewage are
                          discharged into the sea each day, including hazardous materials and untreated
                          industrial effluent. Less than half of estimated solid waste is collected and
                          transported to open dumpsites. Reaching full coverage would require a three-fold
                          increase in expenditures. However, reform efforts have been initiated—a new Sindh
                          Solid Waste Management Board was established recently with comprehensive
                          authority over the sector.

Karachi needs a          Karachi must act quickly and resolutely to preserve its central position as Pakistan’s
programmatic,            main growth pole and window to the world. The City Diagnostic underlines the
phased approach to       structural nature of the city’s challenges. Karachi faces a complex political
address its deeply       environment, ad-hoc planning, poor governance, and weak financial and
structural challenges    institutional capacities. Failing to address issues in a timely manner would exacerbate
                         the infrastructure and service deficit. Yet there is high potential for Karachi’s
                         transformation into a world class metropolitan region through economic growth
                         and prosperity, livability, sustainability and inclusiveness. What is needed is a
                         programmatic, phased approach aligned with the Karachi City Development Plan
                         2020.

This phased            Strategic pillars to transform Karachi into a world-class metropolitan region
approach should
include four strategic 1. Inclusive, coordinated, and accountable institutions. Create strong
pillars                    coordination mechanisms among public land owners and service delivery
                           agencies. Support activities to help agencies’ ability to plan, finance and manage
                           programs. Empower local agencies to take the lead in city management.
                       2. Greening for sustainability and resilience. Close infrastructure gaps and
                           safeguard funds for maintenance. Put in place buffers to protect vulnerable
                           groups from the negative impacts of growth and climate change. Build a
                           resilient and sustainable environment with an emphasis on livability,
                           regeneration and transformation.
                       3. Leveraging economic, social and environmental assets. Involve the private
                           sector in infrastructure provision. Develop stronger incentives for more
                           efficient performance, innovative financing, and new technology adoption.
                           Improve the ease of doing business and encourage PPPs. Reduce delays and
                           discretionary power for key business transactions under city and provincial
                           authority. Improve cost recovery and revenue collection for basic services while
                           safeguarding vulnerable groups. Leverage land assets to finance key
                           infrastructure for growth.
                       4. Creating a smart Karachi. Innovate with smart policies to manage services,
                           enhance competitiveness, facilitate engagement, and improve investment
                           projects. Use assets creatively, efficiently, and sustainably.

4. The FY17 Federal Budget
The FY17 federal budget continues the government’s fiscal consolidation efforts in the federal recurrent
budget and an emphasis on revenue mobilization. The targeted fiscal balance will, however, depend on
provincial government surpluses and continuation of the federal government’s energy sector reforms. On the
expenditure side, an expected fall in interest payments and non-provincial grants has created space for an
increase in infrastructure spending.80

                      a . F Y 17 fisc a l b a la n c e

The consolidated          The FY17 budget aims to reduce the overall fiscal deficit to 3.8 percent of GDP, 0.8
fiscal deficit is         percentage points lower than revised estimates of FY16 (see Table 14). The budget
expected to fall by       suggests this outcome would be achieved through a 1 percent of GDP increase in
0.8 percent of GDP        total revenues and a 0.2 percent of GDP increase in expenditure. The revenue
                          increase will be driven by higher tax revenues at both the federal and provincial
                          level, which counteract a decline in non-tax revenues of 0.5 percent of GDP.

But this outcome is       The fiscal outcome will, however, be dependent on provincial surpluses and the
dependent on              federal government’s efforts to reduce subsidies to SOEs. The federal government
significant reduction     aims to achieve a 4.8 percent of GDP federal budget deficit by cutting recurrent
in support to SOEs        spending by 0.7 percent of GDP. The cuts in recurrent spending fall largely in three
and provincial            areas: lower interest payments (0.2 percent of GDP), significantly lower subsidies
government                (0.5 percent of GDP), and lower grants to SOEs. The reduced spending on
surpluses                 subsidies and grants to SOEs will depend on the government’s efforts to reduce
                          electricity subsidies. The consolidated surplus will similarly rely upon a provincial
                          government surplus of 1 percent of GDP. The federal government’s recent 10
                          percent ad hoc relief allowance on civil servants’ pay is likely to be emulated by
                          provinces, perhaps putting at risk the expected surplus.

A new legislative         The federal government plans to establish a permanent ceiling on the federal fiscal
ceiling on the federal    deficit through a proposed amendment of the Fiscal Responsibility and Debt
fiscal deficit will be    Limitation Act (FRDLA); the significant challenge of implementing this ceiling has
very challenging to       been left to the next elected government. The proposed amendment would limit the
implement                 federal fiscal deficit – excluding foreign grants – to 4 percent of GDP during the
                          three years from FY18, and to 3.5 percent of GDP thereafter. This will represent a
                          significant reduction; deficits over the last five years have averaged 6.7 percent of
                          GDP. Several gaps in the legislation will also make it harder to implement: the
                          amendments did not reduce institutional fragmentation in debt management, codify
                          borrowing purposes, strengthen the escape clause or include sanctions for missing
                          stipulated targets. Moreover, recurrent spending at the federal level appears to be
                          very rigid. Over the past five years, almost 60 percent of the federal government’s
                          recurrent spending has been comprised of defense and interest payments.

                          on last year’s performance, the proposed revenue effort may be achievable.
                          However, much of it will be delivered through an increasing reliance on direct
                          taxation, which accounts for 83 percent of the revenue expected from the new
                          measures. Measures related to federal GST will generate 32 percent of additional
                          revenue while customs duties are projected to contribute 9 percent. Much of this
                          increase will be delivered by eliminating a portion of SROs exempting various
                          entities from income tax, sales tax and customs duties. This will significantly
                          broaden the tax base. On the other hand, non-tax revenues are expected to decline
                          by 0.5 percent of GDP compared with FY16 revised estimates. This is largely due to
                          a fall in SBP profits, defense receipts and a significant fall in royalties from crude oil
                          and natural gas.

Some tax measures         Several of the Finance Bill’s tax measures have been criticized by provinces as
are unpopular with        unconstitutional. The first will require provincial governments to withhold federal
provincial                taxes from those who are registered for provincial sales tax but do not file federal
governments               tax returns. This could create a disincentive for people to pay provincial taxes, and
                          would have benefitted from further consultations at the appropriate forum. The
                          second controversial measure will deny GST input credits in relation to services,
                          thereby increasing the cost of doing business and the price of finished goods. This
                          step will also dilute the benefits of a value-added tax and create tax cascading,82 a
