  The objective of the report is to shed light on the development impacts of solar-powered electricity services in
  Mongolia. The target audience includes development professionals and government officials that are engaged
  with rural electrification programs based on solar home systems. It is hoped that the results of the analysis pre-
  sented in this report will be a source of inspiration for and help make informed decisions on rural electrification.

Survey 1: Sample Survey

The sample survey was conducted in 2012 in the Khentii
and Bayankhongor aimags (there are a total of 21 aimags
in Mongolia). Within each aimag, the soums were strati-
fied according to their total number of herder house-
holds owning SHSs. Five soums were then randomly
selected from each aimag. Thereafter a sample of 800
herder households was randomly selected from a pool
of 1,490 households that were registered as SHS pur-
chasers under REAP  . Actual face-to-face interviews were
conducted with 789 households. Salient demographic
features of the survey population are summarized in
Annex A. A map of the selected aimags and soums is
presented in Map 2.1.

Use and Sustainability of SHSs

Before SHS became available, only 69 percent of the sur-
veyed households had access to some form of electric-
ity. The main sources of alternative energy were candles,
kerosene lamp or dry cell battery powered flashlights for
lighting; and dry cell battery powered radios for news,
information and entertainment. The concern herders
had regarding the use of candles was the fire hazards
they created. The majority also believed the burning of
kerosene and oil in closed quarters was harmful to their
health.

One common source of portable electricity was from
                                                                herders often set up their gers in areas that shelter them

Only the lucky few who owned diesel or wind pow-

     said, according to the vast majority of those interviewed    they purchased under REAP are still in use.
     (95 percent), the solar PV systems are still considered a
     reliable source of electricity.

     The herders’ coping mechanisms during power
     shortages include using the SHS without the
     base so they can turn the unit to catch the sun
     in early mornings and late afternoons; operating
     the television set for fewer hours or switching to
     a black and white set during the winter. Some
     more affluent herders opted to install additional
     SHSs to enhance reliability and also to accommo-
     date larger television sets and other major electri-
     cal appliances such as a freezer.

     Health Education and Preventive Care
     According to the interviews, it appears that the most
     popular and effective means of health education is often
     delivered via regularly scheduled television programs
     (some also available on the radio). They usually come
     in the form of tips on preventive care. For example, a
     bi-weekly program called “Healing YoYo” prompted its
     viewers to say: “We learned that it’s better not to use too
     much salt, fat and sugar” and “we watch the show all
     the time.” Another example is a program that discusses
     certain common diseases (such as flu) that herders could
     contract, their symptoms, ways to prevent them, and the
     drugs that are used to treat them. An example of a rather
     common response goes as follows: “Now that we have
     a TV, we can learn about health-related issues from some
                                                                    With a CFL lamp and a mobile phone, herders over-
     programs and discuss with the doctor our symptoms.
