2   IBRD MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: MARCH 31, 2015
I.    Introduction
This document should be read together with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development’s (IBRD)
Financial Statements and Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014
(FY14). IBRD undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statements. Box 1 provides IBRD’s selected
financial data as of, and for the nine months ended, March 31, 2015 and 2014, as well as for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2014. Certain reclassifications of prior year’s information have been made to conform with the current
year’s presentation. (For further details see Note A: Summary of Significant Accounting and Related Policies in the
Notes to the Condensed Quarterly Financial Statements).
Business Model
IBRD, an international organization owned by its 188 member countries, is the largest multilateral development
bank in the world and is one of the five institutions of the World Bank Group (WBG). The other institutions of the
WBG are the International Development Association (IDA), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), and the International Centre for Settlement of Investment
Disputes (ICSID). Each of these organizations is legally and financially independent from IBRD, with separate
assets and liabilities, and IBRD is not liable for their respective obligations. The WBG’s two main goals are to end
extreme poverty and promote shared prosperity. To meet these goals, IBRD provides loans, guarantees, and
technical assistance (including through reimbursable advisory services) for economic reform projects and programs.
In addition, IBRD provides or facilitates financing through trust fund partnerships with bilateral and multilateral
donors. IBRD’s ability to intermediate the funds it raises in international capital markets is important in helping it
achieve its goals. IBRD’s objective is not to maximize profits, but to earn adequate income to ensure its financial
strength and sustain its development activities.
IBRD derives its financial strength from its capital base, through the support of its shareholders as well as its
financial and risk management policies and practices. Shareholder support takes the form of capital subscriptions
from members and their strong record in servicing their debt to IBRD. IBRD’s sound financial and risk management
policies and practices have enabled it to maintain its capital adequacy, diversify its funding sources, hold a portfolio
of liquid investments to meet its financial commitments, and limit its risks – including credit and market risks.
Basis of Reporting
Financial Statements
IBRD’s financial statements conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(U.S. GAAP), referred to in this document as the “reported basis.” All instruments in the investment and borrowing
portfolios and all other derivatives are reported at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in the income
statement. IBRD’s loans are reported at amortized cost, except for loans with embedded derivatives, which are
reported at fair value. Management uses the reported financial statements as the basis for deriving allocable income.
Fair Value
IBRD makes extensive use of financial instruments, including derivatives in its operations. In an attempt to address
the asymmetry in the reported financial statements, whereby not all financial instruments are reported on the same
basis, IBRD reflects all financial instruments at fair value in the MD&A. The fair value of these instruments is
affected by changes in market variables such as interest rates, exchange rates, and credit risk. Management uses fair
value to assess the performance of the investment-trading portfolio; to manage certain market risks, including
interest rate risk and commercial counterparty credit risk; and to monitor the results of the Equity Management
Framework (EMF), where IBRD uses derivatives to reduce the sensitivity of allocable income to short-term interest
rates. Since fair value results constantly change in response to changes in the market environment and given
IBRD’s intention to hold its primary assets and related funding to maturity (in its loan and borrowing portfolios),
Management does not use the fair value results as a basis for making decisions on income allocation.




                                            IBRD MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: MARCH 31, 2015 3
Allocable Income
When looking at the long-term financial sustainability of IBRD, Management monitors IBRD’s capital adequacy
and uses allocable income as the basis for making allocations from net income. Given IBRD’s intention to hold its
primary assets and related funding to maturity, allocable income is calculated by excluding all unrealized mark-to-
market gains and losses with the exception of those relating to the investment portfolio, which is a trading portfolio.
As a result, for the non-trading portfolios, only the realized mark-to-market gains and losses related to the infrequent
liquidation of these positions is included in allocable income. In addition, allocable income also reflects adjustments
such as pension, as well as adjustments to exclude Board of Governors-approved and other transfers from reported
net income, since in the case of the Board of Governors-approved and other transfers, these amounts have been
funded from prior year’s allocable income (Table 1).

II.       Summary of Allocable Income and Income Allocation
Reported Net Income
For the first nine months of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2015 (FY15), IBRD had a net loss of $1.8 billion, versus
a net loss of $0.4 billion during the same period in FY14. The $1.8 billion net loss was primarily due to $1.6 billion
of unrealized mark-to-market losses on non-trading portfolios. These unrealized mark-to-market losses primarily
relate to the derivatives associated with the loan portfolio and are consistent with the decline in interest rates during
the period (See Table 11). Since loans are carried at amortized cost for reporting purposes, the economic offset to
the loan related derivatives which are required to be reported at fair value under U.S. GAAP, is not reflected in the
reported net income. However, in line with IBRD’s risk management policies, IBRD is immunized against interest
rate movements on its loan and borrowing portfolios. In order to show the effect of these risk management policies,
IBRD reflects its loans at fair value in the MD&A. See section V for more details.
Table 1 below provides a reconciliation between the reported net loss and allocable income. The key differences
between these two measures relates to the treatment of Board of Governors-approved and other transfers, and
unrealized mark-to market losses on non-trading portfolios, net.

4     IBRD MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: MARCH 31, 2015
Allocable Income
The primary drivers of IBRD’s allocable income are interest                Figure 1: Net Interest Revenue for the first
earned on the loans funded by debt and revenue generated                   nine months of Fiscal Year
from IBRD’s equity (equity contribution), partially offset by              In billions of U.S. dollars
changes in the provision for losses on loans and other
exposures1 and net non-interest expenses (Table 1 summarizes                FY15
IBRD’s net income and provides a reconciliation to allocable
income).
IBRD’s loans are funded by debt and equity. Revenue                         FY14
generated from IBRD’s equity is primarily comprised of the
following: a) interest earned from loans funded by equity; b)                    -0.3   0.0       0.3      0.6    0.9    1.2   1.5    1.8

net interest revenue from EMF positions (See Section IV); and                   Interest margin         Equity contribution    Investments
c) realized mark-to-market gains from the unwinding of certain
EMF positions.
Allocable income was $528 million for the first nine months of FY15, $245 million lower than the same period in
FY14. The major variances between the periods are explained below:
Equity Contribution:
During the first nine months of FY15, equity contribution was $824 million as compared with $934 million during
the same period in FY14. The $110 million reduction in the equity contribution was primarily due to the decline in
interest revenue on the EMF trades, consistent with the liquidation of EMF positions in earlier periods.
Investments:
During the first nine months of FY15, IBRD incurred a $4 million loss on its investment portfolio. This is in
contrast to the $89 million of net income earned during the same period in FY14. The reduction in investment
revenue was primarily due to the $62 million of unrealized mark-to-market losses related to the Heta Asset
Resolution AG investment during the first nine months of FY15. This investment had a carrying value of $5 million
as of March 31, 2015.
Provision for losses on loans and other exposures:
For the first nine months of FY15, there was a net charge of $65 million, primarily reflecting the change in credit
quality of the loan portfolio. This compares with a net charge of $9 million in the same period in FY14, reflecting
the impact of loans to Iran being restored to accrual status.
Income Allocation
The allocable income for FY14 was $769 million. Of this amount, on October 10, 2014, IBRD’s Board of
Governors approved the transfer of $635 million to IDA and $134 million to Surplus. In addition, on the same date,
IBRD’s Board of Governors approved a transfer of $15 million to the Global Infrastructure Facility (GIF) from
Surplus. The transfers to IDA and GIF were made on October 14, 2014 and April 8, 2015, respectively.

    Other exposures include loans with a deferred drawdown option (DDO), irrevocable commitments, exposures to member
    countries’ derivatives, and guarantees.

6    IBRD MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: MARCH 31, 2015
Investment Highlights
As of March 31, 2015, IBRD’s net investment portfolio totaled $42.7 billion, of                  Figure 4: Liquid Asset
which $41.6 billion related to the liquid asset portfolio (see Note C: Investments in            Portfolio
the Notes to the Condensed Quarterly Financial Statements). The liquid asset                     In billions of U.S. dollars
portfolio was largely unchanged from June 30, 2014.                                              50

                                                                                                 40
The objective of the liquid asset portfolio is to ensure the availability of sufficient
cash flows to meet all of IBRD’s financial commitments. Historically, IBRD has                   30
operated at levels of liquidity in the range of between 100% and 150% of the                     20
prudential minimum. During the third quarter of FY15, the range was increased to
                                                                                                 10
approximately 140% and 175%, reflecting Management’s desire to hold sufficient
liquidity to cover 12 months of projected debt service obligations and net loan                   0
                                                                                                          Jun-13     Jun-14     Mar-15
disbursements. The prudential minimum liquidity level has been set at $26 billion
for FY15, and the liquid asset portfolio was at 160% of this level as of March 31,
2015.
Borrowing Highlights
IBRD issues debt securities to both institutional and retail investors in a variety of           Figure 5: Borrowing
currencies. During the first nine months of FY15, IBRD raised medium and long-                   Portfolio
term debt of $41.6 billion in 18 currencies.                                                     In billions of U.S. dollars
                                                                                                 200
As of March 31, 2015, the borrowing portfolio totaled $155.2 billion, an increase of
$2.5 billion from June 30, 2014 (see Note E: Borrowings, in the Notes to the                     150

Condensed Quarterly Financial Statements). This increase was mainly due to net
                                                                                                 100
new issuances of $7.5 billion to support loan disbursements, partially offset by
currency translation gains of $5.9 billion, consistent with the depreciation of the euro          50
against the U.S. dollar.
                                                                                                      0
                                                                                                           Jun-13     Jun-14     Mar-15

Capital Highlights
As a result of the General and Selective Capital Increase        Figure 6: Status of FY11 GCI/SCI Subscriptions as
resolutions in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 (FY11),       of March 31, 2015
subscribed capital is expected to increase by $87 billion        In billions of U.S. dollars
(including shares subscribed under the Voice Reform for
                                                                       Subscribed Capital                          Paid-in Capital

subscription period is for five years and ends March 16,
                                                                            26.3                                      1.5
2016. On March 30, 2015, the subscription period for the
Selective Capital Increase (SCI) was extended from                                  60.7                                        3.6
March 16, 2015 to March 16, 2016 for members
requesting extensions of one year, and to March 16, 2017
                                                                       Subscribed    Remaining                 Paid-In         Remaining
for members requesting extensions of two years. As of
March 31, 2015, $60.7 billion was subscribed, resulting in
additional paid-in capital of $3.6 billion, of which $1.1
billion was received during the first nine months of FY15.

IV.      Financial Risk Management
In an effort to maximize IBRD’s capacity to lend to member countries for development purposes, IBRD limits its
exposure to market and counterparty credit risks. In addition, to ensure that the financial risks associated with its
loans and other exposures do not exceed its risk-bearing capacity, IBRD uses a strategic capital adequacy framework
as a key medium-term capital planning tool.

Capital Adequacy
IBRD’s capital adequacy is the degree to which its capital is          Figure 7: Equity-to-Loans Ratio Trend (%)
sufficient to withstand unexpected shocks. IBRD’s Executive             40
Directors monitor IBRD’s capital adequacy within a strategic
                                                                        35
capital adequacy framework and use the equity-to-loans ratio as
a key indicator of capital adequacy.                                    30

At the beginning of the 2008 global financial crisis, the equity-       25
to-loans ratio, at 38%, significantly exceeded the capital
requirements of the Strategic Capital Adequacy Framework,               20

allowing IBRD to respond effectively to the lending needs of its
borrowing member countries through a decline in the ratio,
thereby increasing its leverage.
IBRD’s equity-to-loans ratio decreased to 25.2% at March 31, 2015 from 25.7% at June 30, 2014, and remained
above the minimum ratio of 20% (Table 5). Under IBRD’s currency management policy, to minimize exchange rate
risk in a multicurrency environment, IBRD matches its borrowing obligations in any one currency (after derivatives
activities) with assets in the same currency. In addition, IBRD’s policy is to minimize the exchange rate sensitivity
of its capital adequacy as measured by the equity-to-loans ratio. It implements this policy by undertaking currency
conversions periodically to align the currency composition of its equity with that of its outstanding loans across
major currencies. As a result, exchange rate movements do not have an impact on IBRD’s equity-to-loans ratio.
For the nine months ended March 31, 2015, there was a $1 billion net decline in IBRD’s usable equity, of which
$2.1 billion related to currency translation adjustments, offset by a $1.1 billion increase in paid-in capital due to the
GCI/SCI. Concurrently, net loans outstanding and other exposures declined by $0.6 billion, of which $8.4 billion
related to currency translation adjustments partially offset by $8 billion in net loan disbursements during the period.
The currency translation adjustments were primarily due to the 21% depreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar
during the period. This did not have an impact of the equity-to-loans ratio. Rather, the decline in the equity-to-loans
ratio was driven by the net loan disbursements during the period, partially offset by the additional paid-in capital
received during the period.

Management of Credit and Market Risks
Among the various types of market risks, interest rate risk is the most significant risk faced by IBRD. IBRD’s
exposure to currency and liquidity risks is minimal as a result of its risk management policies. In addition, IBRD
faces two types of credit risk: country credit risk and counterparty credit risk.
Country Credit Risk
Country credit risk reflects potential losses arising from protracted arrears on payments from borrowers on loans and
other exposures. IBRD manages this risk by applying individual country exposure limits. These limits take into
account the creditworthiness and performance of borrowers.
IBRD’s exposure to certain countries in the Europe and Central Asia Region experiencing geo-political tensions,
was $5.5 billion as of March 31, 2015. This represents 3% of IBRD’s total loans outstanding and other exposures.
At March 31, 2015, no amounts were overdue from these countries.

IBRD. It is carefully managed, in part, by
applying an exposure limit for the aggregate            Brazil                                            15.3

The eight countries with the highest exposures accounted for about 61% of IBRD’s total exposure. In FY14, a
surcharge of 50 basis points was introduced on balances above the previous SBL, $17.5 billion for India and $16.5
billion for the other four SBL-eligible borrowing countries. As of March 31, 2015, no surcharge was applicable to
any of the five SBL-eligible countries.
Accumulated Provision on Loans and Other Exposures
As of March 31, 2015, only 0.3% of IBRD’s loans were in nonaccrual status and all were related to Zimbabwe.
IBRD’s total provision for losses on loans was 1.1% of total loans outstanding (see Note D: Loans and Other
Exposures in the Notes to the Condensed Quarterly Financial Statements).
Counterparty Credit Risk
Commercial Counterparty Credit Risk
Commercial counterparty credit risk is managed by applying eligibility criteria, volume limits for transactions with
individual counterparties, and using mark-to-market collateral arrangements for swap transactions (Table 6). The
effective management of this risk is vital to the success of IBRD’s funding, investment, and asset/liability
management. The monitoring and managing of this risk is continuous, given the changing market environment.
IBRD’s overall commercial counterparty credit exposure increased by $841 million during the first nine months of
FY15. The credit quality of IBRD’s portfolio remains concentrated in the upper end of the credit spectrum, with
67% of the portfolio rated AA or above and the remaining portfolio primarily rated A. The reduction in AA rated
exposure from June 30, 2014 to March 31, 2015 was primarily due to a rating downgrade of one country, to single
A. IBRD continues to have a preference for highly rated securities and counterparties across all categories of
financial instruments.

Interest Rate Risk
Under its current interest rate risk management strategy, IBRD seeks to match the interest rate sensitivity of its
assets (loan and investment trading portfolios) with those of its liabilities (borrowing portfolio) by using derivatives,
such as interest rate swaps. These derivatives effectively convert IBRD’s financial assets and liabilities into
variable-rate instruments. This strategy helps IBRD to manage the interest margin on the proportion of loans funded
by debt, against interest rate volatility. The interest revenue on the remaining proportion of loans funded by equity,
if left unmanaged, would be highly sensitive to fluctuations in short-term interest rates. To manage this exposure,
IBRD uses an EMF, which seeks to manage the sensitivity of IBRD’s revenue from loans funded by equity to
fluctuations in short-term interest rates. In particular, the EMF allows the flexibility of managing the duration of
IBRD’s equity within a range of zero to five years based on market and macroeconomic conditions.
The EMF also allows IBRD to realize some of the unrealized mark-to-market gains from the positions. In line with
this, the EMF position declined to $1.0 billion as of March 31, 2015, from $1.4 billion as of June 30, 2014. The
decline was primarily as a result of the realization of mark-to-market gains of $581 million from to the liquidation of
certain derivatives. This was partially offset by the $265 million of net unrealized mark-to-market gains
experienced during the first nine months of FY15, primarily as a result of the decline in the U.S. interest rates (see
table 8). In addition, the liquidation of certain derivative positions resulted in a decline in the interest rate sensitivity
of equity. As measured by duration, the interest rate sensitivity of IBRD’s equity declined to approximately 2 years
as of March 31, 2015, from approximately 3 years as of June 30, 2014.

V.         Summary of Fair Value Results
Fair Value Adjustments
An important element in achieving IBRD’s financial goals is its ability to minimize the cost of borrowing from
capital markets for lending to member countries by using financial instruments, including derivatives. The fair value
of these financial instruments is affected by changes in the market environment such as interest rates, exchange rates
and credit risk. Fair value is used mainly to assess the performance of the investment trading portfolio, to monitor
the results of the EMF, and to manage certain market risks, including interest rate and commercial credit risk for
derivative counterparties.
As shown in Table 7, on a fair value basis, if interest rates increased by one basis point, IBRD would experience a
net unrealized mark-to-market loss of approximately $15 million as of March 31, 2015.

Figure 9 below provides a further breakdown of how the use of derivatives affects the overall sensitivity of the loan

result in net unrealized mark-to-market gains of $46 million on the bonds. These would be significantly offset by the
$45 million of net unrealized mark-to-market losses on the related swaps, resulting in net unrealized mark-to-market
gains of $1 million for the portfolio.

Effect of Credit
For the first nine months of FY15, IBRD experienced $308 million of unrealized mark-to-market losses on the
borrowing portfolio, of which $290 million was due to the tightening of its credit spreads. In addition, IBRD
experienced $1.4 billion of unrealized mark-to-market losses on the loan portfolio, of which $1.1 billion was due to
the net widening of CDS spreads for several of its borrowing member countries during the same period (see the June
30, 2014, MD&A for a detailed discussion on how the credit risk of each portfolio is managed).
Effect of Interest Rates
IBRD uses derivatives in its loan and borrowing portfolios to arrive at floating rate instruments, as part of its risk
management strategies. The sensitivity of these portfolios to interest rate movements, after the effect of derivatives
is therefore low, resulting in relatively small interest rate related unrealized mark-to-market gains/losses in income
(Figure 8).
The unrealized mark-to-market gains on the EMF position of $265 million were primarily due to the decrease in
U.S. interest rates experienced during the first nine months of FY15.
Fair Value Results
As non-financial assets and liabilities are not reflected at fair value, IBRD’s equity is not intended to reflect fair
value. Under the fair value basis, in addition to the instruments in the investment and borrowing portfolios, and all
other derivatives, loans are reported at fair value and all changes in AOCI are also included in fair value net income.
Tables 9 and 10 provide a reconciliation from the reported basis to the fair value basis for both the balance sheet and
income statement.

Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
In addition to the unrealized mark-to-market gains/losses on the non-trading portfolios, IBRD’s fair value net
income also reflects changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI). The $1.6 billion decrease in
AOCI primarily relates to net negative currency-translation adjustments resulting from the 21% depreciation of the
euro against the U.S. dollar during the period.

18           IBRD CONDENSED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: MARCH 31, 2015 (UNAUDITED)
NOTES TO THE CONDENSED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE A—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND RELATED POLICIES
Basis of Preparation
These unaudited condensed quarterly financial statements should be read in conjunction with the June 30, 2014
audited financial statements and notes included therein. The condensed comparative information that has been
derived from the June 30, 2014 audited financial statements has not been audited. In the opinion of management, the
condensed quarterly financial statements reflect all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of IBRD’s financial
position and results of operations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America (U.S. GAAP).
Management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed quarterly financial statements and the
reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in
making those estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. Areas in which significant estimates have
been made include, but are not limited to, the provision for losses on loans and other exposures, valuation of certain
financial instruments carried at fair value, and valuation of pension and other postretirement plan-related liabilities.
The results of operations for the first nine months of the current fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of results
that may be expected for the full year.
Certain reclassifications of the prior year’s information have been made to conform with the current year’s
presentation.
In particular, effective July 1, 2014, derivative assets and liabilities relating to the Loan portfolio, which were
previously included in the line items Borrowing derivative assets, Borrowing derivative liabilities and Other
derivative liabilities on IBRD’s Condensed Balance Sheet, are now shown separately under derivative assets and
derivative liabilities. For the Condensed Statement of Income, interest, net and unrealized mark-to-market gains and
losses associated with these derivatives, which were previously shown under Borrowings, net are now included
under Loans, net. For the Condensed Statement of Cash Flows, the impact of these derivative instruments, which
were previously shown under the Net derivatives-borrowings line item, under financing activities, is now shown as a
separate line item under investing activities. As a result of the reclassifications, on the Condensed Balance Sheet,
Borrowing derivative assets, Borrowing derivative liabilities and Other derivative liabilities as of June 30, 2014 have
decreased by $2,784 million, $4,933 million and $199 million, respectively. Derivative assets and derivative
liabilities relating to loans increased by $2,784 million and $5,132 million, respectively. On the Condensed
Statement of Income, for the nine months ended March 31, 2014, total revenue decreased by $420 million, with the
offset reported as a decrease in total expenses. On the Condensed Statement of Cash Flows, for the nine months
ended March 31, 2014, Net derivatives-borrowings increased by $11 million while Net derivatives-loans decreased
by $11 million.
In addition, the presentation for realized mark-to-market gains and losses on the Condensed Statement of Income
and the Condensed Statement of Cash Flows has been changed. For the Condensed Statement of Income, realized
mark-to-market gains and losses, net, which were previously included in Interest, net, for the Equity management
and Borrowing portfolios have been reclassified to Unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses, net for the
respective portfolios. For the Condensed Statement of Cash Flows, within the Cash flows from operating activities
category, realized mark-to-market gains and losses, were reclassified from Other assets and liabilities to Unrealized
mark-to-market gains and losses on non-trading portfolios, net. As a result, on the Condensed Statement of Income,
for Equity management, net, for the nine months ended March 31, 2014, Interest, net decreased by $432 million, and
the Unrealized mark-to-market losses decreased by $432 million. For Borrowings, Interest, net, decreased by $23
million, and Unrealized mark-to-market gains, net, increased by $23 million. There was no net effect on total
revenue and expenses due to this reclassification. For the Condensed Statement of Cash Flows, Unrealized mark-to-
market losses (gains) on non-trading portfolios, net decreased by $409 million, and Other assets and liabilities
increased by $409 million. There was no net effect on the Cash flows from operating activities line item in the
Condensed Statement of Cash Flows.
There was no effect on IBRD’s total assets, total liabilities, equity, reported net loss or unrestricted cash balances
from these reclassifications.
Accounting and Reporting Developments
In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) became law. The Act
seeks to reform the U.S. financial regulatory system by introducing new regulators and extending regulation over
new markets, entities, and activities. The implementation of the Act is dependent on the development of various

                  IBRD CONDENSED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: MARCH 31, 2015 (UNAUDITED)                              19
rules to clarify and interpret its requirements. As the rules are being developed, IBRD continues to assess the impact
on its business. As of March 31, 2015, IBRD believes that the Act has not had any significant effect on its business.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The ASU
provides a common framework for revenue recognition for U.S. GAAP, and supersedes most of the existing revenue
recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity recognizes revenue when it
transfers control of promised goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects consideration to which the
entity expects to be entitled. The ASU also requires additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures to enable
financial statement users to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising
from customers. For IBRD, the ASU will be effective from the quarter ending September 30, 2017. IBRD is
currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its financial statements.
In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-11, Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860): Repurchase- to- Maturity
Transactions, Repurchase Financings, and Disclosures. The ASU requires repurchase-to-maturity transactions and
some repurchase financing arrangements to be accounted for as secured borrowings. It also requires additional
disclosures about certain transactions accounted for as sales and about the nature of collateral pledged for
transactions accounted for as secured borrowings. For IBRD, the ASU is effective from the quarter ended March 31,
2015. The ASU does not have any impact on IBRD’s financial statements since all repurchase agreements are
already accounted for as secured borrowings. IBRD will include additional disclosures required by the ASU in the
financial statements for the year ending June 30, 2015.
In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements (Subtopic 205-40): Going
Concern – Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s ability to Continue as a Going Concern. The ASU provides
guidance on management’s responsibilities in evaluating the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and for
the related financial statement disclosures. Until now guidance related to this topic was provided under U.S. auditing
standards, which do not govern management’s disclosures. Under this ASU, each reporting period, management
would be required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity’s
ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date in which the financial statements are issued. For
IBRD, the ASU will be effective beginning with the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017. IBRD is currently evaluating
the impact of this ASU on its financial statements but does not expect the ASU to have a significant impact.
In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation
Analysis. This ASU makes amendments to the current consolidation guidance focusing on targeted areas for certain
types of entities. For IBRD, the ASU will be effective beginning with the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017, with
early adoption permitted. IBRD is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its financial statements.

Valuation Methods and Assumptions
Summarized below are the techniques applied in determining the fair values of investments.
Investment securities
Where available, quoted market prices are used to determine the fair value of trading securities. Examples include
most government and agency securities, mutual funds, futures contracts, exchange-traded equity securities and ABS.
For instruments for which market quotations are not available, fair values are determined using model-based
valuation techniques, whether internally-generated or vendor-supplied, that include the standard discounted cash
flow method using market observable inputs such as yield curves, credit spreads, and constant prepayment rates.
Where applicable, unobservable inputs such as constant prepayment rates, probability of default and loss severity are
used. Unless quoted prices are available, time deposits are reported at face value which approximates fair value.

Securities purchased under resale agreements, Securities sold under repurchase agreements and Securities lent
under securities lending agreements
These securities are short-term and are reported at face value which approximates fair value.
Commercial Credit Risk
For the purpose of risk management, IBRD is party to a variety of financial transactions, certain of which involve
elements of credit risk. Credit risk exposure represents the maximum potential loss due to possible nonperformance
by obligors and counterparties under the terms of the contracts. For all securities, IBRD limits trading to a list of
authorized dealers and counterparties. In addition, IBRD receives collateral in connection with resale agreements as
well as swap agreements. This collateral serves to mitigate IBRD’s exposure to credit risk.
Swap Agreements: Credit risk is mitigated through the application of eligibility criteria and volume limits for
transactions with individual counterparties and through the use of mark-to-market collateral arrangements for swap
transactions. IBRD may require collateral in the form of cash or other approved liquid securities from individual
counterparties in order to mitigate its credit exposure.
IBRD has entered into master derivatives agreements which contain legally enforceable close-out netting provisions.
These agreements may further reduce the gross credit risk exposure related to the swaps. Credit risk with financial
assets subject to a master derivatives arrangement is further reduced under these agreements to the extent that
payments and receipts with the counterparty are netted at settlement. The reduction in exposure as a result of these
netting provisions can vary due to the impact of changes in market conditions on existing and new transactions. The
extent of the reduction in exposure may therefore change substantially within a short period of time following the
balance sheet date. For more information on netting and offsetting provisions see Note F-Derivative Instruments.
The following is a summary of the collateral received by IBRD in relation to swap transactions as of March 31, 2015
and June 30, 2014.

As of March 31, 2015, IBRD received total cash collateral of $3,597 million ($3,234 million—June 30, 2014), of
which $3,589 million was invested in highly liquid instruments ($2,114 million—June 30, 2014).
Securities Lending: IBRD may engage in securities lending and repurchases, against adequate collateral, as well as
secured borrowings and reverse repurchases (resales) of government and agency obligations, corporate securities
and ABS. These transactions have been conducted under legally enforceable master netting arrangements, which
allow IBRD to reduce its gross credit exposure related to these transactions. For Balance Sheet presentation
purposes, IBRD presents its securities lending and repurchases, as well as resales, on a gross basis. As of March 31,
2015 and June 30, 2014, there were no amounts which could potentially be offset as a result of legally enforceable
master netting arrangements.
Transfers of securities by IBRD to counterparties are not accounted for as sales as the accounting criteria for the
treatment as a sale have not been met. Counterparties are permitted to repledge these securities until the repurchase
date.

At March 31, 2015, and June 30, 2014 the liabilities relating to securities transferred under repurchase or securities
lending agreements did not include any repurchase agreement trades that had not settled at that date.
In the case of resale agreements, IBRD receives collateral in the form of liquid securities and is permitted to
repledge these securities. While these transactions are legally considered to be true purchases and sales, the
securities received are not recorded on IBRD’s balance sheet as the accounting criteria for treatment as a sale have
not been met. As of March 31, 2015, securities purchased under resale agreements included $264 million of
securities, which had not settled at that date ($2,027 million—June 30, 2014). For the remaining purchases, IBRD
received securities with a fair value of $2,569 million ($1,069 million—June 30, 2014). None of these securities had
been transferred under repurchase or security lending agreements as of that date (Nil—June 30, 2014).
NOTE D—LOANS AND OTHER EXPOSURES
IBRD’s loans and other exposures (exposures) are generally made to, or guaranteed by, member countries of IBRD.
In addition, IBRD may also make loans to the International Finance Corporation (IFC), an affiliated organization,
without any guarantee. Other exposures include: Deferred Drawdown Options (DDOs), Irrevocable Commitments,
Exposures to Member Countries’ Derivatives, and Guarantees. IBRD’s loans are reported at amortized cost, with the
exception of one loan which is carried and reported at fair value, because it contains an embedded derivative.
IBRD uses derivative contracts to manage the currency risk as well as the repricing risk between its loans and
borrowings. For details regarding derivatives used in the loan portfolio, see Note F—Derivative Instruments.
Of the total loans outstanding as of March 31, 2015, 82% were to Latin America and the Caribbean, Europe and
Central Asia, and East Asia and Pacific regions, combined.
Based on IBRD’s internal credit quality indicators, the majority of loans outstanding are in the medium-risk and
high-risk classes.
As of March 31, 2015, only 0.30% of IBRD’s loans were in nonaccrual status and were all related to one borrower.
The total provision for losses on accrual and nonaccrual loans accounted for 1.05% of the total loans outstanding.
Credit Quality of Sovereign Exposures
Based on an evaluation of IBRD’s exposures, management has determined that IBRD has one portfolio segment –
Sovereign Exposures. IBRD’s loans constitute the majority of the Sovereign Exposures portfolio segment.
IBRD’s country risk ratings are an assessment of its borrowers’ ability and willingness to repay IBRD on time and
in full. These ratings are internal credit quality indicators. Individual country risk ratings are derived on the basis of
both quantitative and qualitative analyses. The components considered in the analysis can be grouped broadly into
eight categories: political risk, external debt and liquidity, fiscal policy and public debt burden, balance of payments
risks, economic structure and growth prospects, monetary and exchange rate policy, financial sector risks, and
corporate sector debt and vulnerabilities. For the purpose of analyzing the risk characteristics of IBRD’s exposures,
these exposures are grouped into three classes in accordance with assigned borrower risk ratings which relate to the
likelihood of loss: low, medium and high-risk classes, as well as exposures in nonaccrual status. IBRD considers all
exposures in nonaccrual status to be impaired.
IBRD’s borrowers’ country risk ratings are key determinants in the provision for losses. Country risk ratings are
determined in review meetings that take place several times a year. All countries are reviewed at least once a year,
or more frequently, if circumstances warrant, to determine the appropriate ratings.

Accumulated Provision for Losses on Loans and Other Exposures
Management determines the appropriate level of accumulated provisions for losses, which reflects the probable
losses inherent in IBRD’s exposures. Probable losses comprise estimates of potential losses arising from default and
nonpayment of principal amounts due, as well as present value losses. Delays in receiving loan payments result in
present value losses to IBRD since it does not charge fees or additional interest on any overdue interest or charges.
These present value losses are equal to the difference between the present value of payments of interest and charges,
made according to the related instrument’s contractual terms and the present value of its expected future cash flows.
It is IBRD’s practice not to write off its loans. All contractual obligations associated with exposures in nonaccrual
status have eventually been cleared, thereby allowing borrowers to eventually emerge from nonaccrual status. To
date, no loans have been written off.
Notwithstanding IBRD’s historical experience, the risk of losses associated with nonpayment of principal amounts
due is included in the accumulated provision for losses on loans and other exposures.

During the three and nine months ended March 31, 2015, no loans were placed in nonaccrual status or restored to
accrual status.
In addition, during the three months ended March 31, 2015, interest revenue recognized on loans in nonaccrual
status was less than $1 million, while during the nine months ended March 31, 2015, the interest revenue recognized

was $1 million (less than $1 million—three months ended March 31, 2014 and $2 million—nine months ended
March 31, 2014).
Effective July 16, 2013, all loans to, or guaranteed by, Iran were placed into nonaccrual status. The aggregate
principal balance outstanding on these loans at July 16, 2013 was $697 million, of which $79 million was overdue
on that date. Subsequently, on September 27, 2013, Iran cleared all of its overdue principal and charges due to IBRD
and the loans to, or guaranteed by, Iran were restored to accrual status on that date. Interest revenue for the nine
months ended March 31, 2014, increased by $8 million, $7 million of which represented revenue that would have
been accrued in previous fiscal years had these loans not been placed in nonaccrual status.

Guarantees
Guarantees of $1,524 million were outstanding at March 31, 2015 ($1,804 million—June 30, 2014). This amount
represents the maximum potential amount of undiscounted future payments that IBRD could be required to make
under these guarantees and is not included on the Condensed Balance Sheet. These guarantees have original
maturities ranging between 5 and 20 years, and expire in decreasing amounts through 2029.
At March 31, 2015, liabilities related to IBRD's obligations under guarantees of $45 million ($60 million—June 30,
2014), have been included in Other liabilities on the Condensed Balance Sheet. These include the accumulated
provision for guarantee losses of $18 million ($25 million—June 30, 2014).
During the nine months ended March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2014, no guarantees provided by IBRD were called.
Waivers of Loan Charges
IBRD provides waivers on eligible loans, which include a portion of interest on loans, a portion of the commitment
charge on undisbursed balances and a portion of the front-end fee charged on all eligible loans. Waivers are
approved annually by the Executive Directors of IBRD.
The reduction in net income during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2015, and March 31, 2014, resulting
from waivers of loan charges is summarized below:

Segment Reporting
Based on an evaluation of IBRD’s operations, management has determined that IBRD has only one reportable
segment since financial results are reviewed, and resource allocation decisions are made, at the entity level.
Loan revenue comprises interest, commitment fees, loan origination fees and prepayment premia, net of waivers.
For the nine months ended March 31, 2015, loans to one country generated an excess of 10 percent of total loan
revenue; this amounted to $181 million.

b. Does not include interest expenses, net from loan related derivatives of $729 million ($709 million—March 31, 2014).

Fair Value Disclosures
The loan carried at fair value is classified as Level 3. This loan has an embedded derivative and its fair value is
estimated on a matrix basis against the related bond. As IBRD’s loans are not traded, the yield which is used as a
key input to determining the fair value of this loan is not observable. The yield applied in determining the fair value
of the loan at March 31, 2015 was 4.3%. An increase (decrease) in the yield would result in a decrease (increase) in
the fair value of the loan.
The following table provides a summary of changes in the fair value of IBRD’s Level 3 loan during the three and
nine months ended March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2014:

30            IBRD CONDENSED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: MARCH 31, 2015 (UNAUDITED)
Valuation Methods and Assumptions
All IBRD’s loans are made to, or guaranteed by, countries that are members of IBRD, except for those loans made
to IFC. IBRD does not currently sell its loans.
As of March 31, 2015 and June 30, 2014, except for one loan which is reported at fair value, all other loans are
carried at amortized cost. The fair value of these loans is calculated using a discounted cash flow method. This
method incorporates Credit Default Swap spreads for each borrower. Basis adjustments are applied to market
recovery levels to reflect IBRD’s recovery experience. IBRD’s loans, including the one loan reported at fair value
on a recurring basis, are classified as Level 3, within the fair value hierarchy.
NOTE E—BORROWINGS
IBRD issues unsubordinated and unsecured fixed and variable rate debt in a variety of currencies. Some of these
debt instruments are callable. Variable rates may be based on, for example, exchange rates, interest rates or equity
indices.
Borrowings issued by IBRD are carried and reported at fair value. As of March 31, 2015, 98% of the instruments in
the portfolio were classified as Level 2, within the fair value hierarchy.
IBRD uses derivative contracts to manage the currency risk as well as the repricing risk between its loans and
borrowings. For details regarding the derivatives used in the borrowing portfolio, see Note F—Derivative
Instruments.

During the three and nine months ended March 31, 2015, IBRD’s credit spreads tightened. The estimated financial
effects on the fair value of the borrowings issued and outstanding as of March 31, 2015, were unrealized mark-to-
market losses of $80 million and $290 million, respectively.
During the nine months ended March 31, 2014, IBRD’s credit spreads widened. The estimated financial effects on
the fair value of the debt issued and outstanding as of March 31, 2014, were unrealized mark-to-market gains of
$155 million. Conversely, during the three months ended March 31, 2014, IBRD’s credit spreads tightened,
resulting in estimated unrealized mark-to-market losses of $89 million. These amounts were determined using
observable changes in IBRD’s credit spreads.
IBRD’s Level 3 borrowings primarily relate to structured bonds. The fair value of these bonds is estimated using
valuation models that incorporate model parameters, observable market inputs, and unobservable inputs. The
significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of structured bonds are correlations and long-
dated interest rate volatilities. Generally, the movements in correlations are considered to be independent from the
movements in long-dated interest rate volatilities.
Correlation is the statistical measurement of the relationship between two variables. For contracts where the holder
benefits from the convergence of the underlying index prices (e.g. interest rates and foreign exchange rates), an
increase in correlation generally results in an increase in the fair value of the instruments. The magnitude and
direction of the fair value adjustments will depend on whether the holder is short or long the option.
Interest rate volatility is the extent to which the level of interest rates change over time. For purchased options, an
increase in volatility will generally result in an increase in the fair value. In general, the volatility used to price the
option depends on the maturity of the underlying instrument and the option strike price. For IBRD, interest rate
volatilities are considered an unobservable input for maturities greater than ten years for certain currencies.
The following table provides a summary of the valuation technique applied in determining fair values of these Level
3 instruments and quantitative information regarding the significant unobservable inputs used:

Valuation Methods and Assumptions
The techniques applied in determining the fair values of debt instruments are summarized as follows:
Discount notes and vanilla bonds
Discount notes and vanilla bonds are valued using the standard discounted cash flow method which relies on market
observable inputs such as yield curves, foreign exchange rates, basis spreads and funding spreads, where available,
quoted marked prices are used to determine the fair value of short-term notes.
Structured bonds
Structured bonds issued by IBRD have coupon or repayment terms linked to the level or the performance of interest
rates, foreign exchange rates, equity indices or commodities. The fair value of the structured bonds is derived using
the discounted cash flow method based on estimated future pay-offs determined by applicable models and
computation of embedded optionality such as caps, floors and calls. A wide range of industry standard models such
as one factor Hull-White, LIBOR Market Model and Black-Scholes are used depending on the specific structure.
These models incorporate market observable inputs, such as yield curves, foreign exchange rates, basis spreads,
funding spreads, interest rates volatilities, equity index volatilities and equity indices. Where applicable, the models
also incorporate significant unobservable inputs such as correlations and long-dated interest rate volatilities.

IBRD is not required to post collateral under its derivative agreements as long as it maintains a AAA credit rating.
The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk related contingent features that are in a liability
position on March 31, 2015 is $4,348 million ($1,216 million—June 30, 2014). IBRD has not posted any collateral
with these counterparties.

would be required to post collateral on March 31, 2015, the amount of collateral that would need to be posted would

be $1,638 million ($164 million—June 30, 2014). Subsequent triggers of contingent features would require posting
of additional collateral, up to a maximum of $4,348 million ($1,216 million—June 30, 2014). In contrast, IBRD
received collateral totaling $5,860 million as of March 31, 2015 ($6,019 million—June 30, 2014), in relation to
swap transactions (see Note C—Investments).

Offsetting assets and liabilities
IBRD enters into International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) master netting agreements with
substantially all of its derivative counterparties. These legally enforceable master netting agreements give IBRD the
right to liquidate securities held as collateral and to offset receivables and payables with the same counterparty, in
the event of default by the counterparty.
The presentation of derivative instruments is consistent with the manner in which these instruments are settled.
Interest rate swaps are settled on a net basis, while currency swaps are settled on a gross basis.
The following tables summarize information on derivative assets and liabilities (before and after netting
adjustments) that are reflected on IBRD’s Condensed Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2015 and June 30, 2014. Total
derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally
enforceable master netting agreements. The net derivative asset positions have been further reduced by the cash and
securities collateral received.

40        IBRD CONDENSED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: MARCH 31, 2015 (UNAUDITED)
The fair value of IBRD’s Level 3 loans and borrowings related derivatives is estimated using valuation models that
incorporate model parameters, observable market inputs and unobservable inputs. The significant unobservable
inputs used in the fair value measurement of these derivatives are correlations and long dated interest rate
volatilities. See Note E—Borrowings for details on these unobservable inputs.
The following table provides a summary of the valuation technique applied in determining fair values of these Level
3 instruments and quantitative information regarding the significant unobservable inputs used:

Valuation Methods and Assumptions
Derivative contracts include currency forward contracts, TBAs, currency swaps and interest rate swaps. Currency
swaps and interest rate swaps are either plain vanilla or structured. Currency forward contracts and plain vanilla
currency and interest rate swaps are valued using the standard discounted cash flow methods using market
observable inputs such as yield curves, foreign exchange rates, basis spreads and funding spreads. For structured
currency and interest rate swaps, which primarily consist of callable swaps linked to interest rates, foreign exchange
rates, and equity indices, valuation models and inputs similar to the ones applicable to structured bonds valuation are
used. Where applicable, the models also incorporate significant unobservable inputs such as correlations and long-
dated interest rate volatilities. 
NOTE G—RETAINED EARNINGS, ALLOCATIONS AND TRANSFERS
IBRD makes net income allocation decisions on the basis of reported net income, adjusted to exclude the unrealized
mark-to-market gains and losses on non-trading portfolios, net, restricted income and Board of Governors-approved
and other transfers, and after considering the allocation to the pension reserve.
On August 7, 2014, IBRD’s Executive Directors approved the following allocations relating to the net income
earned in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, a reduction in the Pension Reserve by $43 million and an increase in
Restricted Retained Earnings by $2 million.
On October 10, 2014, IBRD’s Board of Governors approved the following allocations relating to the net income
earned in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014: an immediate transfer to IDA of $635 million and $134 million to
Surplus. The Board of Governors also approved a grant of $15 million to the Global Infrastructure Facility (GIF)
from Surplus. The transfers to IDA and GIF were made on October 14, 2014 and April 8, 2015, respectively.
Retained earnings comprise the following components at March 31, 2015 and June 30, 2014:

NOTE H—PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
IBRD, IFC and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) participate in a defined benefit Staff
Retirement Plan (SRP), a Retired Staff Benefits Plan (RSBP) and PEBP that cover substantially all of their staff
members.
All costs, assets and liabilities associated with these pension plans are allocated between IBRD, IFC and MIGA
based upon their employees’ respective participation in the plans. Costs allocated to IBRD are then shared between
IBRD and IDA based on an agreed cost sharing ratio. The net periodic pension cost (credit) for the SRP, RSBP and
PEBP is included in Administrative Expenses, in the Condensed Statement of Income.
The following table summarizes the benefit costs associated with the SRP, RSBP, and PEBP for IBRD and IDA for
the three and nine months ended March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2014:

interest rate of 3.96% and weighted average maturity of 1.21 years. This loan is not eligible for interest waivers.
In addition, on July 5, 2012, IBRD’s Executive Directors approved for IBRD to lend up to $197 million to IFC. At
March 31, 2015, the balance of this loan was $196 million ($196 million— June 30, 2014). This loan is at LIBOR

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, IBRD entered into an exposure exchange agreement with MIGA under
which IBRD and MIGA agreed to exchange $120 million each of notional amount of exposures on their respective
balance sheets with one another. Under the agreement, MIGA provided a guarantee on one of IBRD's loan principal
and interest exposures in exchange for IBRD's guarantee of principal and interest exposure of MIGA under its Non-
Honoring of Sovereign Financial Obligation. As of March 31, 2015, liabilities related to IBRD’s obligation under
this agreement amounted to $3 million. These include an accumulated provision for guarantee losses of less than $1
