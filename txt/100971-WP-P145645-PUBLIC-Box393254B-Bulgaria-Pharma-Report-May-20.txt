Executive summary and recommendations
This report presents a review of current issues in the pharmaceutical sector in Bulgaria, examining drug policy,
regulation, pricing, formulary selection, distribution, expenditure, and to the extent possible, patterns of use in
Bulgaria. Its recommendations are intended to serve as options for reform, by articulating short and long term
strategies for managing pharmaceutical expenditure, improving system sustainability, and driving value for money in
Bulgaria, thereby improving efficiency, equity, affordability and ultimately, access to prescription medicines.
Although small, the Bulgarian pharmaceutical market is showing strong growth. Medicines comprise not only a
disproportionate share of health care expenditure (38% of total health expenditure, compared with an EU average of
around 25%), the burden of out of pocket (OOP) costs is also excessive, possibly as high as 81% of total
pharmaceutical expenditure. Of perhaps greatest concern is that rapid expenditure growth is taking place without
obvious improvements in health outcomes, and at the expense of population equity.
Bulgaria does not yet have an integrated national medicines policy, and the pharmaceutical sector is characterized by
various highly prescriptive and at times, arguably inconsistent policy levers. While the regulatory framework has been
largely brought into line with current EU standards, existing mechanisms for listing, pricing and subsidizing medicines
are not ensuring adequate value for money for the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), and are contributing to
inefficiencies in the health sector. Current pharmaceutical policy settings appear focused on limiting NHIF outlays
rather than prioritizing access and affordability, and afford little financial protection to patients.
At present the principal price-setting mechanism for medicines is international (external) reference pricing, with prices
set at the level of the lowest of ten primary and seven secondary EU member states. However, sole reliance on
reference pricing may not be ensuring value for money for a number of reasons —the referenced prices are ‘official’
prices and may not capture confidential discounts and negotiated rebates, and they may not reflect (and may not
have been assessed for) value for money in the referenced member states. Moreover, they may be subject to strict
controls on utilization to offset the budget impact of high unit prices in source countries, and this is unlikely to be taken
into account in a simple pricing look-up. Finally the references prices are drawn from EU member states that all enjoy
substantially higher per capita GDP than Bulgaria, so even if the price of a drug were shown to reflect reasonable
value for money in the source country, this cannot be assumed to be the case in Bulgaria.
For some single source, and in many cases, high unit cost medicines, prices are as high, and at times even
higher in absolute terms than in countries of much greater national wealth (a proxy for capacity to pay). Moreover,
existing processes for listing medicines on the Positive Drug List are insufficiently influenced by considerations of
cost effectiveness, and there are no explicit links between circumstances of listing and existing prescribing
protocols. There are as yet no officially endorsed pharmaco-therapeutic guidelines despite at least three pieces of
legislation containing provisions stipulating their development and deployment in clinical practice in Bulgaria. The net
result is that utilization of several very high cost and potentially non cost-effective medicines is growing very rapidly.
Currently a number of clinical guidelines are being developed, but as they do not take into account issues of cost or
cost effectiveness in directing treatment, even with good adherence they may not be effective in moderating
expenditure and may even increase it by promoting the uptake of new but not necessarily cost-effective therapies.
The setting of a benchmark price for multi-source medicines in the absence of any mechanisms that favor dispensing
of the benchmark product or of any restrictions on the number of brands of the medicine listed on the Positive Drug
List (PDL) discourages competition within the off-patent medicines market. To the extent competition exists, it is
focused on discounting in the supply chain, which suggests scope for lowering prices and clawing back some of the
savings currently accruing to pharmacies. Adjusting approaches to listing, pricing and procurement of multi-source
medicines to create greater competition has the potential to deliver substantial savings.
The apparent focus on cost-containment, reflecting the need to control public expenditure given the above issues,
contributes to the very high out-of-pocket expenses for patients. For multi-source products containing the same
International Non-proprietary Name (INN) in the same pharmaceutical form, the amount of NHIF reimbursement is set
as a proportion of the product with the lowest cost per Defined Daily Dose (DDD). Therapeutic reference pricing is
also applied across different molecules within the same therapeutic class (where the products are considered to be of

similar efficacy and safety in a particular indication). Since actual prices often substantially exceed benchmark prices,
and as levels of reimbursement by the NHIF are set as a proportion of the benchmark, OOP costs to patients can be
extremely high, often substantially exceeding the NHIF contribution.
Other pharmaceutical sector policies also appear to be contributing to high OOP costs for patients and are regressive.
As retail margins are proportional to drug prices, pharmacists have powerful incentives to stock and dispense more
expensive products. [No explicit dispensing fees are paid by NHIF though pharmacies receive 2 BGN per prescription
for prescriptions for fully subsidized items.] In addition the imposition of the full VAT rate of 20% adds to the cost
burden for both the NHIF and patients. Currently OOP costs are likely to be undermining access and adherence to
treatment for medicines that are important for delaying or preventing progression of non-communicable diseases,
particularly cardiovascular and chronic respiratory diseases. Many drugs for chronic conditions, for which adherence
to treatment is important to prevent long-term sequelae or disease progression, carry both substantial levels of co-
insurance and ‘premiums’ over and above the NHIF’s benchmark prices.
Most prescribing is by brand, both in hospitals and in ambulatory care, and substitution at pharmacy is not permitted
for NHIF-subsidized prescriptions. As a result many prescriptions are written and dispensed for brands that are more
expensive than the reference or benchmark price, which increases OOP costs for patients, often by substantially
more than the co-insurance amount. Moreover, there are no safety nets or “stop-loss” provisions to protect individuals
from catastrophic OOP costs. Consideration should be given both to mandating prescribing by international non-
proprietary name (INN), and giving pharmacists the right to substitute a generic medicine for an originator brand at the
point of dispensing. Where a prescription is written for a medicine that is subject to generic competition, patients
should have the right to receive, and when requested, pharmacists should be required to dispense a benchmark-
priced product attracting the minimum co-insurance amount - or if unable to do so, to absorb the difference in cost.
In summary, current listing and pricing mechanisms provide little or no assurance of value for money for new
medicines included in the Positive Drug List and some prices for both patented and off-patent medicines compare
unfavorably with countries with far greater capacity to pay. Several high cost medicines that are contributing
significantly to rapid expenditure growth are unlikely to be cost effective in Bulgaria and should be subject to price
(re)negotiation, explicit restrictions on use, and in some cases, even disinvestment (delisting). If Bulgaria were also
able to encourage greater competition in the off-patent medicines market, this, together with measures to address
demand and promote rational prescribing and generic uptake, could significantly improve efficiency in current
pharmaceutical expenditure. Reconfiguring the role and remit, structure and procedures of the National Council on
Prices and Reimbursement of Medicinal Products (the Pricing Council) is critical to improving efficiency and ensuring
value for money.
To that end, in the short term, results of HTAs conducted in other jurisdictions could be adapted to inform current and
future decisions on listing and pricing in Bulgaria. While the results of an economic evaluation in one jurisdiction or
setting may not be directly applicable in another setting, some HTA data will be relevant across different settings and
contexts, such as evidence from randomized controlled trials regarding the comparative efficacy and effectiveness of
interventions. Factors such as burden of disease, patterns of clinical practice, unit costs and patterns of resource
utilization, availability of healthcare resources and budget constraints, as well as the choice of appropriate comparator
are more country-specific, and country-specific evaluations which reflect the needs of decision-makers within country
are ultimately to be preferred.1 Nevertheless if a high-income country finds that a particular health technology is not
cost-effective at a given price, it is highly unlikely to be cost-effective at that price in a low- and middle-income
setting.2 Thus applying what is effectively a ‘de facto’ HTA (see Box 1)—that is, referencing prices and conditions of
listing in another jurisdiction with established HTA processes, and determining a notional ‘cost-effective price’ by

adjusting for relative PPP-adjusted per capita GDP—could be used in the short term to guide listing decisions and to
inform price negotiations.
To operationalize this in Bulgaria the NHIF could begin by simply adapting the results of HTA analyses from the UK,
(or Belgium, France or any other country with robust HTA processes), and use these to modify conditions of listing
and inform (re)negotiation of prices of existing medicines. Renegotiating the prices of just four drugs in Annex II –
nilotinib, rituximab, pazopanib and pemetrexed – to approximate UK prices could potentially reduce spending by
around BGN 10.8 milllion, based on 2014 NHIF expenditure. However, applying the de facto HTA method to drugs in
Annex II, and reducing the prices of just 4 of the top 5 medicines (by NHIF expenditure) to prices approximating a
similar degree of cost effectiveness to those in the UK, could generate savings of up to BGN 21 million.3 While
obtaining price reductions of that magnitude through negotiation would clearly be exceptionally challenging (and
given the extensive use of reference pricing within the EU might need to be obtained by way of confidential discounts
or rebates), the calculation nevertheless highlights the true opportunity costs of the current prices and supports the
need for realistic assessment of value for money of medicines proposed for the PDL.

                        Box 1: What is ‘de facto’ health technology assessment (HTA)?




For drugs under consideration for inclusion in the PDL, applying this method would mean setting conditions of listing
that are consistent with those in a jurisdiction where the drug has been subject to rigorous HTA, and declining to list
drugs for indications not considered cost-effective or clinically appropriate there. Prices higher than those in the
reference jurisdiction after adjustment for relative per capita GDP would represent the upper limit of cost
effectiveness for these medicines. This process could be introduced quite quickly, and should be possible to
implement within existing resources.
In the short term savings should be achievable through the introduction of more competitive procurement
mechanisms for multi- and some single source medicines, supported by other measures described above. This could
be complemented by utilizing a de facto HTA approach to the listing and pricing of other single source and high cost
medicines in the short term, while in the medium term working towards the gradual development of HTA processes
and capacity.
In addition, consideration could be given to the introduction of risk sharing arrangements (RSAs) to assist both in
moderating and improving predictability of overall expenditure. For example, price-volume agreements or expenditure
caps could be a condition of inclusion in the PDL for drugs for which utilization and budget impact are uncertain, or for
which prescribing is likely to be difficult to control. Listing and pricing of certain high cost drugs could be made

This Project is implemented with the financial support of Operational Programme “Technical Assistance”

contingent on the proportion of patients achieving a specified response to treatment, with rebates where outcomes
anticipated from clinical trial data (and on which estimates of cost effectiveness are predicated) are not reflected in
practice. RSAs do however require skills in developing estimates and in assessing the evidence to distinguish high
value from low value use. For performance-based contracts patient registries or other mechanisms for recording and
aggregating patient outcomes may also be required.
Over time however, the development and introduction of robust, evidence-based HTA processes within Bulgaria will
be important to improve the country’s capacity to a) assess value for money in the selection, listing and pricing of
medicines and b) provide a means of prioritizing expenditure in a resource limited environment. The development of a
critical mass of practitioners with adequate expertise in HTA methods will take some time and would need to be
appropriately sequenced. One approach could be to utilize a “train the trainer” model to develop a core of intensively-
trained individuals, and by ensuring that they are able to network effectively with relevant individuals and
organizations both within and outside Bulgaria, domestic capacity could be developed within a few years. The
necessary expertise need not reside solely within the Pricing Council or the MoH, though some capacity should
clearly be developed and retained there, together with the necessary administrative supports. A more practical model
may be to have trained professionals distributed across several academic and quasi-academic settings, as well as
within Government. This would facilitate expansion of the skill base.
In the short-term (12-24 months) consideration should be given to mandating comparative cost effectiveness as a key
criterion for addition to the PDL. To operationalize this, one option would be to introduce an interim de facto HTA
process, accompanied by a review and recalibration of subsidized indications, particularly for high cost Annex 2
drugs. Direct price negotiations for those drugs identified as unlikely to be cost effective at current prices should be
considered, and these could be informed by the de facto HTA method to determine target prices. At the same time
HTA capacity-building could commence through focused technical training, and gap analyses initiated to identify
information and data needed to inform future decision-making
In the medium term (2-4 years) processes, guidelines, methods and decision criteria for a robust and rigorous HTA
framework could be developed to support listing/delisting of medicines. One approach might be to partner with one or
more academic institutions, some of which may have existing expertise, to continue the process4 of developing (or
adapting other countries’) guidelines for the submission and evaluation of the required evidence. HTA capacity could
be gradually expanded through ongoing training and professional development activities. Mandatory HTA as
prerequisite for listing/delisting of medicines could then be introduced by law to replace the interim de facto process
once guidelines and methods are agreed and promulgated.
In the longer term (5+ years) rigorous processes should ideally be established to review and update national drug
formularies. The role of HTA as a prerequisite for the listing/delisting of medicines could gradually be consolidated
and its application considered for non-drug technologies, products and services as appropriate.
During the drafting of this report, the Ministry of Health released a document entitled Concept Note: Health 2020
Goals5 which, inter alia, emphasizes the importance of increasing the efficiency of drug treatment, of building capacity
for the evaluation of health technologies, of the role of clinical guidelines and treatment algorithms, and of prescribing
and use of medicines that are effective and cost-effective. Importantly it also noted that
          control over health expenditures must be governed by the understanding that it is essentially a
          method for their optimization for the achievement of particular health outcomes, instead of an end
          in itself to decrease and limit them.
The findings and recommendations of this report are consistent with those sentiments.

1.      Introduction and Scope of the Report
In August 2014, the Government of the Republic of Bulgaria and the World Bank (“the Bank”) entered into an
agreement generally referred to as the Health Financing Reimbursable Advisory Services (RAS). The objective of
this RAS is to support the Government as it lays the groundwork for implementing its National Health Strategy 2014-
2020.
2.     Specifically, the Bank is assisting the Ministry of Health to develop, evaluate, and implement options in the
area of health financing, to improve the efficiency, equity, financial protection, and long-term sustainability of the
health system. Part of that task was to develop a standalone report on pharmaceutical sector issues, with actionable
recommendations for improving efficiency, equity, affordability and sustainability in access to prescription medicines in
Bulgaria.
3.     In order to present a document that was self-contained, much of the narrative describing the current state of
the pharmaceutical sector presented in the earlier Diagnostic Report has been reproduced here. This subsequent
report is intended to complement that by drawing on the previous analyses to articulate reform options intended to
improve efficiency, equity, affordability and long-term sustainability in access to prescription medicines for the people
of Bulgaria.
4.     What should be the pharmaceutical policy priorities? Even among countries that share similar policy objectives,
pharmaceutical policy choices will be influenced by social values and priorities; political, legal, and historical contexts;
economic and budgetary pressures; systems financing and insurance arrangements; and perceptions of equity and
affordability.
5.     Nevertheless, irrespective of the specific social, political, regulatory, and financial conditions that exist, there
are certain common themes that have been found to be important priorities in otherwise disparate countries and
settings. Broadly these may be described as:
                Leveraging market power;
                Focusing on purchasing outcomes rather than products;
                Ensuring value for money in drug selection;
                Encouraging competition in the off-patent market and promoting the use of generic medicines;
                Identifying and eliminating perverse incentives; and
                Promoting rational drug use.
6.     Importantly, these themes are echoed in the Ministry of Health’s Concept Note: Health 2020 Goals7 released
during the drafting of this report. It speaks, inter alia, of the importance of increasing the efficiency of drug treatment,
of building capacity for the evaluation of health technologies, of the role of clinical guidelines and treatment
algorithms, and of prescribing and use of medicines that are effective and cost-effective. Significantly, it also notes
that
          “ … control over health expenditures must be governed by the understanding that it is essentially a
          method for their optimization for the achievement of particular health outcomes, instead of an end
          in itself to decrease and limit them.”

2.      Current Situation and Key Issues
2.1     The Bulgarian context
7.      Structural inefficiencies in the current health system together coupled with demographic, epidemiological, and
economic trends pose significant challenges for public financing of health services in Bulgaria. With the population
both ageing and in overall decline, a substantial proportion of the population is either poor, or highly vulnerable to
falling into poverty. Bulgaria’s health delivery system gives insufficient priority to investment in primary care, and is
poorly equipped to address the growing burden of non-communicable diseases.
8.     According to data from the National Health Accounts, in 2012 around BGN 6.3 billion was spent on health care
in Bulgaria, 51 percent of which was public expenditure, largely disbursed through the NHIF. The remainder is private
expenditure, mostly out of pocket (OOP) fees and charges levied at the time individuals seek care. Medicines
comprise not only a disproportionate share of health care expenditure (38% of total health expenditure, compared
with an EU average of around 25%), but the burden of out of pocket (OOP) costs is also excessive, accounting for
possibly as much as 81% of total pharmaceutical expenditure. Of perhaps greatest concern is that rapid expenditure
growth is taking place without obvious improvements in health outcomes, and at the expense of population equity.
9.       Lacking a comprehensive and integrated national medicines policy, the Bulgarian pharmaceutical sector is
characterized by various highly prescriptive and at times, ineffective and arguably counterproductive policy levers.
While the regulatory framework has been largely brought into line with current EU standards, existing mechanisms
for listing, pricing and subsidizing medicines are not ensuring adequate value for money for the NHIF, and are fueling
rapid growth in expenditure. Current pharmaceutical policy settings appear to prioritize limiting NHIF outlays rather
than promoting access and affordability, and offer little financial protection to patients.

2.2     The Pharmaceutical market
10. Although the Bulgarian pharmaceutical market is one of the EU‘s smallest, it has grown strongly over the past
few years, and the pharmaceutical industry is one of the fastest growing sectors of the Bulgarian economy.8 In 2011
the Bulgarian market was valued at BGN 2.1 billion, an increase of 12% over 2010, and it grew another 10.5% to a
value of BGN 2.32 billion (USD 1.57 billion) from 2011-2013.8 Figure 1 refers.

co-financed by the European Union through the European Regional Development Fund
11. This growth has been mainly attributed to two factors: increased NHIF expenditure on oncology and other high
cost medicines, and growing consumer spending on over the counter (OTC) products. Growth in recent years is also
likely to have been stimulated by the opening of the market, partly a result of harmonization of Bulgarian regulatory
processes with EU regulations, which began in 1995 and was finalized in preparation for Bulgaria’s EU accession in
January 2007. 9
12. Hospital consumption accounted for around 18% of the market in 2009, with another 18% being ambulatory
care medicines reimbursed by the NHIF, and with OTC medicines making up nearly 17% of the total market (the rest
being non-reimbursed prescription medicines).9

2.3     Regulatory framework
13. The accession of Bulgaria to the European Union in 2007 and its participation in the nCADREAC Agreement
has facilitated the establishment of EU standards of drug regulation. The implementation of the Medicinal Products in
Human Medicine Act (MPHMA) 10 has been instrumental in this. The law was drafted in 2007 to align the Bulgarian
regulatory framework with European standards, but has since undergone 20 amendments. The scope of the MPHMA
is broad, covering the role and responsibilities of the Bulgarian Drug Agency (BDA) as regulatory body dealing with
medicinal products marketing authorizations, distribution, import, advertising etc., as well as provisions relating to the
pricing of prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medicines11 and the establishment and maintenance of the Positive
Drug List (PDL). For product registration it provides for centralized, decentralized and national procedures.
14. In addition to the MPHMA and the various amendments to it, the sector is also subject to a significant number
or other laws and ordinances. Of particular relevance are:
       Health Law (1 January 2005);
       Health Facilities Law (5 July 1999);
       Ordinance on the Terms, Rules and Procedure for Regulation and Registration of Prices for Medicinal
           Products (30 April 2013);
       Ordinance № 4 on the terms and conditions for prescribing and dispensing of medicines (4 March 2009);
       Ordinance No 10 on the terms and conditions for payment of medicinal products, dietary foods under Art.
           262, para 6, part 1 of the MPHMA as well as medicinal products for health-related activities under Art. 82,
           para 2, part 3 of the Health Act (24 March 2009);
       Ordinance № 28 on the structure, terms and conditions of work of the pharmacies and nomenclature of
           medicinal products (9 December 2008);
       Ordinance № 34 on the terms and conditions for payment from the state budget for the treatment of
           diseases outside the scope of mandatory health insurance (25 November 2005);
       Ordinance № 38 defining the list of diseases for which medicines, medical devices and dietary foods for
           outpatient treatment fully or partially paid for by the NHIF (16 November 2004);
       Ordinance № 39 on the principles and requirements of Good Distribution Practice (13 September 2007);
           and
       Ordinance № 40 for determining the basic package of health services guaranteed by the NHIF budget (24
           November 2004),

co-financed by the European Union through the European Regional Development Fund
15. The Bulgarian Drug Agency (BDA) reports to the Ministry of Health and is responsible for assessing and
ensuring the quality, effectiveness and safety of medicinal products. Its role includes:
       Marketing authorization for medicines;
       Authorization and oversight of manufacturing, import, wholesaling and retailing of medicines;
       Authorization and oversight of clinical trials;
       Advertising;
       Pharmacovigilance and drug information;
       Classification (scheduling) of medicines.
16. The BDA is funded in part from the budget of the Ministry of Health as well as from revenues generated by its
activities, which include fees for laboratory analyses, application and evaluation fees, annual registration charges,
and GMP inspections. Fees and charges are set by the Council of Ministers.

2.4     Drug selection and pricing

Role of the Pricing Council
17. A 2011 amendment to the MPHMA replaced two separate Commissions with responsibility for pricing of
medicines and management of the Positive Drug List respectively, with a single new entity, the National Council on
Prices and Reimbursement of Medicinal Products (hereinafter referred to as the Pricing Council).12
18. The Pricing Council is a state budget-supported legal entity, with the status of a state commission based in the
city of Sofia. It comprises a chair and 6 members (3 of whom must be physicians or pharmacists, 2 economists and 2
lawyers, all with experience in their specialties of not less than 5 years) and is supported by a Secretariat.13
19. The Pricing Council’s role includes registering the maximum retail selling prices of over-the-counter medicines
and makes decisions on the inclusion and pricing of medicines on the Positive Drug List (PDL), as well as setting
maximum (ceiling) prices for all other medicines.14 The price-setting mechanisms and processes are outlined in the
MPHMA and set out in more detail in the 2013 Ordinance on the Terms, Rules and Procedure for Regulation and
Registration of Prices for Medicinal Products (the Pricing Ordinance).15
20. The Pricing Council’s role also includes approving, revoking or modifying pharmaco-therapeutic guidelines, as
well as the recommendations for treatment algorithms proposed by the national consultants, various medical societies
and experts. However to date no guidelines have been finalized, though several are currently in development.
21. The Pricing Council meets weekly, and direct updates to the reimbursement list (RL) fortnightly, which
variously involve changes to prices, available brands, and levels of reimbursement for any of the existing medicines
on the reimbursement list. Prices may also be routinely adjusted for inflation. The MPHMA also sets out timeframes
for the Pricing Council’s decision- making which are:
            60 days for listing and pricing of new prescription medicines to be included in the PDL;



12 See http://www.ncpr.bg/en
13 See http://www.ncpr.bg/en/ncprmp/structure/organogram
14 The Pricing Council thus sets the price of all drugs marketed in Bulgaria. The positive drug list (PDL) is the more restrictive list of drugs
that are (to a greater or lesser degree) subsidized with public funds. The reimbursement list is the list of outpatient medicines reimbursed by the
NHIF (Annex 1)
15 Ordinance on the Terms, Rules and Procedure for Regulation and Registration of Prices for Medicinal Products, effective 30 April 2013.
At http://www.ncpr.bg/en/regulations/bulgarian-legislation/regulations/. This supersedes Ordinance 10 of 24 March 2009 on the Terms and
Conditions for Payment of Drug Products.


This Project is implemented with the financial support of Operational Programme “Technical Assistance”                                          15
co-financed by the European Union through the European Regional Development Fund
              30 days for listing and pricing of generic medicines, and for setting maximum prices for prescription
               medicines not subject to reimbursement and over-the-counter (OTC) products, from the date of filing of the
               application with the Pricing Council.

Pricing mechanisms
22. The primary price-setting mechanism is international (external) reference pricing. For new prescription
medicines ex-factory prices are determined by considering ‘official’ prices in ten primary (Romania, France, Latvia,
Greece, Slovakia, Lithuania, Portugal, Italy, Slovenia and Spain) and seven secondary (Belgium, the Czech Republic,
Poland, Denmark, Hungary Finland and Estonia) EU member states. The Bulgarian ex-factory price is then set at the
level of the lowest price among these jurisdictions. Links to the sources of the pricing information are provided on the
Pricing Council website.16
23. However, international price comparisons can be significantly affected by manufacturers’ marketing strategies,
the relative importance of the market segment, regulatory controls, patent expiration dates, exchange rate
movements, taxation policies, supply chain efficiency, use of health technology assessment or value-based pricing,
and demand-side behaviours.
24.        In particular, the referenced prices:
            are ‘official’ prices and may not capture confidential discounts and rebates;
            may not reflect (and may not have been assessed for) reasonable value for money in the referenced
               member states;
            may be offset with narrow indications and strict controls on utilization (submitted pricing data do not take
               into account indications for use).
25. All referenced member states have substantially higher per capita GDP than Bulgaria, so even if the price of a
drug reflects reasonable value for money in the source country, this may not be the case in Bulgaria. At the very least
the drug will be less affordable in Bulgaria.
26. Wholesale and retail margins proportional to the drug prices are set by the Ministry of Health and are
regressive. Wholesale mark-ups range from 4-7%, with a maximum of BGN 10. Retail mark-ups vary from 16-20%,
with a maximum of BGN 25. These are added along with 20% VAT to form the maximum retail price via a complex
formula shown in Table 2.

26. At 20% VAT on medicines is very high. Bulgaria is one the few EU member states that does not apply a
concessional rate to medicines17,18 although, at 9%, even the concessional rate is substantially higher than the rate
applied to medicines in some countries. The UK, Ireland and Malta do not apply VAT to medicines, and in Spain,
France, Croatia, Cyprus, Lithuania and Hungary the rate is 5% or less.
27. Consideration should be given to reducing the VAT rate to a level similar to other Central and Eastern
European countries. In an environment in which consumers can pay significant amounts out-of-pocket for medicines,
the VAT is in effect a levy on the health care budget that, like co-insurance, differentially impacts lower SES groups,
thus undermining any implied equity objective. Moreover, not only do the vast bulk of OOP health costs derive from
medicines, the burden falls most heavily on the poorest in Bulgaria, as shown in Table 3.

Pricing of generic medicines
28. The ex-factory price of the first generic version of a medicine listed on the PDL may not exceed 80% of the ex-
factory price of the reference product included in the PDL. Thereafter generic pricing is subject to external
referencing. In other words, although a statutory price reduction is applied at the point of initial generic market entry,
there is no mechanism to drive further price reductions within the off-patent market. For off-patent medicines more
competitive pricing could create savings that could support expenditure-neutral increases in NHIF reimbursement
rates, particularly for drugs used in chronic conditions for which long-term adherence is important for the prevention
of long term sequelae.
29. For each multi-source medicine a notional reference or benchmark price is set at the level of the lowest cost
per Defined Daily Dose (DDD) for any brand or presentation of that medicine. 19 This benchmark pricing is also
applied across different molecules within the same ATC subgroup where the products are considered to be of similar
efficacy and safety for a particular indication. The benchmark price within the ‘cluster’ of drugs is set at the level of
the lowest cost/DDD for any of the drugs within that cluster. This is then the ‘price’ against which the level of
reimbursement is set.
30. As a result of this therapeutic reference pricing there are few incentives for competition in the off-patent
market. As long as the ex- factory price of a multisource medicine is not higher than 80% of that of the originator,

18 The 9% concessional rate appears to be applied only to hotel rooms.
19 The Defined Daily Dose (DDD) is the assumed average maintenance dose per day for a drug used for its main indication in adults.
Importantly, the DDD is a notional metric and does not necessarily reflect the recommended or actual prescribed dose. Moreover, an
observation that two drugs in a given class have the same DDD for a given indication does not imply that they are of equivalent efficacy.

co-financed by the European Union through the European Regional Development Fund
and the price is shown to be no higher than the lowest price for the same presentation in any of the specified
reference countries, the actual price can substantially exceed the current benchmark in terms of cost/ DDD, with any
excess becoming an OOP cost to the patient. (See Table 4 below)
31. Section 264.2 of the MPHMA sets out notification requirements for suppliers of products whose prices set
benchmarks, but it is not clear if suppliers are required to guarantee supply of a minimum proportion of the overall
market. It is also not specified whether and how the unavailability of the benchmark-priced product triggers a
(presumably upward) revision of the benchmark price. It is therefore unclear as to what, if any, mechanisms exist to
ensure that benchmark-priced products are either available for supply or stocked by pharmacists and therefore
available to patients.

Pricing of OTC medicines
32. Unlike most EU countries where no price controls are applied to over the counter (OTC) medicines, pricing in
Bulgaria is ostensibly ‘free’ but is nevertheless subject to a 2013 transitional rule stating that registered maximum
sales prices of OTCs could not be increased by more than the applicable inflation rate over the period since the
preceding price registration. Although the rule was transitional it has since been extended to apply until the end of
2015.

The Positive Drug List
33.     The Positive Drug List comprises four annexes:
         Annex I (the Reimbursement List): lists those outpatient medicines paid for by the NHIF and the level of
            subsidy they receive, as established by the Health Insurance Act (HIA)20;
         Annex II: lists medicines funded from the budgets of ‘medical-treatment’ facilities;
         Annex III: lists medicines for the treatment of HIV/AIDS and certain communicable diseases outside the
            scope of the HIA, as well as vaccines for compulsory immunizations; and
         Annex IV: sets out the ceiling prices for medicines included in the PDL.
34. Chapter 6 of the Pricing Ordinance sets out the criteria for the inclusion of medicines in the PDL. To be
considered for listing, the medicine must first have marketing approval in Bulgaria, as well as evidence of coverage
by health insurance programs in at least five of the 10 primary reference countries. Evidence of coverage does not
however, require or imply evidence of satisfactory health technology assessment, and thus is not an indicator of cost
effectiveness. As such the requirement adds no additional value added to the assessment of the therapeutic
efficiency of the medicine, apart from the other criteria used in Bulgaria, which to big extent are the same as in most
of the other countries. The Bulgarian Commission on Protection of Competition (CPC) has suggested that, given
other characteristics of the Bulgarian pharmaceutical market, in particular its small size, low public spending on
medicines, and low reimbursement prices, this requirement may be restricting and delaying access to the national
reimbursement market by originators. However the apparently rapid listing of new high cost medicines on the PDL,
and a review of current prices suggest that this is unlikely to be the case.21
35. For new medicines, a range of clinical parameters and ‘pharmacoeconomic indicators’ is then evaluated, from
evidence presented in the application dossier submitted by the drug’s manufacturer or supplier. The
‘pharmacoeconomic indicators’ include the cost of therapy; a comparison of the costs of therapy with available
alternatives; the cost-benefit ratio; an economic evaluation of the additional benefits offered by the therapy; and an

analysis of anticipated budget impact. For each group of criteria a number of ‘points’ is awarded, with ‘clinical
factors’ receiving a maximum of 95 points, and ‘pharmacoeconomic factors’ a maximum of 40 points.
36. A minimum of 60 points is required for approval, thus a product considered clinically effective may be
approved even if scoring poorly on economic factors and failing to show evidence of reasonable cost effectiveness.
The process and criteria for the assessment of the economic data are not detailed in the Ordinance. Moreover
members of staff of the Pricing Council indicated that they did not have sufficient expertise in pharmacoeconomic
(PE) evaluation of medicines to undertake rigorous assessments of PE data submitted by applicants.
37. The assessment is made more challenging by virtue of the short timeframes specified in the MPHMA for the
Pricing Council’s decision-making (60 days for listing and pricing of new prescription medicines to be included in the
PDL). The rationale for this is obscure. While timely decision-making is desirable, considering the practices of other
bodies undertaking similar assessments, this is unlikely to be sufficient for rigorous assessment of the clinical and
economic performance of new medicines, particularly those likely to give rise to substantial budget impact, and for
which new or updated treatment protocols may be needed. The European Transparency Directive No 89/105/EEC
currently allows member states up to 90 days for pricing decisions and up to 180 days for combined pricing and
reimbursement decisions.22
38. For the evaluation of a new medicine for inclusion on the PDL and establishment of a price under Article 261 а
of MPHMA, the Pricing Council receives a fee of BGN 1,500.23 This appears modest in relation to the effort required
and the potential market available to a medicine listed on the PDL and subject to NHIF reimbursement.
39. Reasons for the Pricing Council’s decisions are not made public. Few applications for inclusion of new drugs
on the PDL are rejected. Any decision to refuse an application to include, change or exclude a medicine from the
PDL, or endorse a proposed price is appealable to the Transparency Commission (TC). The TC is also established
by the MPHMA, with members appointed by the Council of Ministers from nominations from the Minister of Health,
the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy, the Bulgarian Drug Agency, the National Health
Insurance Fund, the Bulgarian Physicians' Union, the Bulgarian Dentists' Union, the Bulgarian Pharmacists' Union,
and from patient and pharmaceutical industry organizations.
40. The PDL is published by the Pricing Council, and for existing drugs is updated on the 2nd and 16th day of
each month. New products are only added on the 1st January each year, and the Pricing Council may only change
the level of reimbursement of a medicine in PDL once a year, although price changes can occur more frequently. The
ceiling price can be increased only 12 months after the last approval of the price. However if the supplier wishes to
reduce the ceiling price, this can be given effect at any time.24

Levels of Reimbursement
41. The Pricing Ordinance also sets out the procedures for determining the amount of reimbursement of products
in the Reimbursement List. These are said to be determined according to perceived clinical significance, but this
appears to be applied inconsistently. All products in Annex III, as well as those in Annex I (the Reimbursement List)
for chronic diseases causing ‘severe disruptions in the quality or life or disablement and requ iring prolonged
treatment’ are said to be subject to full (100%) reimbursement. Yet subsidies for oral agents for diabetes, for


22 The EU Transparency Directive No 89/105/EEC specifies a series of procedural requirements to ensure transparency of pricing and
reimbursement measures adopted by the Member States. These include specific time limits for pricing and reimbursement decisions (90 days
for pricing, 90 days for reimbursement or 180 days for combined pricing and reimbursement decisions). The Directive also requires competent
national authorities to provide a statement of reasons based on objective and verifiable criteria for each of their decisions and to provide
appropriate legal remedies to applicants. A 2012 proposal to shorten the time limits to 60/120 days has not yet been adopted, but would still
allow twice the time currently allowed for the Pricing Council’s decision-making.

example, vary between 25% and 100%. Medicines for chronic diseases with widespread prevalence receive 75%
subsidy; for all others reimbursement is up to 50%, with the actual level determined by a complex assessment of a
range of factors that include whether use of the product is considered to be essential, preventive, palliative,
symptomatic or for maintenance treatment; the social significance of the condition under treatment; the duration of
treatment; ‘accepted’ treatment algorithms; the number of patients with the condition; expenditure in the preceding
year; and budgetary capacity. For some reimbursed products NHIF pays as little as 10% of the benchmark price.
42. As described above, for multi-source products containing the same INN in the same pharmaceutical form, the
benchmark price is set with reference to the cheapest version of the product as determined by cost per DDD, and
this is then pro-rated across all pack sizes. Benchmarking is also applied across different molecules within the
same ATC subgroup where the products have been shown to be of similar efficacy and safety for treatment of a
particular indication, in which case the benchmark or reference price is calculated according to the lowest cost/DDD
within the cluster.25
43. Importantly, whether it is for multi-source products (i.e. containing the same INN in the same pharmaceutical
form) or for a therapeutic class medicines grouped in a cluster, the level of NHIF reimbursement is then set as a
proportion of the benchmark price, not the actual price. As a result, the OOP payment for a drug subject to, for
example, 75% reimbursement may be considerably higher than 25% of the actual product’s cost, if that product is not
a benchmark-priced product. The patient’s OOP costs consist of the reference price minus the NHIF contribution,
plus any difference between the reference price and the retail price of the product. In many cases the actual price
can be many times the benchmark price, and the NHIF contribution only a small fraction of the cost. This is said to be
a key driver of patients seeking medicines without prescription, as the levels of reimbursement are often so low that it
is cheaper to pay for the entire product OOP than to add the co-payment to the cost of seeing a doctor to obtain one.
44. There are also no co-payment exemptions for drugs. Such high private OOP expenditures suggest a
mismatch between policy objectives for the NHIF – namely, limiting the funds’ financial exposure – and that of
providing financial protection and access to essential medicines.
45. Table 4 illustrates the implications of this reimbursement method for ranitidine, a drug used in the treatment
of oesophageal reflux and peptic ulcer disease, for which the level of reimbursement by the NHIF is 25%. The drug
is available in 3 different forms on the market. For a treatment course corresponding to 30 days of 300mg/day (30
defined daily doses or DDDs), the patient will pay either BGN 5.96, 15.17 or 13.61 out of pocket, and the NHIF
contribution will be only BGN 1.99 across all the products.

2.5     Procurement and payment
46. For medicines used in in-patient facilities (Annex II) procurement procedures fall within the scope of the Public
Procurement Act. Each public hospital undertakes the procurement annually. Prices cannot exceed those established
by the Pricing Council. The costs of medicines used in hospitals are included in the estimations of the costs of the
Clinical Care Pathways (CCPs), thus theoretically medicines for use in in-patients should be fully covered by hospital
budgets. However patients with chronic diseases who receive medicines subsidized by NHIF in outpatient settings
are expected to bring their medicines with them when hospitalized.
47. For outpatient medicines the NHIF is responsible for payment in accordance with the decisions of the Pricing
Council and the specified levels of subsidy. It has no role in the disposition of the PDL, though representatives of
NHIF attend meetings of the Pricing Council and may make representations to it.
48. In 2012, the MOH transferred responsibility for payment for a list of specialty medicines from it to the NHIF.
These are 100% reimbursed and include certain oncology drugs funded outside the CCPs, as well as drugs for post-
transplant immunosuppression, and various orphan diseases. Although additional funds were allocated to the NHIF
for this purpose, increasingly they are insufficient to meet demand, and NHIF has only limited capacity to moderate
prescribing. Expenditure on oncology medicines is one of the fastest growing areas of expenditure (56% growth rate
over 2011-2013), and demand routinely outstrips the amounts budgeted. Table 5 shows the magnitude and growth in
NHIF medicines reimbursement over 2011-2013.

2.6     Distribution and supply chain
49. The Bulgarian pharmaceutical industry consists of around 30 domestic companies, and a number of
international companies with local manufacturing/packaging, the largest of which is Actavis. All levels of distribution
chain for medicines are highly regulated. Vertical integration (manufacturer - wholesaler - retailer) is theoretically
prohibited.
50. The Association of Research-based Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Bulgaria (ARPharM), established in
1996 represents the interests of 26 pharmaceutical manufacturers from Europe, US and Japan. \

This Project is implemented with the financial support of Operational Programme “Technical Assistance”                            21
co-financed by the European Union through the European Regional Development Fund
51. The largest local producer is Sopharma, a founding member of the Association of Bulgarian Pharmaceutical
Manufacturers (ABPhM), with both originator and generic products, and the only local manufacturer of sterile
injectables in the country. Sopharma is in fact one of several entities reported to be heavily vertically integrated with a
wholesaling operation as well as ownership of a large number of pharmacies.
52. There is also substantial horizontal integration. While one individual may only own a maximum of four
pharmacies, the same individual may own multiple entities each of which may, in turn, also own up to four
pharmacies, thereby facilitating control of a large network and creating scope for anti- competitive behaviour. One
network of around 300 pharmacies is owned by a single entity, which also owns a wholesaler.
53. As of December 2014 there were 273 registered wholesalers in Bulgaria, with more than 320 warehouses.
Although five wholesalers supply more than 80% of the market, this very large number is likely to be contributing to
inefficiencies in the distribution chain.
54. Prescription medicines may only be dispensed and sold in pharmacies, whereas over-the-counter (OTC)
medicines may be sold in both pharmacies and ‘drug stores’ (numbering 965 in 2010). As at January 2015 there
were 4,217 registered pharmacies in Bulgaria, of which approximately half were authorized to dispense NHIF-
subsidized prescriptions. However, only about half of these have contracts with NHIF permitting them to dispense
fully reimbursed medicines (roughly one quarter of all registered pharmacies). Retail trade in reimbursable drugs is
perceived as unattractive for a significant number of pharmacies, and in around 15% of Bulgarian municipalities
there are no pharmacies dispensing NHIF-subsidized drugs at all.21
55. Because pharmacies do not receive dispensing fees for their professional services, they are heavily reliant on
these retail margins, together with income from OOP prescription costs, and retail sales of OTCs and non-medical
consumer goods. As noted previously, wholesale and retail mark-ups are set by the Ministry of Health, and are
proportional to drug prices, which creates incentives to supply and/or dispense more expensive products. However,
for drugs fully reimbursed by the NHIF26, the retail markup is not applied, and pharmacies receive only a fee of 2
BGN per prescription (not per item) payable by the NHIF.
56. Consideration should be given to reducing the reliance of pharmacies on retail margins and eliminating
disincentives for dispensing reimbursed products, by introducing a flat dispensing and/or professional service fee
applicable to all NHIF subsidized prescriptions. This would also reinforce the role of pharmacists as highly trained
health care professionals contributing to the safe and appropriate/rational use of medicines. Wholesale and retail
margins should also be restructured so that they are at least partly unbundled from the prices of the medicines and
replaced with fixed amounts, albeit with possible variations for products requiring special handling (for example,
narcotics, cold chain, cytotoxics).
57. In addition, discounting at both the wholesale and retail level can skew the availability of particular products
and create additional profits, because reimbursement is determined by list prices, not transaction costs.
Consideration could be given to the introduction of a “clawback” policy based on mandatory disclosure of actual
transaction prices, capturing cash and in-kind discounts. Both the UK and the Netherlands have instituted clawback
arrangements where discounting in the supply chain and full price reimbursement create windfall profits.27 Australia
has also implemented a system of price adjustments for off-patent medicines based on mandatory disclosure of
actual transaction prices (including cash and non-cash discounts), and this has led to very substantial price
reductions in the off-patent market.28


26 All medicines in Annex II and III are fully reimbursed and selected medicines in Annex 1
27 In the UK and the Netherlands, policies allow the sharing of discounts between distributors and payers.
28 See http://www.pbs.gov.au/info/industry/pricing/eapd/price-disclosure-faq. Under this mechanism actual transaction costs – including
cash and the value of discounts in kind - are required to be reported to Government for each product. At regular intervals the weighted average
transaction prices are calculated, and the reimbursement prices adjusted downward to reflect these. In this way discounts that would otherwise
be retained by pharmacies – by receiving discounted products but being reimbursed at the full rate – are captured by the Government.

2.7     Prescribing and dispensing
58. While drug prices are clearly an important determinant of overall expenditure, the other key components are
prescribing practices and other influences on utilization. Industry promotion, formulary selection and design, clinical
guidelines, utilization management tools,29 prescribing rules,30 and co-payment policies are among important factors
that influence demand. Promotion of new and more expensive medicines, prescriber detailing, and inducements to
prescribers and pharmacists can contribute significantly to the rapid growth in the use of new and expensive
therapies. Failure to promote the acceptance and use of generic medicines also increases expenditure.
59. Direct to consumer advertising of prescription medicines is not permitted, but pharmaceutical industry
promotion to prescribers is thought to be influential in driving prescribing in favour of more expensive products.
Anecdotally, there is strong and widespread criticism concerning the capacity of the BDA to adequately regulate
pharmaceutical industry promotional activities.
60. Prescribing by INN is not encouraged in Bulgaria and for NHIF subsidized prescriptions, pharmacies must, at
least in theory, dispense the brand specified by the prescriber. In practice however there is anecdotal evidence that
because of the proportional nature of retail margins substitution does occur in favour of higher-priced products, and
these are also favored where dispensing occurs without a prescription. The dispensing of prescription-only
medicines to patients without prescriptions is driven in part by low and unpredictable rates of NHIF reimbursement
and therefore of unpredictable OOP costs, but also because patients can avoid the cost and time of consulting a
physician. While this presumably reduces costs to NHIF (while increasing out of pocket costs to patients) it could
well be adding to the burden of medication-related adverse events and their associated costs, as well as to patterns
of anti-microbial resistance.
61. Despite near universal prescribing by brand, and the prohibition on substitution at pharmacy for reimbursable
drugs, generic utilization is substantial, though has been declining in recent years. Estimated at ~99% in 1989, the
generic market share (by volume) decreased from ~99% in 1989 to ~76% in 2010, and in 2011 was at 75% by
volume and 44% by value.21 This may reflect the effect of originator industry promotional activities, but anecdotally is
attributed, at least in part, to concerns about the quality of generic products. By specifying the originator brand in a
prescription (without permitting substitution), prescribers believe their patients can avoid ‘inferior’ generic products.
However, when a physician prescribes a medicine with a price higher than the reference or benchmark price, the
patient must pay the difference out of pocket.
62. Although multisource drugs, irrespective of brand, are reimbursed to the same degree by NHIF, prescribing
by brand is not necessarily cost neutral to NHIF, since brand preferences can lead to reduced competition, and
incentives used to encourage brand preferences are reflected in higher prices for those drugs. These incentives –
discounts and rebates – can generate substantials for pharmacies, and the benefits of competition are profits
retained in the supply chain rather than lowering prices for patients and payers.
63. There are a number of ways to influence prescribing practices and promote the rational use of medicines.
These include promoting or even mandating prescribing by INN and permitting substitution at pharmacy. Allowing
substitution at pharmacy is an essential element in rational generic drug policy. Other mechanisms include applying
constraints on prescribing—limiting the range or quantity of drugs or the circumstances in which they may be
prescribed and/or reimbursed; requiring prescribers to adhere to predefined consensus / national clinical treatment
guidelines31 or specific treatment protocols or algorithms; imposing prescribing budgets that encourage or require
prescribers to take cost and cost-effectiveness into consideration in making treatment decisions; introducing


29     Examples include setting maximum quantities, imposing treatment algorithms, and requiring physicians to seek prior authorization to
prescribe.
30     For example, mandating prescribing by INN.
31 To be effective in promoting efficient and rational care, clinical guidelines should take into account not just the comparative efficacy and
safety of different therapies but also their cost effectiveness.

co-financed by the European Union through the European Regional Development Fund
monitoring and feedback on individual prescribing patterns, with or without financial incentives or penalties; and
academic detailing of physicians in clinical practice.32 While academic detailing is an effective method of educating
prescribers, it is highly resource intensive and requires a substantial commitment to implement effectively. In
addition, principles of rational prescribing could be introduced into undergraduate and postgraduate medical
curricula. WHO has a number of well-tested materials on which such programs could be based.33 Promoting rational
prescribing should also be supported by the establishment of a source of independent drug information.
64. A requirement for INN-based prescribing should be accompanied with a communications strategy to promote
patient and prescriber confidence in the quality of generics, together with labelling and packaging standards to
minimize patient confusion when brand switching occurs. This should be coupled with the dissemination of
information about the availability of least costly alternatives at pharmacies.
65. A framework should be established in which pharmacies are a) permitted to substitute (unless expressly ruled
out on clinical grounds), b) both encouraged to offer and supply a benchmark-priced product, and c) penalized if
they fail to do so when one is requested. One option would be for the NHIF to pay a small fee to the pharmacy when
a benchmark-priced brand is supplied. 34
66. Another option would be to require pharmacies to absorb any difference in cost if a patient requests a
benchmark-priced product and one is not supplied. The difficulty with the latter is that where the drug is subject to
co-insurance amount (as distinct from a flat co-payment) it can be difficult for the patient to know how much they
should be paying. Pharmacies could, however, be required to display a list of benchmark prices for medicines in
high-volume clusters, as a guide for patients.35
67. Where a benchmark-priced product is the one dispensed, no (or only minimal) co-payment should be
required. 36 However, if the patient chooses an alternative brand, they should continue to bear the cost of any
difference in price between the benchmark product and the one dispensed.
68. A policy framework requiring pharmacies to dispense benchmark-priced products on request must also
ensure that such products are readily available to them. Matching incentives and penalties for wholesalers and
distributors should also be considered.

2.8     Prices, utilization, expenditure
69. This section presents an analysis of prices, utilization and expenditure trends for selected drugs in Annexes I,
II and III. In Table 6 and Table 8 Bulgarian prices are compared with prices in the UK and New Zealand for
selected Annex I medicines, and for the Top 25 (by value) in Annex II (mainly high cost, patented oncology
medicines) with prices in the UK alone. Where multiple prices are listed in the Annex for a given presentation the
lowest price has been used for the comparison. It is important to note however that for some drugs the unit prices
listed vary by more than a factor of 10 between different brands of the same presentation.
While for off-patent medicines better prices may be expected in the much larger and more competitive UK market,
the same cannot be said for New Zealand, with a population of only 4.4 million.37 For Annex II, UK prices were


32 Academic detailing is form of face-to-face education for prescribers by trained health care professionals, typically pharmacists,
physicians, or nurses. The goal of academic detailing is to change prescribing of targeted drugs to be consistent with available evidence,
support patient safety, and to be cost-effective medication choices and overall, to improve patient care.
33 See for example http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Jwhozip23e/
34 This is a policy used effectively in Australia to encourage pharmacies to stock and dispense benchmark-priced products.
35 This would not be necessary with a system of flat co-payments (that is co-payments that do not vary with the cost of the drug, though they
may vary with the patient’s capacity to pay).
36 In some countries, co-payments are only required if a brand other than the lowest priced is selected. For example, in Germany, patients
pay €5 out-of-pocket for a prescription, but if they accept a generic priced significantly below the market average under a contractual
agreement between their insurance fund and the manufacturer, the co-payment may be waived.

NOTES: Text in bold denotes medicines in NHIF ‘Top 25’ by reimbursement value in 2014. Total expenditure is for all presentations and dosage
forms of the INN. Data show NHIF expenditure, not total costs. Bulgarian prices shown as at 2 August 2014. Where multiple presentations
listed, Bulgarian price shown is for product with lowest unit cost. All prices over 100 Euros are rounded. UK prices from

70. Table 6 shows that there are a number of high unit cost, single source medicines for which Bulgarian prices
may not reflect reasonable value for money. The prices of adalimumab and etanercept, for example, are 18% and
13% higher respectively, than in the UK. Further, in the UK their assessment by the National Institute for Health and
Care Excellence (NICE) has resulted in use within the National Health Service being limited to the circumstances in
which the drugs are considered cost effective. Bulgaria not only appears to be paying higher prices for these drugs
(though this may in part be an artifact of the 20% VAT applied in Bulgaria) they are among those showing most rapid
growth in expenditure (see Table 7) and the extent of any restrictions on usage is unclear.




37 The New Zealand Pharmaceutical Management Agency PHARMAC makes extensive use of sole supplier tendering for off patent products
and the New Zealand market is highly competitive. The successful tenderer gets sole subsidized supply of the medicine for a fixed term thus
creating maximum incentive to offer the best price

71. Similarly, while the prices of long-acting insulin analogs such as insulin glargine are comparable with those in
the UK (notwithstanding the very substantial difference in per capita GDP and therefore capacity to pay), use of these
products in the UK is largely limited to patients with Type I diabetes, as they are not considered cost effective in most
patients with Type II diabetes. Others such as the TNFα inhibitors (eg adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab) are limited
to third line therapy38 and fourth line in Australia. 39

72. Within Annex II there are also a number of drugs for which prices are similar to, and in some cases even
higher than in the UK (Table 8). Currently drugs listed in Annex II carry no specifications as to the conditions for
which they may be prescribed, though the addition of ICD codes reflecting the approved indications for marketing are
planned.40 Given that the UK has a PPP-adjusted per capita GDP more than twice that of Bulgaria, many of these
drugs are clearly unlikely to be cost effective in Bulgaria. Many of these are also among those contributing most
significantly to rapid expenditure growth. If the prices of just the four highlighted drugs – nilotinib, rituximab,
pazopanib and pemetrexed – could be reduced to those in the UK, based on 2014 NHIF expenditure this alone would
generate savings of BGN 10.8 milllion.

73. Moreover many of the medicines list in Table 8 and Table 9 are subject to very significant constraints in use
in the UK, or not approved for use on the NHS. For example, NICE does not recommend bevacizumab for use in any
solid tumours; sunitinib is only recommended for first line and sorafenib is not recommended for either first or second


40 However, these will reflect the scope of marketing approval, which for many drugs will be much broader than the conditions in which use
of the drug is cost effective.

line treatment in renal cell carcinoma. Many of the other drugs listed here are very significantly restricted in the UK to
ensure cost effective use. There is no evidence that such restrictions are applied in Bulgaria (in the absence of
official guidelines).
74. A more extensive review of the existing PDL is likely to reveal further examples of drugs unlikely to be cost
effective at current Bulgarian prices, especially where existing clinical treatment algorithms do not take into account
the cost effectiveness of different therapies. Absent very significant reductions in price, several drugs are likely to
require very tight restrictions in order to approach cost effectiveness, or otherwise be considered as candidates for
disinvestment (delisting).

In January 2015 thirteen new medicines were added to the PDL, with a total estimated expenditure of BGN 34.6
million in the first year. While some of these costs will be offset by reductions in the use of other medicines, this
represents a substantial financial outlay for the NHIF. These are shown in Table 12.

75. Table 12 shows that the prices of these drugs in Bulgaria are comparable to those in the UK, yet several of
them are either not considered cost effective there or are significantly restricted in their use on the NHS. Many of
these new listings are therefore unlikely to be cost effective options for Bulgaria at this time.
  •     ruxolitinib is a selective inhibitor of the Janus-associated tyrosine kinases JAK1 and JAK2 and is licensed for
        the treatment of disease-related splenomegaly or symptoms in patients with primary myelofibrosis, post-
        polycythaemia vera myelofibrosis, or post-essential thrombocythaemia myelofibrosis. However ruxolitinib
        is not recommended by NICE for any of these conditions.41
  •     pertuzumab is used in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel for the treatment of HER2 positive
        metastatic or locally recurrent unresectable breast cancer which has not been previously treated, or has
        relapsed after adjuvant therapy. NICE’s appraisal committee did not recommend the technology because the
        incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) was in excess of £125,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).42
  •     axitinib is recommended by NICE as an option for treating adults with advanced renal cell carcinoma after
        failure of treatment with a first-line tyrosine kinase inhibitor or a cytokine, only if the company provides axitinib
        with the discount agreed in the patient access scheme. In other words, the drug is only considered
        satisfactorily cost effective in the UK at a discount on the listed price.43

           TK inhibitor, and if the manufacturer provides afatinib with the discount agreed in the patient access scheme.45
     •     brentuximab is licensed for the treatment of relapsed or refractory CD-30 positive Hodgkin's disease following
           autologous stem cell transplant or following at least two prior therapies, when autologous stem cell transplant
           or multi-agent chemotherapy is not a treatment option. It is also licensed for relapsed or refractory systemic
           anaplastic large cell lymphoma. It has not yet been considered by NICE.46
     •     lipefilgrastim has not yet been considered by NICE, but the Scottish Medicines Consortium found it non-
           inferior to pegfilgrastim and accepted it for restricted use within NHS Scotland.47
     •     lixisenatide is used in people with type 2 diabetes who are receiving oral antidiabetic drugs or basal insulin.
           Efficacy is assessed by measuring levels of glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), however non-inferiority to
           exenatide (already listed) has not been shown for this outcome and there are as yet no published data relating
           to clinical endpoints.

3.         Analysis and Recommendations
76. Without an integrated national medicines policy, the Bulgarian pharmaceutical sector is characterized by
various highly prescriptive and at times, arguably counterproductive policy levers. While the regulatory framework
has been largely brought into line with current EU standards, existing mechanisms for listing, pricing and subsidizing
medicines are not ensuring adequate value for money for the NHIF, and are contributing to inefficiencies in the public
financing of the health sector. Current pharmaceutical policy settings appear focused on limiting NHIF outlays rather
than rather than prioritizing access and affordability, and afford little financial protection to patients.
77. Processes for listing medicines on the Positive Drug List are insufficiently influenced by considerations of cost
effectiveness and there are no explicit links between circumstances of listing and existing prescribing practices.
Insufficient consideration of cost-effectiveness when listing and pricing medicines together with inadequate or
ineffective restrictions on prescribing are resulting in rapid growth in public expenditure on some very high unit cost
and potentially non cost-effective medicines. A significant portion of this rapidly growing expenditure is avoidable.
78. Current policy settings do not promote competition among off-patent medicines and many prices for both
patented and off-patent medicines compare unfavorably with countries with far greater capacity to pay. Several high
cost medicines contributing significantly to rapid expenditure growth are unlikely to be cost effective in Bulgaria and
should be subject to price (re)negotiation, explicit restrictions on use, and in some cases, disinvestment (delisting).
79. Ideally, a key objective of any reforms should be to improve overall coverage of essential prescription
medicines and reduce OOP costs for patients, taking into account the existing and evolving burden of disease in
setting expenditure priorities. If Bulgaria were also able to encourage greater competition in the off-patent medicines

market, this, together with measures to address demand and promote rational prescribing and generic uptake, could
significantly improve efficiency in current pharmaceutical expenditure.
80. More rational processes for drug evaluation are critical, as are procurement and pricing mechanisms that are
more flexible and fit for purpose, and can effectively leverage the market power of the public sector by utilizing
inclusion on the PDL as an effective barrier to market entry. These would include giving the Pricing Council the
capacity to negotiate prices with pharmaceutical manufacturers and to introduce risk-sharing arrangements, bundling
agreements and other approaches to pricing beyond the passive acceptance of prices reported in other countries.

3.1. Goal: Greater clarity in policy objectives
        •    Prioritize the development of a comprehensive, integrated, national medicines policy
81. The Concept Note: Health 2020 Goals48 stresses the importance of increasing the efficiency of drug treatment,
of building capacity for the evaluation of health technologies, of the role of clinical guidelines and treatment
algorithms, and of prescribing and using medicines that are effective and cost-effective. It articulates the need for
improvements in the mechanisms for pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products and medical products paid for
with public resources.
82. While these are critical policy goals they do not capture all the elements necessary to articulate a
comprehensive national medicines policy. Although there has been some considerable support for the development
of an overarching policy, previous attempts to develop one have stalled.
83. It is recommended that the Bulgarian Government prioritize the development and promulgation of a
comprehensive national medicines policy, with clear objectives and priorities addressing financing, equity of access,
individual and collective affordability and financial protection, technical and allocative efficiency, and long term
sustainability. All relevant stakeholders should be represented in its development through a consultative process,
and should commit to supporting it once agreed.

3.2     Goal: More effective formulary decision making and pricing processes
        Consider
        •    revising the remit, structure, composition and operation of the National Pricing Council
        •    introducing (comparative) cost effectiveness as a mandatory criterion for inclusion of a drug in the PDL
        •    establishing a simplified HTA process until HTA resources and mechanisms can be established
        •    modifying use of external reference pricing pending implementation of full HTA
        •    introducing competitive tendering for off patent medicines, both for individual molecules and selected
             therapeutic classes; limiting the number of products and suppliers; and requiring supply guarantees
        Introduce mandatory Budget Impact Assessment for all new medicines with anticipated high cost or utilization
        Review the current PDL and consider delisting or restricting products unlikely to be cost effective in Bulgaria;
        renegotiate prices where possible
        Consider applying restrictions on listing, and developing risk sharing arrangements (RSAs) for high cost
        medicines
        Progress development of evidence-based clinical treatment guidelines that take into account the cost
        effectiveness of therapies in Bulgaria.

84. The operation of the Pricing Council should be revised as a matter of priority to a) modify its remit, b) provide
it with needed expertise, c) clarify evaluation and decision criteria, d) improve the transparency and quality of
decision-making, and (e) enable engagement with stakeholders.
85. The procedural and governance arrangements of the Pricing Council and reimbursement program should
ensure that a recommendation for the addition of a medicine to the PDL cannot be made in the absence of an
evidence-based evaluation of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, budget impact assessment (BIA), and specific
consideration of the necessary conditions for cost-effective prescribing. Medicines should only be added to the PDL
if they can be shown to reflect reasonable value for money in the Bulgarian context. BIA should be undertaken using
epidemiological estimates, taking into account current or anticipated prescribing patterns.
86. Detailed information about the considerations of the committee and the evidence that has informed its
recommendations should be published and prescribers should encouraged to understand the relative merits and
costs of medicines, particularly as detailing by pharmaceutical companies will tend to exaggerate benefits and
downplay risks (including expenditure risks).
87. Core principles that should be codified in guidelines for the future operation of the Pricing Council should
include
        • Independence from government, MoH, NHIF, sectoral interest groups (including clinical and patient
          groups) and industry, by recognizing any conflict of interest in policies and processes for engaging with
          different stakeholders.
        • Transparency in the way work is prioritized, the evidence synthesized and assessed, and the final
          decisions made; by publicizing all relevant analyses; and by minimizing the extent to which information
          is protected.
        • Scientific rigour, by applying peer review and remaining methodologically current in the evaluation of
          evidence.
        • Value and affordability, by ensuring that comparative cost effectiveness is an essential criterion for a
          positive listing decision.
88. Membership of the Pricing Council should include clinicians representing the key internal medicine
specialties, one or more representatives of primary care, at least one health economist, and one or more consumer
representatives. It could also include a pharmacist, and an epidemiologist/ biostatistician.
89. While the availability of legal expertise is essential to the Pricing Council’s effective operation, it is not clear
that legal practitioners are needed for formulary decision making per se, particularly where decisions rely on
assessments of clinical and cost effectiveness rather than legal precepts. The Pricing Council need not undertake
explicit evaluation of applications for listing of generic versions of already-listed medicines; these could be
processed by Secretariat staff.
90. The time taken to review and consider applications for listing and pricing is well short of the maximum
duration specified in the EU Transparency Directive and may not be sufficient to allow for rigorous assessment of an
application dossier. The frequency of meetings of the Council would also need to be modified to reflect the changes
in process. Consideration should be given to increasing Application fees to support an expansion of resources and
to more closely reflect the effort required to manage the listing and pricing processes. Experience from other
countries suggests that the PDL and price could be updated less frequently, for instance once or twice a year.
91. When medicines are listed on the PDL sponsors should be required to guarantee availability of sufficient
product to supply a minimum percentage of the anticipated market at or below the price proposed, for at least 12
months. Under the current arrangements a product can be accepted for listing on the PDL and set the benchmark,
and yet be largely unavailable, thus increasing patient OOP costs.
92. A key recommendation is the introduction of full health technology assessment (HTA) for medicines (and
potentially for other health technologies) as a specific medium term objective (3-5 years). A key part of the

This Project is implemented with the financial support of Operational Programme “Technical Assistance”                34
co-financed by the European Union through the European Regional Development Fund
establishment of the process will be the development of guidelines both for applications to the process and those
involved in their evaluation. Guidelines for the submission of applications for consideration by the committee are
currently being drafted; these should set forth in some detail the nature, scope, presentation, rigour and
transparency expected of the evidence of comparative clinical and cost effectiveness to be presented by the
applicants. Above all, the establishment of cost effectiveness as a mandatory criterion for listing of a drug on the
PDL must be prioritized.
93. Establishing an HTA framework will take time and resources but Bulgaria may be able to draw on the
experience of other EU member states. Several smaller countries are well advanced in establishing HTA processes
and entities, and there are potential opportunities for synergy and collaboration. A good example is the introduction
of the Baltic pharmacoeconomic guidelines and combined evaluation processes.
94. In the interim an abbreviated HTA process could be introduced using a scoring mechanism that draws on the
extent to which a medicine has been subject to HTA and the conditions under which it is reimbursed elsewhere in
the EU. A simple scorecard similar to that previously proposed by Seiter (2007)49 could be developed and use to
support decisions on whether (and the extent to which) a product should be included in the PDL. The current
regulations specify that a new medicine must be reimbursed in at least 5 other jurisdictions, but it need not have
been subject to HTA.
95. In addition, until HTA can be put in place to directly or indirectly influence pricing, it is suggested that a
modified external reference pricing paradigm be adopted. Under this paradigm, the price of a new medicine would
be determined based on the price of that medicine in an EU country (Country A) where it has been reimbursed
following rigorous HTA review, adjusted by factor equivalent to the ratio of Bulgarian GDP to Country A GDP (PPP
adjusted). This adjusted price then forms the target price for negotiation with the drug’s sponsor. Subsequent
inclusion of the medicine on the Bulgarian PDL based on this adjusted external reference price should be limited to
those indications and treatment settings for which it is reimbursed in Country A.
96. Undertaking an in-depth review of the current Annexes could free up some resources relatively quickly. All
high unit cost and high volume products on the Reimbursement List would be reviewed to determine whether
reimbursement should be restricted in terms of indications, patient populations, prior treatment modalities, treatment
duration and/or maximum quantities, to support cost-effective use. Prior authorization should be required for all
drugs for which diagnostic certainty or prior treatment failure is a prerequisite for cost-effective therapy. This could
be expedited by mirroring any listing conditions applying in the country from which the price has been referenced
and requiring the negotiation of RSAs for all products for which expenditure has exceeded a pre-determined
threshold in the preceding financial year.
97. The use of BIAs should guide the introduction and use of financial Risk Sharing Arrangements (RSAs).
Estimating the size of the population in whom the drug is likely to be cost effective can inform the terms and
parameters of an RSA. Absolute expenditure caps (with rebates for use exceeding agreed estimates) could be
considered in cases where anticipated utilization is difficult to estimate) or price-volume agreements (where unit
prices are reduced beyond an agreed volume) where cost-effectiveness differs between sub-populations, and where
use cannot easily be limited to cost-effective settings. RSAs can improve the accuracy of budget impact
assessments and discourage inappropriate promotion both to prescribers and within the distribution chain. Uptake
should be monitored with regular review of observed vs expected utilization.
98. It is recommended that in order to optimize pricing for high volume off-patent medicines, consideration be
given to limiting reimbursement to one, or at most two or three brands of any molecule, selected on the basis of

open tender. Successful tenderers should be required to demonstrate that they are able to supply a pre-specified
proportion of the market as a minimum, and penalties should be established and enforced for failure to supply.
99. Limiting the number of suppliers of a given molecule will encourage competition in the market; the greater the
proportion of the market guaranteed for a given supplier the steeper the price reductions likely to be achieved. If
necessary to retain low turnover products on the market, consideration could be given to exemptions from BDA fees
(on a rebate basis) for low volume/ low value medicines, including orphan drugs.
100. For (high volume and high cost) classes within which there is a high degree of therapeutic interchangeability
(eg proton pump inhibitors, ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, statins, calcium channel blockers),
consideration should be given to limiting subsidy to no more than two, or at most three molecules in each class,
again on the basis of competitive tendering. Successful tenderers should again be required to provide supply
guarantees, with penalties applying for supply failures. For some high unit cost drugs for example erythropoietins,
sole supply arrangements could even be considered. This would create a strong incentive for competitive pricing. In
a resource constrained environment choice might reasonably be considered a luxury; it is difficult to imagine why six
erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) are needed.

3.3     Goal: improved access, equity, and affordability
        Consider
         replacing co-insurance with fixed, flat co-payments
         introducing a consumer awareness campaign to reinforce a) the safety and quality of generic medicines;
           b) the actual costs of medicines; and c) opportunities for consumers to save money at the pharmacy by
           choosing benchmark-priced products
         using savings on off patent medicines to increase levels of reimbursement in key therapeutic classes
101. An active generics policy also requires undertaking awareness campaigns to encourage widespread
acceptance for generic medicines among patients and prescribers. A program to promote the safety and quality of
generic medicines, raise awareness of actual costs of medicines and opportunities to save money by choosing
generic options at pharmacy should be developed. The actual price of a medicine could be added to the dispensing
label. This encourages consumer awareness of the value of the subsidy provided.
102. Rationalization and simplification of patient co-payments through the introduction of a flat co-payment
structure should be considered to improve both equity and individual affordability. Co-insurance is regressive and
creates uncertainty for patients; uncertainty in cost has been shown to reduce treatment adherence. This need not
involve increased expenditure; it should be possible to model a tiered co-payment system that is revenue neutral.
103. Further improvements in affordability could be achieved by educating prescribers in cost effective prescribing,
ensuring the availability of benchmark priced products at pharmacy, and by raising awareness among consumers of
the safety, quality and availability of generic medicines and the additional costs that may be avoided by choosing a
benchmark-priced product.

3.4     Goal: Better management of utilization and promotion of rational use
               Develop and mandate adherence to clinical guidelines based on evidence of effectiveness and cost
                effectiveness
               Consider introducing “good prescribing” education for prescribers, which should an understanding of
                the comparative effectiveness and cost effectiveness of treatments
               Consider introducing indicative individual prescribing budgets, with monitoring of prescribing behavior
                and feedback to prescribers
               Consider introducing an entity to provide independent drug information

104. Evidence-based consensus guidelines are needed to guide rational pharmacotherapy nationally. Currently
guidelines are being developed that are not informed by considerations of cost or cost effectiveness, and may lead
to greater expenditure by encouraging uptake of new treatments. .
105. In addition to clinical guidelines, physicians need to be educated on the principles of rational prescribing. This
education should be offered to medical students, recent graduates and as part of continuing professional education.
106. Consideration should be given to introducing indicative prescribing budgets in primary care, with
accompanying mechanism to monitor prescribing and provide constructive feedback to prescribers.
107. Finally consideration could be given to the establishment of an entity involving academics and health
professionals to provide a source of independent drug information. This could also undertake academic detailing and
support training and curriculum development in rational prescribing.

3.5     Goal: Improved distribution chain
        Consider
         permitting substitution at pharmacy for NHIF-reimbursed medicines
         establishing incentives for pharmacies to dispense benchmark-priced generics and for wholesalers to
           supply them
         introducing fees for professional services eg dispensing
         introducing fixed, flat wholesale and retail margins
         introducing clawback arrangements to take advantage of discounting in the distribution chain
108. As pharmacies do not receive dispensing fees or any other payments for professional services (apart from a
2BGN fee in lieu of a co-payment paid by the patient for a prescription containing up to three fully reimbursed items)
pharmacies rely on income from dispensing without prescription, OOP prescription costs, dispensing higher priced
products where possible, margins on retail sales of OTCs and non-medical consumer goods. In addition significant
income is likely to accrue from discounting in the supply chain.
109. Reducing the dependence of pharmacies on income from retail margins, and giving financial recognition for
professional services would lessen this reliance and reinforce the role of the pharmacist as a health care
professional contributing to the safe and appropriate use of medicines. Pharmacists are highly trained professionals
in Bulgaria, undertaking up to five years of tertiary study and this investment should be capitalized on.
110. A framework could be established in which pharmacies are both encouraged to offer and supply a
benchmark-priced product and penalized if they fail to do so when one is requested. One option would be to
introduce a small dispensing fee payable when a benchmark price brand is supplied. Another option would be to
require the pharmacy to absorb any difference in cost if the patient requests a benchmark-priced product and one is
not supplied. The difficulty with the latter is that with co-insurance rather than fixed co-payments it is difficult for a
patient to know where the benchmark is. Pharmacies could however be required to display a list of benchmark
prices for medicines in high volume clusters, as a guide for patients. A policy that requires pharmacies to dispense a
benchmark product on request must also ensure that such products are available to them. Matching incentives and
penalties for wholesaler and distributors would also need to be developed.
111. The current structure of the wholesale and retail margins creates incentives to supply and dispense more
expensive drugs, and to reduce availability of cheaper ones. Wholesale and retail margins should be restructured so
that they are unbundled from the prices of the medicines and replaced by fixed amounts, with variations for products
requiring special handling (e.g., narcotics, cold chain, cytotoxics).
112. In addition significant discounting at both wholesale and retail level skews the availability of particular
products and creates additional profits as prescriptions are reimbursed based on the list prices. Consideration could
be given to the introduction of a clawback policy based on mandatory disclosure of actual transfer prices, taking into
account cash and non-cash discounts.

3.6     Goal: A more sustainable system
        Consider
         reducing VAT to the concessional rate
         requiring supply guarantees to discourage parallel exports
         adjusting prices across the board if expenditure growth exceeds GDP growth
113. As noted above VAT on medicines in Bulgaria is substantially higher than many other EU countries. Where
patients face significant OOP costs, VAT on medicines differentially affects the poor and contributes to inequity. It is
recommended that consideration be given to reducing the VAT rate to a level similar to other CEE countries.
114. Efforts to reduce prices carry the risk of encouraging parallel exports. Anecdotally, this is said to be a
significant issue, but data were not available. Parallel exports are difficult to track, and a recent constitutional court
decision nullified requirements approved by the Parliament in 2014 that introduced authorization by BDA of any
planned export of medicines included in the PDL.50 The key risk of parallel export is the potential for shortages of
essential medicines. One option would be to require supply guarantees as a condition of inclusion on the PDL.
115. To create greater certainty regarding overall expenditure options include fixing a budget and growth rate for
reimbursed medicines, with funding for new medicines predicated on obtaining savings from getting better prices for
existing ones. This is essentially the model used by the New Zealand Pharmaceutical Management Agency
(PHARMAC).51 (See Box 2). Another possible approach would be to allow demand to drive expenditure but reduce
prices across the board by one percentage point for each percentage of expenditure growth in excess of growth in
GDP (or other designated measure).

               Box 2: About New Zealand’s Pharmaceutical Management Agency (PHARMAC)50

  PHARMAC operates within a fixed budget covering community
  medicines, hospital medicines and vaccines. It uses a range of
  commercial purchasing strategies to encourage price competition
  including:
   Negotiation: As funding applicants are competing for funding
    from a fixed budget, negotiation increases competition between
    suppliers.
   Tendering: For off-patent medicines tendering leads
    to significant price reductions (in some cases > 90%). The
    successful tenderer gets sole subsidized supply of the medicine
    for a fixed term thus creating maximum incentive to offer the best
    price.
   Reference pricing: Under therapeutic reference pricing the
    same subsidy is applied to medicines with the same
    or similar therapeutic effect.
   Rebates: Contracts with pharmaceutical companies may include
    confidential rebates to the public purchasers
   Expenditure caps: If annual spending exceeds an agreed
    expenditure cap, the supplier must refund the balance. This is
    useful where there is uncertainty around likely uptake of a
    medicine.
   Multi-product agreements (bundling): Suppliers with large
    portfolios of products may offer price reductions on older
    medicines in return for a new medicine being subsidized.
  The impact of these strategies on containment of drug expenditure
  over time can be seen in the figure opposite.

4.      Conclusions
116. This report presents a large number of recommendations and options for the Bulgarian Government to
consider. Some of these will be controversial and their feasibility will be subject to influences that may lie outside the
health care system. Moreover, no suite of policies, however carefully framed, can satisfy the often-conflicting
priorities and needs of all stakeholders. Competitive tendering for off-patent medicines and limiting the brands
included on the PDL are likely to meet with resistance from both industry (generic and research-based) sectors;
patients may claim it reduces choice, while providers may argue that it interferes with the independent exercise of
their clinical judgment and prevents them from taking the best care of their patients.
117. For these reasons the development of an overarching national medicines policy, with priorities and objectives
agreed by stakeholders, should be a key priority. Getting stakeholders to agree and commit to supporting an explicit
set of policy objectives is crucial to successfully implementing reforms that, while consistent with those objectives,
may well be unpalatable to them.
118. Resource constraints will always preclude the subsidy of all effective medicines for all potential patients, and
even highly cost effective medicines may be unaffordable if the scale of treatment is large. Insofar as some degree
of rationing is inevitable, those responsible for making the decisions must ensure that the decisions are transparent,
publicly accountable, and arrived at only after a thoughtful assessment of the clinical and economic evidence,
undertaken by competent and disinterested experts, and having regard to societal values and priorities, wherever
possible.
