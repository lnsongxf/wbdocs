THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: DB2014 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for D B2014 that capture the effects of such
factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practic e or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

        A recent proof of land ownership or property certificate can now be
        obtained from the Ministry of Urban Planning Development (Ministere
        du Developpement Urbain). This was previously obtained from the Land

        * Obtain a certificate of urban planning (certificat d'urbanisme)

        The Planning Certificate shows whether this is a building land, provides
        information on the density of permitted construction, and notifies of
        the existence of easements. It also provides information on whether
        utilities are available on this land or planned in the future (water,      10 days          XAF 16,200

      For the geotechnical assessment, the services of a professional certified

      * Hire an authorized supervision agency

      For buildings with a surface area of more than 400 sq. m., contractors
      must hire a private company “Bureau d’Etude” to supervise the
      construction phase. According to Decree Nº 201/1005 PM/ of May 21,
5     2014, the Communauté Urbaine de Doula now requires that a contract           1 day      XAF 2,397,107

      Obtain building permit

      To obtain a building permit, BuildCo must submit four copies of each of
      the following documents:

      • Application (stamped, with forms provided by the Douala Urban
      Council). The fiscal stamp and two communal stamps (timbre fiscal et
      deux timbre communaux) are required.
      • Certificates of ownership
      • Certificates of urban planning (Certificat d’urbanisme)
      • Block and location plans (plan de situation et plan de masse)
      • Site, foundation, roofing, view or elevation, and septic tank plans
      • Descriptive estimates

      All plans must be signed by an architect accredited by the National
      Order of Architects (l’Ordre National des Architectes du Cameroun,
      ONAC).

      The company hires a structural engineer, accredited by the National
      Order of Structural Engineers, to develop a structural design that then
      serves as the execution plan. Because the engineer signs this document,
      it is not modifiable without his express consent. Although an FCFA
      1,000.00 application fee is payable upon submission, the building
      permit fee is paid upon permit approval. The official time limit for
      permit approval is 90 days. Afterwards, the silent-is-consent rule
      applies.

the case from simple debt enforcement. To make the
data comparable across economies, Doing Business
uses several assumptions about the case:

        economy’s largest business city. For the 11

ENFORCING CONTRACTS
Economies in all regions have improved contract                   reducing backlogs by introducing periodic reviews to
enforcement in recent years. A judiciary can be improved          clear inactive cases from the docket and by making
in different ways. Higher-income economies tend to look           procedures faster. What reforms making it easier (or
for ways to enhance efficiency by introducing new                 more difficult) to enforce contracts has Doing Business
