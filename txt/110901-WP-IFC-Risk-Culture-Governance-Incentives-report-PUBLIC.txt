of an economy. The Euro and United States of America (US) subprime
crises have demonstrated that even within a tightly regulated financial
system, hard-earned growth can be easily eroded in the absence of certain
aspects of good governance principles and management practices. A key
area of attention that has emerged from the diagnosis of the financial crisis
is the critical importance of risk culture, risk governance, and balanced
incentives within financial institutions as preconditions for maintaining an
effective risk management framework. A lot of research and studies have
been done on the impact of these three components with a focus on the
failures in developed markets and on large banks. There has been little or
no focus on the impact of similar issues in emerging markets.

The IFC Global Risk Management advisory program aims to strengthen
financial institutions’ risk management capacity and frameworks and
has published this best practice handbook to expand the knowledge
and research on practices on risk culture, risk governance, balanced
incentives, and the impact these three components have on effective

Case Study 1: An example of negative culture impacta



    The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is an interest rate at which banks lend unsecured funds to each other and is published
    daily by the British Bankers’ Association (BBA). Each morning, global banks submit their borrowing costs to the Thomson Reuters
    data collection service and after removing the highest and lowest 25 percent of the submissions, the calculation agent averages the
    remaining submissions to determine LIBOR. LIBOR is considered the most important benchmark interest rate as many banks use
    LIBOR to set the interest rates for lending to consumers and businesses. When LIBOR rises, the rates and payments on loans often
    increase.

    Some European banks were recently under investigation for allegedly manipulating the LIBOR rate. The employees of the banks
    submitted rates that would benefit the banks instead of the rates the banks actually paid for the funds they borrowed. One particular
    European bank manipulated LIBOR downward to appear less risky. In another European bank, its senior management took the blame
    for creating a system in which its employees were awarded huge bonuses if they took part in the scheme. Their focus on short-term
    return on equity and their competitive position led to a decline in culture and values.

    This practice undermined investors’ confidence in the financial markets and distorted the pricing of trillions of dollars of financial
    instruments. The banks that participated in the LIBOR scandal have been sued with some paying huge amounts in settlement claims.
    There has also been a push to scrap the LIBOR rate in favor of a new rate based on real transactions data.

Case Study 2: Ensuring common values



     To ensure that all its employees across the markets it operates in have aligned their values and interests with its approach to
     business, one of the banks interviewed has developed a code of ethics (“Code”) which all employees are required to review and sign
     off on to confirm understanding. The Code, available on the bank’s intranet, has the following objectives:

     •	 To provide a collective statement of standards for personal and corporate behavior;

     •	 To foster employee behavior that aligns with the bank’s core values—Integrity, Accessibility, Mutual Respect and Continuous
        Learning;

     •	 To ensure adherence to principles of professional behavior;

     •	 To promote and maintain confidence in the banking profession;

     •	 To resist and highlight improper or unprofessional conduct;

     •	 To instill a sense of honesty, fairness, and decency in the conduct of banking business;

     •	 To harmonize the concepts of profitability and social responsibility;

     •	 To reinforce compliance with regulators’ requirements;

     •	 To enhance and sustain public confidence in the banking industry;

     •	 To safeguard the cornerstones of the banking profession; and

     •	 To respect the bank’s rules of professional conduct.


     The Code is a mandatory module for all staff orientation classes and is also accessible in the bank intranet to all staff. The bank in 2013
     introduced a mandatory e-learning module which all bank staff are required to undertake on an annual basis to confirm and refresh
     their understanding of the Code.

      It is reviewed alongside the Human Resources (HR) policy manual annually (where applicable). The Code, which was developed
     seven years ago by the HR team in liaison with the Legal and Compliance team, has been approved at the senior management
     level and by the Board of Directors and has benefited the bank in many ways, i.e., it is instrumental in instilling discipline and thus
     enhancing internal controls performance of the bank. It encourages ownership, accountability, compliance, confidentiality and
     ethical behavior.

                                                                                         —enforces the code of ethics by
     The bank’s Management Disciplinary Committee—which reports to the Board HR Committee­
     adjudicating any infringements by an employee and, depending on the severity, recommends an appropriate sanction, which could be
     a caution, warning, suspension or termination.

Case Study 3: Consideration of risk management principles



     In addition to defining a risk management framework that contains the definitions of key risk terms and their categorizations,
     a participating bank in this study further enhances the universal application of risk management principles through continuous
     discussion. Risk management is a standing agenda on the Board and Board subcommittee meetings as well as Management
     Operational Committee meetings.

     The bank further ensures that its officials consider the risk implications of their decisions through risk assessments as one of the key
     steps in approval of new products and/or initiatives and through regular Risk and Control Self Assessments (RCSAs) and Key Control
     Risk Assessments (KCSAs).The business units provide information in the RCSA and KCSA templates provided by the Risk Management
     Division. Any new risks identified are discussed at the monthly Management Operational Risk Committee and mitigating actions are
     identified.

     To further ensure that risk management principles are applied uniformly in the bank, risk management discussions are held at
     departmental meetings. With these practices, there has been a better and considerably active engagement between the business and
     risk functions thereby leading to a reduction of losses relative to business growth and day-to day operations.

Case Study 4: Risk management responsibilities



     A listed commercial bank offering a full range of corporate and retail banking services that participated in this study has identified
     risk champions across the business to help embed the “right” risk culture across the bank and ensure individual and collective
     ownership over risk management and reporting.This ensures that the risk champions have constant interactions with the business
     units they represent. The information collected by the risk champions is then reported to the Board on a quarterly basis through the
     Risk Function.

     Risk champions are identified within the business unit based on their performance. They must have substantive knowledge of the
     business unit to be able to effectively guide the business unit on coordinating and reporting on risk management issues through
     the Risk Management department. The champions undergo regular formal risk management training from the Risk Management
     department and external consultants as appropriate to guide them in their role as risk champions.

     Through the risk champions, the bank has been able to benefit from a more coordinated and focused approach to risk management.
     The business units with support from their risk champions and the risk management function are involved in developing the
     mitigating actions in their respective business units thus facilitating effective risk ownership in the Bank.

3.1	   Introduction
                                                                                           Risk management framework
A bank has many stakeholders that include the Board, senior
management, employees, regulatory authorities, customers, suppliers,
                                                                                            Qualiﬁcations and experience
other banks and lenders, and the community in which it operates.
Effective interaction with these stakeholders requires a bank to have good
                                                                                               Training and capacity

Risk governance focuses on applying the principles of sound corporate
governance to the identification, management and communication of
risk. It incorporates the principles of accountability, participation and
transparency in establishing policies and structures to make and implement
risk-related decisions.23 A sound risk governance framework promotes
clarity and understanding of the ways in which bank employees execute
their responsibilities.

The bank should strive to manage the risks its faces holistically by
adequately assessing and addressing risk from all perspectives and quarters;
breaking through the organizational barriers that may obscure a view
of the entirety of risks facing the bank; and systematically anticipating
and preparing an integrated response to potentially significant risks. This
also requires institutions to move away from the traditional “silo-based”
approach to risk management. Holistic risk management is a concept about
managing all the risks simultaneously and is all about accountability—that
is, people taking responsibility for their actions. Holistic risk management
involves a methodology where the various risk types that can affect a bank
are considered holistically, rather than independently.24

To ensure this, the bank’s risk governance should exhibit the following
characteristics:25

Case Study 5: Board level committees



   One of the banks interviewed indicated having established a Board Integrated Risk Management Committee (BIRMC) and a Board
   Audit Review Committee (BARC) through which the Board maintained oversight of risk management activities at the bank. Through
   these committees, the Board fulfils its responsibilities of approving a risk management strategy for the bank, articulating the bank’s
   risk appetite, establishing the risk governance structure, reviewing significant risk issues highlighted by its committees, reporting to
   stakeholders on risk management of the bank, and approving public disclosures.

   The mandate of the BIRMC includes ensuring that the bank has a comprehensive risk management framework; assessing the
   effectiveness of the bank’s risk management systems and monitoring risks through appropriate risk indicators and management
   information. The BIRMC ensures compliance with laws, regulations, regulatory guidelines, internal controls, and bank policies, and
   updates the Board on the bank’s risk exposure.

   The functions of the BARC include: making recommendations on matters in connection with the appointment, fee negotiation,
   resignation and dismissal of the external auditor of the Bank; discussing issues arising from the interim and final audits, and any
   matters the external auditor may so wish. The BARC also reviews the adequacy of the internal audit programs and results of the
   internal audit process and ensures that appropriate actions are taken on the recommendations of the internal audit department. As a
   champion of whistle-blowing, the BARC ensures that mechanisms are available for employees to report on possible improprieties in
   financial reporting, internal controls or any other matters and a fair and independent investigation of these reports.

   The committees meet on a quarterly basis and decisions made at these meetings are enforced via the Risk Management Division of
   the bank who also submit quarterly reports to the Board.

Case Study 6: Regulator guidelines on the risk management and compliance functions—East Africa



     One of the regulators in East Africa with over 44 banks under its jurisdiction recently issued updated risk management guidelines
     which require that banks and banking groups must have comprehensive risk management processes. A bank is required to have a
     comprehensive risk management function tailored to its needs and circumstances under which it operates and supervises the bank’s
     overall riskmanagement.

     The function should be independent from those who take or accept risks on behalf of the institution and should report directly to the
     Board Risk Management Committee. The risk management function is charged with:

     •	   Identifying current and emerging risks;

     •	   Developing risk assessment and measurement systems;

     •	   Establishing policies, practices and other control mechanisms to manage risks;

     •	   Developing risk tolerance limits for senior management and Board approval;

     •	   Monitoring positions against approved risk tolerance limits; and

     •	   Reporting results of risk monitoring to senior management and the Board.

     The regulator has also issued guidelines on compliance risk. Compliance risk is defined as the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions,
     financial loss, or loss to reputation an institution may suffer as a result of its failure to comply with all applicable laws, guidelines,
     code of conduct and standards of good practice. The guidelines require the establishment of a compliance function. This should be
     an independent function which facilitates efforts to comply with legal and regulatory requirements by tracking and documenting
     compliance. The function should be sufficiently resourced and its responsibilities should be clearly specified.

     Licensed institutions are required to organize their compliance function and set priorities for the management of their compliance
     risk in a way that is consistent with their own risk management strategy and structures. Some institutions may wish to organize
     their compliance function within their operational risk management function, as there is a close relationship between compliance
     risk and certain aspects of operational risk. Others may prefer to have separate compliance and operational risk functions, but
     establish mechanisms requiring close cooperation between the two functions on compliance matters.

     The function should report independently to the Board, or committee of the Board, that identifies, assesses, advises, monitors and
     reports on the institution’s compliance risk.

     A bank that is licensed by the regulator to operate should therefore include compliance risk as part of its risk management processes
     and risks of non-compliance identified, assessed, and managed as part of overall risk management.

Case Study 7: The role of the risk function



    To focus on the different risks facing the bank, one of the studied banks has established specialized units within the risk management
    department. The bank’s risk department is responsible for monitoring and reporting on credit, market, and operational risks. The
    department has the following units:

    •	   The credit risk management unit is divided to focus on the bank’s three target markets—large companies, SMEs and retail
         customers. It performs analyses of the credit files before submission to the appropriate credit committees. Its other major roles
         include development of assessment tools and risk management, and internal regulatory reporting on credit risk performance;

    •	   The market risk management unit’s roles include monitoring bank counterparties, active contribution to the Asset and Liability
         Management (ALM) risk perspective, and monitoring the activities of the bank’s exchange room. The assets and liabilities
         management unit assesses the bank’s liquidity and interest rate risks to ensure adequate cover of its exposure to banking risks in
         line with recommendations of the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision; and

    •	   The operational risk management unit’s roles include outlining the framework for dealing with operational risks, collection of
         incidences and losses, and calculation of capital requirements.

    The specialist units were established in the risk management department as part of the bank’s quest to provide innovative and
    convenient banking services for the benefit of its stakeholders. This has benefited the bank by minimizing losses, protecting its
    revenues and providing sustainable business through a more thorough and in-depth risk monitoring and reporting process.

Case Study 8: Recommendations by the Monetary Authority of Singapore on corporate governance



     In East Asia, the Monetary Authority of Singapore has the following as part of the corporate governance guidelines for financial institutions:

     Independent directors should make up at least one third of the Board. There is a division of duties between the Chairman and the CEO.
     The Board should have a Nomination Committee that makes recommendations on:

     •	   The review of Board succession plans for directors, in particular, the Chairman, and for the CEO;

     •	   The development of a process for evaluation of the performance of the Board, its Board committees and directors;

     •	   The review of training and professional development programs for the Board; and

     •	   The appointment and re-appointment of directors (including alternate directors, if applicable)

     The Board is responsible for the governance of risk and may establish a separate Board risk committee. The Board should ensure that
     the management maintains a sound system of risk management and internal controls to safeguard shareholders’ interests and the
     bank’s assets, and should determine the nature and extent of the significant risks which the Board is willing to take in achieving its
     strategic objectives. The Board should determine the bank’s levels of risk tolerance and risk policies, and oversee management in the
     design, implementation and monitoring of the risk management and internal control (including financial, operational, compliance
     and information technology control) systems. The bank’s risk management and internal control systems should be reviewed at least
     annually by the Board and a comment included in the bank’s annual report as to whether the CEO or Chief Finance Officer (CFO)
     assured the Board on the effectiveness of the bank’s risk management and internal control systems.The Board should also approve the
     appointment, remuneration, resignation, or dismissal of the CRO. The Board or the Board risk committee should have influence over
     the performance assessment and succession planning of the CRO.

     The Board should establish an Audit Committee comprised of at least three directors with a majority of non-executive directors and
     an independent chairman. Its duties include:

     •	   Reviewing the significant financial reporting issues and judgments so as to ensure the integrity of the financial statements of the
          company and any announcements relating to the company’s financial performance;

     •	   Reviewing and reporting to the Board at least annually the adequacy and effectiveness of the bank’s internal controls, including
          financial, operational, compliance and information technology controls (such review can be carried out internally or with the
          assistance of any competent third parties);

     •	   Reviewing the effectiveness of the bank’s internal audit function;

     •	   Reviewing the scope and results of the external audit, and the independence and objectivity of the external auditors; and

     •	   Making recommendations to the Board on the proposals to the shareholders on the appointment, re-appointment and removal of
          the external auditors, and approving the remuneration and terms of engagement of the external auditors.

     The bank should establish an effective internal audit function that is adequately resourced and independent of the activities it audits.
     The head of the internal audit should report functionally to the Chairman of the Audit Committee and administratively to the CEO.
     The adequacy and effectiveness of the internal audit function should be reviewed, at least annually, by the Audit Committee

     The Board should also establish a Remuneration Committee, comprising at least three non-executive directors and an independent
     chairman. The Committee should review and recommend to the Board the remunerations for the Board and key management personnel
     (the key management personnel include the CEO and other persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing, and
     controlling the activities of the bank). Lastly, the Committee should also seek the Board Risk Committee’s views to ensure that the
     remuneration practices do not create incentives for excessive or inappropriate risk-taking behavior.The remuneration should take account
     of the risk policies of the bank, be symmetric with risk outcomes, and be sensitive to the time horizon of risks. Annually, the bank should also
     name and disclose the remuneration of the directors, CEO, and at least five key management personnel. The disclosure should include the
     fixed salary, incentive pay, benefits in kind, stock options granted, share-based incentives and awards, and other long-term incentives.

Case Study 9: Three lines of defense to support the risk governance structure



   To implement a robust risk management program, one of the interviewed banks has defined a governance structure based on the three lines
   of defense model. The bank has clearly defined roles for the Board, the internal audit and risk management functions, and the business units.

   The Board is charged with risk oversight and determination of the bank’s risk appetite and reviews the risk appetite appropriate to
   the bank’s growth strategy. The Board has delegated its risk oversight responsibilities to committees that include the Board Audit
   Committee (BAC), Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC), Board Credit Committee (BCC), Information and Communication
   Technology (ITC) Committee, and the Assets and Liabilities Committee (ALCO).

   The BAC is responsible for ensuring that the Bank’s financial reporting is transparent by reviewing the effectiveness of the bank’s
   internal financial controls and risk management system, and monitoring the effectiveness of the internal audit function. The BAC also
   ensures the independence of the external audit function by appointing and assessing the performance of the external auditor. It is
   also responsible for ensuring compliance with laws and regulations affecting financial reporting.

   The BRMC is responsible for oversight of the bank’s risk management systems, practices, and procedures to ensure their effectiveness in risk
   identification and management as well as to ensure compliance with the bank’s internal policies and the guidelines laid out by the regulator.

   The ALCO establishes guidelines on the bank’s tolerance for risk and expectation from investment, sets and monitors specific
   financial targets and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), monitors the bank’s capital, and ensures that management implements the
   assets and liability policy of the bank.

   The BCC’s duties include reviewing the bank’s credit portfolio KPIs that include concentrations and provisions, ensuring alignment
   with the bank’s credit strategy and risk appetite, and approving credit terms.

   These committees complement each other. The BAC provides the critical independent quality assurance, the BCC manages credit
   risk, and the ALCO committee manages market risk, the Operational Risk Committee manages operational risk, complianceand legal
   risk, regulatory risk, and reputational risk. In addition to this, the ICT Committee manages IT risks facing the bank and the BRMC
   oversees all the risks managed by all other Board subcommittees as well as external or emerging risks.

   The internal audit function is independent of all other business units and provides assurance of the adequacy and effectiveness of
   the bank’s risk management, control and governance processes. It is headed by the General Manager Internal Audit, who reports
   administratively to the Managing Director and functionally to the Board Audit Committee. To improve the independence of the
   internal audit function, its head has unfettered access to the Chairman of Audit Committee and the Chairman of the Board.

   The risk management function is charged with providing guidance to the business units and independently reporting and monitoring
   the risk management systems. The General Manager, Risk and Compliance Division, in conjunction with the Managing Director, is
   responsible for setting a framework that ensures effective risk management, compliance and control for all risk types across the bank.

   The business units take ownership of the risks with the heads of the business units responsible for identification and management of
   risk in their business units. This is undertaken through regular Risk and Control Self-Assessment exercises.

Case Study 10: Risk management framework


      In one of the banks interviewed, the Board has facilitated the operationalization of the bank’s Risk Management Framework as
      follows. Different Board committees such as the Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC), Board Audit Committee, and the
      Board Credit Committee in co-operation with Management Committees provide the written principles for overall risk management
      policies. They also provide the guidelines for the bank’s risk identification, measurement, monitoring, and reporting. The execution of
      the framework is a function of the bank’s Enterprise Risk Management Group, which identifies, evaluates, and hedges financial risks
      with assistance from the bank’s strategic business units. The bank has also appointed a Chief Risk Officer (CRO) who has a direct
      reporting line to BRMC and a dotted line to the CEO. The establishment of a formal risk management framework has helped the
      bank to ensure that the risks inherent in the bank’s products, processes, activities, and new markets are identified early and the risks
      profiles are regularly reviewed. The bank’s risk management process considers various risks, including credit, operations, liquidity,
      legal, compliance, and strategic risks.

      The identification, assessment, prioritization and mitigation of identified risks are completed through periodic Risk and Control Self-
      Assessment (RCSA) and development of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) to identify and monitor the risks. Workshops are held with all
      stakeholders such as the process owners, the Internal Control Department, Internal Audit, and senior management (through the Risk
      Management Committee) to assess the identified risks, proffer mitigations and then use heat maps based on frequency and impact
      to prioritize these. This process is further supported through:

      •	   Use of approved processes and templates for documenting identified risks;

      •	   Existence of a strategic framework for the assessment of risks associated with new ventures (markets and products);

Case Study 11: Risk management training


     One bank that was interviewed uses an e-learning platform to disseminate required learnings to the Bank’s employees. Courses on
     financial analysis, financial accounting, credit analysis, securities in banking and internal controls are included on this platform.

     Classes are also conducted through a mix of internal and external consultants and courses are a mix of mandatory and optional courses.

     For specialized trainings, some employees are selected for initial training so that they can transfer the knowledge acquired to other
     employees in their departments.

     The above training and capacity building programs provide knowledge to employees, giving them a comprehensive vision of risk
     management within the organization’s different sectors, from the theoretical aspects to implementation as a management tool.

Incentive programs linked to risk performance grew out of companies’                                 the bank’s risk horizon
desires to reduce fixed compensation costs and focus on pay for
performance. They were considered “pay at risk” because, unlike                                  Transparent incentive reporting

guaranteed compensation such as salary and benefits, incentive
payouts depended on the achievement of tangible, predefined                                              Creating awareness
performance goals. Banks generally considered such incentive pay
as a positive means of aligning pay and performance, encouraging
senior management to make the right decisions, and driving the right
results. However, this is thought to have lured some members of senior
management to take significant financial risks to accrue significant
rewards. 49

In a Deloitte Banking Industry Survey50 released in May 2013, bankers
indicated that the main causes of the banking industry’s cultural problems
were misaligned incentives and poor leadership. Employee incentive
programs reinforced failures at the top.

Better risk management and alignment of pay with meaningful, long-
term performance address shortcomings in incentive programs seen as a
contributor to the global financial crises. Banks should scrutinize their
incentive programs to see how they factor in their business strategy, risk
profile, and potential business risks. Incentive programs now advocate
for and encourage ownership of risks by business units and specific
employees. 51

     In an effort to establish a robust and objective remuneration and incentives program, the Board at one of the banks referenced in
     this study has a Board Nomination and Remuneration Committee composed of three independent non-executive directors. The
     committee meets bi-annually and is responsible for:

     •	   Evaluating the performance of the individual Board members and the CEO;

     •	   Setting the remuneration policies and strategic objectives of the Board and the CEO;

     •	   Setting policies on employee incentives such as bonuses; and

Case Study 13: Performance measurement



   To encourage the right risk behavior, one bank has established Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to evaluate and reward the bank’s
   employees for prudent risk decisions. It rewards employees by use of incentives such as bonuses and equity. The bank has a formal
   process for identifying the risks it faces through its integrated risk management practices. The risk management function is involved
   in the design of the incentive program by providing and deciding which key risk indicators should be included in determining KPIs for
   different working staff groups.

   The incentive program features quantitative and qualitative performance rating systems. The quantitative performance rating
   system takes quantitative indicators such as profit and non-performing loan ratios into consideration, while qualitative performance
   rating system features 360° staff performance rating: an employee’s supervisors, peers and staff at junior levels give ratings on an
   employee’s performance.

   Those who contravene the bank’s policies and rules are subject to the sanctions stipulated in the code of conduct which include
   warnings, economic punishment such as fines, and administrative punishment.

   Deferral of incentive payouts is done on a case-by-case and is based on rules and policies formulated by the Remuneration and
   Appraisal Committee.

   The details of the incentive program are included in the bank’s internal policies and rules and are communicated to the employees
   through the bank’s intranet, emails, and print outs.

Case Study 14: Transparency guidelines in India


    There has been considerable effort to improve the incentive programs in the financial services industry since the global crises. The
    Financial Stability Board issued 9 principles of sound compensation practices in 2009 to encourage the right practices across various
    regions and discourage imprudent risk taking as a result of incentive programs in place.

    In 2012, the Reserve Bank of India issued guidelinesa on the compensation of bank employees to be implemented from the financial year
    2012–2013. To encourage transparency in a bank’s incentive programs, the annual report should disclose the following information:

    •	   Composition and mandate of the remuneration committee;

    •	   Design and structures of the remuneration processes and key features and objectives of the remuneration policy;

    •	   The risk management processes of risks facing the remuneration policy;

    •	   How the bank links performance management with its levels of remuneration;

    •	   The bank’s policy on deferral and vesting of variable remuneration and the criteria for adjusting the deferred remuneration before
         and after vesting;

    •	   A description of the different forms of variable remuneration that are used and the rationale for using such;

    •	   Number of meetings held by the remuneration committee during the year and payment to its members;

    •	   Number of employees that have received a variable remuneration award during the financial year;

    •	   Number and total amount of sign-on awards made during the financial year;

    •	   Details of guaranteed bonus, if any, paid as joining / sign-on bonus;

    •	   Details of severance pay, in addition to accrued benefits, if any;

    •	   Total amount of outstanding deferred remuneration, split into cash, shares and share-linked instruments and other forms;

    •	   Total amount of deferred remuneration paid out in the financial year;

    •	   Breakdown of amount of remuneration awards for the financial year to show fixed and variable, deferred and non-deferred
         components;

    •	   Total amount of outstanding deferred remuneration and retained remuneration exposed to ex post explicit and/or implicit
         adjustments; and

    •	   Total amount of reductions during the financial year due to ex- post explicit adjustments.

The bank should ensure that staff members understand
the incentive programs’ mechanics and the reasons for the
program. If employees do not accept the program, it will have
limited or potentially even counterproductive impact on their
motivation and decisions about taking and managing risks.
54       Chapter 4: Incentive Programs in Banks



Case Study 15: Creating awareness of the incentive programs


     In order to create awareness of their incentive program, some banks ensure that human resource procedure manuals and salary
     administration policies are regularly updated and available to all the bank’s employees through the bank’s intranet portal. Supervisors
     are also trained on these policies and procedures so that they can impart such knowledge to the staff in their departments.

     Any feedback obtained through these sessions is channeled to the compensation team that clarifies any doubts and concerns about the
     incentive programs. This ensures there is a process of continuous communication and improvement on the bank’s incentive programs.

markets where many banks may still be in the implementation stage
of ERM frameworks, it is important to incorporate lessons learned in
the developed markets and to integrate the soft qualitative factors that
influence the effectiveness of their risk management programs. Research
continues to show that a weak risk culture, poor risk governance, and
unbalanced incentive compensation contribute heavily to financial
industry failures.

As noted in a recent publication by the Financial Times, financial firms
are increasing their risk appetite as they search for better returns. The
Board and senior management should therefore put more emphasis on
risk culture. The regulators have a role to play in promoting the correct
risk cultures in their jurisdictions. However, regulators may place more
emphasis on the quantitative issues of capital and liquidity, frequently at
the expense of the no less important qualitative matter of risk culture.76

The recommended practices included in this handbook under risk culture,
risk governance, and balanced incentives programs indicate that, due to
the softer qualitative nature of these aspects, the practices to enhance
these principles are interrelated and improvement in one area should be
combined with others to result in a cascading positive effect across the
bank. These include:

   management requires the Board and senior management to take
   ultimate responsibility for the bank’s risk programs. Their role include,

   risk management function, developing and determining the design on
   incentive programs, and facilitating performance evaluation of the
