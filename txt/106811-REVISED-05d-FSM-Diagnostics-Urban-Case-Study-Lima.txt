Executive summary

Introduction
This report summarises the main findings of a case study on faecal sludge management in Lima,
Peru. It is part of the project entitled ‘Fecal Sludge Management: Diagnostics for Service Delivery
in Poor Urban Areas’, funded by the World Bank Water and Sanitation Programme (WSP). There
are five city case studies as part of this project (Balikpapan, Dhaka, Freetown, Lima and Santa
Cruz). The specific objectives of the Lima study were:

        To provide quantitative and qualitative data on the sanitation situation in Lima from a socio-
         economic perspective, specifically as it relates to FSM.

        To do the above in such a way that the data is representative of poor non-sewered areas of
         the city.

        To provide initial recommendations to guide discussions around future interventions in the
         sanitation sector in Lima, by contributing credible data and analysis.

        To inform the development of analytical tools and guidelines for using them, by “road -
         testing” draft tools using primary data collection.


Methodology
The study followed an overall research framework developed as part of the inception period, which
set out research questions and sub-questions. Data collection instruments were then developed so
as to answer these questions. Six data collection instruments were used in Lima, four quantitative
and two qualitative. The quantitative instruments were a household survey, transect walks,
observation of service provider practices, and tests of fecal sludge characteristics. The qualitative
instruments were key informant interviews and focus group discussions.

The lead consultant team led on methodology design and data analysis, while data collection was
undertaken by separately-contracted consultants under the leadership of WSP. All data collection
was undertaken by Akut Peru, with the exception of key informant interviews which were
undertaken by a WSP short-term consultant.

The household survey primarily aimed to collect data from households using on-site sanitation
regarding their current use and preferences for future FSM services. The sampling was carefully
planned so as to allow conclusions to be drawn about non-sewered areas of the city as a whole
and lowest-income non-sewered areas in particular. The transect walks aimed to enable
participants to make a subjective and qualitative assessment of physical and environmental
conditions within a community. The observation protocol for service providers involved making
visual inspections about fecal sludge (FS) from pits or tanks to final disposal. The tests of fecal
sludge characteristics were carried out at three stages: (i) in containment, (ii) during removal, and
(iii) after treatment. The key informant interviews aimed to address key questions about how both
the ‘enabling environment’ and the ‘operating environment’ affects FSM services (past, current and
future). Finally, the focus group discussions aimed to gather qualitative data that complements,
validates, or challenges the conclusions drawn from the household survey data.

Sampling for most quantitative instruments was derived from the sampling for the household
survey, for which there were two sub-samples. For sub-sample A, the Primary Sampling Units
(PSUs) were Unidades Administrativas Locales (UALs), an administrative unit akin to “urban

                                                                                                      ii

neighbourhoods”, which were selected so as to allow estimates which were representative of non-
sewered areas of Lima as a whole. For sub-sample B, the PSUs were lowest-income
neighbourhoods, purposively selected among the 33 low-income and priority areas for SEDAPAL
(i.e. areas that are unlikely to get access to sewerage in the next 4 years). There are 720
households overall, equally divided between the two sub-samples.

The data in the table above paints a picture of almost all fecal sludge ending up in unlined pits, of
which all are usually abandoned after they fill up. It is therefore not surprising that a market for
FSM services does not exist. These key data are reflected in the fecal waste flow diagrams
(FWFDs) in the body of the report. The non-sewered areas FWFD is reproduced below.

Faecal Waste Flow Diagram for Lima – non-sewered areas




Analysis of demand and supply for FSM services finds that there is basically no demand and no
supply for the urban poor in Lima. That is not surprising in the context of the SFD above, and
particularly the household survey finding that only 3% of households in non-sewered areas who
had a toilet with a pit or septic tank have experienced it filling up. Households in non-sewered
areas generally cover and abandon their pit once it fills up, digging a new one nearby. However,
there have been several reports (both in the media and also in the focus group discussions) about
people running out of space in their plots to dig new pits, which may be encouraging the demand
for FSM services. Nonetheless, current prices remain too high and unaffordable for the majority of
households in poor non-sewered areas. On the supply side, there are currently no large-scale FSM
services for poor households, with private service providers mainly serving only public facilities
(e.g. hospitals, schools) or households in wealthy areas of Lima. Given the lack of knowledge
about the potential market for FSM services as well as the lack of ability and / or willingness to pay
of households in poor peri-urban areas, private service providers have had little incentive so far to
offer services in these areas.

Findings from the transect walks show that there are very few instances where blackwater was
visible in irrigation channels. Although open defecation (OD) is not a major problem in Lima, OD
was reported in 10% of the non-sewered areas sampled, mainly practiced by a few children or
elderly people. Fecal sludge was also reported to be dumped alongside solid waste – focus group
discussions revealed that this was primarily carried out by households whose pit had filled up and
were unable to dig a new pit, or by people who use potties (as opposed to a toilet) in the evenings.
The main issue in the majority of locations was the accumulation of solid waste on a daily basis.
Overall, the combination of instances likely introducing risks to public health occurred in a total of
17 locations in non-sewered areas and 3 locations within lowest-income areas.

The City Service Delivery Assessment shows that public policy is deficient, while there is a
severe shortage of capital investment and operational oversight of FSM services throughout Lima.
Although for the city as a whole, the lack of FSM services may not seem to be a priority (given the

                                                                                                    iv

high level of sewerage coverage), there are around 800,000 people in poor areas without a real
and sustainable solution to their daily sanitation needs. Sustainable solutions will only come about
when an FSM Framework translates into clearly defined, capacitated and financed action. This
requires recognition of the scale of the problem, dialogue and engagement of public, private and
civil society bodies to ensure appropriate infrastructure and services can be systematically
developed and adapted to respond to the various contextual challenges of the city. Segmentation
and lack of coordination is already a key constraint in the provision of basic services, so bringing all
key stakeholders together and aiming at reaching a consensus on a course of action, is an
imperative. A clear definition and agreement of the roles of different stakeholders along the
sanitation service chain is also required, with a particular focus on developing adequate
containment and treatment frameworks, and strengthening both emptying and transport
components of the FSM chain.

Finally, a Prognosis for Change shows that the current incentives discourage actions from both
public and private stakeholders. On one hand, responsibilities for FSM at both national and local
levels have not been clearly designated, and thus both planning and financing for FSM are unlikely
to happen if no stakeholder can be held accountable for investments and results. Evidence from
KIIs also suggests that, although there seems to be no political opposition to the development of
FSM services, there is no political will either to carry this forwards. On the other hand, without a
clear demand (current and future) for FSM services, private service providers are unwilling to
develop a market that may be unprofitable. Moreover, households may be reluctant to invest in
upgrading their containment facilities, partly because many regard sewerage as the only long-term
option, but also because the lack of land tenure and ownership generally discourages investment.
Change is achievable, but interventions will not be successful unless they address the incentives
which deliver the current status quo.

1         Introduction and Research Framework

1.1       About this report
This report summarises the findings of a case study on fecal sludge management in Lima, Peru. It
is part of the project entitled ‘Fecal Sludge Management: Diagnostics for Service Delivery in Poor
Urban Areas’, hereafter “the FSM research project”. This work is funded by the World Bank Water
and Sanitation Programme (WSP). There are five city case studies as part of this project
(Balikpapan, Dhaka, Hawassa, Lima and Santa Cruz).

The project is led by Oxford Policy Management (OPM) in partnership with the Water, Engineering
and Development Centre (WEDC) at Loughborough University. The full TOR for the project can be
found here. The overall objective of this assignment is to “work with the WSP urban sanitation
team to develop the methodology, design and survey instruments, undertake analysis of data
collected from five field case studies (linked to World Bank operations projects), refine the
diagnostic tools, and develop decision-making tools and guidelines for the development of
improved FSM services.” Specific objectives of the Lima case study are listed in the next section.

This document is part of a project deliverable designed to be internal at this stage. Therefore, it
does not contain much background information, and the assumed audience is the WSP project
team and other stakeholders familiar with the Lima FSM context. The inception report is available
here for other readers, which contains more background information on the project and the
methodology.

The report’s structure is detailed below. It begins with a background to the research and the city,
moving into several sections analysing the urban sanitation context, which are not specific to FSM.
Thereafter, the report’s focus is on FSM services in particular.


1.2       Study rationale and objectives
It is very common for poor people living in urban areas of most low-income countries to either use
on-site sanitation facilities or defecate in the open. Even when improved on-site options are used
to contain feces, there generally exist few services for collection, transport and disposal or
treatment of the resulting fecal sludge. Fewer opportunities for resource recovery through end-use
of fecal sludge exist. The service delivery gaps within and between stages of the sanitation service
chain become more apparent as sanitation coverage increases in poor urban areas. Failure to
ensure strong links throughout the fecal sludge management (FSM) service chain results in
untreated fecal sludge (FS) contaminating the environment, with serious implications for human
health.

Despite increasing demands for FSM services, there are few tools and guidelines to help city
planners navigate complex FSM situations. This study aims to build on existing frameworks and
tools, in particular the City Service Delivery Assessment (CSDA) scorecard, Fecal Waste Flow
Diagram (FWFD), and the Economics of Sanitation Initiative (ESI) toolkit. The aim is to produce
diagnostic and decision-making tools that are based in tried-and-tested strategic planning
approaches and frameworks, with a focus on practicality. Critically, updates to the tools and
guidelines will be based on primary data collection in five cities. In most of the cities, this is
supported by interaction with city stakeholders involved in ongoing World Bank lending.
Acknowledging the difficulty of reforming FSM services in cities, the political economy questions
around FSM are explicitly included as part of the overall analysis.



                                                                                                   1
Fecal Sludge Management in Lima – Case Study Report


The specific objectives of the study are:

        To provide quantitative and qualitative data on the sanitation situation in Lima from a socio-
         economic perspective, specifically as it relates to FSM;

        To do the above in such a way that the data is representative of the non-sewered areas of
         the city as a whole but also provides a separate picture of the situation in lowest-income
         non-sewered areas;

        To provide initial recommendations to guide discussions around future interventions in the
         sanitation sector in Lima, by contributing credible data and analysis; and

        To inform the development of analytical tools and guidelines, by “road -testing” draft tools
         using primary data collection.

The study was therefore primarily socio-economic rather than technical. It did not aim to carry out
technical inspections of infrastructure or produce detailed maps with neighbourhood-level analysis
and recommendations. For those who have previously worked in the sanitation sector in Lima,
there may be few surprises, but the report does offer representative data to back-up what has
previously been reported in smaller or more general studies.


1.3       Research framework
During the inception stage, the OPM/WEDC team developed a Research Framework (RF), based
on the overarching research questions implicit in the TOR and draft research protocol. From these
questions, a logical set of project components was developed. These became the basis for the
design of data collection instruments that would enable information to be collected for the
indicators making up each component.

The approach is to place all components – as well as ensuing results – of the study within the
context of the FSM service chain, to optimise its relevance and effectiveness. This is clear from the
full version of the RF in the Inception Report, with all components and questions arranged along
the service chain. There is not enough space here to go through the research questions, but the
Research Framework can be downloaded from a link available in Annex F.

The initial structure of components from the Inception Report is reflected in Table 1 below. The
study methodology is described in Annex B.

2         Background to Lima City

2.1       Lima overview
Lima is located in the central Peruvian coast, within the valleys of three main rivers: Rímac, Chillón
and Lurín, which serve as the city’s main drinking-water resources. The city is characterised by a
mild and warm climate, with mean annual temperature ranging between 18.6°C and 19.8°C, and a
high humidity, which fluctuates between 81% and 85%.

In this study, we are considering the whole of Lima Metropolitan Area (hereon after referred to as
Lima), which encompasses the municipalities of Lima and Callao. Lima is the third largest city in
Latin America, with a population of almost 10 million distributed across 49 districts, the majority of
which are entirely urban. Indeed, like other Latin American countries, urbanisation has been one of
the main drivers of population growth, with around 60% of Lima’s citizens coming from other
regions of the country.

However, lack of long-term planning has led to a highly disorganised urbanisation process, with
many ‘human settlements’ in peri-urban areas having limited or inadequate access to basic public
services, i.e. electricity, water and sewerage. For example, while coverage of piped water supply
for households in the highest quintile was 100% in 2013, coverage was only 50% among
households in the lowest quintile. This is compounded by the fact that human settlements are both
formal and informal in nature, which increases the difficulty in the provision of adequate services,
not only due to land titling issues but also to the type of terrain that is inhabited, e.g. some
communities are located in remote arid areas, where building any type of infrastructure is very
expensive. Figure 1 below depicts the usual conditions in many of these low-income peri-urban
settlements.

The main provider of both drinking water and sanitation services is SEDAPAL, which has been in
operation since 1981. SEDAPAL mandates the operation, maintenance, control and development
of water and sanitation services, also undertaking tasks related to planning, programming and
financing, among others. SEDAPAL provides services to both Lima and Callao, as well as to other
districts or areas within the Lima Department that have received approval from the Ministry of
Housing, Construction and Sanitation (MoHCS). Other relevant stakeholders for the provision of
water and sanitation services are presented in Table 3.


                                                                                                     5

2.2       Lima’s sanitation context
According to the 2013 National Household Survey (ENAHO), around 92% of Lima’s population has
access to sewerage (both inside and outside the dwelling). However, only 43% of the population in
the lowest quintile, as compared to 100% in the highest quintile, has access to the sewer network
(Table 2). Indeed, around 800,000 people in peri-urban areas of Lima do not have access to
sewerage. Households in the lowest quintile rely mainly on septic tanks (17%) and unlined pits for
containment (19%), with 12% of them having no sanitation service at all (i.e. open defecation).

Although it would be ideal to have more information on the type of user-interface (i.e. the type of
sanitation facility used), the focus of this study is primarily the management of fecal sludge from
latrines (i.e. the containment stage) and, to an extent, all forms of fecal waste flows, including
sewerage, through to end-use/disposal (see Figure 2 below).

Figure 2          The sanitation service chain




This study is not focusing on the structural conditions or the latrine itself, so much as the extent to
which it contains/does not contain fecal sludge and what happens to the fecal sludge from this
stage onwards. For this reason, the household survey and later sections of this report refer to
different categories for household sanitation facilities and assess fecal sludge management in
relation to the service chain above.


2.3       Lima’s FSM context
Later sections of this report will identify the scale of FSM services and its implications, based on
extensive qualitative and quantitative data collected through this study. Here, the roles legally
assigned to the key actors that currently are and could be involved in FSM are briefly presented,
based on key informant interviews and field experience gathered by the World Bank consultant.
The list is not exhaustive. How this plays out in reality is covered in Section 8.

  For Lima, there is an overlap in the data between the type of sanitation facility and the type of blackwater
containment/disposal for all major national and international surveys (e.g. ENAHO, DHS). It is thus not possible to
accurately classify sanitation facilities.

                                                                                                                 6

3         Fecal Waste Flow Diagrams

3.1       Introduction
Fecal Waste Flow Diagrams (also known as ‘shit flow’ dia grams or SFDs) are an innovation arising
from WSP’s 12-city study of FSM (Peal & Evans, 2013). In short, an SFD is a visualisation of how
fecal waste (fecal sludge or wastewater) flows along the sanitation service chain. At each stage of
the chain, the proportion of fecal waste that is or is not effectively managed to the next stage of the
chain is indicated.2

This means that where fecal waste is deemed to be:

        Effectively managed from one stage of the chain to the next (for example, where
         wastewater from cistern flush toilets is effectively transported through sewers to a
         designated treatment site, or fecal sludge is transported by a tanker to a designated
         disposal site), the SFD shows the flow of fecal waste continuing along the chain – and the
         arrow representing that flow of fecal waste to the next stage remains green;

        Not effectively managed from one stage of the chain to the next (for example, where
         wastewater leaks from sewers before reaching a designated treatment site, or fecal sludge
         is dumped into the environment or drainage channels), then the SFD shows the fecal waste
         “dropping out” of the service chain – and the arrow representing that flow of fecal waste
         turns brown.

The proportion of fecal waste that is effectively managed all the way to the end of the service chain
is indicated as “safely managed”, with the remaining proportion that has dropped -out of the chain
deemed “unsafely managed”. The primary destination of that “unsafe” fecal waste is indicated (e.g.
receiving waters, general environment, drains, etc.).3 Thus far, SFDs in different cities have been
undertaken using different methodologies, as is often necessary in the context of poor data
availability. Furthermore, most SFDs so far (including those in the 12-city study) were undertaken
using secondary data and expert estimates. This study is amongst the first to use primary
household survey data and field-based observations to construct SFDs. A group of urban
sanitation experts is currently discussing the ‘roll-out’ of the use of SFDs, for which other
methodologies will be developed.4

For this study, SFDs are being developed which are indicative of (i) the city-wide situation, and (ii)
the situation in low-income settlements (see Annex B for more information). For Lima, the former is
based on secondary data, whereas the latter is based on primary data collection in non-sewered
settlements (which are generally low-income areas), as part of sub-sample A.




2
  Previous iterations of SFDs distinguished between safe and unsafe practices, but here we refer to effective / ineffective
management. This progression has been made because it is difficult be sure of the safety of the process, but if the fecal
waste is managed to the next stage of the sanitation service chain, we can say it is considered an effective process.
3
  It is acknowledged that fecal sludge may pass from irrigation channels into other water bodies, e.g. rivers, but the
diagram focuses on the primary destination. It was beyond the scope of this study to be able to track the pathways of
sludge beyond the household, e.g. which canals did it pass through and where was its eventual destination.

3.2         Methodology
As noted above, the city-wide SFD is based on secondary data, because neither sub-sample in the
household survey was representative of Lima as a whole.5 Secondary data used includes other
household surveys (e.g. ENAHO 2013 for the type of sanitation system used) and utility records
(i.e. SEDAPAL’s data related to the proportion of wastewater which is transported and treated).

For the SFD in non-sewered areas, data from the household survey questions was used.6

    A. What kind of toilet facility do members of your household usually use?

    B. Where do the contents of this toilet empty to?

Of these, question ‘B’ is the m ost crucial for the SFD. The household’s response is taken as given,
as it was not possible to confirm responses by observation. Enumerators could however observe
‘above-ground’ components (i.e. slab, water seal, superstructure, etc.), and this was carried out in
all households where permission was granted.7

To analyse this data, an SFD matrix was created – a blank matrix is shown in Figure 3 below. It
shows which data sources are used and how they are analysed into categories of effective and
ineffective management of fecal waste through the stages of the service chain. Results for Lima
are shown in the next section.

Firstly, household survey data on use of infrastructure (questions A and B above) is used to
allocate households to five categories shown in the column marked (1) in the figure below:

    (i)      Sewered (off-site centralised or decentralised): toilets connected to sewers (not on-
             site sanitation).
    (ii)     On-site storage – emptiable: on-site sanitation (on-site sanitation) toilets (involving
             pits or septic tanks) that can be emptied. However, they can also be connected to
             drains through an overflow, to avoid the need for emptying. These toilets are emptiable
             but may or may not be emptied.
    (iii)    On-site storage – single-use / pit covered: on-site sanitation toilets where pits or
             tanks are covered and / or abandoned once full. These toilets are emptiable but never
             emptied.
    (iv)     On-site non-storage – straight to drain / similar: on-site sanitation toilets which
             connect directly to drains, water bodies or open ground. These toilets are therefore non-
             emptiable.
    (v)      Open defecation (OD): self-explanatory.

The question of emptiability is key. Category (ii) above is denoted as emptiable, meaning that this
containment option involves a pit or tank which fills with fecal sludge. Between the two extremes of
a closed system and a system which never fills up, there is a spectrum of scenarios. For example,
some pits / tanks may have an overflow to the drain but may still require emptying if they become

5
   In other cities in this five-city study, sub-sample A was designed to be representative of the whole city. However, given
the very high sewerage coverage in Lima, sub-sample A is largely representative of non-sewered areas of the city. For
more information on sampling, please refer to Annex B.
6
   Full response categories for these questions are included in the survey questionnaire, to which there is a web link in
Annex F. In particular, the response categories to question B above were: (i) Piped sewer system, (ii) Lined septic tank,
(iii) Unlined pit (single or twin), (iv) directly to open drain, (v) directly to sea, lake or river, (vi) open ground/street
7
   Given that ‘B’ is based on household response, possible sources of bias include the household not knowing the true
answer or knowing it but answering differently for fear of being identified as practicing illegal behaviour. The former is
certainly likely, the latter does not seem to be an issue given that households willingly disclosed illegal behaviour where
applicable.

                                                                                                                          9

blocked. These categories were designed to be applicable around the world. As it happens, the
vast majority of households in Lima fall into category (i), as there is 92% sewerage. In non-
sewered areas, most households fall into category (iii).

Data from questions A and B at the beginning of this section are allocated in column (2) below (a
key shows the meaning of the colour-coding of cells by data source). Next, the proportions for each
of the stages of the chain are allocated. As can be seen from the emptying column, marked (3), a
certain proportion of the population’s fecal sludge which is collected is emptied by a service
provider, with the remaining fecal sludge not emptied (e.g. overflows to drains).

The rest of the matrix follows a similar logic. Full SFD matrices for the Lima Metropolitan Area (city-
wide) and non-sewered areas (sub-sample A) are presented in Annex C, along with further
methodological notes. This section has given a brief overview of where the data underlying the
SFDs comes from. The SFDs themselves are more intuitively appealing and are presented in the
next section.

As the data comes from household surveys (i.e. the Peru National Household Survey – ENAHO –
and this study’s household survey), the proportions in the matrix are proportions of households, not
proportions of people or fecal sludge volumes.8

  The impression given by the SFD therefore involves assumptions that (i) each person produces the same amount of
FS, and (ii) pit accumulation rates are constant across the city. This is an approximation but the most pragmatic
approach in the context of uncertainty around fecal sludge volumes. Fecal sludge volume only really becomes an issue
when considering the extent of change in service levels needed to deal with the amounts. This study is primarily about
identifying the broader picture of where the management of fecal sludge is or is not effective, not what volumes are being
managed or mismanaged.

3.3       Results
Firstly, the secondary data and household survey results, which are inputs to the SFD, are shown
in the tables below. They are reported separately for Lima Metropolitan Area and non-sewered
areas (sub-sample A). After that, a separate SFD matrix and diagram for each area are presented.

3.3.1     Household survey results as an input to the SFD

In most countries, national household surveys usually collect data on the toilet type (e.g. cistern
flush, pour / manual flush, pit latrine, hanging toilet, etc.). However, in Peru only the type of
blackwater disposal is inquired about in Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and other similar
surveys. Therefore, it is not possible to know what type of toilets are most prevalent in Lima from
secondary data, though anecdotally it is mostly cistern flush or pour flush, with a raised seat in all
cases.

For non-sewered areas however, primary data (sub-sample A) is available. Although data is also
available for sub-sample B, the situation is fairly similar to that of non-sewered areas –
conceptually, it is best to think of sub-sample B as a subset of sub-sample A, i.e. all the lowest-
income neighbourhoods are in non-sewered areas. Since sub-sample A is more representative of
the situation in non-sewered areas as compared to sub-sample B, we have decided to use data
from the former to populate the SFD.

As can be seen in Table 4 below, the majority of households in non-sewered areas (57%) used
pour/manual flush toilets Pit latrines without a slab and cistern flush were the next popular, at 16%,
followed by pit latrines with slab (8%) and urine diversion toilets (1%).

The table above shows the basic categories, but it is also important to consider the proportion of
these which are shared. This is relevant, not just in terms of developing the standardised indicators
of the WHO/UNICEF JMP, but also because the FSM arrangements for shared latrines are likely to
be different from those of ‘private’ latrines from a management perspective. This is because
accountability for dealing with full or blocked pits, as well as payment for FSM services, may be
less clear-cut in a ‘shared’ situation, recognising that this label could refer to a large number of
scenarios. The technology and service used would be as for private facilities, while noting that
shared pits/tanks would be likely to fill more quickly, depending on the number of users.

As can be seen from Table 5 below, 76% of households in non-sewered areas used a facility
considered improved under JMP definitions (see footnotes below). However, this value should be
read with some caution as, even if the facility is classified as improved by standard definitions, its
quality and maintenance may not always be adequate. Figure 4 shows some of the typical facilities

                                                                                                    12

and superstructures that are observed in non-sewered peri-urban areas of Lima – superstructures
tend to be made of non-durable materials that can easily collapse while the facility itself may be
partially broken and unclean. The type of soil and landscape is also a concern in Lima, with
households in rocky and hilly areas (as shown below in Puente Piedra) being more likely to have
poorly constructed facilities.

Sharing was not that common, with only 11% of households sharing an improved or unimproved
latrine. Data on sharing was not available for Lima city-wide.9

As noted above, the most important question in the survey is where the contents of toilets go after
flushing or similar. The standard DHS question incorporates this into the overall sanitation question
(see WHO/UNICEF core questions available at www.wssinfo.org). However, for this study, it was
necessary to ask a separate question in order to get better quality data. 12 Household-reported data
is relied upon for this indicator, while noting that households may not always know the full detail,
especially if they are renting, or may answer untruthfully. Furthermore, with a socio-economic
survey rather than a technical survey, it was not always possible to physically verify household’s
answers to this question. Nonetheless, a large proportion of the enumerator training was spent
ensuring that the enumerators fully understood the distinction between the response categories. In
the event, most interviewed households in non-sewered areas of Lima fall into one category.

9
  ENAHO does collect data on this question but it is not readily available.
10
   The JMP definition of a shared facility is one which is used by 2 or more households (including a public facility).
11
   “Unimproved shared” is not a category usually reported by the JMP, but it is useful to report for our purposes so we
can see the full proportion of households sharing latrines.
12
   As stated above, the question asked was “Where do the contents of this toilet empty to?” The question is answered by

Fecal Sludge Management in Lima – Case Study Report


For completeness and consistency with other case study reports, it is important to explain that
results were grouped into risk categories based on the relative risk to public health from a
combination of the type of containment arrangement and where the fecal sludge and effluent
empty to:

        Low-risk categories are those where the fecal sludge can be considered to be contained
         (in JMP terms), at least in relation to the first stage of the service chain.

        High-risk categories are those where the fecal sludge goes directly into the environment
         and so potentially poses a risk of exposure to the public, whether via drainage systems or
         water bodies with which people interact (especially children).

        Medium-risk categories are those where there is at least some containment in a pit or
         septic tank, but those pits/tanks either: (a) have outlets connected to drains that allow only
         partially digested effluent to flow through, or (b) are unlined, allowing fecal sludge to leach
         into the surrounding soil and groundwater that may be used for domestic purposes (e.g.
         washing clothes). These scenarios still represent a risk, but it is somewhat lower than
         contact with fresh fecal sludge as in the high-risk category above.

The results are shown in Table 6 below. Only 3% of non-sewered households have high-risk
blackwater management practices, all of which goes “directly to drain”. The most common category
was medium-risk (96%), with all these being unlined pits. Comparison to the city-wide situation can
be done with reference to Table 2, noting that 92% of Lima’s population are connected to a sewer
and only 2% have high-risk blackwater management practices (connected to river or open
defecation).

Cutting the data another way, it is important to note that only 7% of households city-wide use what
is considered as an on-site sanitation system, whereas 100% of households in lowest-income
areas do so. However, in practice, the majority of these on-site systems consist of lined / unlined
pits which are covered when full and abandoned. This covering of the raw fecal sludge is usually
done with lime and soil (and in some instances with wood and cement), and cannot generally be
considered effective management.

With 7% of households using on-site sanitation city-wide, the majority of which belong to low
income wealth quintiles and thus have a low ability to pay, it is not hard to see why there is such a
limited market for FSM services. However, in order to assess the potential demand, households
were asked whether both their previous and current pit / tank ever filled up. For pits that were
previously in use, 77% of responding households in non-sewered areas (n = 155) noted that the pit


                                                                                                      14
Fecal Sludge Management in Lima – Case Study Report


had filled up. With regards to pits / tanks currently in use, only 3% households in non-sewered
areas reported the pit ever filling up (n = 342).
Finally, it is worth considering the reported household behaviour in the context of pits filling up.
This was assessed by asking about the action taken by the household when their pit last filled up.
As can be seen in Table 7, the majority of households either left the pit unsealed or sealed and
abandoned it, which is consistent with the common practice of digging a new pit every time the one
in use fills up. However, when referring to the last time the current pit/tank filled up, 90%
households in non-sewered areas responded that the tank had been emptied (n = 10). This may
be related to the lack of space for building a new pit, and suggests there is some scope for future
FSM services, although there are too few observations to draw accurate conclusions.

3.3.2     Presentation of SFDs

Using all these results, two sets of SFD matrices and diagrams were constructed: one giving a city-
wide picture based on secondary data and one based on sub-sample A of the household survey.
These are presented as ¡Error! No se encuentra el origen de la referencia. and ¡Error! No se
encuentra el origen de la referencia. below. SFDs work on the same principle as the matrix
shown above. Household’s toilet technology and associated containment method is shown on the
left, with intermediate steps and primary destination of the fecal sludge shown along the sanitation
service chain.

What is clear from the city-wide SFD is that almost half (48%) of fecal sludge in Lima is not
effectively managed. While 92% of households have a sewer connection, 27% of wastewater is
released directly into the sea without treatment. Furthermore, around 73% of the wastewater which
makes it to the treatment plant is effectively treated. These weaknesses in the sewerage system
are the main reason for the city-wide SFD looking as it does. The proportion of households that
practice open defecation or use toilets that empty straight to drains is very small, jointly
encompassing 1.4% of households. The only remaining point of note is that septic tanks are
assumed to be adequately managed while unlined pits (except when emptied) are considered to
be ineffectively managed. Overall, around 7% of households in Lima use an on-site sanitation
system, 3% of which are deemed to be effectively managed (i.e. septic tanks).




                                                                                                  15
Fecal Sludge Management in Lima – Case Study Report

Considering next the SFD for the non-sewered sample (¡Error! No se encuentra el origen de la
referencia.), the picture is completely different because there are no sewers in these areas. The
vast majority of households (96%) have an unlined pit, of which around 3% were deemed to
adequately contain FS (i.e. households reported the pit filling up). The remaining 93% of unlined
pits are deemed to be ineffectively managed, with FS leaching into the surrounding environment.
Households further reported that 90% of pits that fill up are emptied, for which only 44% of FS
seems to be transported (i.e. FS is discharged into a tanker truck). However, given that there are
no treatment plants specifically designed for the reception of FS, none of the FS emptied and
transported is likely to be given adequate treatment. A further 3% of households have toilets which
discharge straight to drains, and finally 1% have a septic tank or a urine-diverting dry toilet (UDDT),
in which fecal sludge is safely contained and, for UDDTs, emptied, transported and treated by
NGOs. Overall then, only 1% of fecal sludge in non-sewered areas in Lima is effectively managed.

3.4       Implications of the SFDs for FSM in Lima
The city-wide SFD shows that the city is doing relatively well at extending sewerage coverage, but
the capacity for treatment needs to be improved. By the end of 2016, both La Chira and La
Taboada wastewater treatment plants will be fully operational, increasing the capacity of treatment
to almost 100%. The great majority of households that do not have access to sewerage rely on on-
site sanitation facilities that discharge to an unlined pit (96%). Only 3% of these households empty
their pits while the remaining ones generally cover and abandon their pits when full. These
abandoned unlined pits are a public health hazard, as FS leaches into the surrounding
environment, potentially contaminating nearby water sources. Some reports and media headlines
also suggest that people in poor areas are running out of space to dig new pits, while many of the
covered pits collapse.

Having large amounts of fecal sludge in the environment, via unlined pits, is a hazard which
primarily affects people in poorer areas but the discharge of untreated wastewater represents a
broader externality affecting everyone. Both the SFDs are necessarily vague about the destination
of the untreated fecal sludge (i.e. “local area and beyond”). Lima has a very dry climate and much
of the fecal sludge may not contaminate the groundwater easily, but this is still possible.

Further implications of the SFDs above for FSM in Lima are discussed in Section 9 of this report,
which focuses on implementation options. In short, however, it is clear that the key challenges in
Lima are: (i) improving wastewater treatment capacity; (ii) developing and extending FSM services
to non-sewered areas where people are currently abandoning full pits in a potentially unsafe
manner – adequate containment and facility maintenance needs to be encouraged, and FS reuse
needs to be developed to increase the profitability of FSM markets; and (iii) progressively
extending alternative services, including forms of sewerage coverage to 100% (e.g. condominial
sewerage) or UDDTs with centralised emptying and treatment.

4            Public health risk assessment

4.1          Introduction and methodology
A component of the diagnostic study is to assess the extent of public health risk resulting from poor
FSM services within Lima, representing risks for non-sewered areas. The study also seeks to
identify the approximate level and location along the sanitation service chain of adverse public
health risks.

Methods adopted within the data collection instruments to do this include:

          Identifying types of household facility and emptying services used (supported by direct
           observation of the cleanliness and functionality of the facility), during the household survey;

          Observing emptying service providers to identify how their practices may introduce risk to
           the household specifically (containment and emptying stages) and to the wider public at
           large (emptying, transport and disposal stages);

          Scoring hazards and vulnerability factors observed during transect walks (see explanation
           below), along with information about local practices that could result in fecal contamination
           in the environment (see Annex E for information on the scoring system used);

          Measuring fecal contamination levels in local drains and water supplies, to identify potential
           levels of exposure to risks; and

          Asking for perceptions of risk related to emptying services, during focus group discussions.

Collating and analysing results from the data collection instruments provides information about
sources of risk through the service chain. This includes: how clean and operational toilets are kept
within the household; how effectively and safely service providers empty, transport and dispose of
fecal sludge; and the extent to which infrastructure provides effective handling of fecal sludge and
wastewater through the city.

Given the limited extent of data collected for this part of the study, it can only provide a general
indication of risk level at positions along the service chain. The study is not intended to report on
specific locations or flow paths of fecal sludge movement within the sampled UALs.13

For more information about sanitation-related diseases and the significance of safe management
of fecal sludge to protect environmental and public health, see Cairncross & Feachem (1993,
pp.11-25), and Strande et al (2014, pp.1-4).


4.2          Results: risks through stages of the FSM service chain

4.2.1        Containment: household facilities, levels of sharing and practices

From the survey, reported levels of sharing of facilities shows that 8% of households in non-
sewered areas use an improved shared latrine and 3% use an unimproved shared latrine (see
Table 5). For shared latrines in non-sewered areas, 73% of households report sharing the latrine
with up to 5 people, and 26% share with up to 10 people. Around 1% of households reported
sharing the latrine with 11 people or more. Ownership of private household toilets is high in non-

Fecal Sludge Management in Lima – Case Study Report


sewered areas, with 89% of households reporting owning a private latrine (on plot) – either an
improved (76%) or unimproved (14%) facility.

Standards of cleanliness for household facilities, observed during the household survey, indicate
that in non-sewered areas, 68% of observed latrines were found to have a cleanable slab and 53%
had no fecal or urine contamination on the floor or slab (20% had either feces, or feces plus urine,
visible).

Practices around the disposal of child faeces also introduce risks to both households and
potentially the wider public. In non-sewered areas, 75% of households who reported their practices
(n=109) identified unsafe methods when disposing of feces of children under 5 years old (72%
throwing the feces out with solid waste, while the remaining households either buried or burned the
feces). In addition, 55% of households reported storing solid waste within the household before
collection and 24% reported throwing solid waste out into the street. All of these practices have
serious implications for contamination of the immediate household and neighbourhood
environment, as shown in Figure 7.

Self-reported diarrhoea prevalence stated by the respondent (person answering the questions)
during the household survey are shown in Table 8 below. Prevalence is relatively low, with 9% of
households reporting having at least one diarrhoea episode in the past 2 weeks.

Focussing exclusively on children under 5, household survey data suggests that 18% of all children
under 5 in non-sewered areas (n = 190). This is significantly higher than the prevalence reported in
the 2013 ENDES (or DHS) for Lima, with 7% of children under 5 having an episode of diarrhoea.
This suggests that households in non-sewered areas of the city have a greater risk of diarrhoeal

                                                                                                  19
Fecal Sludge Management in Lima – Case Study Report


disease as compared to the city overall, which is likely to be linked to poor access to water and
sanitation services. Indeed, at a national level, 2013 ENDES estimates indicate that the prevalence
of diarrhoea among children under 5 was higher among those who used an unimproved water
source (14%) as compared to those who used an improved water source (11%). Similarly, the
prevalence of diarrhoea was higher for children with an unimproved shared toilet (12%) as
compared to children with an improved and private facility (10%).

Diarrhoea prevalence is only one indicator of a contaminated environment. It is increasingly
understood that nutrition outcomes, especially stunting (height-for-age) are strongly linked to
sanitation through multiple transmission pathways, although stunting has numerous determinants,
including living in contaminated environments.

Wider risks to public health, beyond risks to families and individuals from poorly-managed
containment facilities and practices, as is the use of unlined pits that are poorly covered and
abandoned, arise from poor access to fecal waste management during discharge, emptying,
transport and disposal practices.

4.2.2        Emptying: household practices around emptying services

As seen in the results from the household survey in non-sewered areas, the majority of households
rely on using some form of simple latrine discharging to an unlined pit (96%) that is covered and
abandoned when full (93%) and in very few cases, emptied (3%). Others have latrines discharging
directly to an open drain, ditch or ground (3%), while the remaining 1% have a septic tank or an
UDDT facility. In 16% of cases, greywater is also discharged into the unlined pits, but the majority
of greywater is discharged directly to the open (69%) and only 3% to a soakaway.

What is clear is that very few households in non-sewered areas make use of emptying service
providers, as people traditionally cover and abandon the pit when it becomes full and dig a new
one. This is borne-out by the reported average age of pits in non-sewered areas being less than 4
years old (median is 3 years old, n = 358 households).14

4.2.3        Emptying, transport and disposal: observed practices and risks

Planned observations were carried out at six latrines. Of these, three latrines (two pits and one
septic tank) were emptied using mechanised tankers, while two were UDDTs relying on manual
removal of dried feces from a vault or a mobile container and urine separately handled. The other
was an abandoned pit latrine. The use of urine diversion latrines (permanent and mobile) is
currently at a small scale in Lima – but of growing interest as a service option in the non-sewered
areas.

Using a structured observation format, likely sources of immediate risk from exposure to fecal
sludge at each step of the process were identified for the containment, emptying, transport,
disposal, treatment, and end-use stages. Transportation, treatment and end-use of fecal material is
only practiced on a very small scale in non-sewered areas of Lima; in this instance, for the urine
diversion latrines with urine diversion and potential for re-use of dried feces.

Risk levels were taken to be based on exposure as follows:

          At containment stage, to the family members / households who use the facility;



14
     Similarly, for the overall non-sewered sample, less than 3% of households reported their pit / tank ever filling up.

                                                                                                                            20
Fecal Sludge Management in Lima – Case Study Report


        At emptying stage, to those in the compound (site) where the facility is located, plus the
         neighbourhood along the emptying route from the compound to transport / disposal point,
         and

        At transport, treatment and disposal stages, affecting a wider geographical area and
         population.

Based on the scoring system developed for the structured observation, exposure to risk were
recorded using high / medium / low categories. A summary of the results is shown in Annex E,
while the following sections discuss the broader findings and their implications. It should be kept in
mind that, as the immediate risk was being noted down at each stage in the process, the risk level
can vary between stages, depending on the actions taken.

Containment and emptying: mechanical

Containment facilities where mechanical emptying was observed (three cases) were considered to
introduce low risk to two of the households, while in one case the pit latrine was full and at risk of
overflowing, with evidence of flies or insects inside the superstructure, which increased the overall
risk to the household to a medium level.

The emptying procedure in each case was observed to pose low risk to the household, as the
removal and transfer of fecal sludge was contained in the pipework running directly from the pit /
tank to the tanker, with only small amounts of fecal sludge becoming exposed close to the
emptying point.

Containment and emptying: manual

In the instances of manual emptying, the content was separated from urine and washing water in
UD latrines. Different types of solid waste were found in the abandoned pit, while the contents of
the urine-diversion latrines contained no solid waste.

The containment facilities themselves were found to pose low risk to households, based either on
the abandoned nature of the pit, or on the way in which feces is stored in closed containers. For
one UD latrine, the use of twin vaults allows the feces to be stored in one vault for a year before
removal, making it safe to handle. For the other UD latrine, feces are stored in a portable bucket
fitted with a lid, which is removed on a weekly basis (see Figure 8 below). Careful handling of the
content of the UD bucket results in a low risk during the emptying stage, with a low risk level also
identified for emptying the dried feces after a year of storage.

The mechanical emptying tankers take the fecal sludge to Huaycoloro landfill site. The observed
process did not introduce any risks to the environment or population along the route and the fecal
sludge was considered to be “taken to a secure site”, although the landfill site itself was not
observed during the process.

Transport and disposal: manual

The content in the abandoned latrine was considered to introduce medium risk in terms of long-
term disposal arrangement, as people, animals or insects could come into contact with the
abandoned FS. In the majority of cases, when pits are abandoned, the pit is sealed (i.e. filled up
with soil and lime on top of the fecal sludge content before being abandoned). However, some
cases of land subsidence or pits being poorly covered were reported in FGDs.

For the UD latrines, the twin-vault facility with feces correctly stored before removal was
considered to introduce low or no risk during the final stages of disposal / reuse on site (no
transport necessary). The mobile facility was considered to introduce low risk during transport –
using the sealed bucket – or during the treatment process (in sealed bags), but the disposal and
reuse arrangements were considered to introduce medium risk due to the process exposing only
partially-treated feces back into the environment as it is mixed with sawdust and bacteria for the
final processing stages. These risks should be confined to the processing plant (in Villa El
Salvador) and can therefore be better managed through correct operating procedures. The
partially-processed product (fecal material plus additives) needs further storage before being sold
on to a final destination.

4.3       Results: risks from wider environmental contamination
The 40 transect walks (30 conducted in non-sewered areas and 10 in lowest-income non-sewered
areas) highlighted that in a few instances (6 locations in non-sewered areas and 2 in lowest-
income non-sewered areas), blackwater was visible in the local environment in irrigation channels.
Where this occurred, it was reported as being a daily occurrence, although little information is
available about the source of the blackwater.

Open defecation and dumped fecal sludge

Open defecation, while not a significant problem in Lima, was reported to be observed in 4 non-
sewered UALs. Consultation with community members identified open defecation as practiced in 3
locations: either by “a few” mainly children, or elderly people and children most of the time, or by
“many” people from households without latrines on a daily basis. In a further 3 locations, a few
unspecified people were suspected to be practicing open defecation, but with no further details
provided.

Other unsafe practices were reported during community consultations as:

        fecal sludge dumped by dwellings or the roadside on a monthly basis, in 1 location, which
         may come from the use of potties in the evening or among children and the elderly;

        Uncontrolled latrine emptying near to roads and paths every couple of months, in 1
         location;

        Overflowing latrines occurring in 4 locations, either on an uncommon basis (3 locations in
         non-sewered areas and 1 location in lowest-income areas) or most of the time (1 location).

The combination of instances likely introducing risks to public health occurred in a total of 17
locations in non-sewered areas and 3 locations within lowest-income non-sewered areas.

Water supply and irrigation channels

Tests were carried out to identify levels of fecal contamination of samples of drinking water
supplies and water in drainage/irrigation channels in 10 non-sewered UALs and 7 lowest-income
non-sewered areas. The level of E. coli in the drinking water measured above 3 FCU/100ml in 3 of
the 10 non-sewered area samples and 2 of the 7 samples in lowest-income non-sewered areas.
Samples from drains/irrigation channels were shown to have levels of up to 100 FCU/100ml in 5 of
the 10 non-sewered UALs and 4 of the 7 samples in lowest-income non-sewered areas. In
addition, 2 of the non-sewered samples were found to have over 1,000 FCU/100 ml.

In all locations with fecal contamination of drinking water sources, solid waste contamination of the
environment was recorded as being problematic (scoring 3 or above during the transect walk
observations). Contamination of water supplies was not found to correlate with locations where
blackwater was observed flowing in the drains/irrigation channels. In only one of the non-sewered
locations and 2 of the lowest-income non-sewered areas, contamination of water supplies was
found where community members were reported to discharge latrine contents into open water
bodies (ponds, rivers, streams or irrigation channels) on a daily basis.

Evidence thus suggests no direct link between behaviours and practices around the disposal of
fecal waste and resulting contamination of water supplies and water bodies, but rather a stronger
association between the mismanagement of fecally-contaminated solid waste and resulting
contamination.

                                                                                                   23

Health and environmental risks

In 6 non-sewered locations, a diarrhoeal outbreak was identified by community members as having
occurred in the last year. Of these 6 locations, 5 took place where either blackwater was observed
in drains (2 instances), where household latrines were reported to be overflowing (2 instances), or
where a few suspected people were considered to be practicing open defecation. In all 6 locations,
solid waste was observed to be accumulating in a number of locations on a daily basis (scoring 4
in the risk matrix) and the coverage of household latrines was considered to be between 25-75%,
with over 50% well maintained (3 locations) or 50% poorly maintained (3 locations).


4.4       Implications: assessing the public health risk from poor FSM
Risk to public health, as a result of poor FSM services, comes when there is human exposure (i.e.
some form of contact) to the hazard (i.e. feces that contains pathogens), through an event (such as
walking barefoot over fresh feces, playing in drains that carry discharges from latrines, drinking
water or via hands contaminated with feces). The study has identified that some areas of Lima are
prone to fecal contamination, resulting from (i) children’s feces being thrown out with solid waste
that is a common sight in the locations studied; (ii) latrine effluent connecting into irrigation
channels that run through the localities; and (iii) a few instances of reported open defecation or
latrines being emptied in an uncontrolled manner, resulting in fecal sludge being dumped by the
roadside. In some areas of Lima, exposure to fecal sludge may be more direct and hazardous than
others – where fresh fecal matter gets into living areas. In other situations, the cause and level of
exposure may be more difficult to measure, such as the extent to which contamination in water
supplies is a result of poor FSM.

The problem of exposed fecal contamination is perhaps not that widespread in non-sewered areas
overall, given the extremely limited levels of latrine emptying that takes place. What is undoubtedly
occurring is contamination of the soil, and possibly groundwater sources, due to leaching from
unlined pit latrines. Further investigation into the public health risks and implications of this are
needed, before any conclusions can be drawn.

Further analysis is therefore needed if results of where, how and to what level risk is occurring are
to be clearly identified. In collaboration with the Centre for Global Safe Water at the Rollins School
of Public Health, Emory University, we hope that results from Lima can be analysed using an
adapted version of the SaniPATH tool.15

At this stage, the study is not able to present an analysis of public health risk from poor FSM
services in Lima. However, the collaboration with Emory University is informing ongoing
development of a SaniPATH tool for FSM services by identifying minimum data requirements to
conduct a credible public health risk assessment, the need for preliminary assessment of the main
pathways of risk, and the reporting requirements for target audiences, such as municipal managers
or World Bank staff. Further collaboration will work towards developing a more effective tool that
addresses an appropriate level of data collection and analysis, with improved visual presentation of
the results.

5         FSM services: potential demand and supply management

5.1       Introduction
In economic theory, markets for goods and services operate on the basis of demand and supply.
This chapter provides a brief assessment of demand and supply for FSM services in Lima. At this
stage, it is important to note the difference between potential (or notional) demand and effective
demand. The potential demand for FSM services is the quantity (and type) of services which would
be demanded in the absence of any market failures or distortions. This is different from effective
demand, which is the quantity (and type) of services actually purchased in the context of current
supply and prices.

A simple way of illustrating this is to note that 7% of households city-wide use on-site sanitation
(i.e. potential demand), of which only 3% report experiencing a pit or tank filling up, suggesting a
very low effective demand (around 0.2% of Lima’s population).16,17 Reasons for a gap between
potential demand and effective demand in Lima include, among others: (i) common practice among
poor households to dig a new pit after the one in use fills up; (ii) lack of knowledge about the
existence and safety of FSM emptying services; (iii) service providers not being able to physically
access households, which affects the type of services demanded, and (iii) market prices for
services being higher than consumers’ willingness and/or ability to pay. 18

There can be different definitions of potential demand in the context of FSM, with varying layers of
complexity. The simplest definition is as per the above, i.e. services that would be demanded if all
households using on-site sanitation requested emptying services and were willing and able to pay.
Qualifications could be added for different scenarios, for example given (i) emptying of pits/tanks
every 10 years on average, (ii) regularly desludging once a year, (iii) 30% of households are
unable to pay the market price and a further 20% are unwilling, and so on. For this study, we have
kept things simple.

Both FGDs and KIIs reveal that there are basically no formal FSM services provided to poor urban
households – FSM services are only available for public establishments (schools, universities,
social clubs, etc.), which are out of the scope of this study, and for wealthier households who own
private residences near the beach. There are a few households in non-sewered areas that were
reported to have used emptying services, but this is very rare and generally unaffordable. Thus, a
detailed study of the supply side of FSM services was not possible. However, information provided
through FGDs in non-sewered areas is referenced where appropriate.

This section will argue that the main problem in Lima is on the demand side. No FSM services are
demanded partly because people are unaware of the existence of these services, but also because
the most common practice is to dig a new pit once the one in use fills up. FSM services are
exclusively demanded by wealthier households, while poor people are not able to pay for services,
or do not even consider on-site sanitation and FSM as a medium- to long-term solution. Moreover,
the potential costs associated with reaching households in low-income areas (e.g. time and fuel) as
well as accessing the pits, may not make FSM services a profitable business for current providers
of sanitation services.

   For example, in one of the FGDs carried out in the Santa Rosa district, one of the participants mentioned that
emptying services may actually lead to increased pollution as the pit would have to be opened, allowing odours and
contents to leak to the surrounding environment.

5.2       Methodology
This sub-section sets out key dimensions of demand and supply, and the data collected that is
related to these aspects. It was not intended to collect comprehensive data on demand and supply,
given the broad scope of the research and the limitations of some of the instruments used.

5.2.1     Demand

The research framework (see Section 1.3) poses the following question: What is the existing
customer demand and preferences for FSM services? i. e. the current effective demand. This is
discussed in three parts: (a) physical and economic determinants of household demand, (b)
household satisfaction with current services, and (c) barriers faced by households in obtaining
FSM services.19 This list is not meant to be exhaustive, but rather considers key elements for
answering the questions in the research framework.

Physical and economic determinants of household demand

It is useful to separate the physical and economic determinants of household demand because the
differences between them have implications for any potential interventions, either in stimulating or
responding to demand. Physical determinants are related to geography and infrastructure,
whereas economic determinants are more to do with markets and finance.

The main determinants are set out in Table 9 and Table 10 below, describing its relevance and the
way they have been measured by the research instruments (if data is available).

   Given our focus on household demand, the primary concern is demand for emptying services rather than for the
remaining components of the sanitation service chain. The research framework also asks about levels of satisfaction by
providers of emptying services with current transport, treatment and disposal/end-use arrangements. As there are no
formal fecal sludge emptying services, and there is no effective treatment or end-use for fecal sludge in Lima, this aspect
does not form a significant part of the study.

Household satisfaction with existing services

Household satisfaction with the performance of service providers will be a determinant of demand.
This was addressed in two ways through household survey questions based on a four-point Likert
scale.20 Firstly, households were asked to rate their satisfaction level with various aspects of the
sanitation facilities used, including quality of construction, ease of access, privacy and cleanliness.
Secondly, households which had used an emptying service the last time their pit or tank filled up
were asked to rate the service provider on price, overall service quality, safety and ease of
obtaining service.21

Some reasons for a gap between potential and effective demand for FSM services in Lima are
already listed above (e.g. physical access to households and willingness to pay). However, there
are many other potential barriers which households may face in securing FSM services.

Some of the barriers to accessing services have not been possible to predict ex ante. These were
therefore explored in the qualitative research, particularly through FGDs with community members
in lowest-income areas. Several of the discussion questions focused around perceptions and
opinions of existing services, and what participants would like to see in terms of improved services
in the future. Discussions were semi-structured, with participants able to discuss questions more
openly, so allowing for the identification of further determinants of demand not otherwise
addressed in the household survey. The full list of topics and questions addressed can be found
via a link in Annex F.

5.2.2     Supply

On the supply side, the research questions were around the current status and quality of FSM
service delivery, with a focus on assessing current technical and institutional capacity (i.e. the
scope and quality of services). This was assessed mainly through the household survey and the
report submitted by the WSP consultant.


5.3       Findings: household demand for services
The results in each key area are presented below, with an overall assessment provided in the
concluding section, alongside implications for FSM in Lima.

5.3.1     Determinants of household demand

Accessibility of location

Whether a service provider can actually get to the facility requiring emptying (as well as the
household’s perception of this) will be a key determinant of demand for services. Data to assess
accessibility were collected from several angles and analysed starting from road/path systems in
the UAL, before focusing down to the household level and, ultimately, the facility itself.

Some of the transect walk data sheds light on the kinds of housing density, paths and roads
observed in the studied areas. Table 11 provides scoring data for non-sewered areas.22 The main
issue seems to be housing density rather than the quality of paths and roads. In terms of
implications for FSM services, what can be concluded from this table is that while mechanised
emptying equipment may find it relatively easy to access non-sewered UALs, reaching individual
households may prove to be difficult given steep hillsides in some cases, housing density and the
poor quality of paths. Indeed, paths in 8 out of 30 TWs in non-sewered areas were either poorly
maintained or very narrow.

  Scores of 1-5 have been used in each city study to represent a qualitative assessment of the relative impact from each
physical aspect of the UAL on being able to achieve effective and safe FSM services in that locality, with 1 representing
the lowest impact and 5 the highest impact. Annex E includes further explanation of the scoring mechanism.

Nb. Scores indicate the relative impact on effective FSM, while values per parameter show the proportion of transect
walks for which this score was given, e.g. in 1 out of 30 TWs in non-sewered areas was housing density scored with 1.
Note that 30 TWs were carried out in non-sewered areas.

The type of building also influences the extent and nature of the emptying required. Table 12 below
shows that the majority of households live in private residences (94%), with the remaining 6%
living in shared residences. Based on photographs from the sampled areas, most of these
residences (either private or shared) are single storey houses, although the management of the
containment is likely to be different between private and shared residences. However, accessibility
to the pit/tank will only be tangentially related to this, especially in cases where the sanitation
facility is outside of the dwelling.

Focusing on the facility itself, Table 13 below shows the accessibility of the main pit/tank structure,
followed by the presence of a purpose-built hatch (as one would expect with a correctly-
constructed septic tank). Following the theme from the TW data, 16% of households in non-
sewered areas were reported to have “poor access”, while 11% of households reported to have an
access point or hatch to facilitate emptying of their containment facility. 23




23
  This data comes from observations by our enumerators during the household survey. There were three categories: (1)
“Poor access, only accessible to hand-carried emptying equipment”, (2) “Reasonable access for small (manual or
mechanised) emptying equipment”, and (3) “Good access for medium/large size (mechanised) emptying equipment”.

Overall, from the perspective of accessibility it is clear that while ‘geographic accessibility’ may not
be an issue (as indicated through both TWs and household survey data), there is limited access to
the pits for emptying. The latter should be a key concern in any interventions to stimulate demand
for FSM services, e.g. by providing simple workshops on adequate pit/sanitation facility
infrastructure to household members, as they usually dig the pits and build the facility
superstructure themselves.

Filling rate

Data on the type of containment was already shown in Table 6. As noted earlier, data were not
collected on the volume of pits/tanks, since household estimates were thought to be unreliable.
However, households were asked how long it usually took for their pit to fill up, which was
considered more relevant, and a more reliable indicator for households to estimate. The results are
shown in Table 14 below. There are very few observations since so few households have
experienced their current pits filling up (i.e. around 3% of the 7% of households that use on-site
sanitation across Lima). The data shows that among households using on-site sanitation, the
majority of pits take between 2 to 5 years to fill up (75%).

Moving to the data on shared latrines, the mean number of households sharing each latrine was

more detail, as is shown in Table 15 below.26 This comes directly from data reported by
households, as opposed to estimations based on secondary data. The majority of latrines were
shared with fewer than 6 people (73%). This is consistent with perceptions about sharing a
sanitation facility: one of the FGDs revealed that some people prefer to use public facilities at their
workplace or local market rather than asking a neighbour.

Given that the majority of households do not share their facility, the rate for pits to fill up is likely to
be mainly determined by characteristics of the pit itself (e.g. depth, material used, etc.) and the
type of soil. Although there is no accurate data for the physical characteristics of the pit,
participants from FGDs mentioned that the average depth of a pit for a household with 5 members
is 3 metres, which is expected to take about 5 years to fill up. However, more rapid filling has been
observed in larger households: one of the FGD participants in Pachacamac district, whose
household is composed of 10 people, mentioned that in the past 3 years his pit has already filled
up once, with the second pit already filling up. The time taken for the pit to fill up is also likely to be
shorter in rocky areas, where digging deep pits is both physically difficult and costly.

Financial aspects

As noted above, collecting data on willingness to pay (WTP) and ability to pay (ATP) was beyond
the scope of this study. However, data were collected on the price paid the last time an FSM
service was used, and whether households thought that price was fair.

First though, it is worth briefly considering finance for containment. Households were asked how
much they spent (in cash, including materials and labour) to build their toilet at the time when it
was built, if they spent cash at all. For non-sewered areas overall, the average cost of an improved
facility was US $283 (n = 256), while the cost for an unimproved facility was US $48 (n = 55).27
Regarding repairs/maintenance to toilets in the past 12 months (including repairs to mechanism,
superstructure or drainage), the average expenditure for non-sewered areas overall was US $110
(n = 34).28 Although only 9% of households have spent money in maintaining their sanitation
facilities, these amount to 65% of the original investment for their construction.

With regards to payment for FSM services the last time emptying took place (Table 16), the
average amount paid was US $137 (n = 9) for non-sewered areas overall. All households paid the
full amount on delivery, and most of them paid a flat rate (56%) rather than a volumetric charge.
These costs are consistent with those reported by local leaders in Pachacamac district, who

25
   For these estimates, households with private latrines (not sharing with any other households) are included and coded
as 1. If those households are excluded, the mean rises to 2.2.
26
   This data are directly drawn from the following survey question: “ How many people use this toilet regularly?”
Categories are the same as those used in the survey. Average household size was 4.4.
27
   Nb. we did not ask how long ago this was, so are unable to account for inflation and exchange rates, so the results are
indicative only. We used the rate 1 Peruvian Nuevo Sol = US $0.32.
28
   Most households reported that this expenditure was mainly for repairs to the bowl / slab and for the superstructure
(84% in non-sewered areas and 78% in lowest-income areas). Only 2 households (5%) in non-sewered areas incurred
costs for emptying their pits in the last 12 months.

                                                                                                                       31
Fecal Sludge Management in Lima – Case Study Report


suggested that the cost of emptying ranges between US $224 and US $256, depending on the
depth of the pit. For the great majority of households, these costs were perceived to be too high.

Incentives

The incentives that drive demand for improved FSM services are mainly influenced by ownership
(of both the facility and the plot/dwelling itself), previous investments in constructing and
maintaining the sanitation facility (as described above), and the current quality of the facility.

Around 90% of households own and have financed their sanitation facilities. Regarding their
quality, 41% of households in non-sewered areas have a non-durable superstructure with a
cleanable slab (with or without a water seal).29

Households were also asked to express their satisfaction with their current sanitation facility across
a range of factors, as shown in Figure 9 below. The level of satisfaction with the sanitation facility is
a driver of the incentives people have to invest in the improvement and maintenance of their
facilities, which includes emptying of the pit/tank. Data shows that there are no major differences
between non-sewered and lowest-income areas, with the exception of ‘ease of access’, for which
households in lowest-income areas conveyed more dissatisfaction (56% vs 7% in non-sewered
areas)30. Overall, households are generally satisfied with the quality of the construction, but are
dissatisfied with privacy, and especially the cleanliness of their sanitation facility (over 60% for both
samples).

Households also identified their intended action once their pit/tank fills up (whether it had filled up
previously or not) as per Table 17 below. Less weight was placed on this data than the action after
the pit last filled up, as it may not be carried out and the number of observations is not large
enough to draw reliable conclusions. 31 Nonetheless, it does signal market intention in some sense,
with 100% of households mentioning that they intend to hire a professional service. This may be
partly driven by the fact that households relying on on-site sanitation are concerned (as manifested
in FGDs) with not having any space left on their plots to dig a new pit if the one currently in use fills
up. Indeed, participants from FGDs in PROFAM and Las Lomas mentioned that households had
dug their pits on a public road/path. Moreover, another participant in La Rinconada mentioned that
one of the community members had now resorted to throwing fecal sludge along with solid waste
because his pit has filled up and he has no space to dig a new one on his plot.

5.3.2        Barriers faced by households in lowest-income areas to obtain FSM services

Focus group discussions held in lowest-income areas identified that the key barriers faced by
households relate to (1) costs / affordability and (2) lack of information or knowledge about FSM
emptying services (besides those offered by NGOs with UDDTs) and containment requirements.

First, and as mentioned earlier, participants from FGDs stated that emptying services are very
expensive, with an average cost of between US $224 and $256, depending on the depth of the pit.
Similarly, participants from the FGD in San Juan de Miraflores, of which some use urine-diverting
dry toilets (UDDTs), mentioned that a private NGO offered to collect their fecal waste on a monthly
basis at a cost of US $13 per month, which is unaffordable to them. However, some of them
suggested they would be willing to pay between US $5 and US $6 on a monthly basis for this
service.

Another issue is that households in are also relatively unaware of what FSM services are. In the
pilot FGD carried out in San Juan de Miraflores, none of the participants had ever emptied their
pits/tanks nor did they have any idea of what an emptying service entailed. One of the participants
in Santa Rosa district also believed that emptying pits may lead to more contamination, and thus
pose a risk to the community. Moreover, although some NGOs have offered some training
regarding how sanitation facilities should be built and maintained, the majority of households in
lowest-income non-sewered areas rely on family and friends to build their facilities, most of whom
have learned through their relatives/friends as well. FGDs also revealed that some of the pits are
poorly covered – a participant in PROFAM even reported that one of their community members
has not covered his pit, leaving all the fecal sludge exposed –, and as mentioned above, very few
households have access points or hatches in their pits to facilitate emptying. In terms of
maintenance, women usually use lime and hydrochloric acid to prevent their facilities from
overflowing.

Finally, regarding household incentives, the majority of participants in all FGDs (with the exception
of people who use UDDTs) expressed their dissatisfaction with current on-site sanitation facilities,
as most of the pits/latrines have a very bad smell (especially in the summer), which attracts rats,

31
     This question was not answered by households whose current pit / tank has not filled up in the past 5 years.

                                                                                                                    33

flies and cockroaches. Some households have also experienced pit overflow, while others are very
concerned with the lack of space to build new pits in the near future. These experiences, coupled
with high prices and lack of knowledge of FSM emptying services, has skewed households
towards regarding sewerage as the only medium- to long-term alternative to their current situation,
which reinforces the lack of demand for FSM services.


5.4       Findings: supply of FSM services
As set out in Section 5.2.2, the supply side assessment is mainly related to the current status and
quality of FSM service delivery as described by KIIs with service providers.

5.4.1     Services effectively supplied

The first stage of the supply analysis should be to consider what services are supplied in the
market, where effective supply intersects with effective demand. Some relevant context was
already provided in Section 3.3.1 by the SFDs, especially in Table 6 and Table 7. These tables
show that when pits have previously filled up, people generally abandon them, although recent
behaviour suggests there may be some scope for FSM emptying services – 9 out of the 10
households in non-sewered areas for which the pit/tank currently in use filled up claimed to have
emptied it. In all instances, services were provided by a formal service provider (an NGO or a
private firm) using a vacuum tanker. These households were also asked about where the fecal
sludge was discharged during emptying, with the majority responding that contents were
discharged into a drum/container (33%) or a tanker truck (44%).32 The remaining households did
not know where the fecal sludge was finally discharged.

5.4.2     Service provider capacity

Given that there are currently no formal FSM services directed at low-income households that rely
on on-site sanitation, there is limited information about the capacity of potential service providers to
cope with demand. 33 Based on KIIs and information provided by the World Bank consultant, there
are two types of service providers: independent NGOs, such as X-Runner or PEBAL, and current
providers servicing public establishments or dealing with solid waste management, e.g. Megapack
Trading S.A.C or Disal.

On one hand, X-Runner targets poor urban households and provides fecal sludge services across
the whole chain. The NGO provides a UDDT to each household, emptying its contents once a
week or every two weeks, treating and re-using the fecal sludge to create compost. The compost is
sometimes given to back to households or as a gift to future clients, but currently the majority of it
is stored at their treatment area in Villa El Salvador. FS is treated as toxic waste by national and
local legislation, which does not allow FS compost to be commercialised. There are three different
types of packages: (i) for two people: 1 UDDT emptied every two weeks at a cost of US $9 per
month; (ii) for three or more people: 2 UDDTs emptied every week at a cost of US $12 per month;
and (iii) for six people or more: 3 to 5 UDDTs emptied every week at a cost of US $16 per month.
X-Runner is currently serving 480 households, the majority of which have 2 UDDTs (74%).

On the other hand, Megapack Trading S.A.C is a large and well-established firm that primarily
serves the municipality (i.e. public establishments) and large industries (including in the mining

32
   Households were only asked about the initial discharge point, as they would not always be in a position to know where
service providers eventually discharged to. This indicator was only answered by 10 households in non-sewered areas.
33
   Although some richer households in wealthy neighbourhoods are serviced by vacuum tankers to empty their septic
tanks, these services are usually directed at public establishments, which households can use if they are willing and able
to pay the cost.

                                                                                                                       34

sector). In particular, for FSM services in schools, hospitals and social clubs, the service is
provided using mechanical emptying with tanker trucks, which have a capacity of 6, 10 and 30 m 3.
Services are reported to be very efficient, with delivery upon request, but costs and limited physical
accessibility have been highlighted as some of the potential deterrents for providing services to
poor peri-urban households. Indeed, KIIs with NGOs and service providers have suggested that it
may be difficult for current service providers (mostly specialised in solid waste management) to
extend their services to cover domestic FSM: decentralisation of treatment and improved
regulation and monitoring will be needed. From a purely business perspective, service providers all
mentioned the need for a demand/situation assessment to determine if FSM services for the urban
poor are a profitable endeavour. In addition, during the workshop held in Lima, Disal mentioned
that they face two risks: (i) households not paying and (ii) breaking the law, as legislation regarding
FSM is very unclear.

6           Fecal sludge reuse options

6.1         Fecal sludge characteristics
Samples of fecal sludge were collected from six different types of sanitation containment facilities:
         an offset unlined pit connected to a pour-flush toilet
         a pit receiving wastes directly from a pour-flush toilet
         a septic tank
         a dry pit, receiving only feces and urine
         a twin-vault urine-diversion latrine
         a movable urine-diverting latrine.

The six different types of sanitation facilities from which samples of fecal waste were taken, and
the types of wastes from each facility, are summarised in Table 18, below.

The offset unlined pit is the most popular sanitation option in Lima, and there are few septic tanks
in low income peri-urban areas, this option being suitable only where piped water is available and
sewers are not. The twin-vault urine-diversion latrine is the most common sanitation facility for
feces alone, although X-Runner provides a service for movable urine-diversion latrines on a small
scale in a few peri-urban districts of Lima.

Results of the laboratory analyses on FS samples from different sanitation facilities are
summarised in Table 19 below. The analyses indicate high numbers of bacteria in the FS, but with
few helminth eggs. The wet fecal sludge samples showed very high water contents, and all
samples showed low nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) contents.

The samples of fecal sludge from urine-diversion latrines did not include urine. Urine from twin-
vault latrines could either be collected and used as a fertiliser, or allowed to drain into the
surrounding soil. Urine from the movable urine-diversion latrines also drains into the surrounding
soil.

6.2       Availability and access to fecal sludge services
Relatively few sanitation facilities in Lima are emptied when pits or tanks become full. Few people
know about suction tanker services, which also tend to be expensive. Large tankers may also be
unable to gain access to some of the pits and tanks, given the quality of paths and roads, as well
as the hilly nature of the areas occupied by low-income peri-urban households. In addition, the
majority of households choose to abandon and cover their latrines when they are full, and build
new ones. However, given increasing concerns with the lack of space to dig new pits, as well as
delays in getting access to sewerage, there is some interest in alternative FSM services, potentially
including emptying with tanker trucks.

During sample collection some residents were previously unaware that an emptying service was
available. Collecting some samples proved to be difficult and the suction tanker was only used for
three sanitation facilities:

        For the offset unlined pit connected to a flush toilet, a pipe from the suction tanker was
         inserted through a manhole, but part of the pit wall collapsed and blocked the suction pipe.
        For the pit receiving wastes directly from a pour-flush toilet, use of the suction tanker was
         very difficult because the soil was very sandy. Emptying was halted because the pit
         contents were too dry to be pumped as a liquid.
        Emptying the septic tank was relatively simple, and no stones or silt were encountered.
        Non-liquid samples were collected manually from the dry pit.
        Non-liquid samples were collected manually from the twin-vault urine-diversion latrine.
        Non-liquid samples were collected manually from the movable urine-diversion latrine.

Fecal Sludge Management in Lima – Case Study Report


6.2.1     Treatment

There are currently no treatment facilities in Lima for FS, and no organised systems for collection,
except in some rich coastal areas of the city where dwellings usually have a flush latrine with a
septic tank. When septic tanks are emptied, it is reported that the fecal sludge is illegally dumped
in SEDAPAL sewers, landfill sites or in open spaces in nearby peri-urban areas, as there are no
treatment plants designed specifically for fecal sludge.

X-Runner provides emptying, transport, treatment and reuse services in Villa El Salvador,
Pamplona Alta and Villa María del Triunfo for mobile urine-diversion latrines. Feces from these
latrines are taken to a small treatment plant where they are mixed with sawdust, and bacteria are
added to encourage composting. The material is left to compost in plastic bags, before being
mixed and stored for future sale as compost.

6.2.2     Re-use

In the absence of services for collection and treatment of fecal sludge in Lima, there is currently
little, if any, re-use, and very little prospect of significant re-use in the foreseeable future. Most pits
are abandoned when full, and emptying pits may damage the walls of pits, especially those that
are unlined.

Permanent twin-vault latrines have been constructed in a few districts. One vault is used at any
time and, when it is full, it is allowed to ‘rest’ while the second vault is used. By the time that the
second vault is almost full, the contents of the first vault should be dry and inoffensive, and could
be applied to agricultural land. Between 2000 and 2006, some 225 twin-vault latrines were
constructed in Lima, but it is reported that only 62% (140) of these are currently in use. A further
145 were constructed between 2010 and 2014, of which more than 90% are in use. It is not clear
how the urine and dried feces are used or disposed of.

As mentioned above, X-Runner (based in the Villa El Salvador district) has supplied mobile urine-
diversion latrines to residents in 3 different areas. X-Runner services these toilets, providing an
emptying, transport, and treatment service. Feces are collected on a weekly basis from the
containers and transported to a private treatment facility, where compost is produced for possible
future reuse. The treatment process and final product have not been accredited as yet, and the
company is currently seeking a licence to sell the treated compost commercially. The final product
is currently being stored in plastic sacks until it can be sold.

Table 20 below, shows analyses of fresh and treated samples of feces from urine-diversion latrines
supplied and serviced by X-Runner. Few conclusions can be drawn from the analyses. The
samples of fresh and treated feces are independent of one another, but some results are
surprising. They appear to show an increase in the number of Total coliforms during treatment,
while numbers of Thermotolerant coliforms remain unchanged. The overwhelming majority of any
sample of Thermotolerant coliforms are E. coli, yet the results show very few Thermotolerant
coliforms being E. coli. Helminth eggs were detected after, but not before, treatment, and the
moisture content of the material remained constant. It is difficult to account for these anomalies.
The increase in Total coliforms may be associated with the composting process, and most other
anomalies may be attributed to samples being taken from different process streams. The most
surprising result is the very low percentages of Thermotolerant coliforms identified as E. coli,
suggesting errors in the bacterial analysis. The treated feces have limited value as a natural
fertilizer, but could be used as a soil improver if the numbers of bacteria and helminth eggs are
reduced.

6.2.3      Possible future reuse options

Some of the possible reuse options for fecal sludge include: (1) using treated fecal sludge as a soil
conditioner or organic fertiliser; (2) using dried fecal sludge as a fuel; (3) generating biogas from
anaerobic digestion of FS; (4) producing protein for use as animal feed, and (5) including fecal
sludge in building materials. In the absence of any centralised services for emptying pits and septic
tanks, or for treating FS, the only current potential reuse option is localised use of dried feces as a
soil conditioner or organic fertiliser. Management of this, albeit on a small scale, may improve if X-
Runner obtains a licence to sell their treated compost commercially and generate a profit. Future
reuse opportunities in Lima are therefore limited, unless centralised fecal sludge collection and
treatment services are introduced and managed.

KIIs suggest that SEDAPAL and private service providers are generally keen on creating a reuse
market but are deterred by the lack of adequate treatment facilities for fecal sludge and/or a clear
institutional framework to support its development. However, wastewater reuse was legalised in
2010 and is currently being used in urban and peri-urban green areas.34 These guidelines may
thus provide an entry point for fecal sludge end-products to be used for similar purposes, as well
as in peri-urban small-scale agriculture.

   The Ministry of Housing, Construction and Sanitation approved the “Policy Guidelines for the Promotion of Treatment
for Domestic and Municipal Wastewater Reuse for Irrigation of Urban and Peri-Urban Green Areas” in November 2010.

7         City Service Delivery Assessment

7.1       Introduction
The City Service Delivery Assessment (CSDA) is a crucial part of the analysis of FSM services. It
answers an overarching question around the quality of the FSM enabling environment, the level of
FSM service development and the level of commitment to FSM service sustainability. The aim of
the CSDA is to allow an objective assessment of FSM service performance through all stages of
the service chain, so as to identify priorities for reform. The Prognosis for Change (in the next
section) then attempts to explain why the CSDA looks like it does.

The CSDA format builds on an approach developed under the 12-city study (Peal & Evans, 2013).
In turn, the 12-city method was based on similar exercises in water and sanitation (e.g. Country
Status Overviews produced by WSP).

The CSDA is arranged around three broad areas: (1) enabling services, (2) developing services,
and (3) sustaining services. This is illustrated in Table 21 below, alongside the key question
associated with each area, and the indicators used.

7.2       Methodology
The CSDA aims to be fully objective and transparent, so the analysis is clear and stakeholders can
engage with it and update it over time as the situation improves. It is primarily a qualitative
analysis, based on a review of key documents and interviews with stakeholders at the city level.
WSP’s overall study design was that the OPM/WEDC team designed the methodology, but did not
do primary data collection (for more information, please refer to Annex B). For analyses such as
the CSDA and PFC, it is hard to separate data collection from analysis. Therefore, the collection
and preliminary analysis was conducted by a short-term consultant contracted by WSP, Eng.
Ruddy Noriega.

There are several questions beneath each of the nine overall indicators in Table 21 above, with 20
questions in total. For each question, there are objective criteria to enable a score to be given for
the city, with 0 (poor), 0.5 (developing) or 1 (good) on that question. Each question is scored along
the whole service chain from containment to disposal. An example is given in Table 22 below, for
the first question under the “policy” indicator.



                                                                                                       40

local or both)?                                                                               context



Once all 20 questions are scored, the next step is to aggregate those scores into a city scorecard,
by summing together the scores for each indicator (policy, planning, etc.). Because there are
different numbers of questions for each indicator, a final step is required, which is to normalise the
scores to a total out of 3 for each indicator. This is achieved by dividing the city score for that
indicator by the maximum possible city score, multiplying by 3, and finally rounding to the nearest
0.5. This process delivers the overall CSDA scorecard. The output for Lima is shown in Figure 10
below.

7.3       Findings
The overall CSDA scorecard for Lima is shown above as Figure 10. An explanation for each score
allocated to the full set of 20 questions is shown in Annex D, while the following sub-sections
summarise the implications of those results.35

7.3.1     Enabling

Domestic FSM services in Lima have not been developed, with the current ones exclusively
serving public establishments, such as schools, universities and health facilities, or private
dwellings in wealthier areas (e.g. beach houses). Although most KIIs recognised the importance of
FSM to address the needs of the 800,000 people that have no access to sewerage, there are no
planning and/or budgetary arrangements to address these issues. Like other Latin American cities,
sewerage is regarded as the ‘first best’ for urban areas, especially with current coverage at above
90%. Thus, the target for Lima is to achieve universal coverage by 2017, with no medium-term
solutions until sewerage infrastructure is put in place. Similarly, the National Urban Sanitation
Programme (Programa Nacional de Saneamiento Urbano ) does not seem to be making any
investments on on-site sanitation or FSM.

Nonetheless, legislation for FSM is slightly more developed, with both Law No. 26338 (General
Law for Sanitation Services) and Law No. 30045 (Law for the Modernisation of Sanitation Services)
encompassing the disposal of feces from latrines and septic tanks within the purview of sanitation
services. In particular, Law No. 30045 defines the competencies across sector stakeholders (e.g.
Ministry of Housing, Construction and Sanitation is sanctioned as the main governing body), and
introduces support mechanisms to ensure the quality and sustainability (including financial) of the
sanitation services provided, among others. Although service providers (i.e. EPSs) are mainly
dealing with sewerage, treatment and solid waste management, fecal sludge service providers
would likely fit under the same policy framework.

7.3.2     Developing

There is currently no identifiable public expenditure in fecal sludge urban infrastructure or services,
with the result that the availability of appropriate, affordable and safe services to the non-sewered
population in Lima is non-existent. In terms of equity, KIIs mentioned that FSM services are too
costly for the urban poor, which may be party explained by difficulty of access (to both the dwelling
and the pit/tank) and the lack of a recurrent demand for these services. Despite the principles of
universal access and social inclusion for the provision of sanitation services, both national and
local governments have failed to develop plans and ensure adequate funding is allocated for this
purpose.

Given the lack of FSM services, there are no measurable outputs. Besides the provision of UDDTs
by NGOs, and previous government efforts to provide latrines, there is nothing in place besides
some partial fecal sludge containment (in septic tanks, pit latrines and unlined pits). 36

7.3.3     Sustaining

Operation and maintenance costs for fecal sludge services are primarily carried out by households
through their investment in self-financed sanitation infrastructure – the common practice for poor
35
   Since FSM is relatively under-developed in Lima, the original CSDA questions were adapted by the World Bank
consultant to fit the Lima context. We have however been able to populate the original CSDA based on secondary
information, KIIs and data collected through transect walks.
36
   Unlined pits refer to pozo ciego/negro as recorded in national surveys.

                                                                                                           43
Fecal Sludge Management in Lima – Case Study Report


urban households is to dig a new pit once the one in use is filled up. It is not possible to determine
with certainty how many of the pits are properly covered or sealed. Given the high level of
sewerage coverage overall, the risk to public health is often deemed to be quite low – although
there could be a high risk of environmental pollution in poorer areas where the use of unlined pits
is common, resulting in pit collapse or abandoned pits not being covered safely.

One of the main issues is the lack of demand from households for services, as this reinforces the
government’s inaction with regards to FSM development and strengthening. The majority of KIIs
confirmed that there are no government programmes or support for service providers, and no
formal systems that serve the urban poor, with the exception of small NGO initiatives that provide
alternative sanitation systems, mainly in the form of urine-diverting dry toilets.

7.3.4     Implications of the CSDA scorecard

The resulting CSDA scorecard of the FSM service delivery assessment in Figure 10 reveals a
complete absence of public policy, capital investment and operational oversight of FSM. Although
for the city as a whole, the lack of FSM services may not seem to be a priority (given the high level
of sewerage coverage), there are 800,000 people in poor areas without a real and sustainable
solution to their daily sanitation needs.

In a way, policy and regulatory frameworks already allow for the provision of emptying and
transport services to households, as feces disposal is encompassed within the national definition of
sanitation services. Current service providers of treatment and solid waste management are also
likely to be able to cope and adapt to an increase in demand, assuming that the legal provisions to
ensure their financial sustainability (Law No. 30045) are guaranteed. Through KIIs, SEDAPAL and
other stakeholders also agreed on the need to fill this gap for the urban poor, and some manifested
their willingness to get involved in the provision of adequate FSM services, as long as both national
and local governments show commitment and provide the necessary support.

This suggests that what is needed is a space for open dialogue and engagement of public, private
and civil society bodies to ensure that the appropriate infrastructure and services are
systematically developed and adapted to respond to the various contextual challenges of the city
(space, tenancy, poverty, etc.). Segmentation and lack of coordination is already a key constraint
in the provision of basic services, so bringing all key stakeholders together and aiming at reaching
a consensus on a course of action, is an imperative. A clear definition and agreement of the roles
of different stakeholders along the sanitation service chain is also required, with a particular focus
on developing adequate containment and treatment frameworks, and strengthening both emptying
and transport components.

8         Prognosis for Change

8.1       Introduction
This chapter provides a Prognosis for Change (PFC), by considering the positions of various
stakeholders, in particular the institutions and incentives at play. In the sanitation sector, key
studies considering these questions include a multi-country study carried out by WSP with OPM
(WSP, 2010) and a series of papers by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI, 2013). In
addition, SANDEC’s recent FSM book includes a chapter on stakeholder analysis, which is a key
methodology for this kind of analysis (Strande et al, 2014). Through this prognosis for change, it is
intended to understand three elements, which are briefly outlined below and in Figure 11.

Firstly, a PFC considers how institutions function. Here, institutions are defined as “the rules and
norms governing human interaction”, rather than a narrower definition of organisations. Institutions
can be formal – such as codified laws, e.g. a by-law about where fecal sludge can be legally
dumped – and informal, as is the case of social norms, such as prevailing attitudes towards
reusing fecal sludge in agriculture.

Secondly, a PFC considers the incentives which institutions provide to different stakeholders. A
stakeholder is any individual or group with an interest in the outcomes of a policy. In FSM,
stakeholders may include sludge truck companies, the municipality, or poor households.
Stakeholders can be defined broadly or narrowly as required by the breadth and depth of the
analysis. For example, the former stakeholders could be narrowed to recent entrants to the sludge
truck market, the planning department of the municipality, or poor female dwellers. This allows for
a more nuanced analysis rather than taking all organisations as homogeneous.

Third, a PFC considers how stakeholders exert influence. Here, influence is defined as the formal
or informal power to cause something or to prevent it from occurring. In FSM, it might be worth
considering municipality by-laws on FS. A municipality may have formal legal power, but if all their
by-laws are openly flouted by service providers without fear of punishment, then their influence is
very low by that measure. They may however have informal power to influence the FSM market in
other ways, such as the actions undertaken by employees when they identify a blocked sewer
pipe.

Finally, for a PFC to be practically useful, it should also consider the implications of the findings for
effective engagement in a reform or change process. This involves the assessment of the options
for engagement, and weighing them up in the context of the prevalent power dynamics and likely
response of stakeholders.

8.2       Methodology
In this study, developing a PFC was only one concern alongside a large number of other research
components, as set out in Table 1 at the beginning of the report. There was therefore a balance to
be struck. The approach was to link a focussed PFC closely to the service delivery assessment,
presented in the previous section (Section 7). The aim is therefore to explain why the CSDA is as it
is – in other words, to explore why service delivery blockages exist and what entry points are
available to stakeholders to try and resolve them.

Undertaking a PFC is primarily a qualitative exercise. It relies mainly on Key Informant Interviews
(KIIs) with relevant stakeholders and focus group discussions, alongside secondary data in the
form of key sector documents, reports and studies. As noted in Section 7.2 for the CSDA
methodology, the OPM/WEDC team did not conduct the primary data collection and preliminary
analysis, which were carried out by other consultants contracted by the World Bank. Interview
notes and reports from these consultants were the primary inputs for the construction of this PFC.
In order to keep the length of this report manageable, only a brief summary of the full analysis
conducted by the team is provided in this section.

Developing a PFC requires a structure in order to be clearly analysed and communicated. There
are several tools available, which can be applied to particular questions as to explore some of the
issues described in the CSDA. Many tools which are commonly used, including in this study, are
contained in a sourcebook which OPM produced for the World Bank (Holland, 2007). The main
tools used include institutional responsibility analysis, stakeholder analysis and process mapping.


8.3       Findings

8.3.1     Lima’s FSM context

As noted above, the main objective is to explore why the CSDA results are as they are. For Lima,
the CSDA is almost entirely red (i.e. “poor” scores), albeit with some yellow (“developing”) scores
for policy in the emptying and transport stages of the chain. Scores for the rest of the chain, and
across the enabling, developing and sustaining environments are universally zero except for policy
around containment, where a score of 0.5 was given due to X-Runner’s provision of onsite
sanitation facilities in poor urban areas, and service outcomes for containment (also given a score

                                                                                                  46

of 0.5) as the risks to public health at this stage are deemed to be at medium-level, given the
uncertainty about the risk posed by abandoned and covered unlined pits. Overall then, the job of
the PFC in the Lima context is to try and explain “why has nothing happened on FSM” and what
the prognosis for change is.

At this stage, it is worth reconsidering Lima’s context and the responsibility of key actors, which
were briefly set out in Section 2. As many other Latin American countries, rural-urban migration is
a major trend in Peru, with Lima Metropolitan Area (encompassing Lima and Callao) being the
main urban and economic centre of the country. High rates of migration have led to a rapid
horizontal expansion of the city, with many migrants illegally occupying small plots of land in poor
peri-urban areas, which have very limited access to basic public services, mainly drinking water,
sewerage and electricity. Indeed, while current sewerage coverage in Lima is estimated to be
around 92%, only 43% of households in the lowest wealth quintile have access (APEIM, 2013).

Households without sewerage (8% of the city as a whole) rely either on some sort of on-site
sanitation (7%) or practice open defecation (1%). Given the lack of both formal and informal FSM
services, the most common practice among poor peri-urban households is to dig a new pit once
the one in use fills up – although there is an increasing usage of UDDTs that are being provided by
NGOs (e.g. X-Runner and PEBAL). Evidence from focus group discussions (FGDs) suggests that,
while some of the pits have been lined with concrete rings or bricks, most of them are unlined and
built by the household head (usually male) or other close relatives, who have learnt by observation
or through a neighbour, and more unfrequently, through training by an NGO or SEDAPAL. An
example of this is shown in Figure 12 below.

Both the superstructures and the pits are usually located within the plot but outside of the
household, with the majority of pits connected with a pipe to the facility. 37 However, FGD
participants mentioned that some of their neighbours have built their pits in public spaces, such as
nearby green areas or even in public dirt roads, either because they have limited space (e.g.
dwelling is located in a hilly area) or in anticipation of being connected to the sewerage network in
the near future.38 Properly-built pits are covered with a concrete layer or lid, with the more unstable
and cheaper ones being covered with wood and soil, which tends to subside and is clearly a
37
  The distance of the pit to the facility varies, with a range of between 2 and 8 metres.
38
  According to some FGDs, people believe that if their facility is connected to a pipe that leads to the road, it will be
easier for SEDAPAL to provide the sewerage connection.

                                                                                                                      47

hazard, especially for children. FGD participants even commented on a pit being used but left
open, regardless of complaints by neighbours related to bad smell, flies and other environmental
and hygiene concerns. Once full, pits are sealed with lime, rocks, wood and soil, and a new pit is
built nearby or any nearby available space. The lack of space to dig new pits is an increasing
concern for poor non-sewered households, with many not knowing what they will do once the pit in
use fills up. There have even been reports during FGDs of people using buckets or potty chairs
and throwing their contents in a refuse bag along with all other solid waste due to the pit having
filled up and no space left for digging a new one. Poor FSM is coupled with poor solid waste
management (SWM), increasing health risks and environmental hazards in these neighbourhoods.

On the supply side, SEDAPAL faces high costs for the provision of both water and sanitation
services to peri-urban areas, partly explained by the type of terrain occupied by poor households
(e.g. rocky and hilly areas, land intended for agricultural use, etc.), but also by the lack of land
ownership and titling. Private or tertiary service providers are mainly reported to serve wealthier
areas of the city or public institutions (e.g. schools and health facilities), where people have the
ability to pay for emptying and transport of FS, and FSM is thus a profitable business. FGD
participants referred to one or two cases where emptying services were provided to a poor peri-
urban dweller, but this is extremely occasional and unaffordable for the majority of households in
these areas. Other barriers for the provision of services in poor peri-urban areas include access to
dwellings, given the hilly landscape of some of these neighbourhoods and the lack of adequate
roads, as well as access to the pits and methods for emptying, given that the quality of their
construction (and the terrain itself) is precarious. NGOs, such as X-Runner, provide FSM services
across the whole chain, but these initiatives are still at ‘pilot-level’, serving few households and, in
some cases, remaining unaffordable.

On the demand side, there is a very low level of demand for FSM services due to a lack of
knowledge of the possibility of FSM services (or high prices for vacuum truck services, when
people knew of their existence). Indeed, the majority of FGD participants did not know that
emptying services exist or that their private pits could potentially be emptied. With regard to cost,
discussions also suggest that in some neighbourhoods people are simply not willing to pay for
FSM services (regardless of the cost), expecting to receive services for ‘free’ or being comfortable
with the status quo. Moreover, on-site sanitation is generally conceived as a temporary solution
with the expectation that both piped water and sewerage will be provided in the short- to medium-
term (this is true even for current users of UDDTs). Many households have not observed any
improvement in the past 5 to10 years, with lack of progress being primarily linked to costs and the
lack of land titling and formalisation of the human settlement, which is a pre-requisite of SEDAPAL.
Most FGD participants claimed that they have already submitted their documents (i.e. land titles or
plano visado) and are waiting for a response in upcoming months. It must be noted as well that,
contrary to service provision in rural areas, SEDAPAL is not able to intervene at the intra-
domiciliary level in urban or peri-urban areas, limiting its ability to provide alternative sanitation
services to households in non-sewered areas.

Overall, there is no formal FSM market for poor non-sewered households in Lima – while vacuum
truck services are demanded and supplied in some parts of the city, there is no such market in
poor peri-urban areas. On one hand, the problem has relatively low visibility given the high level of
sewerage coverage and the concentration of on-site sanitation among the urban poor. On the other
hand, given the low ability and willingness to pay of poor households, FSM services are not
demanded and hence, private or tertiary stakeholders have limited incentives to develop a market
that is likely to be financially unprofitable and unsustainable. However, SEDAPAL is currently
designing a pilot for the provision of decentralised water supply and sanitation services, including
FSM, in poor peri-urban areas. FSM services may be coupled with ‘sanitation marketing’ to offer
poor households different on-site sanitation options at affordable prices (an alternative that is

                                                                                                      48

currently being explored through initiatives like “Mi Baño”, which offers different types of
prefabricated sanitation facilities). It is envisaged that SEDAPAL will have full responsibility for the
development and sustainability of the FSM market, with private/tertiary service providers being
sub-contracted to provide mainly emptying and transport services. Regulatory agencies (e.g.
SUNASS and DIGESA) will also play a key role in fixing the maximum prices or tariffs to be
charged for these services.

A preliminary overview of the situation in the language of incentives is as follows. It is clear that the
prevalent FSM service providers (vacuum truck companies serving wealthier areas of the city, e.g.
beach houses) have no incentives to provide services in poor non-sewered areas because there
seems to be no demand and no potential profit. Poor households have no incentive to properly line
their pits and empty them because the contamination is an externality that primarily affects the
general public rather than the household itself. They also have little incentive to invest in safer (and
more expensive) containment options, while their expectation is that SEDAPAL will eventually
extend the sewer network to their area. SEDAPAL has little incentive to extend the sewer network
in this way mainly because it is very costly (especially in hilly and rocky areas), but also because
there are legal impediments (i.e. lack of formal land rights) for the expansion of the network. One
part of squaring this circle is therefore for SEDAPAL to make their intentions clear.

To have a better understanding of current institutional responsibilities and the scope for reform, the
next section maps out these responsibilities across key sector stakeholders.

8.3.2     Mapping institutional responsibilities

As set out above, the focus is on how institutions function, the incentives which those institutions
provide to stakeholders, and how those stakeholders exert influence. It is therefore important to
understand who those stakeholders are, alongside their formal and informal roles. A useful tool to
do this is institutional responsibility mapping, as set out in Table 23 below. Stakeholders have been
categorised by sector (e.g. national or local government, private, etc.), and both their formal
responsibilities (‘what should be happening’) and the reality (‘what actually happens’) in FSM in
Lima are described. A final column summarises some of the main challenges faced.

The main messages of Table 23 are the following:

        At both national and local levels, no responsibilities for FSM have been clearly designated
         across stakeholders, which discourages the development of FSM services. Sector
         planning, and thus, public budgets are unlikely to encompass FSM if no stakeholder can be
         held accountable for investments and results. Indeed, budget allocations are primarily
         directed to the expansion of the sewerage network and treatment facilities (both for grey
         and blackwater, and solid waste). Moreover, given the current segmentation of the
         sanitation sector across different institutions (as shown in Table 23), a clear designation of
         responsibilities is needed (as is the case for sewerage). Indeed, several KIIs expressed that
         sector or national development plans that encompass FSM cannot be developed without a
         prior definition and allocation of competencies. Evidence from KIIs also suggests that,
         although there seems to be no political opposition to the development of FSM, there is no
         political will either to carry this forwards – this is partly driven by the persistent demand for
         sewerage (and piped water) by poor non-sewered dwellers, which drives political
         campaigns and sanitation policy more broadly, as well as the lack of actual commitment
         and actions by government counterparts.

        Although there are no formal regulations or legal frameworks for FSM, these seem to be
         flexible enough to encompass the provision and regulation of FSM services either by


                                                                                                        49
Fecal Sludge Management in Lima – Case Study Report


         SEDAPAL directly or through private/tertiary service providers (sub-contracted by
         SEDAPAL). However, current demand is limited and there is very little knowledge about
         potential demand (i.e. volume of fecal sludge to be emptied, transported, treated, etc.). A
         reuse market for fecal sludge also remains to be legalised and developed. Thus, there are
         no clear incentives to develop a market from the supply side.

        Poor households in peri-urban Lima face significant financial restrictions to pay for the FSM
         services currently offered, with emptying services ranging between USD $120 and $240 (as
         reported in FGDs). The common practice of digging new pits once the ones in use fill up
         has also contributed to the maintenance of the current status quo. However, limited space,
         land tenure issues and health hazards and risks, as well as delays in getting access to
         sewerage (which can take between 8 to 10 years), is encouraging people to explore other
         alternatives, as is the case of UDDTs offered by X-Runner and PEBAL.

Overall, as shown in the CSDA scorecard in Figure 10, the whole FSM chain needs to be formally
enabled, developed and sustained. Even if the current legal frameworks for SWM service providers
allows for the inclusion of FSM service providers, there is an urgent need to explicitly include FSM
within urban development plans and budgets, and define competencies across sector institutions.
From the table, it seems that the Ministry of Housing should be the institution that has responsibility
for ensuring that appropriate FSM services exist, while SUNASS should continue to oversee the
services themselves. SEDAPAL should be the main service provider, as this would allow for an
integration of FSM services within the provision of WSS in Lima, regardless of whether services
are provided directly or through the private/tertiary sector.

Without a proper distribution and designation of responsibilities for FSM, to which stakeholders are
held accountable, it will not be possible to establish FSM services and develop a strong FSM
market. There are no obvious incentives for stakeholders to undertake FSM activities, and they
cannot be expected to independently take this venture forwards.

   On-site sanitation and blackwater treatment is significantly more developed for rural areas. For instance, there is a practical manual for households that provides information about
containment, emptying and treatment of fecal sludge (Manual Tecnico de Difusion – Sistema de Tratamiento de Aguas Residuales para Albergues en Zonas Rurales ).

   Sanctions include corrective measures, such as public notices to discourage non-compliance of legal frameworks, refunds to affected users, or any other measure that SUNASS considers
necessary to revert SPs non-compliance.

8.3.3     The influence and interests of stakeholders in FSM reform

When considering reform options, as in a redistribution or introduction of FSM responsibilities, it is
crucial to consider how stakeholders might respond, e.g. who would be supportive and who would
oppose – in other words, their interest, or whether they stand to gain or lose from any change to
the status quo. With a limited amount of time and effort to put into preparing the ground and
working with different stakeholders, it would be wise to use that time efficiently and target it at the
right people. Therefore, information about stakeholders’ interests is not enough. It must be used in
combination with an analysis of their relative influence. This will allow to identify who potentially
opposes the reform and, among them, who has enough decisive power to prevent it from being
implemented. Since there is no clear reform proposal on the table at this stage, the analysis is
fairly generic and relates to a general improvement in containment and emptying services.

Interest and influence can be scored and mapped onto a stakeholder matrix, as in Figure 13 below.
Although stakeholder matrices can help start a conversation about stakeholder engagement in
reform processes they have inherent limitations, e.g. it is not possible to be certain about how
different stakeholders would respond, stakeholders are not homogeneous, etc. In the matrix shown
below, the question of whether each stakeholder would support or oppose a move towards
developing full-scale containment and emptying practices in peri-urban Lima is considered, i.e. a
move towards preventing the construction of new, inadequate and non-emptiable pits and an
associated rise in the demand for emptying services. Their relative interest and influence to cause
or prevent such a change is assessed and scored on a scale from -10 to 10. Thus, a score of (-10,
-10) represents a stakeholder that strongly opposes the reform but has minimal influence. On the
contrary, a score of (10, 10) is representative of a stakeholder that shows strong support and is
also decisive for the reform to be implemented.

Figure 13 suggests that the majority of stakeholders would hold a neutral position, i. e. they would
not actively support or discourage a reform that enhances FSM services in poor peri-urban areas


                                                                                                                        54

in Lima. This is based on the general consensus conveyed across all KIIs that there would not be a
strong opposition against the development of formal FSM services, assuming that the reform
process is fair and actively engages all stakeholders, but is also a reflection of the current situation,
where FSM remains highly underdeveloped and there are no plans or investments in developing
the sector. All ministries, with the exception of the Ministry of Environment, would potentially take a
position of neutrality or indifference, and are highly influential. Their support may initially be
moderate, actively supporting changes to legislation to include FSM but possibly displaying some
caution for political reasons – for example, providing access to sewerage (and other basic
services) to poor peri-urban areas is usually advocated during elections, so a shift towards FSM
(especially if not regarded as an adequate medium- to long-term solution by households) may have
a political cost. Given that the Ministry of Housing, Construction and Sanitation has the main
responsibility for guaranteeing access to sanitation services, this entity is likely to be more
supportive as compared to the Ministry of Health, which would still perceive some benefits via a
potential reduction in water-related diseases. The Ministry of Environment might be slightly more
reticent to take an FSM reform forwards given that there are no clear and documented hazards to
the environment from poor use of on-site sanitation in peri-urban areas of Lima, and poor solid
waste management is a more predominant concern and complaint from poor households.

SEDAPAL was placed in an influential and supportive position, given its primary role in the
provision of water and sewerage, as well as its recent interest in exploring alternative options to
sewerage in poor peri-urban areas. SEDAPAL’s interest position is also conveying the current
situation, where they have had very little involvement in the development of FSM services to date,
which may be partly explained by the lack of explicit competencies for on-site sanitation, but also
due to the demand for sewerage exclusively on behalf of poor households. With regards to the
supervisory or regulatory agencies, OTASS has lower influence than SUNASS, given the nature of
its role and, similarly to the Ministry of Environment, it is likely to have a neutral interest in the
development of FSM services. SUNASS, on the other hand, being the main regulatory agency may
show some slight opposition to the development of FSM, partly due to the lack of clarity in the
allocation of responsibilities between SUNASS, OTASS and the Ministry of Housing (as regularly
mentioned in KIIs), but also because it will increase its regulatory burden and overall operational
costs.

At the local level, the Metropolitan Municipality of Lima also has significant influence (although
below that of national regulatory agencies), but may take a neutral position or potentially oppose
the introduction of FSM services, as they are currently trying to prevent migrants from settling in
‘inconvenient’ peri-urban areas, which the provision of FSM may counteract. Similarly, district
municipalities, although having some influence, may slightly oppose the development of FSM
services. This position is explained by their current lack of involvement in the development of FSM
and on-site sanitation alternatives, and their limited accountability to people living in peri-urban
areas. Indeed, when asked about the involvement of local leaders in ensuring the provision of
piped water and sanitation, most FGD participants mentioned that they have not received any
direct support from district municipalities, with local mayors usually making several promises during
elections, which remain unfulfilled after their time in office. Moreover, district municipalities
manifested their concerns with the lack of adequate planning and budgeting in the sanitation
sector, which may have a negative effect on their level of support if they foresee that the reform will
not materialise as planned.

Finally, NGOs and private stakeholders (service providers and households) generally have minimal
influence but are likely to be the ones with the highest interest in ensuring an FSM market is
developed given their widespread concerns with their pits potentially filling up and the lack of space
to build new ones, as well as their positive experiences with UDDTs (where available and
affordable) and reuse in the form of compost. In the particular case of NGOs (X-Runner and

                                                                                                       55
Fecal Sludge Management in Lima – Case Study Report


PEBAL), support may be moderate as they may be displaced or forced out of the market if other
tertiary/private service providers become widespread. On the contrary, current SWM service
providers may see their markets expand but may be cautious with SEDAPAL’s oversight and
control (e.g. will SEDAPAL allow for competition between SPs or will prices be pre-determined?
What will the contract between SPs and SEDAPAL entail with regards to fecal sludge transport to
treatment plants?). Finally, given that households without access to sewerage encompass 8% of
the total Lima population, they have very low visibility and influence, and while the majority are
likely to support the provision of on-site sanitation and FSM services (as manifested through FGDs
for both affordable UDDTs and pit emptying), some will still be reticent to accept these services
with a preference for traditional sewerage, especially if on-site sanitation alternatives are not
coupled with adequate water supply, which is also very deficient in peri-urban areas.41

In summary, the stakeholder matrix suggests that it is SEDAPAL who will have the decisive
influencing power over making FSM services happen in poor urban areas. Therefore, it is likely that
supporters of reform would do well to invest their time in working with SEDAPAL to move
proposals forward.


8.4       Illustrating the incentive problem
It is helpful to consider the problem of poor FSM in Lima in two dimensions. The first dimension is
static, that is, the way households, service providers and government stakeholders are currently
dealing with on-site sanitation and FSM (partly described in Table 23 above). The second
dimension is dynamic – the city is changing both spatially (e.g. people settling illegally in expanding
peri-urban areas) and demographically (urban population growth and inward migration). In terms of
policy, the static problem requires an action which could be implemented immediately but may
have a slow response over time – for example, there may be ways of persuading households to
improve the quality of their pits to minimise environmental and health hazards. The dynamic
problem, however, requires longer-term involvement and engagement in areas that are more the
domain of urban planning than sanitation policy and practice, e.g. ensuring that rural migrants
settle in adequate areas and that land titles are provided to encourage investment in private
sanitation facilities and allow for the provision of FSM services in these areas.

A useful tool to illustrate these problems is process mapping. This tool aims to understand the
interaction between formal and informal “steps” in a process, and identify entry points for
engagement. Similarly to the stakeholder matrix presented above, it is important to assess the
roles of the key stakeholders in a process, how and where they exert influence, and the incentives
they face in both formal and informal systems.

For this analysis, we have focussed on the process for dealing with a pit when it fills up, given the
predominance of this practice in poor non-sewered areas. This is shown in Figure 14 below. The
central column shows the formal process which is supposed to be followed by the household, while
the right column shows elements of the informal process, i.e. what really happens. Given that there
are no formal guidelines for containment and emptying, households cover the pits themselves with
whatever material and resources they have available, usually including lime, wood, stones, soil,
and in exceptional cases, cement. Many pits are also treated with muriatic acid to aid
decomposition and prevent overflow. After the pit is sealed, a new pit is built, if space permits.
There are increasing concerns from households with the lack of space to dig new pits on their plots
if the one in use fills up, with some people even reporting neighbours already digging their pits on
public dirt roads or green areas.

41
  FGDs revealed that some poor settlements rely on private tanker trucks for their water supply, which are generally
more expensive but also unreliable (e.g. service is not available when needed). Many households perceive their water to
be unsafe, and claim that the water has visible particles and a bad taste.

                                                                                                                    56
Fecal Sludge Management in Lima – Case Study Report


In terms of entry points, there are two potential ways in which the formal process could be
improved to discourage households from following the informal process. On one hand, training and
guidance could be provided on how to build and properly cover pits. Although some settlements
have benefited from training provided by SEDAPAL and NGOs, the majority of households learn
from their neighbours or relatives. A second entry point could be the introduction of affordable pit
emptying services or the extension of coverage of UDDTs, which have had good uptake on behalf
of poor non-sewered households. While the first entry point provides a ‘stop -gap’ solution,
minimising environmental and health hazards in the short-term, the second entry point is likely to
be a more sustainable alternative, improving the situation for poor urban dwellers in both the short-
and long-run.

Other key processes could be mapped to try and identify more entry points for the development of
FSM services. The main message is that informal processes, and the incentives which make them
happen, are crucial to understanding why good ideas do not always work out in practice.


8.5       Implications for FSM in Lima
This chapter has summarised aspects of the analysis conducted through key informant interviews
and focus group discussions by World Bank consultants to help explain why the CSDA looks as it
does, i. e. why there are no formal FSM services in Lima for poor non-sewered households. The
fact that the majority of the CSDA is red (i.e. FSM across the whole chain and at different stages is
poor) has precluded a focused look at key parts of the sanitation chain, which may be more
appropriate for other cities.

From a government perspective, at both local and central levels, it is crucial to allocate
competencies across different stakeholders and hold them accountable to specific targets and
budgets. Many of the KIIs suggest that unless responsibilities are clearly identified (for instance,
between the Ministry of Housing, OTASS and SUNASS), it is unlikely for central and local
governments, and regulatory agencies alike, to fully support the development of formal FSM
services in poor peri-urban areas. As described through the stakeholder mapping exercise, the
Ministry of Housing should probably have the responsibility for ensuring that appropriate FSM



                                                                                                             57
Fecal Sludge Management in Lima – Case Study Report


services exist, with SUNASS playing the main regulatory role, and SEDAPAL being the main
service provider.

Focussing on service provision and the development of an FSM market, it is crucial to minimise the
main blockages at both supply and demand. From the supply side, a pricing scheme needs to be
set up that allows for FSM services to be profitable SEDAPAL and/or for tertiary/private sector
stakeholders, but at the same time affordable for poor peri-urban households. FGDs suggest that
households are likely to be more willing to pay small amounts on a monthly basis (as they do for
other public services) rather than a single and relatively high fee upon emptying. On the other
hand, from the demand side, households’ practice of digging a new pit once the one in use fills up
needs to change through formal training and guidelines, and enforced through legislation related to
fecal sludge containment and emptying. Households are already manifesting their concerns with
the lack of space to continue digging pits in the future, so they are definitely open to sustainable
and affordable alternatives to solve their sanitation needs. Based on the stakeholder mapping
exercise, SEDAPAL seems to be the most obvious candidate for service provision, with a
progressive involvement of the tertiary/private sector as required.

To address the “so what” questions, which are often a response to this kind of analysis, the next
section considers potential intervention options in the context of the above analysis.




                                                                                                  58

9         Intervention options
This section proposes interventions to improve fecal sludge management services for poor non-
sewered areas of Lima and provide an effective enabling environment within which those services
can be appropriately developed and sustainably managed. These interventions are mainly
informed by the assessment carried out by SEDAPAL and WSP through the Reimbursable
Advisory Services (RAS) in Lima and the results of the household survey data, the SFDs and the
CSDA described earlier.

To support planning decisions for improving FSM services over time, this chapter starts by
referring back to key results responding to the question “Where are we now?” using the fecal waste
flow diagrams as a means to illustrate the key challenges. It then goes on to propose responses to
the question “Where do we want to get to?” that acknowledge components of the enabling
environment, current studies and ongoing sectoral reforms, as well as good practice and relevant
experience from elsewhere.

Addressing the next question “How do we want to get there?” is a further process that requires
strong leadership at the city level, engagement of city authorities and key stakeholders, detailed
studies and analysis to identify specific plans and solutions that can support an incremental and
strategic planning approach.


9.1       Identified weaknesses
The key starting point for presenting weaknesses in the existing services for poor non-sewered
areas in Lima is the fecal waste flow diagram, as this identifies the extent to which fecal sludge is
managed (or not) through the current sanitation service chains. From this diagram, “problems” or
“weaknesses” in the process of managing fecal sludge at the key stages in the chain can be
highlighted (see Figure 15 below), pointing to where interventions are needed to improve the status
quo.

9.2       Proposed solutions
Through the RAS, a decision tree was developed (see Figure 16 below) to assess possible
intervention options. The decision tree aims to (i) identify the communities that need to be
prioritised; (ii) assess the financial and technical feasibility of interventions in priority communities,
and (iii) identify household preferences to be included in the design of alternative WSS solutions.
Potential interventions should be designed to minimise water wastage, be more profitable than
conventional solutions (i. e. sewerage), be able to be fully implemented in the short-run, and be
flexible enough to meet the needs of households and adapt to their ability to pay.

Figure 16         Decision tree for WSS services in Lima




The first step of the decision tree is to identify the communities to be intervened (i.e. community
meets the selection criteria). Based on discussions with SEDAPAL, the criteria for community
selection include:

        There are no plans for the extension of the sewerage network in the next five years, and/or
         no national plans for investment in the area.

                                                                                                        60
Fecal Sludge Management in Lima – Case Study Report


        Land is legally occupied and physically accessible.

        Local authorities are required and willing to support the interventions proposed.

        Population density is above the required minimum, increasing the likelihood of financial
         feasibility.

If the community or area of intervention meets the selection criteria, both the technical and financial
feasibility of the project need to be assessed – this includes investment, operational and
maintenance costs. Tariff levels and costs of services are to be assessed in coordination with
SUNASS, the main regulatory agency.

Subsequently, if the solution is technically and financially feasible, a participatory planning needs to
be carried out, enabling a direct dialogue between SEDAPAL, SUNASS, other key stakeholders,
and community members. The objective of this step is to understand the current status of WSS
services (i.e. initial diagnosis), define the activities to be carried out and the competencies of each
stakeholder involved, and finally, identify and select the best management model (considering
services decentralisation, focusing on the client, and public, community, private/tertiary or joint
public-private management). A social agreement or covenant will finally be established between
SEDAPAL and the community to ensure the accountability of service provision and management.

Although there are several options that can be used for the provision of alternative WSS services,
SEDAPAL aims to provide services that are efficient, able to create economies of scale, and allow
for the participation of the tertiary/private sector. Three different interventions have been
considered:

    1. On-site FS containment and greywater disposal, with FS emptying and transport services
       provided by tanker trucks (i.e. mechanical emptying), discharge at a FS treatment plant and
       compost and/or fertilizer production (S1);

    2. Small community or condominial sewerage system, with decentralised wastewater
       treatment plants and wastewater reuse in green areas (S2), and

    3. UDDTs with on-site greywater disposal and specialised FS treatment with compost and/or
       fertilizer production (similar to current X-Runner services) (S3).

The decision tree for these options is depicted in Figure 17 below, providing an initial assessment
of where these options might be suitable across peri-urban areas of Lima.




                                                                                                      61
Fecal Sludge Management in Lima – Case Study Report


Figure 17         Decision tree for alternative sanitation services




Considering also SFD and CSDA, the key messages for action through the service chain are:

        Containment: Increase the availability of affordable options for improved non-networked
         containment quality (including pit lining materials, twin-pit, UDDTs), to eventually bring to an
         end the practice of abandoning simple pits. Increase skill-sets of artisans and builders to
         ensure quality construction, as well as public awareness and practices affecting appropriate
         management of latrine pits to ease emptying (e.g. separate disposal options for greywater
         and solid waste). As decentralised networked options become available in low-income
         areas, facilitate connecting households to these systems, with separate handling of
         blackwater and greywater.

        Emptying and transport: Increase the availability of a range of small- and medium-sized
         service operators emptying pit contents (urine, dried feces and/or fecal sludge). Support
         service providers with a range of technical improvements to manual/mechanised pumps,
         tankers and transport vehicles suited to the topography, space limitations and affordability
         of low-income areas.

        Treatment and reuse: Identify a range of technologies and application suited to various
         locations and the up-stream service functions. For example; anaerobic baffle reactors, up-
         flow anaerobic sludge blankets, fecal sludge drying beds, reed bed systems, lagoons, etc.
         where sufficient households are connected to decentralised sewer networks; composting
         facilities where households are serviced by dry non-networked systems such as twin-pit,
         twin-vault or container-based latrines (with or without urine diversion). The choice of
         technology and locations should account for the market-potential from end-use of
         wastewater, treated fecal sludge, urine, dried feces and associated effluent discharges.

                                                                                                       62

For any service option, the choice and implementation must adopt an integrated approach through
the full service chain. This means taking account of the need for sufficient and reliable water
supplies, solid waste management services and drainage networks to ensure optimal sanitation
service provision during operation, maintenance and management of each option. Each stage of
the service chain must also account for the range of physical and institutional constraints
necessary to provide citizens with a reliable service that protects both public and environmental
health. These include tenancy and land ownership, topography and space, affordability, capacity
and resources to deliver and sustain service functions.

Table 24 below sets out specific technical interventions, whereas the sections following the table
consider interventions more related to the enabling environment. The options in the table are not
necessarily mutually exclusive and in presenting the “Where do we want to get to?” they do not
specify interim or staged approaches. These are discussed in the following section.

9.3       Program design and prioritisation
Based on the analysis of broader findings from the FSM study, the following sub-sections consider
the key areas of the Enabling Environment (as defined and grouped within the City Service
Delivery Assessment of the Enabling, Developing and Sustaining components) and identify actions
to support any infrastructure-focused investments in the poor non-sewered settlements of Lima.
While drawing on the CSDA results, these sections also account for good practice and relevant
experience from elsewhere.

9.3.1     Enabling: policy, planning and budget

Policy – There is a complete absence of policy relating to FSM, which requires reviewing existing
policy and incorporating FSM as a first step (for instance, in the Law for Solid Waste
Management). This will need a strong commitment from national and local level stakeholders (e.g.
MoHCS, SUNASS, Lima Metropolitan Municipality), as scale of FSM services is currently
extremely limited and universal coverage with sewerage by 2017 is the present target.

Regulation – Legislation for FSM exists in the form of general laws (such as the SEDAPAL
byelaws under Title 1, Article 2) addressing removal of feces from latrines and septic tanks; but
without the scale of services, application and enforcement are likely to be extremely weak. It will be
necessary to review existing regulation to strengthen it in view of a proposed expansion of FSM
services.

Institutional roles – Current legislation does not clearly define competencies for all sector
stakeholders, which hinder the development of FSM policy and services. As mentioned in the PFC
chapter, both planning and budgeting are unlikely to happen if responsibilities are not allocated and
there is no accountability for investments and results. Although there are some mechanisms for
support to private service providers (e.g. operation under a competitive market, regulatory
frameworks), these are unlikely to have much impact on actual service provision, especially for the
urban poor. More active involvement from SEDAPAL in bringing both public and private
stakeholders together to develop a joint framework for FSM is highly recommended. This should
be complemented by a revision of existing legislation to ensure it enables more flexible and
responsive services, while addressing minimum service standards to protect public health through
the stages of the FSM service chain.

Service provision and planning – The National Urban Sanitation Programme does not show an
obvious commitment to expand or develop the scope of on-site sanitation options or FSM services,
with sewerage being considered as the first-best and long-term option for urban areas. Only once
political commitment is oriented towards the development of FSM, will plans and capacity needs be
adequately acknowledged and addressed.

Budget – There are no budgetary arrangements identified that are specifically for FSM services in
urban areas. This will require attention along with policy and planning reviews to identify the scale
of financing required and potential sources.

9.3.2     Developing: equity and outputs

Choice / reducing inequity – There is almost a total absence of FSM service options for residents
of poor non-sewered areas. Containment facilities are poorly constructed and managed with no
enforcement of standards to prevent this from happening. There needs to be much greater
attention to incentives for households to improve latrine quality, with associated incentives
developed for SEDAPAL and other emptying service providers so they can offer a range of

                                                                                                    66
Fecal Sludge Management in Lima – Case Study Report


affordable, responsive and safe services to those who demand them. A greater understanding of
community-level needs and wants, as well as household willingness and ability to pay for different
service levels is also required.

Outputs – The fecal waste flow diagram (SFD) highlights a total absence of safe and effective
services for the whole of the service chain. This requires technical assistance for all stages of
service delivery that address the technical interventions mentioned in Table 24, as well as
supporting capacity development of institutions and agencies that will be responsible to deliver
them. It will also require attention to training of artisans, builders and entrepreneurs in a range of
available options, as well as public information and marketing to promote. Sources of committed
financing for this also need to be identified, as well as regular monitoring of achievements against
improved service coverage targets, indicators and standards.

9.3.3     Sustaining: O&M, expansion and service outcomes

Cost recovery and standards – Again, all stages of the service chain need to be addressed with
appreciation of costs affecting households and service providers. Options for financial transfers
also need to be considered (e.g. water bill surcharge, environmental tax), ensuring that charges
reflect the level of service received by the customer, i.e. those with a lower service level, should
pay less. This will likely need an incremental approach to achieving service standards, phased
over time and adopting a realistic, doable attitude.

Demand and sector development – Demand for services is almost non-existent, reflected by the
lack of FSM actors and little government attention to the scale of the problem. Sector development
needs to come first, with improved service options available, marketed and more widely applied
(probably with initial external financial support and “friendly” regulation to allow more actors to
enter the market), before demand achieves any significant level for service options to become self-
sustaining.

9.3.4     Resulting prioritised interventions: guidelines for action

Considering the results from the CSDA and PFC (Sections 7 and 8 respectively), it is possible to
recommend where actions are most needed in relation to the non-technical components of the
enabling environment (such as policy and planning, institutional arrangements, capacity and
financing), to support technical responses.

For such actions to be effective, recommended interventions must respond to how well developed
the enabling environment currently is. Based on the assessed status of FSM service development
using these tools, the following Service Delivery Action Framework tables present a range of non-
technical, ‘institutional’ interventions. Actions are grouped according to the current status of the
enabling environment: Basic, Intermediate or Consolidating.

The set of recommended actions have been developed from good practice and informed by the
experience of the authors in relation to the enabling environment for urban sanitation. They are
tailored to how well developed the enabling environment currently is, with a view to strengthening
it. As the actions account for the current realities in a city, they must be recognised as essentially
sequential and should be viewed as dynamic; that is, actions are proposed as being at the Basic
stage before moving towards the Intermediate, then the Consolidating stages. Where a city is
identified to already be delivering FSM service needs from one of these stages, the resulting set of
actions are taken from the ‘next stage’.




                                                                                                    67

The recommended sets of actions are shown within the boxes that have a bold outline
                                                                                            ‘Action’
and shading.

As progress is made through these stages, actions can shift from being mainly about identifying,
reviewing or building awareness of services, through to actions that are more about establishing,
strengthening and promoting commitment to services, and on towards actions that are about
strengthening, consolidating and expanding engagement to achieve a more sustainable range of
enhanced services. The actions also move from prioritising public health protection (which may
include developing temporary measures), to ensuring the protection of the environment and
looking at the potential for the reuse of fecal sludge end products. In the case of Lima, it is clear
that a strong focus must be on providing the poor with a range of options to eliminate the continued
practice of digging informal, unlined pits and abandoning them when full, or allowing blackwater to
discharge directly into the environment. The implications for risk to health and environmental
contamination are significant, while interventions must ensure sanitation services are ensured
throughout the service chain.

The actions proposed in Table 25 below, considering services to the poor non-sewered areas of
Lima, are all within the stage of basic actions. Such basic actions ¡Error! No se encuentra el
origen de la referencia.are considered to be appropriate within the context of an almost total
absence of attention to FSM services at the time of the study, although the scale and significance
of the challenges faced do appear to have been gaining increasing political attention. They are
considered appropriate to address the increasing likelihood of public health risks resulting from a
failure to address FSM service limitations, were the conditions in the enabling environment
identified during the study to continue as they are currently.

10        Economic analysis of intervention options
Nb. The technology costing is based exclusively on secondary data. All costs and benefits are
given at the HH level, since the secondary data was not suitable for extrapolating population-level
estimates of the costs and benefits.


10.1      Introduction
This chapter provides an analysis of four possible sanitation intervention options for the low-
income non-sewered areas of Lima. The analysis spans the whole sanitation chain (i.e.
containment, emptying, transport, treatment and reuse), and is broken down by cost component,
allowing a detailed view of the points in the chain where the costs are incurred.

Two key pieces of information were required to conduct this analysis. Firstly, an estimate of the
damage cost, which assigns a monetary value to the negative consequences of poor sanitation,
i.e. “the cost of doing nothing”. Secondly, an estimate of the costs of the proposed intervention.
This requires a clear intervention design for a well-defined population, and sufficient information
that allows for each component to be costed.


10.2      Methodology
Four hypothetical models are presented in this analysis: three are based on secondary data from
existing literature on sanitation in Lima, while the remaining one draws from the reported costs of a
specific programme intervention. Costs were updated to reflect inflation to date and were estimated
for each component and at each stage of the sanitation chain.

The damage costing is based on the health-related costs associated with diarrhoeal incidence and
treatment only. The unit of analysis for all interventions is the household.

All costs are presented as annualised costs per HH. Annualisation was conducted using a
standard formula (see below) which incorporates a discount rate r1 that represents the opportunity
cost of capital.




The choice of a discount rate is a key parameter of the costing. The higher the discount rate, the
higher the opportunity cost of capital and consequently, the higher the annualised costs. However,
the discount rate does not affect the ratios between different cost options. A discount rate of 6%
was used here as this is the long term rate of CPI inflation in Peru. The World Bank uses a rate of
10% for infrastructure projects.

All of the analysis was conducted using the Economics of Sanitation Initiative (ESI). As such, many
of the assumptions used in the damage costing are based on the ESI’s standard settings.

10.3      Data sources
The primary source of data for this analysis was Platzer et al (2008), a study that presents three
hypothetical sanitation interventions for areas of Lima without sanitation access. Interventions were
modelled on a target population of 10,000 and draw on cost data specific to Lima. Two waterborne
(i.e. sewer based) systems and one UDDT model with centralised collection and treatment were
considered. The study also analyses the costs of providing an improved water supply in
conjunction with the different sanitation options (as was similarly done in the RAS), and their
comparative costs. Given the focus of our research on FSM, we have not considered the costs of
providing an improved water supply, although we acknowledge that it is unlikely for sewerage to be
provided without an improved water connection.

The costs derived by Platzer et al (2008) were updated to reflect inflation to date and have been
disaggregated into the different cost categories used by the ESI (i.e. CapEx, CapManEx, and
recurrent costs) and the different stages of the sanitation chain. CPI inflation as reported in the
World Bank’s world development indicators was used. The analysis also draws on the household
survey data collected as part of this study. The probability of death by disease is drawn from the
WHO Global Burden of Disease data (for additional information, see WHO, 2012).


10.4      Hypothetical intervention options
The four intervention options considered in the analysis are the following:

    1)       A full on-site solution – Urine Diverting Dry Toilets (UDDTs) with on-site
             composting

This option encompasses the installation of a twin vault UDDT system with urine and greywater
infiltration. Costs are based on the reported average construction costs incurred by the Peru-based
NGO Rotaria del Peru. Rotaria has installed over 800 UDDT systems in Peru. Each UDDT
constructed is individual and made from locally available materials. In many cases, the latrine is
designed to be upgraded by the addition of showers and a full bathroom.

    2)       A waterborne system with treatment through an anaerobic lagoon

Under this option, all households have a pour-flush latrine connected to a sewage network. The
model assumes pre-treatment is carried out with an anaerobic lagoon followed by manual grit
removal, and secondary treatment in facultative and maturation lagoons. The hypothetical model is
devised for a population of 10,000 households assuming that the lagoon treatment serves a wider
population of 200,000 households. Annex A contains some of the key design specifications for this
model.

Treatment via lagoons is not recommended by Platzer et al (2008) as open lagoons have severe
odour problems. However, this option was included as a lower bound estimate for a waterborne
system, as anaerobic pre-treatment is comparatively cheaper than other options.

    3)       A waterborne system with primary treatment by up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket
             reactors (UASBs) and secondary treatment through lagoons

This option has the same specifications as Option 2 above, with the exception that pre-treatment is
given by UASB reactors as opposed to anaerobic lagoons. The design population for the sewer
network is 10,000 households, and the treatment design assumes a population of 40,000
households.


                                                                                                   72
Fecal Sludge Management in Lima – Case Study Report


     4)      UDDTs with semi-centralised collection and treatment

This model assumes that all households have UDDTs. The difference from Option 1 is that this
model is based on single-vault UDDTs that are emptied by a municipal operator on a quarterly
basis. Urine is stored on-site and is also collected quarterly. This design considers trucks that have
been adapted to collect urine and feces simultaneously. The costs quoted also include the
construction costs for greywater infiltration pits. The design population is 10,000 households.


10.5      Design populations
The existing sanitation infrastructure and coverage is used as the base for costing the hypothetical
interventions. Table 26 presents the results for the lowest-income non-sewered areas of Lima.

In all of the four intervention options considered, the route down the sanitation chain requires the
majority of household to build/purchase a new sanitation facility. However, given the current type of
sanitation facilities owned by households (Table 26), some of the costs were lowered – for the two
options based on UDDTs, none of the costs were lowered as the construction of UDDTs requires
an overhaul of all existing infrastructure. For the two waterborne options considered, 50% of the
costs of the latrine (excluding the sewer connection) were lowered for the 28% of the population
with either a cistern or pour/manual flush.42

As described above, the four options are all costed for slightly different design populations
(households served). It is not proposed that any one of these options is suitable for the entire non-
sewered population; rather, costs should be considered as indicative per household costs.


10.6      Technology cost analysis
Figure 18 presents the total annualised costs for the three routes through the sanitation chain that
are proposed in the Platzer et al (2008) study. For more information, Annex F contains a summary
table with the data underscoring these calculations. Overall, the UDDT collection model has the
lowest total cost per household. The waterborne system with primary treatment by anaerobic
lagoons is only marginally more expensive than the UDDT collection option. The fully onsite option
is the most expensive overall.

In all cases the cost of the on-site facility (i.e. the latrine and blackwater containment system used
by the household) is the largest component of the costs. In the case of the fully on-site UDDT

42
  This assumption assumes that the above ground component would be adapted as opposed to constructed from
scratch.

                                                                                                            73

system, all of the costs are related to containment, while for the semi-centralised collection system,
costs include on-site urine storage and greywater infiltration pits, both of which are key drivers of
the total costs. In the case of the waterborne systems, costs are driven by the connection to the
sewer network, which is given as a fixed cost and accounts for 75% of the containment costs.
Figure 18 presents the total annualised costs for the four intervention options.

As mentioned previously, despite the high containment costs, the UDDT collection option
intervention is comparatively cheaper overall than the two waterborne options. The emptying and
transport costs associated with the sewer-based options mainly encompass the costs of laying and
maintaining the sewer network from the household service line to the treatment facility. These
costs are roughly twice the costs associated with the emptying and transport for the UDDT options.

The remaining of this section presents the costs for three of the four interventions options,
disaggregated by type of cost (i.e. CapEx, CapManEx, and recurrent costs). Figure 19 below
presents the annualised costs of the four options and the stages at which they are incurred along
the sanitation chain, as well as the cost components of the expenditures.

For the UDDT fully on-site option, the annualised onsite CapEx costs are extremely high relative to
the other options: just over S/.331 (~US $101) compared to a range of between ~S/.100 – S/.160
(~US $30 – $50) as all costs are incurred in the construction of the sanitation facility (i.e.
containment).

The sewer-based option with primary treatment by an anaerobic lagoon entails heavy capital
investment for each part of the chain – at least 60% of the total cost incurred over the lifecycle of
the infrastructure. For this option, the treatment costs are lower than those for containment,
emptying and transport. It has been included as a lower bound estimate for a waterborne system,
as primary treatment with anaerobic lagoons are comparatively cheap. In the case of the UASB
option, the costs of treatment are higher than the costs of containment, emptying and transport –
this is the only system for which this is the case. Again, capital expenditure remains the largest
component of the costs across all stages of the sanitation chain.

For the UDDT dry collection model, the costs are mainly associated with containment, given that
they include the construction of a greywater soakaway and urine storage. The greywater soakaway
itself accounts for 57% of the on-site capital investment. Unlike the sewer-based options, recurrent
costs encompass a higher proportion of total costs, especially at emptying, transport and treatment
stages of the sanitation chain. As a proportion of annualised costs, recurrent costs are around 51%
of the total costs at emptying and transport stages. On the contrary, for the sewer-based system
with primary treatment with a UASB reactor, recurrent costs are only 20% of total annualised costs.


10.7      Damage costs and cost-effectiveness analysis
The damage costing analyses the out-of-pocket expenditure and productivity losses, as well as the
costs related to premature loss of life, due to diarrhoea. The data for the damage costs associated
to diarrhoeal incidence and out of pocket expenditures were drawn from the household survey data
collected through this study. Data for the damage costs associated with premature loss were
drawn from the WHO global burden of disease estimates. It should be emphasised that this is a
limited damage costing and represents only the costs of poor sanitation associated with diarrhoeal
disease. Table 27 presents the annualised costs per household. Damage costs are given in
absolute terms and as a proportion of GDP.

Table 28 presents the data on the cost of avoiding deaths and illnesses related to diarrhoea. There
is an emerging consensus that if the cost per DALY averted is less than three times annual GDP
per capita, it may be considered cost-effective, while any intervention that costs less than total
annual GDP per capita is highly cost effective (Marseille et al, 2014). The values presented in
Table 28 assume that half of the damage costs are averted due to the intervention. Under this
assumption, all of the interventions are cost-effective as they cost between 1.5 times (UDDT) and 2
times (Waterborne – UASB) annual GDP per capita. The interventions fall out of the cost-

10.8      Concluding remarks
The technology cost analysis reflects the findings of the Platzer et al (2008) in that the FSM option
entailing the collection and semi-centralised treatment of fecal waste is comparatively more cost
effective than the two conventional sewer-based options proposed. Through annualising these
cost, and estimating where along the sanitation chain they are incurred, it is clear that the driving
force behind this is the considerably lower costs associated with the transport and treatment of
fecal waste.

Despite the differences in the technology costs, and based on a limited damage costing, all of the
proposed intervention options are cost-effective by international standards. It is only by assuming
the interventions mitigate less than 3% – 25% of the damage cost that cost-effectiveness no longer
holds.

11        Conclusion
This study has identified several key challenges in ensuring the continued provision of safe
sanitation services in peri-urban areas of Lima. Besides increasing urbanisation rates, one of the
main issues in Lima is the relatively low visibility of sanitation issues for the urban poor, as only 8%
of the city’s population relies on on-site sanitation, with the majority of citizens having access to
sewerage. Other concerns relate to the type of terrain inhabited by the urban poor, mainly hilly and
rocky or sandy areas that are difficult to access and where building adequate sanitation facilities is
generally costly (both in terms of time and capital investments). In addition, most of these areas
have been illegally inhabited, and although land tenure has progressively been granted, many
households are at risk of getting evicted, which generally discourages expenditures on improving
housing conditions.

Furthermore, the very few available FSM services only service public institutions (schools,
hospitals, etc.) and wealthier households, which can guarantee payment. Given the lack of
knowledge about the size of the demand for FS emptying and transport services and the risk of no-
payment on behalf of poor households, private/tertiary sector providers are unwilling to invest in
the development of an FSM market. As has been pointed out at several instances across this study
and the RAS, SEDAPAL should naturally have the responsibility for the provision of FSM services,
ensuring their integration with all other WSS conventional services, with the private/tertiary sector
(e.g. SWM firms) potentially intervening as sub-contractors.

Given the inexistence of a FSM market for the urban poor, priority should be given to the following:

     1. Ensuring adequate containment facilities are built and maintained by households – besides
        encouraging the use of FS emptying and transport services, improved containment will also
        minimise issues with the lack of space to build additional pits as well as health hazards
        related to poor sealing of full pits.

     2. FSM and on-site sanitation alternatives need to be properly included in policy and planning
        documents, and a specific budget should be allocated to ensure that FSM services are
        provided. Given that SEDAPAL’s conventional WSS services will not reach many of the
        households living in peri-urban areas in the next 5 to 10 years (if not more), FSM needs to
        be considered as a medium- to long-term option for peri-urban communities. Although
        SEDAPAL’s upcoming pilot is a good starting point, FSM services will only be scalable if a
        supportive enabling environment is in place.

     3. Part of the profitability of FSM markets originates from the possibility of reusing treated FS.
        Currently, the Peruvian legislation considers FS as a toxic waste, which limits exclusive FS
        treatment and prohibits FS reuse. This may eventually become an important barrier for the
        sustainability of FSM services, and is currently an impediment for NGOs, like X-Runner,
        which are having to store their end-products indefinitely.

     4. Sensitisation at all levels (community, local authorities, national authorities) will be key
        when planning to carry out on-site sanitation interventions as there is a bias (as is the case
        for most of Latin America) towards sewerage in urban areas. On-site sanitation is generally
        seen as a long-term alternative only for rural areas, with urban dwellers only considering
        piped water and sewerage as their options (e.g. all of X-Runner’s clients consider UDDTs
        as a short-term alternative and they are all waiting for SEDAPAL to provide conventional
        services).

SEDAPAL (with the support of the World Bank) is considering different alternatives to improve
coverage in peri-urban areas. These are:

                                                                                                      78
Fecal Sludge Management in Lima – Case Study Report


        On-site FS containment and greywater disposal, with FS emptying and transport services
         provided by tanker trucks (i.e. mechanical emptying), discharge at a FS treatment plant and
         compost and/or fertilizer production;

        Small community or condominial sewerage system, with decentralised wastewater
         treatment plants and wastewater reuse in green areas, and

        UDDTs with on-site greywater disposal and specialised FS treatment with compost and/or
         fertilizer production.

How and where these interventions are actually taken forwards will depend on the pilot outcome
and the characteristics of the different peri-urban settlements. Besides the priority areas listed
above, active engagement from all sector stakeholders through continuous consultations is an
imperative if these alternatives are to become a reality for the urban poor.

B.1        Overall design
A key component of this study was primary data collection, since it aimed to build on an earlier 12-
city FSM study based only on secondary data (Peal & Evans, 2013). The study had six different
data collection instruments, four quantitative and two qualitative, each of which contribute to
various project components shown in Table 1 in the introduction of this report. These instruments
are summarised in Table 29 below.

The overall design decided by WSP was that the OPM/WEDC team should lead on methodology
and analysis, while actual data collection would be managed by two types of consultants
contracted separately. A local firm, Akut Peru, was contracted by WSP to conduct primary data
collection under all of the above instruments, except for the Key Informant Interviews. In addition, a
short-term consultant (Eng. Ruddy Noriega) was contracted to conduct the Key Informant
Interviews and produce a draft of the Service Delivery Assessment and Prognosis for Change.

Household survey

The household survey aimed to collect data from households using on-site sanitation (particularly
those living in informal or low-income settlements) regarding their use of FSM services and
preferences for future FSM services. The household survey informs multiple components of this
research. The sampling was carefully planned so as to allow representative conclusions to be
drawn from non-sewered households in low sewerage coverage areas of Lima Metropolitan Area 44,
and separate conclusions for lowest-income non-sewered areas45 in particular, on a purposive
basis. Questionnaire sections included a household roster, dwelling characteristics, use of water
and sanitation infrastructure, usability and observation of latrines, satisfaction and planning on
sanitation, and pit / septic tank filling up and emptying.

Observation of service provider practices

The observation protocol involved making visual inspections about fecal sludge from pits or tanks
to final disposal, in particular watching service providers (SPs) go about their business.
Observations required the identification of hazards, hazardous events, and an assessment of
possible risks at each stage (containment, emptying, transport, treatment and end-use or disposal)
of the fecal sludge management chain. However, given the limited scope of FSM services in Lima,
observations mainly focussed on the containment and emptying stages of the chain.

Testing fecal sludge characteristics

The characteristics of fecal sludge will vary, depending on many factors including, but not limited
to, the length of time for which it has been stored, the season, and the storage conditions (e.g.
whether the sludge was in a lined or unlined pit). Assessment of the characteristics was performed
in (i) latrines / pits currently being used, (ii) abandoned pits, (iii) urine-diverting (UD) sanitation
facilities, and (iv) during removal, as this will influence the removal methods that could be used.

Transect walk

The transect walk enabled participants to make a subjective and qualitative assessment of the
physical and environmental conditions within a community. During the walk, participants make
systematic observations, discuss them and record their findings using a standard reporting format.
The information collected complements data from household questionnaires, observations, and
sample collection and analysis. For this study, a transect walk provides information about the
broad environmental risks to public health, in particular with respect to the presence of fecal
material and solid waste, and the likelihood that these enter drainage channels and water sources.
When all observations are complete, participants ask community members a few short questions to
gain information about typical behaviours in the community that could be a source of risk (e.g.
latrines discharging to drains, overflowing latrines, illegal dumping of fecal sludge, etc.) and the
frequency of those behaviours throughout the year (e.g. daily, weekly, seasonal, etc.). These walks
were designed to give an overall picture of conditions in a neighbourhood – they did not aim to
allow detailed maps to be drawn with fecal sludge flows to be physically tracked, nor did they aim
to make operational recommendations at the neighbourhood level.




44
   In the other case country studies, sampling was designed to draw representative conclusions for the city as a whole,
and lowest-income non-sewered areas in particular. However, Lima has a very high sewerage coverage (estimated at
92% in 2012), so to be able to assess FSM services, the study focussed on the low sewerage coverage areas of the city,
i.e. 22 districts where sewerage coverage was below 90% in 2007.
45
   Lowest-income areas were selected based on national poverty levels (i.e. districts with a poverty index level above
20%).

                                                                                                                    83
Fecal Sludge Management in Lima – Case Study Report


Testing water supply and drain water quality

During transect walks, samples of drinking water supplies and water flowing in irrigation channels
and greywater deposits or puddles were taken from a selection of UALs in the city and tested for
levels of E. coli. The results help to identify the extent to which there is an association between
poor FSM services and resulting levels of fecal contamination in the local environment (i.e. in water
supplies, irrigation channels, etc.). This information, together with results from transect walk
observations, reported sanitation behaviours and practices in the community and other data
sources, helps build-up a picture of the public health risks associated with poor FSM services,
related to contamination levels (hazard), exposure and vulnerability.

Key informant interviews

Key informant interviews (KIIs) are the way in which primary information was sought to address
key questions about how both the ‘enabling environment’ and the operating environment affects
FSM services (past, current and future). KIIs were held with stakeholders having responsibility or
interest in FSM services at city-level and beyond, allowing the enabling and operating
environments to be better understood in relation to their influence within the city.

Focus group discussions

The objective of focus group discussions (FGDs) with residents of informal settlements was to
gather qualitative data that would complement, validate, or perhaps challenge responses made
during the household survey. Questions focused on obtaining information relating to household
sanitation and FSM practices (particularly identifying the prac tices of “others”, as individuals are
reluctant to talk honestly about their own, or their families’ practices), service levels, past
interventions, risks and other issues associated with FSM services that affect their community.

B.2      Sampling
B.2.1 Household survey

The main sampling method design was for the household survey, with the sampling approaches for
other instruments using the selected clusters as a basis. Therefore, the household survey is
discussed first, and the remaining instruments are covered afterwards. Overall, it is crucial to
understand that in the sampling, two pictures were being sought: the first to give an understanding
of the situation of non-sewered households in (1) low sewerage coverage areas of Lima, and (2) a
specific understanding of the situation in lowest-income areas.

Given the high level of sewerage coverage in Lima, Peru, the study population were non-sewered
households in the city located in areas where sewerage coverage was below 90%, as reported in
the 2007 National Census. This encompasses 314,087 households in 22 urban districts within the
boundaries of Lima Metropolitan Area (i.e. Lima and Callao municipalities), here on referred to as
‘Lima’. These districts are listed below in Table 30.

There were two sub-sample areas (denoted A and B). Sub-sample A was representative of non-
sewered areas in districts that had less than 90% sewerage coverage in 2007 – which are referred
to across the report as ‘non-sewered areas’ – while sub-sample B focused on the lowest-income
non-sewered households. Sub-sample B is not representative as households were purposively
selected to be able to locate and focus on the most vulnerable on-site sanitation users. The aim of
sub-sample A was to get estimates for non-sewered households in low sewerage coverage urban
areas at minimum cost and administrative burden. Hence, the sample has a relatively small sample
size, for example compared to what would be necessary for studies with different objectives (e.g.
an evaluation aiming to attribute impact to a specific sanitation intervention).

Sub-samples and sampling units

For sub-sample A, the Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) were districts and the Secondary Sampling
Units (SSUs) were Secciones Censales46 or census tracts47. Lists of districts and census tracts
were collected from National Institute of Statistics and Information (INEI).


46
   A census tract is equivalent to part of or a complete Unidad Administrativa Local (UAL). An UAL is an administrative
unit akin to “urban neighbourhoods”.
47
   In a household survey, households are the sampling unit we are interested in, but it is difficult and expensive to sample
1,000 households from across a city completely randomly, as you would potentially have to go to 1,000 different
localities. Therefore, most surveys take an intermediary approach using clusters of households. This approach has three

For sub-sample B, households were chosen based on three different criteria: (1) UAL is one of
SEDAPAL’s (Lima’s utility) priority areas; (2) obse rved poverty and (3) not connected to sewerage.
Areas prioritised by SEDAPAL are those that are unlikely to gain access to sewerage in the next
four years, which encompass 33 Unidades Administrativas Locales (UALs). The poverty status of
the household was determined based on road characteristics, access to public services (i.e.
electricity, water and sewerage), and dwelling characteristics. The focus of the sample were
asentamientos humanos (i.e. human settlements) in both rocky and sandy peri-urban areas of
Lima48.

Finally, the Tertiary Sampling Units (TSUs) were households, in both cases.

A map showing the location of sampled district and SSUs within districts is shown in Annex A.

Sample sizes

Given that in both sub-samples, the sampling is purposive (i.e. in sub-sample A, the focus is non-
sewered households and in sub-sample B the focus is lowest-income non-sewered households),
there is no specific level of confidence. To be consistent with other city case studies, the sample
size for each sub-sample was 360 households, giving a total number of 720 households surveyed
across both sub-samples.

Sampling methodology

Sub-sample A – non-sewered areas

A three-stage sampling approach was followed. In the first stage, 10 districts/PSUs were sampled
from the 22 districts with a sewerage coverage below 90% using probability proportionate to size
(PPS), listed in Table 30 above. In the second stage of sampling, 30 census tracts were randomly
selected from the PSUs (i.e. 3 per district). This can legitimately be called a non-sewered sample
of census tracts of low-sewerage coverage areas of Lima.

Households (TSUs) were sampled using systematic random sampling. Each supervisor and
enumerator was given a map of the UAL divided into twelve equally-sized blocks. Upon arrival to
the first block (previously selected by Akut), the enumerator surveyed the first house (starting from
the northeast corner of the block and walking in a clockwise direction). After completing the first
survey, the enumerator jumped the following 4 houses, and interviewed the next one (i.e. the 6 th
house). The enumerator followed this ‘jump system’ until 12 questionnaires were completed49.

In cases where the household did not wish to participate, it was replaced with the adjacent /
neighbouring household. There were two additional types of replacements. On one hand, if in a
census tract less than 20% of households were found not to be connected to sewerage, the tract
was randomly replaced with another one from a list of 20 census tracts. On the other hand, if



sampling units. The district is the primary sampling unit (PSU), the census tract / neighbourhood is the secondary
sampling unit (SSU) and the household is the tertiary sampling unit (TSU). The reason we say SSU instead of census
tract / neighbourhood is the former can be clearly defined geographically, whereas the latter means different things to
different people. The size of a SSU will differ across cluster surveys. The gold standard is to use census enumeration
areas (usually between 200 and 400 households), but this is not always possible.
48
   The reason for distinguishing between rocky and sandy areas is that, in the former, households are generally unable to
dig deep pits and thus rely on containment structures that fill up and overflow frequently. Digging pits in sandy soil is
easier, and there is usually a higher rate of infiltration, so pits are expected to last for a longer time.
49
   A differentiated systemic jump was used, depending on the number of households in the census tract without access
to sewerage. For census tracts with 100 or more households without sewerage, a jump of 5 households (k = 5) was
used. For census tracts with 51 – 99 households without sewerage, k = 3. Finally, for census tracts with 30 – 50
households without sewerage, k = 1 (i.e. every other household was surveyed).

                                                                                                                      86

during fieldwork a census tract had less than 30 non-sewered households, the tract was replaced
by the community or neighbourhood closest to the end-point of the sewerage network.

Sub-sample B – lowest-income non-sewered areas

A purposive sampling method was used. First, through a meeting with SEDAPAL, 33 low-income
and priority UALs50 (i.e. areas that are unlikely to get access to sewerage in the next 4 years) in 8
districts were selected (Ancon, Carabayllo, Comas, Independencia, Pachacamac, Puente Piedra,

50
  SEDAPAL’s database refers to UALs rather than census tracts. However, census tracts in sub-sample A either refer to
part of or a complete UAL, so for ease of understanding, these terms may be used inter-changeably.

Santa Rosa and Ventanilla). UALs that were previously selected in sub-sample A or confirmed to
have access to sewerage (i.e. 13 UALs), were excluded, leaving a sample of 20 UALs. The
remaining 10 UALs were selected based on proximity to the end-point of the sewerage network,
i.e. the closest non-sewered UAL to an excluded prioritised area. 18 of the UALs selected had
sandy soil, 11 were predominantly rocky areas, while the remaining UAL was in located in a
farming area. For sampling households / TSU, the same process was followed as in sub-sample A.

B.2.2 Other instruments

Observation of service provider practices and testing fecal sludge characteristics

Fully recorded observations were made at 6 different locations (latrines in use, abandoned latrines,
urine-diverting (UD) sanitation facilities and mechanical emptying trucks), at the containment and
emptying stages of the sanitation service chain. Tests were also carried out at the reuse stage for
UD bi-products, as there is no composting for other type of on-site sanitation facilities. Tests at
transport and treatment stages were excluded as there are no specific fecal sludge services
(except for public institutions and richer households). Overall, the chosen observations reflect
existing fecal sludge management practices as much as possible.

Tests for fecal sludge characteristics were carried out on fecal sludge and dried excreta collected
during the observations of SPs, so their sampling method is identical.

Transect walks

Transect walks were conducted in 40 UALs in total: all 30 census tracts of sub-sample A and 10
randomly selected UALs from the full list of sub-sample B UALs. Section 4 in the report includes an
explanation of the format and scoring used during the transect walks.

Testing water supply and drain water quality

Samples of drinking water supplies were taken in 20 different UALs; 10 in sub-sample A and 10 in
sub-sample B. Water samples were taken from either the same water source or from the three
most common drinking water supplies identified in the UAL (verified by asking community
members). Samples were taken at the source of the supply and tested for levels of E. coli to
identify contamination in the supply itself and avoid measuring contamination resulting from poor
water storage or handling practices. Similarly, water samples from irrigation channels / dumping
sites were taken in 10 UALs from sub-sample B, from either the same location or from three
different locations and also tested for levels of E. coli, to identify contamination from poor sanitation
and fecal sludge handling within the UAL. A standard procedure for collecting samples was
followed, with samples sent to registered laboratories for testing.

Key informant interviews

The total number of interviews required, as well as the range and extent of questioning, was
influenced by the availability of current and reliable data from other sources, as well as constraints
on time and resources. Selection of interviewees was purposive, based on advice received from
stakeholders and existing knowledge of the World Bank consultant.

Focus group discussions

10 FGDs were held with households from 10 UALs from sub-sample B, which were randomly
selected from the total of 30 sub-sample B UALs in lowest-income non-sewered areas.

B.3      Fieldwork implementation
Pretesting, training and piloting

Initial pre-testing was carried out by Akut to refine the instruments a week prior to the enumerator
training. During the training, all data collection instruments were piloted in UALs excluded from the
final samples but that belong to the sampling frame, i.e. any of the 22 districts with less than 90%
sewerage coverage.

                                                                                                       89

Field team composition

For the quantitative survey, two field teams were deployed for data collection. Each team was
composed by one Supervisor and four Household Enumerators. An experienced Field Manager
was responsible for ensuring overall management, field implementation and quality assurance.

Data collection

The field teams collected the majority of the data from the 60 sampled UALs in 4 weeks during
December 2014 to January 2015. On average, each team spent one day in a PSU. Each
household interviewer conducted the survey in 6 households per day, and thus each team with 2
interviewers completed 12 households in a cluster in one day. For the transect walks (TWs), five
teams of two participants conducted all 40 TWs over 7 days.

Data entry, cleaning and analysis

The quantitative survey data were entered into SPSS at Akut’s offices in Lima, using various data
quality checks, including range checks, skips and internal consistency checks. After data cleaning
checks, data were then transferred into the statistical software Stata. Data were analysed using
Stata in OPM’s offices in Oxford.

B.4      Limitations
This study has two key limitations which need to be considered to understand the strengths and
weaknesses of the data and the conclusions that can and cannot be drawn from the analysis.
These should be considered in the context of the objectives of the study (see Section 1.2 in the
main report). These are:

        Socio-economic survey – household surveys with enumerators skilled in social research
         can only really ask questions of householders. Although enumerators were trained to
         observe and identify different characteristics of sanitation facilities, they cannot always
         make accurate technical inspections of the infrastructure, which would require a different
         skillset. Therefore, it is necessary to take the household’s responses at face value (e.g.
         about the destination of their blackwater).

        Sampling method – sample surveys are designed to estimate indicators for a broader
         population. Therefore, they cannot produce detailed data for specific neighbourhoods
         without dramatically increasing the sample size and appropriate stratification. The sample
         size for this study is relatively small compared to what would be necessary for an impact
         evaluation, for example. In a similar vein, transect walks aimed to build up a broad picture
         rather than specific maps or explanations for individual neighbourhoods. Finally, the study
         only focuses on non-sewered residential areas and households of Lima, excluding sewered
         residential areas, and all public establishments and institutions.

Annex E                Public health risk assessment: scoring used

Observations: To standardise this process, a number of pre-set questions are answered by the
observer at each stage of the process, with the observer selecting the most appropriate response
from a pre-selected list (including ‘Other’ and ‘Don’t know’ options) in each case. Each set of
responses is ranged to indicate a High / Medium and Low risk activity, with a score allocated to
each response High risk = 3, Medium risk = 2, Low risk = 1. ‘Other’ or ‘Don’t know’ responses had
to be considered separately and an appropriate score allocated depending on additional
information provided (photographs, notes, etc.).

        For example, one Transport stage question was “During the transport of faecal sludge,
         does sludge spill into the surrounding environment?” Response categories were: Sludge
         spillage occurs along the route at various times (scores 3 = High risk); Slight sludge
         spillage occurs at specific times, e.g. going down slopes or over rough ground (scores 2 =
         Medium risk); No spillage occurs – equipment contains all of the sludge during transport
         (scores 1 = Low risk).

Tables showing the full set of observation questions and the rating values of responses are
available from the links in Annex F.

For each stage of the service chain, a collated score was put into a risk category based on scoring
ranges (again, High / Medium / Low ranges). These scoring ranges were based on experience of
approaches for assessing risk to water supplies and from sanitation facilities in other studies. In
some cases, the highest risk score would be considered as the most relevant to identify –
particularly in relation to contact between fecal sludge and drinking water supplies or human
directly (through hands, feet, etc.).

* Note relating to Disposal scores:
If Qn1 scores 2 or 3, and Qn2 or Qn3 score 2 or 3, this implies medium (no scores of 3) or high (one or more scores of 3) risk
If Qn1 scores 2 or 3, and Qn4 and Qn5 both score 2 or 3, this implies medium (no scores of 3) or high (one or more scores of 3)
risk


Using the rating and scoring process during observations of emptying practices, a summary of
identified risks is shown in Table 11. The observations follow the practice as far along the service
chain as is possible – which changes depending on the latrine type. Although the number of
observations carried out is small, these results may be taken as somewhat representative of what
emptying practices occur in Lima, given the limited extent to which this happens at all.

Transect walks: Participants used a standard reporting format to allocate scores to help represent
a qualitative assessment of the relative impact from physical and environmental conditions on
being able to achieve effective and safe FSM services in that locality.

Categories included in the conditions that were recorded included: drainage infrastructure and use
(noting the presence of storm water, greywater and/or blackwater); evidence of open defecation,
dumped fecal sludge or solid waste; public latrine coverage; access to water points; housing
density; conditions of roads and paths. Each category was pre-allocated 5 observed responses,
ranging from very poor conditions (scoring 5) through to very good conditions or no evidence found
(scoring 1). Scores of 1 therefore represent the lowest impact and 5 the highest impact on FSM
services. Results from the 40 transect walks (10 in subsample A PSUs and 10 in subsample B
PSUs) are shown in Table 37.

For certain categories relating to FSM (for example evidence of open defecation, fecal sludge,
blackwater in drains) that scored 3 or more, participants identified the location of the observation,
how often the particular risk occurred in the area, by asking members of the community for
information, and the mechanism for human contact and contamination route (through people
walking in bare feet, entering drains, blackwater in drains overflowing near to homes, etc.).

Tables showing the format for scoring conditions in the PSUs during the Transect Walks and for
collecting further details where high risks were seen, are available from the links in Annex F.
