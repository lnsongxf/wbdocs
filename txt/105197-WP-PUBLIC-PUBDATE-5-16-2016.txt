Executive Summary

Introduction: Setting the Scene
Pastoralism is one of the dominant economies of the Sahel and is by far the
main economy on the fringes of the Sahara, a zone of which recently some
areas have become unstable. It is estimated that about 50 million people rely
on pastoralism for their livelihoods in the Sahel and the Saharan fringes,
and  most of them are poor. However, the Northern parts of the Sahel and
the  Sahara have seen a rapid recrudescence of trafficking and other illegal
activities. Some areas are now home to extremist groups, several of which are
involved in terrorist activities. Although the recent violence has led to rela-
tively few casualties compared to the large conflicts Africa experienced in the
20th century, it has exacted a huge human and economic cost. It has also
caused a major loss of revenues and significantly impacted economic devel-
opment, in particular tourism and social infrastructure. The insecurity and
instability in these areas lead directly to increasing poverty for already poor
pastoralists, and have a ripple effect on the economic wellbeing of the entire
population of the Sahelian countries. While only a very small part of the pop-
ulation is thought to be directly and actively involved in these criminal activ-
ities, it is critical to understand whether that large part of dry land peoples
that is not directly involved is vulnerable to these kinds of activities. In most
countries, pastoral populations are a minority and are located in the periph-
ery zones and areas that are difficult to access, often leading to disenfranchise-
ment and poor integration with the rest of the country. Furthermore, pastoral
groups in the Saharo-Sahelian region have had since the colonial period a
tense history with the state apparatus due to the imposition of new forms of
governance that clashed with traditional structures and identities. Most pas-
toralists are peaceful people trying to earn their livelihoods in one of the
harshest environments known to humanity. Also, it is clear that, because pas-
toralists are the major socioeconomic group living in the fringes of the Sahara
and the Sahel areas that are prone to instability and insecurity, they could and
should play a central role in the efforts to promote peace in the region.
   The World Bank’s Global Center on Conflict, Security, and Development,
currently the Fragility, Conflict, and Violence Cross-Cutting Solutions Area
(FCV CCSA), in 2014 commissioned this note to enhance understanding of
the connection between pastoralism and the recent increase in instability and
violence in the Sahel, as well as the conditions under which the development
of the pastoralist economy can actually enhance regional ­      stability. The note

seeks to offer guidance to international, national, and local decision makers
on the drivers of conflict and instability that are most related to pastoral com-
munities, as well as possible measures to reduce violence and enhance stabil-
ity in the Sahel. Governments and international development agencies have
either neglected pastoral populations or sought to support them with poorly
designed interventions. Another compelling reason to look more closely at
appropriate entry points for enhancing pastoral livelihoods is that the World
Bank’s significant investments in pastoralism have had mixed results. High
levels of poverty and increased instability warrant further attention from
governments and development agencies.
­
   This note is based on existing literature and knowledge; it is not based on
any new empirical work. It attempts to raise some important questions for
further investigation and identifies knowledge gaps for further studies. This
paper is not meant to answer all questions on pastoralism and instability
in the Sahel but is rather meant to bring up issues and questions that need
to  be considered in designing development interventions and areas that
would require further investigation. This paper attempts to bring together
two dimensions related to development: pastoral livelihoods and conflict
analysis. The goal of this paper is to explore whether improvement of the
pastoral economy may reduce conflicts, criminality, and trafficking and, if so,
­
under what conditions—in other words, what type of development of the pas-
toral economy is conducive to strengthen peace and stability in the region.
   The main finding of this note is that the development of pastoral economies
and livelihoods is indeed an important contributing element to stabilization
in the Sahel, and in particular to acquire the cooperation of the pastoral pop-
ulation in the control of illicit and extremist activities. However, the note also
tries to demonstrate that poorly designed pastoral development interventions
that do not fully take the drivers of conflict and violence into account can
actually create more instability and exacerbate conflicts. Not all forms of
development of pastoralism will induce stability, and developing pastoralism
does not guarantee regional stability. However, if the objectives of stabiliza-
tion and conflict prevention are well integrated into the support of the pasto-
ralist economy, significant evidence already shows that this can contribute to
lower levels of insecurity and help foster peace.
   The note is based on a review of the literature on pastoral development and
stability and the experience of the authors in these fields. It focuses on the
Sahel but, where relevant to the Sahelian situation, includes data and experi-
ences from other countries. It begins with a background section on both the
current state of pastoralism and the state of insecurity in the Sahel. The
following three sections, introduced by a brief literature review on ways to
­
analyze conflict drivers, focus on the factors that can drive pastoralists into
conflict and violence. The final sections of the paper review past pastoral
development experiences. Based on this review, we formulate development
objectives to guide pastoral development and stabilization efforts in the Sahel.
Finally, the report provides recommendations to national and international
policy makers for follow-up actions related to pastoralism and stabilization in
the Sahel.

Pastoralism Development in the Sahel	                                          vii
Section 1. Background and Context of Insecurity
and Pastoralism in the Sahel
Historical Roots and Typology of Conflict in the Sahel
This section focuses on the nature of instability and insecurity in the Sahel.
Four main types of instability are at play in the Saharo-Sahelian regions:
(1) localized conflict between crop farmers and pastoralists over crop damage
from livestock, access to water, and dry season grazing; (2) rebellion and irre-
dentism (that is, pan-nationalism based on ethnicity, such as in the case of the
Tuareg and Toubou); (3) criminal activities (drugs, smuggling, kidnapping,
and money laundering); and (4) religious extremism, such as Al Qaeda in
the  Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). While they might have different drivers (see
table 2.3), one type (in particular, local conflicts) can escalate into others. Only
a relatively limited part of the huge pastoral Saharo-Sahelian area is insecurity
prone, i.e., the stretch of land at the southern fringes of the mountain range
covering Chad, Mali, and Niger. This stretch is characterized by aridity, lack of
water, underpopulation, state absence, lack of communication infrastructures
and basic social services, and largely uncontrolled spaces and borders that
have become sanctuaries to criminals, armed groups, and terrorists.
   Several different groups and actors contribute to instability. While traders
or wealthy urbanites might well be the main powers behind criminal behav-
ior, some actors from within the pastoralist society also play a role, although
they likely have a secondary role in perpetrating insecurity. Pastoralists con-
stitute a critical part of the security chain and have a strategic value to the
region’s ­stabilization or its destabilization. With their superior knowledge
of  the terrain, they can help government forces control illicit activities
but  can also help criminal groups navigate these challenging areas. Being
the only food-­  producing group in these vast regions, they can sustain or
constrain ­ terrorists or other criminal groups. Any long-term development
effort aimed at stabilizing the region would be doomed without the pastoral
population’s involvement.

Pastoralism and Conflict in the Sahel
Pastoralists have been classified in the past according to their production sys-
tem, in line with their patterns of mobility and involvement of crop farming, but
the boundaries between these groups have become vague, as former pure pasto-
ralists are taking up farming and crop farmers take up livestock p    ­ roduction.
What binds these groups together is keeping livestock as an economic and
sociocultural activity. In addition, for all these groups mobility is essential to
benefit from the random spatially distributed rainfall. The mobile lifestyle has
made it possible for them to avoid the centralization of cultural and social life
following colonization and maintain their own cultural identity. It has led also
to a strong hierarchical structure marked by very specific cultural identities and
reluctance to deal with the overwhelming powers of the state authority.

Section 2. Factors Driving Pastoralist Society
into Conflict and Violence
Economic, demographic, social, and political drivers can cause pastoral ­people
to abandon raising livestock in favor of violent or criminal behavior.

Economic Dynamics and Conflict
The lure of criminal activities or extremist behavior depends on how
attractive and secure pastoral livelihoods are at present and in the future.
On the positive side, by overtaking human population growth, the live-
stock sector has shown to be a better engine of economic growth than
expected. The price of meat is expected to remain high, and there are indi-
cations, although disputed, that further growth of production is possible.
However, on the negative side, livestock ownership is increasingly consol-
idated in the hands of wealthy people who are mostly outsiders, is only a
mediocre employment generator, and shows large interannual variation
(that is, it amounts to a “boom and bust economy”). In addition, pastoral-
ists are also attractive recruits for their knowledge and control of roads
that enable illegal trade. Thus, if pastoralism is to be attractive, the current
inequity and vulnerability of poor and young pastoralists need to be
addressed, to provide attractive sources of alternative income to compete
with the illicit sources. There are indications that armed groups emerge
from the poorer pastoralists groups; however, the rich may also support
illegal gangs because they are disappointed with the central government
and its broken promises.

Resource Access Dynamics and Conflict
The traditional natural resource access rules are rapidly changing. These were
based on a symbiotic relationship between the crop farmers, who benefited
from organic fertilizer and traction animals, and the pastoralists, who prof-
ited from the crop residues, feed, and barter of their products for grains.
However, crop farmers increasingly invest in livestock, whereas pastoralists
are taking up cropping because their herd sizes fall below the minimum to
sustain their households. The symbiotic relationship between crop farmers
and pastoralists therefore disappears. Both groups lose land to expanding
agribusiness and real estate development.
   As a result, increasing competition for access to water and dry season
grazing is marked by occasional outbursts of violence. While there is dis-
pute over how related these local conflicts are to the broader instability in
the Sahel, some local resource conflicts have scaled up to larger conflicts
and even contributed to already existing rebellions. Similarly, droughts and
insecurity have led to highly volatile emigration streams and massive
cross-border dislocations, with subsequent resource access conflicts and
even war. Regarding the  future, the effect of climate change on Sahelian



Pastoralism Development in the Sahel	                                         ix
agriculture and livestock is unclear; but population growth in crop-­farming
ethnicities is faster than in the pastoral ethnicities, and expansion of agri-
business and urban development is expected to continue, pushing crop-
farmers into pastoral areas, where livestock is an essential complement
to  crop-farming, reducing the mobility of pastoral herds and limiting
the  availability of land for grazing. This increases the likelihood of
resource access–related conflicts and, coupled with other security threats,
could lead to further local conflicts mutating or merging with other types
of conflict and violence.

Social and Political Dynamics and Conflict
A number of social and political drivers lead young pastoralists in particular
to join illicit or extremist groups, although inclusive schemes and programs
to prevent pastoralists’ vulnerability to violent and criminal activities may be
part of the answer.
   On the positive side, a greater awareness for the plight of the pastoralists
has emerged of late. For instance, the N’Djamena Declaration (May 29,
2013) (OECD 2013) on the contribution of pastoral livestock to the ­security
and development of the Saharo-Sahelian region recognizes the critical
role  pastoralists play in maintaining stability, as does the Nouakchott
Declaration (October 29, 2013) (N’Djamena Declaration 2013). Most
Sahelian countries have adopted so-called pastoral codes that guarantee
mobility and access rights to resources. There is also an increasing move
toward decentralization that, if done in a way sensitive to the pastoral
population’s needs, could work positively; but it is often poorly imple-
­
mented, lacks adequate funding, and is implemented by ill-equipped non-
pastoral administrators.
   On the negative side, pastoral ethnicities are a minority in most Sahelian
countries (except Chad and Mauritania) and suffer from political margin-
alization. Political power remains in the hands of the elites, since rulers
seek to stay in power at any cost. Increasing lack of clarity in the geograph-
ical and administrative mandates of formal and traditional governance sys-
tems leads to overlapping and competing conflict-resolution outcomes and
exacerbates this sense of marginalization. Corruption and sometimes pub-
lic official’s ­
               participation in illicit activities widen the gap even more. In
addition, the historically strong social cohesion and hierarchical structure
within certain communities is eroding from greater exposure to the out-
side world, especially among the youth. The archaic lineage model is
impaired—the younger generation feels much less morally and socially
indebted to the older ones. Because they are often deprived of education,
or have access only to schooling systems that are ill-adapted to their needs,
the young join traffickers or r ­ eligious radicals who promise unprecedented
opportunities for them. The continuation of current trends will further
politically marginalize pastoralists and form a fertile recruitment basis for
illicit activities.

Section 3. Development Experiences to
Enhance Stability
Development Experiences
Over the last several decades, the World Bank’s activities to develop this
region have included Bank-funded projects supporting pastoralists in Chad,
Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal. The Bank continues these efforts via the
Regional Sahel Pastoralism Support Project (PRAPS) and the Regional
Pastoral Livelihood Resilience Project for the Horn of Africa (RPLRP). Other
donors and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have also accumulated
considerable experience on pastoralism development projects, which are
summarized in this note. However, there has been very limited experience
on how pastoral development initiatives can contribute to stability directly,
and on how to better provide security to these populations and cooperate
with them on security initiatives to combat terrorism, criminality, and other
violent activities.
    This section summarizes the effect of the main pastoral development
­activities, and particularly their effect on stabilization. A first condition is that
 there needs to be greater resource access and mobility, which would reduce
 conflicts and cap their escalation. The recent (since the late 1990s) introduc-
 tion of pastoral codes has been a positive development, but they are techno-
 cratic and poorly or incompletely implemented.
    Institutions of collective action (pastoral associations) can play a useful role
 in amplifying pastoralists’ voices and increasing their inclusion in the national
 policy debates, and hence reducing the temptation to participate in illegal
 activities. Regional or national pastoral associations have had some success to
 this end, although domination by the elites often reduces their effectiveness.
 These associations can also provide a successful framework for much-needed
 enhanced service delivery, such as veterinary and pastoral water services.
    The establishment of more appropriate services, if done in an inclusive
 and  conflict-sensitive manner, can also directly enhance stability. Of these,
 education must be a critical component. A combination of mobile, radio,
 and boarding school models should be tested to overcome the constraints of
 mobility, child labor, parental illiteracy, and religious opposition. Innovative
 solutions must also be found to deliver adequate animal and human health
 services to these highly dispersed populations.
    The establishment of mechanisms and incentives to adapt livestock num-
 bers to the “boom and bust” pastoral economy is described in more detail in
 the main report, and has been important to avoid pastoralists, getting food
 aid dependent. Some local market development might be needed, but generally
 the traditional sector is quite efficient; it is preferable to avoid strong public
 sector involvement.
    Another indirect influence on stability is food aid. If incorrectly designed
 or implemented, food aid can suppress local production and distort livestock
 prices and food markets. If poorly delivered—for example, if the aid ends up



Pastoralism Development in the Sahel	                                               xi
on the black market or benefits the wealthy—it can cause discontent and con-
tribute to rebellion. However, acute and severe food insecurity can also
diminish the resources available to armed groups.

Stabilization and Improving Security
The lessons that emerge from these experiences are that, in order to be suc-
cessful in an unstable environment like the Sahel, development initiatives
should be both stabilization oriented (providing better access to physical and
livelihood security for populations) and conflict sensitive. State-supported
projects that combine development and overcome security measures for the
population’s benefit, if designed and implemented in a participatory fashion,
can improve pastoralists’ perception of the state as repressive, especially if
these projects truly improve the access to security and justice, among other
services, by populations as well as their living conditions and offer sustainable
income opportunities that are more secure than trafficking. Furthermore, and
more important for the long run, ensuring true participation and inclusion of
pastoralists in local political governance mechanisms and in deciding what
kind of development interventions are needed in their areas is key to building
trust with the state. Initiatives should take into account some of the good
principles of pastoral development described in this report so that they are
adapted to the local context and sensitive to the needs of the population,
including but not limited to enhancing mobility, preserving cultural heritage
and traditional institutions that are recognized as useful by the majority
of  pastoralists, and strengthening education, healthcare, access to justice/­
conflict resolution mechanisms, and other services.



Section 4. The Way Forward
It is generally assumed that economic development, employment generation,
and political inclusion would reduce pastoral peoples’ involvement in illicit
activities. However, pastoral development alone will not halt the process of
deteriorating stability. It can encourage populations to rely on services, which
foments dependence on public institutions and encourages trust in govern-
ment. Pastoral development must be an integrated package that focuses on
generating employment, increasing productivity, and reducing pastoralists’
vulnerability. It must also respect pastoralists’ rights, including mobility, and
strengthen education, animal and human health services with methodologies
appropriate to their conditions, and infrastructure development in underused
areas. In addition, it must be promoted in real partnership with target
populations. To these ends, foreign partners will need to engage in long-term
­
commitments.
   Pastoral development must be accompanied by enhanced security and
­
conflict resolution provision to the pastoral and other populations of the
remote areas of the Sahel and Sahara and enhanced cooperation with those
populations. However, a clear distinction should be made between security


xii	                                        Pastoralism Development in the Sahel
operators and development operators, lest the population reject the latter. It
is essential that trust exist between the population and state entities, and spe-
cifically with security forces. Because conventionally policing immense and
remote pastoral areas is costly and impractical, security must be achieved in
other ways—for example, by creating a link of trust between security forces
and “positive influencers” (such as locally elected and traditional leaders);
training security forces with a strong local component; and rewarding local
knowledge and skills against criminal activities.
   As a first step, such an integrated package could be introduced in pilot areas
where institutional prospects are favorable and the population is receptive to
combating illicit activities. A proposal for pilot development areas could be
specifically promoted in Ménaka, a new regional entity in Mali that borders
on Niger. Ménaka is a major livestock area and a rebellion springboard. It has
a multiethnic population and a positive traditional leadership. It could also be
used as a leverage point for subregional stabilization.
   A policy framework will be needed to create an enabling environment
for  the pastoral sector, including (1) providing a “level playing field” for
­
pastoralists, in particular by conducting dialogue with them on an equal
basis and by designing development interventions according to their needs
rather than to the needs of governments; (2) clarifying the roles and mandates
of traditional and formal governance to ensure unbiased conflict resolution;
(3) eliminating the arbitrary taxation of transhumance routes and livestock
trade; (4) strengthening further pastoral codes and their implementation; and
(5) inducing the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to
see that its decision/regulation on transhumance certificates becomes imple-
mented in a more effective and expedient manner.
   All involved parties should participate in the implementation of these
measures. On a basis of mutual respect, governments must open a dialogue

with pastoralist groups, in particular with women and youth; international
organizations should support such dialogues with funding and know-how and
support the region’s many NGOs in implementing the policy and investment
­
actions.

Introduction: Setting the
Scene
Pastoralism is one of the dominant economies of the Sahel and is by far the
main economy on the fringes of the Sahara, a zone that has recently become
very unstable. The northern parts of the Sahel and the Sahara have seen a rapid
recrudescence of all kinds of trafficking and illegal activities, from kidnapping
to theft of cattle and goods. Some areas are now home to extremist groups,
many of which are involved in terrorist activities. Although the recent violence
in the Sahel, which culminated with the war in northern Mali in 2012, has had
relatively few casualties compared to the large conflicts Africa experienced in
the 20th century, it has exacted a huge human and economic cost. Since 2008
total ransom payments have been estimated between US$40  million and
US$65 million, and the French military intervention in Mali was expected to
surpass €400 million in 2013 (Cabirol 2013). The insecurity has led to 1 mil-
lion refugees and internally displaced persons in the Sahel (UNOCHA 2013).
It has also caused a major loss of revenues and significantly impacted eco-
nomic development, in particular tourism and social infrastructure. The illicit
flows of drugs, human beings, oil, cigarettes, counterfeit medicine, firearms,
and toxic waste were estimated by the United Nations Office on Drug and
Crime (UNODC 2013) to be US$3.8 billion annually.
   It is estimated that about 50 million people rely on pastoralism for their
only or a main part of their livelihood in Sub-Saharan Africa; about half of
them are located in the Sahel and the Saharan fringes, and of these about
70 percent are poor (De Haan 2014). The insecurity and instability in these
areas directly lead to increased poverty of already poor pastoralists by inter-
fering with their mobility.1 Instability also indirectly affects the economic
well-being of the entire population of the Sahelian countries because of its
ripple effect on other sectors. The population living off pastoral activities has
also been growing (although populations focused on farming activities have
shown higher demographic growth levels in comparison), and the pastoral
economy struggles to provide decent livelihoods to increasing numbers of
youths. Although it is unclear what climate change’s direct effects are on the
pastoralist population, desertification, scarcity of resources, and other envi-
ronmental issues affect the relationship between farmers and pastoralists.
Inaccessible, underfunded, or poorly designed social services have also been
a major impediment to the development of the pastoralist economy. Despite
their vital role in global food security and their capacity of production on
land otherwise unsuitable to agriculture, pastoral communities around the
world are in a persistent state of crisis. Competition over natural resources,
especially land, has become an issue of major concern and cause of conflict
between the Sahel’s pastoral and farming populations. In many countries,
pastoral communities are among the most politically and socially marginal-
ized, and the increasing circulation of firearms has helped make traditional
raids and cattle rustling more deadly. All of these factors leave pastoralist

communities increasingly exposed to radicalization and recruitment by
insurgent groups and traffickers, as the case of Mali reminded us.
   Over the last several decades, the World Bank’s activities to develop this
region have included improving the livelihoods of pastoralists. World Bank–
funded projects have sought to support pastoralists in Chad, Mali, Mauritania,
Niger, and Senegal. The World Bank intends to continue these efforts via the
Regional Pastoral Livelihood Resilience Project (RPLRP), which initially cov-
ers Ethiopia, Kenya, and Uganda and is being replicated in the Sahel through,
the Regional Sahel Pastoralism Support Project (PRAPS).
   The World Bank’s Global Center on Conflict, Security, and Development
(CCSD) was launched in 2011 to strengthen the Bank and other partner’s
work on fragile and conflict-affected situations by providing technical sup-
port to country teams on strategy, programming design, and operations that
are sensitive to fragility, conflict, and violence. With the recent internal reor-
ganization of the World Bank, in 2014 the CCSD became the FCV CCSA.
This note was commissioned by the CCSD to enhance understanding of the
connection between pastoralism and the recent increase in instability and
violence in the Sahel, as well as the conditions under which the development
of the pastoralist economy can actually provide regional stability. While
investing in pastoralism has had mixed results and offers a compelling reason
to look more closely at appropriate entry points for enhancing pastoral liveli-
hoods, increased instability warrants revisiting the classical approaches to
pastoral development even further.
   This note seeks to offer guidance to international, national, and local deci-
sion makers on the drivers of conflict and instability that are most related to
pastoral communities, as well as possible measures to reduce violence and
enhance stability in the Sahel. Governments and international development
agencies have either neglected pastoral populations or sought to support
them with poorly designed interventions. This marginalization is due to a
combination of factors, including pastoralists’ lack of empowerment, which
stems from their minority status;2 their poor integration into the rest of the
society; the vastness of the pastoral areas in question; and the perceived
limited development potential of livestock under the prevailing pastoral
­
conditions (Véron 2013).
­
   This note attempts to bring together two dimensions related to develop-
ment: pastoral livelihoods resilience and conflict analysis. Our goal is to
determine whether improvement of the pastoral economy and livelihoods
may reduce criminality, trafficking, and recruitment into rebel groups in the
Sahel and, if so, under what conditions. We also explore whether there is
any  correlation between localized, improved stability among pastoral com-
munities and risk mitigation for higher national/political conflicts in Sahelian
countries.
   This note attempts to articulate important questions on the relations
between pastoral development and stability and to identify any knowledge
gaps for further exploration. This note is based on existing literature
and  knowledge and not on any new empirical work. The harshness of the
Saharo-Sahelian environment; its vastness, porosity, and underdevelopment;

2	                                          Pastoralism Development in the Sahel
and the lack of integration of the populations in these regions within the
national entities makes the Sahel-Sahara expanse a favorable setting for armed
rebellions and criminal enterprises, including terrorism, to take hold. These
areas are sparsely populated by pastoralist population and therefore, pastoral-
ists play an important role in populating these porous spaces and could and
should play an important role in stabilizing this space.
   This note is based on (1) an extensive review of the recent literature on pas-
toral development and stability; and (2) the authors’ experience in pastoral
development in Sub-Saharan Africa and in security issues. It focuses on the
Sahelo-Saharian expanses going from Mauritania to Chad, but where relevant
the study also includes data and experiences from other countries more to the
east or to the south. Some findings from this study are probably valid for
other areas such as Sudan and Somalia, but the extrapolation will be limited
by certain context-specific aspects including specific socioeconomic charac-
teristics of pastoralist society, the climate (monomodal rainfall in the Sahel
versus, for example, bimodal rainfall in the Horn of Africa, which defines
movement patterns), proximity to export markets, and the specific dynamics
of conflict in the Horn of Africa, and so on.
   The note begins with a background section on both the current state of
pastoralism and the state of insecurity in the Sahel. The following three sec-
tions focus on the factors that can drive pastoralists into conflict and violence
or alternatively can bring them to play the role of agents of stability. The final
sections of the paper review past pastoral development experiences. On the
basis of this review, we formulate development objectives to guide pastoral
development and stabilization efforts in the Sahel. Finally, the report provides
recommendations to national and international policy makers for follow-up
actions related to pastoralism and stabilization in the Sahel.

Background and Context of
Insecurity and Pastoralism
in the Sahel
Historical Roots and Typology of Conflict in
the Sahel
The Sahel’s current violence and insecurity are historic in nature but also fea-
ture more recent drivers that exacerbate already existing tensions. Two main
historic factors form the basis of the region’s different forms of violence today.
The first is a governance crisis, which is characterized by a feeble state pres-
ence, whereby states do not effectively provide necessary mechanisms and
services to their populations, particularly in low-density population areas.
This results in an inability to control borders, weak capacity by public ser-
vants, lack of a monopoly over the use of force, and a failure to protect people
and their goods, including a lack of access to justice and police services,
among others. This context fosters the free development of all sorts of illegal
(and criminal) activities, including a black market in contraband, drug and
human trafficking, recruitment to rebel groups, the arming of rebels, and the
establishment of terrorist groups. The second historical factor is a legacy of
rebellion against the postcolonial state authority by certain populations in the
region, such as the Tuareg and the Toubou. This has been expressed via frus-
tration with an overcentralized state authority, often exemplified by the use of
security forces to maintain and control the regime’s power, by the lack of
decentralization policies, or by the absence or neglect of the state in its essen-
tial functions, including lack of social and economic development initiatives.
However, there is a large heterogeneity among and in pastoral groups because
of the strength of their internal social cohesion, discipline, equity, and rela-
tionships with local and formal administrations.
   The region’s different types of violence and criminal behaviors can be classi-
fied according to their origin and whether they are linked to (1) localized con-
flicts between crop farmers and pastoralists over crop damage from livestock,
access to water, and dry season grazing; (2) rebellion and irredentism (that is,
pan-nationalism based on ethnicity, such as in the case of the Tuareg and
Toubou); (3) criminal activities (drugs, smuggling, kidnapping, and money
laundering); or (4) religious extremism, such as Al Qaeda in the Islamic
Maghreb (AQIM). While they might have different drivers (see table 2.3) one
type (in particular, local conflicts) can escalate into another.
   Only a relatively limited part of the huge pastoral Saharo-Sahelian area
faces serious insecurity. This highly insecure area is situated in the stretch of
land between and on the southern fringes of the following groups of moun-
tains: the Adrar des Ifoghas in Mali; the Aïr, Ténéré, and Kawar in Niger; and

                      the Tibesti in Chad. These Sahelian territories, bordered by three Arab
                      Maghreb states (Algeria, Libya, and Mauritania), share the conditions of arid-
                      ity, lack of water, underpopulation, state absence, lack of communication
                      infrastructures and basic social services, and largely uncontrolled spaces and
                      borders. Moreover, these mountains offer sanctuaries to criminals, armed
                      groups, and terrorists. These elements are permanent and have triggered a
                      succession of crises over the last century, and especially in the last few years
                      (see map 1.1).
                         Several different groups and actors contribute to instability. While traders
                      or wealthy urbanites might well be the main powers behind criminal behav-
                      ior, this report focuses on the part played by pastoralists, although they likely
                      have a secondary role in perpetrating insecurity. It is only a small group;
                      figures are not available, but the authors’ estimate based on their previous
                      ­
                      fieldwork and experience comes to about 10,000 in the Sahel. The rationale
                      for focusing on pastoralists is that they constitute a critical part of the security
                      chain and can contribute to the region’s stabilization or its destabilization,
                      particularly in the longer term. With their superior knowledge of the ter-
                      rain, they can become key allies who can help government to monitor and
                      control illicit activities but who, if not included in the different political and

Pastoralism and Conflict in the Sahel
Pastoralism is a way of life that has ecological, political, economic, cultural,
and social dimensions. It is a finely honed symbiotic relationship between
local ecology, domesticated livestock, and people in highly variable regions
who often live at the threshold of human survival. It represents a complex
form of natural resource management that involves the direct interaction
between three systems in which pastoral people operate: the natural resource
system, the resource users system, and the larger geopolitical system (Pratt,
Le Gall, and De Haan 1997).
  Pastoralism can be divided according to the production system,1 although
more recently the distinctions between the different groups have faded because

6	                                         Pastoralism Development in the Sahel
nowadays almost all depend on some crop farming, and all depend on being
able to take advantage of the environmental instability. In effect, within the
same family, some members can depend purely on livestock whereas others
depend exclusively on cropping. All also depend on communal land manage-
ment and nonexclusive entitlements to water resources. Also, for all these
­systems, livestock serves multiple purposes, including social and cultural ones.
 This is also reflected in the definition adopted by the Ministry of Northern
 Kenya in the 2012 Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASAL) development policy
 (which builds on the African Union Policy Framework on Pastoralism):
  “The term refers to both an economic activity and a cultural identity, but the latter
  does not necessarily imply the former. As an economic activity, pastoralism is an
  animal production system, which takes advantage of the characteristic instability of
  ­
  rangeland environments, where key resources such as nutrients and water for ­livestock
  become available in short-lived and largely unpredictable concentrations. Crucial
  aspects of pastoralist specialization are: (a) The interaction of people, animals and
  the  environment, particularly strategic mobility of livestock and selective feeding;
  and  (b) the development of flexible resource management systems, particularly
  communal land management institutions and non-exclusive entitlements to water
  ­
  resources.”2

   Pastoralism prospers and survives with mobility (see map 1.2). Erratic
rainfall patterns, often randomly and sparsely distributed over large areas,
make the ability to move herds over large distances essential. The capacity
to make use of the differences in feed quality, with the northern fringes pro-
viding a vegetation of high f  ­eeding value but low quantity and the more
southern parts a higher volume of biomass (Breman and de Wit 1983) but
of much lower quality, makes pastoralism superior in yields to sedentary
forms of livestock keeping in these drylands. The mobile lifestyle has histor-
ically led to relative isolation from public administrations, and a rather
endogenous social and cultural development, but also to a strong hierarchi-
cal structure marked by very specific cultural identities and reluctance to
deal with state authority.
   The numbers of mobile livestock keepers vary significantly from country
to country (they make up more than 50 percent of the population in
Mauritania, for example). Their ethno-linguistic affiliation constitutes their
prima facie characteristic (Arab, Maure, Peul, Tuareg, Toubou, and Zaghawa
constitute the main groups). Unlike in other Sahelian and Saharan societies,
they are much more influenced by their own societal traditions than the
­
traditions of Islam.3
   Pastoralists are proud of, and often ready to defend, their social and eco-
nomic traditions. They boast of their warring abilities (for example, the jihad
of Usman dan Fodio at the turn of the 19th century, or razzia4 drives, repressed
by colonizers but still occurring today), although the Wodaabe, being the
most dedicated “pastoralist” groups among the Fulani of the time of Usman
dan Fodio, actually kept their distance from the jihad and most of them con-
verted to Islam only at the end of the 20th century (i.e., almost a century later)
(Bonfiglioli 1982). In pastoralist societies women have a status (illustrated,
among other things, by monogamy among the Tuareg) that corresponds
to  the enhanced responsibilities conferred to them by the realities of

     Key Messages and Further Research Needs
     •	 The pastoral population of the Saharan-Sahelian zone is highly varied in terms of income,
        assets, and socioeconomic and cultural background.
     •	 Only a very small part of this population is involved in criminal or violent activities; the
        large  majority make their living in a peaceful fashion, although in extremely harsh
        environments.
     •	 More research needs to be done on the number, socioeconomic and cultural background, and
        organizational structure of those involved in each of the respective destabilizing activities.




transhumance or (semi)nomadic life, although most pastoralists groups
are polygamous. Women often have exclusive rights to milk and to specific
lines of stock.
   Pastoralists’ share in gross agricultural product is often higher than their
proportion of the overall population (32 percent in Chad, 32 percent in Mali,
83 percent in Mauritania, 36 percent in Niger).5 Yet they endure prejudice
from the rest of the population, which accuses them of being useless and inef-
ficient; a common charge is that their herds consist of many old, unproductive
animals, which would have been sold much earlier under other production
systems.6 This prejudice is often caused by their perceived lack of discipline
and unchecked competition with sedentary livestock keepers and farmers,
and it is reflected in the many disparaging names for pastoralists that exist in
nearly all local languages. It is also a perspective that can be learned in pri-
mary school textbooks (Kratli and Dyer 2010). This humiliating experience
has led many pastoralists to further underestimate and marginalize them-
selves (Toutain et al. 2012).
   Absentee pastoralists deserve a mention. Living in urban centers, these
well-off traders and possibly traffickers often originate from the Arab com-
munity. They become involved in pastoralism by buying important herds, in
part because of their lack of trust in the inefficient banking systems. Doing so
may offer some an opportunity to launder money and find easy recruits
for  armed groups who will protect their criminal activities. This trend was
initiated as a consequence of the droughts that plagued the Sahel in the 1970s
and  is now illustrated in nearly all urban centers in Mauritania, northern
Mali, and northern Niger, as well as in the northern states of Nigeria and
Chad. The negative impacts of absentee pastoralists’ criminal activity far sur-
pass the damages caused by traditional razzia by nomadic Tuareg or Toubou.
This increases the competition for resources.



Notes
	1.	There are different modes of production and organization within pastoralist
    ­
    societies: the first kind is nomadic, where nomadic herders who are oppor-
    tunistically mobile, i.e., make their movements depending on the rainfall and

     vegetation distribution for that particular period; the second is one where tran-
     shumants move s    ­ easonally between the arid/semiarid regions in the rainy sea-
     son and during the dry season move to areas of more secure grazing resources;
     and finally, agropastoralists that combine agriculture and pastoralism production
     systems. In general, pastoralists are defined as those for whom at least 90 per-
     ­
     cent of their feed (Sere and Steinfeld, 1996) comes from the natural vegetation
     or at least 50 of their agricultural income (including household consumption;
     Swift 1988) from livestock, whereas agro-pastoralists have a greater share from
     agricultural activities. The nomadic and transhumant systems together make up
     about 18 percent of the ­ livestock population (Ly, Fall, and Okike 2010) and about
     25 percent of the livestock-keeping population (IIED and SOS Sahel International
     UK 2011). The remainder of livestock is kept by agro-pastoralists, who have a
     more sedentary production system.

	3.	 The Islamic brotherhoods—Tariqat in Arabic—have pervaded the Sahel over the
     last five centuries and encouraged the expansion of Malekite Muslim law and Sufi
     beliefs and practices. Although the brotherhoods now exist as a mostly urban
     phenomenon, their basic structure, zawiya (a religious school, monastery, or inn),
     was the main diffusion vector of Sufism in the rural zones of the Sahel. As for
     hierarchy among nomads, the group of religious scholars belongs to the nobility,
     which immediately follows the warriors.

Factors Driving Pastoralist
Society into Conflict and
Violence
The specific drivers of conflict for pastoralists will be discussed in this section.
Also important to note is that in some cases the decision to participate in rebel-
lion or other illegal activities might also be imposed, as pastoralists are being
forced out because their assets are below the level needed to sustain them.
   It is generally assumed that increased economic development, employment
generation, and political inclusion would reduce pastoral people’s involve-
ment in illicit activities. For example, the World Development Report
2011: Conflict, Security, and Development (WDR 2011) found in a global sur-
vey that unemployment and idleness—sustained lack of livelihood or
income-generating opportunities—were the most common motivations for
participating in rebel movements and joining street gangs (World Bank 2011,
80). These and other drivers, coupled with a lack of solid, transparent, and
participatory institutions that can provide a political and conflict resolution
space, lead to repeated cycles of violence and fragility.
   The WDR 2011 gives an insight into the theory of conflict drivers; table 2.1,
which illustrates security, economic, and political stresses, is particularly
relevant to the present study.
­
   The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has
developed a similarly useful grid, one that is more specifically applied to pasto-
ralism in the Sahel region. It enumerates the cultural, social, economic, and
political factors that can either curb or accelerate violent conflict (see table 2.2).

                        Likewise, the International Institute for Sustainable Development has iden-
                     tified a series of threats to natural capital, human capital, financial capital,
                     physical capital, and social capital (Nori, Crawford, and Switzer 2005).
                        Three categories of conflict drivers will be reviewed in this section: eco-
                     nomic drivers; drivers related to resource access; and cultural, social, and
                     political drivers. These categories are not impervious to each other because
                     they can combine to transform cycles of violence into explosive situations. A
                     society’s resilience factors may act as mitigating forces to conflict; therefore,
                     these deserve just as much attention in the definition and implementation of
                     development policies for pastoralists.
                        Deciding whether to abandon livestock herding in favor of illicit activities
                     may depend on a process of trade-offs between economic (that is, which
                     activity pays better), social (that is, which activity fits best in the social fabric
                     of my group), and geopolitical and security considerations (that is, which
                     activity yields appropriate livelihood and social status at the lowest security
                     risk). However, motivations will fluctuate according to the type of group
                     joined: for example, the motivations behind participating in illicit activities
                     such as smuggling and trafficking could be motivated by economic rational
                     considerations, whereas identity (whether ethnic, religious, or other) could
                     be the key factor in mobilizing certain types of armed rebellions, like those
                     led by the Tuareg in Mali and Niger. Dr. Yvan Guichaoua, explains how in the
                     case of the Mouvement des Nigériens pour la Justice (MNJ) Tuareg rebellion
                     “circumstantial alliances and percolation of grievances provoked by local
                     micro-political dynamic and long-standing disenfranchisement of some sec-
                     tions of the Tuareg youth permitted the movement to take off as a credible
                     rebel group” and further notes that “rebelling can actually resemble a gradual
                     and fragile ‘bricolage’ whose changes can be influenced by external forces—
                     notably state repression—and disturbed by internal struggle over power”
                     (Guichaoua 2009). Further evidence from the researcher’s interviews suggests

that personal rivalries, family ties, and the individual psychological processes
that frame these concepts can also contribute to individuals choosing to par-
ticipate in violent or criminal activities.1 Also, more specifically to the Sahelo-
Saharan geopolitical context is the logic of clan and social alliances, which
also drives people into conflict.2 As Professor Frances Stewart explains in her
seminal work on horizontal inequalities, “The root causes of most violent
conflicts lie in economic and political factors, often horizontal inequalities of
various types. Yet people are organized, united and mobilized by identities,
in  particular ethnic or religious ones” (Stewart 2009). Following this logic,
one can easily understand how grievances and a sense of marginalization
expressed by some members of a group can mobilize a larger part of a group.
   To set the scene, table 2.3 summarizes the main types of conflicts, their key
defining factors, causes/drivers, and consequences. They are detailed in the
following sections.


Economic Dynamics and Conflict
This subsection describes the key characteristics of the pastoralist economy.
It analyzes the benefits that raising livestock offers to pastoralist households
now and in the future and briefly reviews the returns from alternative sources
of employment. Economic drivers of violence, which might cause pastoral
people to abandon livestock raising in favor of violent or criminal behavior,
are also discussed in parallel with existing or potential resilience factors.
   The key question is whether pastoralism can ensure a reasonable liveli-
hood that will dissuade pastoral community members from undertaking
illicit or illegal ventures. No answer can be proposed without first reviewing
the main traits of the pastoral economy.
   Livestock make numerous contributions to Sahelian pastoral households.
They are (1) livelihood benefits (milk, meat, and sales), (2) agricultural bene-
fits (animal traction and manure for fertilizer); and (3) social benefits (status,
solidarity, and social investment), among others.

12	                                                Pastoralism Development in the Sahel
   Pastoral production has been appropriately described as a “boom and
bust” economy: a boom when the rains return and a bust when a drought
occurs. The interannual variation in production and income is therefore
extremely large. An example of this interannual variation was presented at a
recent World Bank and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) seminar:
Frédéric Ham showed that, for the Ménaka region of northern Mali, the avail-
able feed was adequate for 3,645 TLU3 in 2007 and only 1,235 TLU in 2009,
i.e., it was reduced by a factor of almost 3. Such a difference in the amount of
available feed, if widespread and not accompanied by the capacity to move,
will cause milk yields to drop and young stock mortality to rise sharply. In
addition, rebuilding a herd in boom times takes several years. The interan-
nual variation in income depends on the asset level and the access to other
sources of income of the household. If the herd/flock size is well above the
minimum of about 2.5 TLU per capita (Sandford 2011) the household can
cushion with extra sales. However, with the majority of the households
below that level, the variability of the environment is a major shock factor
(World Bank 2015).
   For the pastoral sector, a clear distinction needs to be made between wealth
in assets versus income. A pastoralist might be well off in assets, but the income
generated by these assets can be lower than that of a crop farmer. The oft-heard
perception that pastoralists are wealthy should therefore be tempered.
   Also, although milk is still an important part of the diet, cereals make up a
significant part of the Sahelian pastoralist diet. Some pastoral households
barter or sell their milk or livestock for cereal (Wane, Touré, and Ancey 2010).
The reliance on cereals is particularly felt during a drought, when the meat-
to-cereal price ratio drops sharply and significantly less cereal can be pur-
chased for the price of one kilogram of beef or mutton (Ickowicz et al. 2012;
SWAC, OECD, and ECOWAS 2008).This adds to pastoral households’ high
level of vulnerability.
   In addition, pastoral production is only moderately labor intensive. It is
mostly provided by family labor for the small pastoral families and by hired
labor for the large herd owners. Data on herd size distribution are scarce
because any person in any culture would be reticent to reveal his or her total
assets; a recent paper (Manoli et al. 2014) from the Ferlo in Senegal, shows
that about one-third of the herds are large (more than 50 cattle or 100 small
ruminants), which would be about the limit where hired labor would be
required. Transhumant herds are often divided into a milk herd, which is kept
near the family compound, and the larger herds of young and dry animals
that make the large cyclical movements.
   Specific data on pure pastoralist household economies are scarce. A
household economic survey (but one that did not include purely pastoral
households) carried out in sample areas in Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, and
Senegal paints the following picture of the household economy of the Sahelian
rural population (FEG 2011). The wealthier half of households own practi-
cally all the cattle and about three-quarters of the small ruminant population;
the handful of small ruminants that the poor own are often sold or exchanged
for food in the lean season. The poor consume practically no animal products

and have to buy most of their cereal food. Outside employment is a major
source of income for the poor, whereas for the wealthier households income
is derived from the sale of cereal, livestock, and livestock products. As the
authors of the survey put it, “Wealthier households live by their production
but poorer households live by their work” (FEG 2011).
   Similarly, remittances are an important source of income for inhabitants
of the Sahelian drylands, including the pastoralists. For example, it was esti-
mated that 82 percent of households in four Nigerien departments4 received
remittances; 45–87 percent of these revenues are used for food purchase
(Inter-Réseaux Développement Rural and SOS Faim Belgium 2012). The drop
in remittances due to the war in Libya ranges from 51 percent to 75 percent.
   Driven by a regional (Nigeria) and global market, there is a long-term
upward trend in beef and mutton prices. For example, in constant values,
the price of livestock reportedly rose by an estimated 78 percent between
1997 and 2002.
   The potential growth in the pastoral sector deserves critical attention.
A Sahelian pastoral sector with significant economic potential could absorb
the population growth, whereas lackluster potential would lead to abandon-
ing the sector in favor of other sources of income, including criminal activi-
ties, including terrorism, trafficking, and kidnapping. The expansion potential
will depend critically on the amount of available palatable feed and the capac-
ity of the herds and flocks to access it, which in turn depends on the capacity
of the herds to move and the availability of drinking water.5 In projecting
future growth, it should first be noted that Sahelian pastures are already very
efficiently used. The classical work of Breman and de Wit (1983) shows that,
in production of animal protein per hectare, the Sahelian systems are superior
to U.S. and Australian ranches under similar rainfall (about 500 millimeters
per year). Thus, in U.S. and Australian ranches, the average production is
from 0.3 to 0.5  kilograms per hectare, whereas the production in transhu-
mant and nomadic systems is 0.6 to 3.2 kilograms and 0.4 kilograms,
respectively.
   So, what are the prospects for the future? More information will be
available shortly from the World Bank African Region Flagship report The
­
Economics of Resilience in the Drylands of Sub-Saharan Africa, but the
picture that emerges is of some, but limited, prospects for growth of
­
production and productivity. In the literature one finds the pessimistic
­
view, represented by the distinguished pastoral development expert Stephen
Sandford, is that there are “too few animals for too many people” (Sandford
2011). Although he mainly focuses on the drylands of the Horn of Africa,
his argument is that with a population increase of 2.5 percent and an
assumed minimum number of five to six cattle (or the equivalent in other
species) needed to support a pastoralist (and about half that number to sus-
tain an agro-­pastoralist), there is simply not enough feed to sustain the herd
even at very low levels of welfare.
   More optimistic views come from similarly reputed pastoral specialists,
who refute this argument based on the reliability of Sandford’s data
(Catley,  n.d.) or technologies for dry season conservation of rangeland

pastures (Swift, n.d.), as well as the importance of nonpastoral income (Little,
n.d.). Although performance data from the last two decades are no guarantee
for the future, they also support a more positive view. Over the past 20 years,
the pastoral economy has shown a rather healthy growth. For example, in
Chad, Mali, and Niger, the growth rate of the livestock population seems to be
higher than the pastoral population. According to data from the Statistical
Division of the FAO (FAOSTAT), the number of cattle, sheep, and goats grew
by 3.7, 3.1, and 4.4 percent, respectively, over the period 1990–2011.
Production of beef and small ruminant meat grew over that same period by
3.2 and 4.4 percent, respectively. While FAOSTAT data are often criticized for
their lack of reliability, the overall trend seems clear: the Sahelian herds and
flocks have increased at a moderate rate. It should be noted, however, that the
increase in production has almost exclusively been driven by increase in
numbers, and not in productivity per head. The picture of past performance
becomes even more positive if the annual growth of the livestock population
(between 3.1 and 4.4 percent) is compared to the annual population growth
of the main pastoral ethnicities, which is estimated between 1 and 2.5 percent.
This means that, on average, the number of animals per household and per
pastoralist has gone up.
   Finally, the capacity to increase production is demonstrated by a num-
ber of projects, such as the pastoral water-development project in Chad
(AFD, n.d.), which is supported by the French Development Agency (AFD).
This project reports an increase in production and income over a 15-year
period due to improved access to pastures from an integrated pastoral water-
development project that included not only physical infrastructure develop-
ment but also institutional capacity building for maintenance and conflict
resolution.
   The attraction of illegal activities (drugs, trafficking, and kidnapping)
can be discussed at this juncture. Smuggling has long been part and parcel of
nomadic life and livelihood (mainly among Tuaregs and Arabs); and, proba-
bly now as much as—if not more than—ever, it boosts economic activity in
the Sahara region. However, since 2003 the comparative advantage of illegal
activities has reached unprecedented levels and induced a shift in ­   behaviors.
Indeed, in some Sahelian areas—mainly northern Mali and northern Niger—
drugs have become the profitable product to transport. Pastoralists in this
region (though most likely still in small numbers) have thus gradually entered
into criminal networks controlled by Arab traders who have economic con-
nections throughout northern Africa and the Middle East, are often linked to
jihadism,6 and participate in kidnapping and other illicit activities. Petty
transporters, guides, or logisticians who often belong to pastoral communities
receive mere crumbs of the very profitable trafficking industry, yet it nonethe-
less has become a profitable endeavor for them. The association of drugs and
jihadism creates a robust vicious circle: the pastoralists who fall into it acquire
more income, and might invest at least part of that income in livestock and
gain more influence and an upgraded status in their community; should they
want out, however, they are unable to leave because it is highly risky and
difficult to escape the network of Al Qaeda in the Maghreb (AQIM).

   There are no data available on current and expected unemployment in pas-
toral societies. However, with moderate population growth, few employment
opportunities, and livestock holdings for many households below the levels
required to provide a decent livelihood, illicit and criminal activities might
become more attractive.
   In conclusion, several factors of the pastoral economy can drive pastoral-
ists into conflicts and illicit activities once they have perceived the com-
parative advantage of shifting into illegality. These factors are both internal
and external.
   Among internal factors:
••    First is, the limited potential of pastoralism in arid and semiarid areas,
      because the feed available for animals may fall below what is needed to
      support pastoralists at a minimum welfare level; the consequence is that
      crowded-out pastoralists must find an alternative livelihood.
••    Second, livestock is becoming increasingly unevenly distributed
      between the well-off and the poor; this weakens group solidarity and pro-
      motes a sense of injustice.
••    Third, whereas the wealthier households can live by their production, the
      poor must earn most of their income hiring themselves out to others;
      this adds to estrangement between community members.
     Among external factors:
••    Essential support from foreign remittances may suddenly dwindle, as
      was the case with the war in Libya. Pastoralists may resort to illicit activ-
      ities to fend for their households.
••    The very lucrative nature of criminal activities can entice particularly
      younger generations to earn a living through these activities.


     Key Messages and Further Research Needs
     •	 Pastoral livestock keeping is risky and provides highly variable livelihood support, but
        on  ­average it is financially attractive. There is some room for expansion and absorption of
        ­population growth.
     •	 However, livestock ownership is consolidating in the hands of the wealthy; poor and small
         herder households, which are already highly vulnerable, are increasingly being crowded out.
     •	 On the other hand, illegal activities are highly lucrative for the main traders and are also
         attractive to the recruited labor from pastoral backgrounds.
     •	 Whether young or poor pastoralists will choose pastoralism over crime will depend not only
         on how successful governments and development agencies are in enhancing the attractiveness
         of pastoralism but also on emphasizing social cohesion within communities that can help
         prevent particularly the younger generations from taking part in these activities.
     •	 More work is needed on the current and future attractiveness of livestock production for dif-
         ferent wealth categories of pastoralist households.
     •	 Although likely, more evidence is required on whether successful pastoral development leads
         to a reduction in destabilizing activities.

  However, other factors tend to mitigate the conflict drivers mentioned
above:
••   Livestock raising has been and will likely continue to be financially
     attractive. Further productivity gains are possible in the areas of animal
     health, breeding, and, for some regions, water development.
••   Population growth within pastoral communities is lower than among
     the sedentary population, and flock size per household and per pastoral-
     ist is going up.
••   Integrated development projects can show the way forward, provided
     they tackle both infrastructural equipment and institutional capacity
     building for maintenance and conflict resolution (see “Resource Access
     Dynamics and Conflict” and “Development Experiences” sections).


Resource Access Dynamics and Conflict
This subsection reviews the major elements of resource access: changes in the
demography, production system, and land use are described, along with issues
related to communication infrastructure and territorial control. The main
drivers of conflict related to resource access are then identified, together with
relevant resilience factors.
   Production system, land use changes, and conflict resolution. In the past,
pastoralists and crop farmers in the Sahel enjoyed peaceful interactions and a
strong symbiotic relationship although, as early as the 14th century, the histo-
rian Ibn Khaldun wrote of conflicts between nomadic populations in North
Africa and the peoples within emerging states (Blench 2001). In general, how-
ever, pastoralists benefited from the grazing of crop residues such as millet
straw, and crop farmers benefited from the manure droppings, which helped
maintain the fertility of their cropland. These interchanges were based on pure
commercial principles; pastoralists paid for the grazing of crop residues in areas
with a high livestock but low crop farmer density, and crop farmers paid for
pastoralists to night corral their animals in areas with a low livestock but high
cropping density (McCown, Haaland, and De Haan 1979). Further interaction
included a lively barter of milk for grain; and, as crop farmers began keeping
livestock, they gave their stock to pastoralists for herding (gardiennage, or care-
taking), and pastoralists provided the crop farmers with animals for traction.
   However, these symbiotic relationships have radically changed over the
past two decades. Crop farmers increasingly invest in livestock, whereas pas-
toralists are forced to take up cropping because their herd size falls below the
minimum to sustain their household. The reciprocal incentives for coopera-
tion are therefore disappearing, and the relationship is turning competitive as
parties vie for access to dry season grazing and water and crops are damaged
along transhumant routes.
   In most cases the conflicts are resolved at the local level. For example,
one study covering conflicts on four sites in the southwestern part of Niger
over a three-year period found that 75 percent of the farmer/herder conflicts
were resolved at the local level (Turner et al. 2012). However, these localized

conflicts around resource access can be at least one of several d      ­ rivers for
escalation to a more violent and regional conflict, as is evidenced by a recent
OECD/Sahel and West Africa Club (SWAC) report (2010a) for the Tuareg
rebellions in Niger (1990–1995); Mali and the Ganda Koy self-defense move-
ment (1990–1996); the food crises in Niger (2004–2006); the Darfur war
(2003–2006); and earlier conflicts between the Maure and the Fulani in the
Senegal River region.
   It has been argued that the frequency and severity of resource access c­ onflicts
might worsen because of climate change. However, the direction (drying or
greening) of climate change for the Sahel illustrated by different models is
unclear (OECD and SWAC 2010b). The analysis of security events in the Sahel
in this study highlights the absence of climate change’s general and direct
impact on security. The higher interannual rainfall variability that is generally
expected might have an indirect effect (via food security), however.
   Population growth, migration, and resource conflicts. Competition for
resources has and will continue to be exacerbated by population growth and
forced displacement. The common theory is that the nomadic pastoralist
populations have lower natural population growth rates than sedentary
farming populations. For example, in a study of two villages in Niger, Swift
(1977) reports that the nomadic Fulani and Tuareg had an annual growth
rate of 11 per 1,000 people, whereas the semi- and fully sedentary groups,
and all rural peoples together, had an annual growth of 23–25 per 1,000.
While some of these data are challenged (Randall 2012), in part because of
their limited sample size, there is a general agreement that this is not the case
for the Tuareg because of their general adherence to monogamy. Forced dis-
placement is a serious issue in the region. There are an estimated 1.1 million
people forcibly displaced as a result of conflicts in the Sahel (­particularly the
western area); of these, two-thirds are refugees and one-third are internally
displaced persons. Only estimates exist on this point, but it seems that at
least 50 percent of these displaced people are pastoralists. Though solidar-
ity and c ­ ommunity-based hosting of the displaced has been an important
feature of displacement across the region, it has also created tensions
between groups and created major strains on both pastoralist and farming
communities. Protracted displacement adds to grievances and trauma and
can easily fuel conflicts.
   Another resource access–related conflict issue driven by the security situa-
tion concerns migration, such as what has developed in Mali over the past
two years. It is estimated that because of this crisis, about 220,000 people have
fled the country, mostly to Mauritania and Niger (IOM 2013). Such a massive
influx of refugees to border areas can cause serious conflicts.
   Axes of communication, territorial control, and telecommunications.
The realm of pastoralists consists of expansive distances, with very few
transport infrastructures and available vehicles. Asphalted roads are an
exception; sand or mud tracks are the rule. Excessive rain makes cross-
ing  the  Niger River and its tributaries very challenging. Mobile telephone
service only exists in town areas. Border checkpoints are too few, improp-
erly manned and equipped, and not linked to each other or to regional or

18	                                          Pastoralism Development in the Sahel
central authorities. Of particular relevance for the future of pastoralism is
the conservation of transhumance routes, which are infringed upon by
ever-extending cropland areas (Cissé, n.d.; McPeak and Turner 2012). These
routes also suffer from political strife, as was recently exemplified in the
2012–2013 Malian crisis.
   The main link between pastoralists and illegal trade is their detailed
knowledge of the terrain and of alternative communication methods.
Pastoralists know exactly where international boundaries lie and how to
transgress them with minimal loss. They excel in moving from one hideout
to another and in adapting travel arrangements and routes to unfold-
ing  situations. Their traditional skills combined with new technologies
 four-wheel drive trucks, mobile and satellite phones, global positioning
(­
system) can be used for  both legal and legitimate activities or for illegal
(although not always illegitimate) ones.
   In conclusion, several resource accessibility factors constitute a high
conflict risk. These factors are mainly internal:

••    First, the growing competition between sedentary people and pasto-
      ralists for access to water, grazing, transhumance routes, transport infra-
      structure, and markets poses a security risk. This risk is aggravated by
      pastoralists’ increasing inability to complement their diminishing income
      from livestock-keeping activities. The pressure on resource access will
      increase with rapid population growth and without concerted action to
      ensure adequate access to dry season grazing and water.
••    Second, localized conflicts around resource access may escalate to vio-
      lence and degenerate at the regional level.
••    Third, the growing population and lack of employment opportunities
      within or around the pastoralist system make illicit activities more
      attractive.
••    Fourth, pastoralists can easily contribute to illicit activities using their
      unchallenged knowledge of uncontrolled, unpatrolled terrain.

     Among external factors:
••    The arrival into an area of refugees who have been displaced because of
      conflict or humanitarian crisis can lead to heightened tension and
      competition over access to resources.
      ­

  On the other hand, certain factors tend to curb the escalation of violence in
conflicts related to resource access:

••    Conflict resolution systems often operate efficiently at the local level;
      ways to improve these mechanisms will be discussed in the “Development
      Experiences” section.
••    Given the fast-growing economies in the countries south of the Sahel,
      other sectors could absorb the surplus unemployed youth.
••    Pastoralists’ knowledge of the terrain could be used positively against
      criminal activities, provided government authorities show them respect
      and decently reward their services.

     Key Messages and Further Research Needs
     •	 Relationships between crop farmers and pastoralists have shifted from symbiosis to competi-
        tion and conflict over access to grazing, crop residues, and water.
     •	 Local resource access conflicts have the potential to scale up to the regional level.
     •	 A more inclusive and profitable pastoralism could dramatically improve the relationship
        between pastoralists and public authorities, enabling them to monitor roads, tracks, and space.
        In such a context, improved communication infrastructure would serve populations and
        security forces more than criminals.




Social and Political Dynamics and Conflict
This subsection presents the main features of pastoral societies in their socio-
cultural and political dimensions. Despite an apparently stronger awareness
of the pastoralists’ predicament, recent evolutions have conspicuously
launched social drivers. Some resilience factors are still potentially available,
but these need careful treatment to be utilized.
   The sociocultural dimension. Historically, pastoralist societies were built
on traditional hierarchical structures with strong social group cohesion and a
specific cultural pattern. This strong social cohesion, and the transboundary
nature of pastoralism (many herds move from the northern Sahel to the
northern parts of the coastal areas in search of grazing and water) explain the
lesser sense of nationality and belonging and allegiance to a particular state
than the rest of the population. However, more recently, several important
forces have weakened that social glue and altered cultural identity priorities:
••    Modern methods of communication and outmigration—in particular
      by youth unable to find employment in the pastoral sector—expose these
      societies to other structures and ideas. Contact with urban life, and some-
      times with foreign countries, and mobile telephones easily transform the
      rather peaceful fatalism of traditional pastoralists into an aggressive
      willingness to correct injustices, the magnitude of which they discover
      ­
      suddenly. In addition, pastoralists are usually religiously radicalized via
      contact with Sahelian and Saharan cities.
••    Increased consolidation of livestock ownership by wealthy absentee
      owners dramatically changes interclan power and prestige relationships
      and enhances overall inequality.
••    Women, already important in pastoral societies, are developing into
      social, economic, and political actors who have both positive and nega-
      tive contributions to conflict situations (Ibrahim 2013; Nori, Switzer, and
      Crawford 2005; Possémé-Rageau 2006).
••    Traditional authorities have lost a significant amount of prestige and
      authority among community members, either because they have been
      implicated in faulty governmental policies or because they have been
      associated more or less forcibly with criminal groups.

20	                                             Pastoralism Development in the Sahel
               ••   The archaic lineage model is impaired—the younger generation feels
                    much less morally and socially indebted to the older one, and therefore
                    youth no longer automatically respect their elders. Because they are often
                    deprived of education that would upgrade their prospects, the young
                    make allegiance to traffickers or to religious radicals who open unprece-
                    dented opportunities for them.7
               ••   Finally, it is unclear what role the continued existence of slavery (Brynn
                    2008) plays in illicit activities.
                  The political dimension. Pastoralists view government and administrative
               structures with a lot of suspicion. Their main grudges concern arbitrary
               limitations of their freedom of movement, unjustified taxation, lack of
               protection, and government failure to keep its promises (see box 2.1
               below). They feel excluded from national life, hardly enjoy any concrete
               benefits from the state, and do not trust their political representatives. On
               ­
               the other hand, governments and other national and international agencies
               have invested in pastoral development, and have made a major impact, along
               with other investments in water development and animal disease control. In
               particular, the eradication of the Rinderpest has removed one of the main
               ­
               disease risks to pastoral herds.
                  Rent seeking further weakens the respect and social status afforded by for-
               mal and traditional leadership. With 2012 Corruption Perceptions Index
               rankings of 105, 113, 123, and 165 for Mali, Niger, Mauritania, and Chad
               respectively, the main Sahelian countries all fall in the lower part of the global
               rankings. Reports exist of rent seeking by security and customs authorities
               and of state complicity in crime (Lacher 2012).




Box 2.1  Failed Promises in Mali
Commitments to pastoralists by state or regional authorities have often remained unfulfilled. For
instance, in Mali’s Kidal region, it is interesting to compare what has been requested and prom-
ised with what has been accomplished. Take for example the time period from February 2007
(the publication of a report by the director of the Programme Intégré de Développement Rural
de la Région de Kidal, or PIDRK) to January 2012 (the beginning of the armed rebellion in the
Kidal region and the attack on Ménaka) (Maiga 2010). The PIDRK director had suggested a set
of actions to improve breeding/pastoralism in the Kidal region that included (1) water and feed
for livestock, drilling water wells, and regenerating pastoral grazing areas; (2) sanitary cover of
livestock (only 1 vaccination park existed in the region in 2007, whereas it needs about 15 for
camels and 6 for bovines); (3) trading (construction of well-equipped livestock markets and a
refrigerated slaughterhouse in Kidal, close to the airport, to export meat to the Maghreb and the
Middle East); (4) professionalization of the sector’s actors (opening a vocational school dedicated
to agriculture and pastoralism to train pastoralists’ sons to become technicians in community
development). None of these actions were carried out, and the 2012–2013 war destroyed the few
preexisting achievements.

   Coexisting, overlapping, and competing traditional and formal gover-
nance structures greatly constrain transparency in decision making. This
leads to so-called “forum shopping,” where litigants seek the institution they
assume to be most receptive to their complaints. Pastoralists, who are less
integrated, have fewer opportunities for such forum shopping. However, a
recent trend that is mildly encouraged by foreign donors favors some return
of traditional authorities in the governance of local issues such as water man-
agement, but not in pastoral land control, which has become a prerogative of
mostly crop farming–dominated communal authorities (Mamoudi and
Sougnabé, n.d.).
   Decentralization of power could, in principle, lead to better inclusion
of pastoralists in the governance structure and herald significant benefits
in a very diverse ecological and cultural area (Mohamed, n.d.). Under
the decentralization laws, locally elected government bodies (rural coun-
cils) are legally responsible for delivering social and economic services
(health, water, education, marketing, and so on) and for drawing up
local  land use plans for agricultural, forestry, pastoral, and other uses.
However, it is often also a partial abdication by the central government,
and power is devolved without adequate budget allocation. Moreover,
many local civil servants have no experience conducting participatory
planning processes. As a result, they fail to address the specific needs of
­
certain groups such as pastoralists, as well as women and other marginal-
ized communities.
   Finally, growing insecurity has caused Western governments to ban their
nationals from visiting the Saharo-Sahelian areas, reducing to naught the
benefits of a promising tourism sector, which was bringing employment
opportunities, additional income, and self-esteem to the local population.
International organizations and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)
have also drastically reduced their presence in these regions. Pastoralists
have therefore lost one of their only advocacy channels at a time when their
dialogue with state authorities has become more problematic than ever. A
consequence of these two factors is that the gap between the periphery and
center of modern states is getting much wider.
   In conclusion, there are many social and political drivers of conflict
that push pastoralists, in particular young ones, to join illicit or extremist
groups:
••    First, feelings of exclusion, injustice, or utter neglect prompt pastoral-
      ists, especially young ones, to become outlaws.
••    Second, the breakdown of collective cohesion is exemplified at two dif-
      ferent levels: the community level, which is marked by estrangement
      between elders and youth, and the national level, between the (semi)
      nomadic pastoralists and sedentary people. At both of these levels, reli-
      gious radicalization adds fuel to the fire.
••    Third, the waning of traditional governance structures drives conflict.
      No satisfactory substitute for the so-called decentralized institutions
      exists.

22	                                         Pastoralism Development in the Sahel
Key Messages and Further Research Needs
•	 Multiple sociopolitical trends contribute to the region’s declining stability.
•	 These include the declining authority of traditional pastoralist rulers due to increased rebel-
   lion of youth and the emancipation of women; unclear and overlapping geographic and
   administrative functions and increasing rent seeking; exclusion of pastoralists because of cen-
   tralization or decentralization without budget; and the emergence of a new, better-educated,
   armed class from formerly poorer and lower parts of the pastoral hierarchy.
•	 In addition, this new and better-educated class is reportedly increasingly involved in violent
   and extremist behavior. As noted above, more work is needed on the background, motivation,
   and dynamics of the groups behind the destabilizing activities in the region.
•	 An aggravating factor is pastoralists’ weak political representation and their limited access to
   state funding.




               ••   Fourth, the absence of state presence in pastoral areas creates a vac-
                    uum that invites insecurity. Examples include the circulation of small
                    firearms and ethnic rebellions by people who have accessed political
                    power through violence.
                  Fortunately, however some social and political factors curb the escalation
               of violent conflict:
               ••   There have recently been some positive attempts to include pastoralists
                    in decision making at the local and national level. For example, pastoral
                    associations are now active in Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal. Pastoral
                    codes, although poorly implemented, support the rights of the pastoral-
                    ists (see “Development Experiences” section).
               ••   Integrated schemes or programs for pastoralists have been tested, with
                    promising results. They have even more chance of succeeding when they
                    focus on youth and women, since these two groups are crucial to the
                    social dynamics of pastoral societies.
               ••   There seems to be increasing political awareness of the plight of pasto-
                    ralists. For instance, the N’Djamena (May 29, 2013) and Nouakchott
                    declarations (October 29, 2013) on the contribution of pastoral livestock
                    to the security and development of the Saharo-Sahelian region have rec-
                    ognized pastoralists’ critical role in maintaining stability (Elevage Pastoral
                    2013). However, it remains to be seen whether these new intergovern-
                    mental initiatives will be fully implemented.

      establishing sharia rule; against Sufi brotherhoods and heterodox forms of Islam;

Pastoralism Development
Experiences to Enhance
Stability
Development Experiences
This section summarizes the effect, particularly on security, of the main pas-
toral development activities being implemented by governments and the
development community. Over the last several decades, the World Bank’s
activities to develop this region have included Bank-funded projects support-
ing pastoralists in Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal, and in East
Africa in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Uganda. The Bank continues these efforts via
the Regional Pastoral Livelihood Resilience Project (RPLRP), which initially
covers Ethiopia, Kenya, and Uganda, and the Regional Sahel Pastoralism
Support Project (PRAPS), which covers the Sahelian countries of Chad, Mali,
Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal. Lessons can be learned also from World Bank
projects on community development, such as the Community Actions
Program (CAP) in Niger, now in its third and last phase, which started by
empowering small village organizations, then village clusters, then communes
(assisting democratically elected people). A number of communes covered by
the project are considered “pastoral”—because of their population, and the
rather promising launch of the Stratégie pour le Développement et la
Sécurité des Zones Saharo-Sahéliennes du Niger (SDS Sahel-Niger)—with
actions programmed according to the prevailing situation in each commune.
However, as with pastoral development ­       projects in the past, the postproject
sustainability of these activities still has to be proven.
  The section below is not a comprehensive review of pastoral development.
There is no comprehensive recent detailed review of World Bank experiences
available, and this falls outside the framework of this note. The description
below is based on extensive literature from experts, technical organizations,
and think tanks. World Bank–focused reviews included those by De Haan
and Gilles 1994; De Haan et al. 2001; English 1999; Fratkin and Mearns 2003;
Pratt, LeGall, and De Haan 1997; World Bank 2009.
  The consensus on good practices that emerges from these pastoralism
development experiences includes the following points: (1) enhance
resource access and mobility, (2) promote conflict-resolution mechanisms,
(3) support pastoral associations, (4) support livestock marketing, (5) sup-
port food aid and food security, (6) support technological interventions to
improve productivity, and (7) support education services. However, devel-
opment interventions also have negative impacts, particularly if they are
designed and implemented in ways that are insensitive to the social, eco-
nomic, and political realities of pastoralist societies. Experts, technical

 organizations, and think tanks have reached consensus on the points
­discussed below.
    Enhancing resource access and mobility will reduce conflicts, and in par-
 ticular their escalation to a wider level. Several Sahelian countries have passed
 various pastoral laws or codes that define the rights of the pastoralists,
 including Mauritania (2000), Mali (2001), Burkina Faso (2003), and Niger
 (2010) (Toutain et al. 2012, 47). Thébaud and Hesse (2008) offer a balanced
 review of these codes’ contribution to pastoralism, saying they are

  …a key feature of pastoral systems in the Sahel… There are provisions for giving herders’
  rights over the common use of rangelands, priority—albeit not exclusive—rights over
  resources in their “home areas” as well as rights to compensation in the event of losing
  their lands to public interest needs… Greater recognition of customary tenure arrange-
  ments, including the principle of decentralised natural resource management, the mul-
  tiple and sequential use of resources by different actors at different times of the year (e.g.,
  herders’ access to harvested fields) and the need to manage conflict at the local level, are
  other innovative features of significance… With the exception of the pastoral code in
  Mauritania, all of the laws adopt a very technocratic and development-oriented
  approach in support of pastoralism. This is particularly apparent in Burkina Faso’s pas-
  toral code. Provisions exist, for example, for the establishment of special grazing reserves
  (zones pastorales aménagées)… It seeks to replace customary systems of resource access,
  driven by what is perceived by outsiders to be rather “messy” processes of social and
  political bargaining between actors, with a more orderly and technical system. This, it is
  believed, will make pastoral production in the Sahel more secure… In these contexts
  water rights are crucial to manage grazing lands sustainably, and endow pastoral
  communities with assets that can be negotiated to access distant resources in times of
  ­
  crisis… The water code does not establish a functional link between access to water
  and access to grazing, as if these resources were independent of each other. The role of
  management committees is limited to surveillance of the water infrastructure, excluding
  the use of grazing resources or control over the number of livestock using the well.
  (Thébaud and Hesse 2008)

   Niger’s pastoral code is more recent (2010) and probably the most advanced
because it very explicitly recognizes that “mobility is a fundamental right of
herders and transhumant pastoralists.”1 Implementation is still incipient in
part because of lack of funds, but conflicts have practically disappeared in the
regions where transhumance corridors have been marked.
   Facilitating mobility has been a hot topic over the last decade, as govern-
ments view mobile pastoralism as backward and difficult to control and pre-
fer to support ranching. A good overview of the superiority of mobility is
provided by the International Institute for Environment and Development
(IIED) and SOS Sahel International UK (IIED and SOS Sahel International
UK 2011). This study provides convincing comparative data on different
levels of mobility. For example, pastoralism produced 155 and 158 percent
­
more protein per hectare than commercial ranches in Kenya and Botswana
respectively and generated 150 percent more profits (in U.S. dollars) in
Zimbabwe. Similar data were reported in Mali. Data from Niger also con-
firm the superiority of the nomadic system. However, the promotion of
nomadic mobility has not yet received genuine support from Sahelian
governments, who until recently only paid lip service to this cause, but
­
as  mentioned above is now formally endorsed in the Nouakchott and
N’djamena declarations.2

   There is a good experience with conflict-resolution mechanisms, which
were discussed in the “Resource Access Dynamics and Conflict” section, about
disputes between pastoralists and crop farmers. Literature highlights the bene-
fits of local and informal mediation (Swift, n.d.). It is reported that, while
75 percent of these conflicts find peaceful settlement, 25 percent may escalate to
a more violent and regional scale (Little, n.d.). It can reasonably be argued that
preventive measures could restrain such escalation. But prevention demands
long-term efforts that go beyond local capacity: They must involve the popula-
tion, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), local and central government,
and development agencies. In addition, prevention is not only about providing
services (health, water, sanitation, education, veterinarian services, energy, and
transport infrastructures); it also involves the provision of civic and political
benefits, especially effective electoral representation and judicial services.
   Decentralization, which was discussed in the “Social and Political Dynamics
and Conflict” section, could be in some cases another way to support the
political and economic inclusion of pastoralists. Although it has been success-
ful in, for example, World Bank projects in East Africa, it often remains ham-
pered by the local administrators’ lack of participatory skills. A 2013 World
Bank/CCSD–commissioned study by the Overseas Development Institute
(ODI) titled “Innovations in Service Delivery: International Experience in
Low-Density Countries” raises the issue of decentralization and challenges
the assumptions behind the rationale of decentralization in itself as a
peace-building measure. “Evidence suggests that it is the extent and form of
decentralization, and the nature of its implementation, as well as the broader
governance environment, that are key determinants of how services are
provided” (ODI 2013). The study concludes that the decentralization
­
model must not only fit the context (Anglophone or Francophone, conflict
affected, low-density population areas, ethnically diverse, and so forth) but
must also be driven by a local and national-level dialogue around what kind
of state and process are desired. The report makes the case that this is of
increased importance when dealing with nomadic or seminomadic popula-
tions such as pastoralists, as well as in conflict-affected environments where
processes of reconciliation and access to justice need to be an integral part of
service delivery.
   Improving local governance and institution building to benefit local
governments does not rank high enough among the priorities of the Sahel’s
development programs, and the linkage with pastoral communities is still
too weak, although experts have identified possible improvements (Bonnet
and Hérault 2011; Bossuyt and Gould 2000; Dufourcq 2013; IIED 2003;
IIED 2006, 58). In the 2013 ODI study mentioned above, a section on hybrid
approaches to governance and service delivery stresses the fact that it is diffi-
cult to balance strengthening local governments that are essentially state
structures with allowing and including customary institutions in local gover-
nance systems. Although hybrid structures composed of both customary and
state elements have sometimes worked, as in the case of community policing
programs in Afghanistan, they also have negative effects. Consider the case of
the Republic of Yemen, where traditional chiefs were included in the state’s

Pastoralism Development in the Sahel	                                          27
sheikh system. In the long run their authority was undermined because they
became viewed as being co-opted by political interests, which allowed the
state to push forward its agenda in rural areas without paying much attention
to state-building efforts. The ODI report thus concludes that the need to adapt
institution building and service delivery is particularly relevant in the Sahel;
populations there are highly diverse and animosity often exists toward the
state, as is the case in certain pastoralist populations. Differentiation of formal
and informal entities is also important where these may work against each
other, particularly when dealing with the resolution of disputes.
   Supporting institutions of collective action (pastoral associations) can
help amplify pastoralists’ voice, increase their inclusion in the national policy
debates, and, in principle, reduce the temptation to participate in illegal
activities. Regional or national pastoral associations have had some success to
­
this end, although their impact is often mitigated when the elite capture the
decision making. These associations can also provide a successful framework
for much-needed service delivery, such as veterinary services, which can even-
tually be combined with human health services. A good example of an inte-
grated service has been the combination of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia
(CBPP) and child vaccination campaigns in Chad, which increased vaccination
coverage of young pastoralists and reduced costs (Weibel, Schelling, and
Zinsstag n.d.). Pastoral associations have been less successful in supporting
the introduction of improved range management and sustainable operation of
water infrastructure. In any case, regarding the latter, care must be taken to
create the appropriate institutional framework to (1) avoid conflicts, (2) ensure
sustainable operation and maintenance, and (3) avoid range degradation.
   Marketing can play a useful role in reducing the vulnerability of poor pas-
toralists. Some local market development might be needed, but generally the
traditional sector is quite efficient; it is preferable to avoid heavy public sector
involvement. The public sector (including the regional centers) should play a
bigger role to support stratification3 of livestock production with higher
potential zones, as well as to establish mechanisms and incentives for early
destocking and restocking.4
   Food aid often neglects the pastoralists. If poorly delivered—for example,
if the aid ends up on the black market or benefits the wealthy—it can cause
discontent and contribute to rebellion. Reasons for the lack of a timely and
effective response in affected pastoral zones include lack of available informa-
tion; refusal to declare an emergency; greater complexity of intervention in
pastoral areas; security constraints for international staff; and lower priority
given to the pastoral zones by donors and governments (Sahel Working
Group 2011). If not designed and implemented correctly, food aid can sup-
press local production and distort livestock prices and food markets.
   It should also be noted that, from a purely military standpoint, Hendrix and
Brinkman (2013) argue that, while increases in food insecurity can be a source
of grievances that fuel rebellion, acute and severe food insecurity also has a
dampening effect on conflict behavior because unpopulated areas and food
insecurity diminish the resources available to militants. Rebel movements
typically do not grow their own food and instead depend on voluntary or

28	                                          Pastoralism Development in the Sahel
               coerced contributions from the population. Drought depresses rural incomes
               via reduced agricultural and livestock production, and the scarcity makes it
               more difficult to find locals who are willing to aid rebels and also makes the
               population less likely to join rebel movements. Whatever the case, food aid
               policies must, from the moment food is delivered, help recipients regain their
               capacity to maintain their livestock and grow their own crops, and they should
               not crowd out local production.
                  Technological interventions (animal health, water development, range
               management) always get high priority in discussions with pastoralists.
               The  vast and sparsely populated areas make it practically impossible for
               the public veterinary facilities to provide regular services beyond the annual
               vaccination campaigns. Basic animal health care systems use para-­   veterinarians
               and community animal health workers and have generally provided
               good results if they are supported by the public sector and not seen to be in
               competition with it (Niang 2004).
                  Education services5 are also essential to promoting stability. Pastoralists
               tend to lack the education and skills required by the modern world, and girls
               are especially vulnerable to falling behind. The significant education-related
               challenges on the provider side include high costs and difficulties in recruit-
               ing staff and on the student side include scattered and mobile populations,
               child labor, illiteracy, and parents who resist education, in particular for girls.
               No good model exists yet for the Sahel, but successful examples are found in
               Mongolia (with boarding schools), in the Islamic Republic of Iran (with
               mobile schools), and in Australia (with radio schools). A combination of
               these methods will be necessary for the Sahel.
                  Development interventions must take into account the specific needs of
               populations forcibly displaced by drought or conflict. Forced displacement
               as a result of conflict affects approximately 1.1 million people in the Sahel, a
               large portion of them pastoralists (Global Program on Forced Displacement
               2013). Forcibly displaced pastoralists in the Sahel usually fall into the category
               of refugees, although they are also internally displaced in some cases, which
               means that they have lost access to their habitual pastoral living space charac-
               terized by their mobility (Schrepfer and Caterina 2014). Loss of mobility and



Key Messages and Further Research Needs
•	 The overriding principle for supporting pastoralists is that the public sector needs to adapt its
   structure and modalities of service deliveries.
•	 Pastoralists should not be fit into the model the state has defined for urban and sedentary
   populations; rather, the state should adapt its structure specifically to meet pastoralists’ needs.
•	 Another important principle is to take into account the needs of vulnerable populations such
   as the disabled, elderly, extremely poor, youths, and the forcibly displaced.
•	 More work is needed on the lessons learned from pastoral development, not only from a port-
   folio review of World Bank projects but also from the large number of activities by national
   governments, other donors, and NGOs.

placement into camps create heightened vulnerability and poverty of pasto-
ralists because livelihood opportunities are limited and the ability of pastoral-
ists to retain their livestock is particularly daunting. Special efforts are needed
to support the return of pastoralists to their original settlements or, if this is
not possible, to help them to maintain their pastoral life and economy, which
might mean interventions that help them to reconstitute their herds.



Stabilization and Improving Security
The above development experiences have already shown promising results.
However, their common limitation lies in the fact that they have not system-
atically integrated a stabilization component. This is in line with the conclu-
sions of the recent conference, Responding to the Challenges of Security and
Fragility in West Africa, that “development actors may no longer shun security
problems in West Africa” (World Bank and French Ministry of Defense
2013). As from now, they should accompany African societies in their transi-
tion and help them to weather their mutation without violence, rather than
only serve them again the technocratic discourse on capacity building. This
assertion is fully valid in the case of pastoralism.
   The lesson that emerges from these experiences is that, in order to be
successful in an unstable environment like the Sahelo-Saherian areas, devel-
­
opment of pastoral society needs to integrate close attention to the way the
development efforts can affect stability.
   Therefore, stabilization policies must comprise at least three main ele-
ments: (1) trust and confidence building, (2) protection measures that are
adapted to physical constraints and to the population’s needs, and (3) regional
cooperation.
   It will be critical to establish trust between the pastoralist population and
the state, including security forces. The goal is to foster a relationship in which
pastoralists and the surrounding communities cooperate with government
authorities on mutually developed security initiatives and develop a commu-
nity system of alert for security threats, thereby depriving criminals of local
intelligence and logistical support. However, to this end, at least two prereq-
uisites should be met:
••    Investments must be made in service delivery; initially in crucial security,
      justice, and conflict resolution mechanisms, as well as basic services and
      infrastructure to upgrade the population’s living conditions; pastoralists
      should be confident that they have not been abandoned by authorities.
••    Better governance and a political settlement that addresses grievances
      will foster a more confident relationship between security forces and
      “positive influencers” (elected and customary leaders, for example).6
   The cost of conventional policing in remote and immense pastoralist
areas cannot be sustained—the total length of Maghreb-Sahel states’ borders
is about 40,000 kilometers, including 7,466 kilometers for Mali and 6,200
kilometers for Algeria. On the other hand, a flourishing pastoral economy in

30	                                          Pastoralism Development in the Sahel
the Saharan borderlands is essential to the political stability and security of
these areas.7 Therefore, specific means must be envisaged that are adapted to
the terrain.
  The following challenges currently exist:
••   Pastoralists continue to view the army as a repressive institution that
     fails to carry out its main mission, i.e., ensure stability. Moreover, efforts
     to improve the army are often contradicted by a heedless implementation
     of disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR), whereby
     ­negative elements from armed rebel groups get promoted into the regular
      army.
••    The gendarmerie in some places has a better image, but its on-the-ground
      presence is too limited and its chain of command inadequate—a defect
      shared by other security forces.
••    The police are concentrated in capital cities and major urban centers. The
      public also holds them in low esteem.
••    Customs is among the most corrupt institutions. Unless tariffs with
      Maghreb countries get harmonized, customs will continue to be part of
      the problem rather than the solution.
••    Intelligence services are also part of the problem because of their associ-
     ation with criminal groups.
••    Self-defense “civil” guards are also part of the problem. For instance, the
      Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa (MUJWA) originates from
      militias created in the 1990s by Arab, Fulani, and Songhaï groups to fight
      against Tuareg rebels.
••    “Camel Corps,” inspired by colonial experience, may help improve secu-
     rity in remote areas. Such is the case in Chad, with the National and
     Nomadic Guard (La Garde Nationale et Nomade du Tchad) (Khamis and
     Pratt, n.d.). This option is worth considering because it ensures a state
     presence in wild, semidesert areas and is adapted to the pastoralist life-
     style, though camels can hardly compete with four-wheel drives.
   Subregional development and stabilization cooperation is essential.
The focus countries should be Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and possibly
North Sudan, given the violence in Darfur related to pastoral routes and
resource access. The Maghreb countries, in particular Algeria and Libya,
should also be involved. In light of its supposed connections with regional
stability, pastoralist development, which has long been somewhat neglected
in national, regional, and international policy agendas, has recently gathered
significant political momentum. For instance, the N’Djamena Declaration
(May 29, 2013) on the contribution of pastoral livestock to the security and
development of the Saharo-Sahelian region recognizes the critical role pasto-
ralists can play in maintaining stability. The Nouakchott Declaration on
Pastoralism, adopted by six Sahel countries in October 2013, demands that
pastoralism be placed at the center of strategies and policies promoting devel-
opment and stabilization (Nouackchott Declaration 2013). In the Horn of
Africa, a Regional Drought Disaster Resilience and Sustainability Platform
launched by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) in

Pastoralism Development in the Sahel	                                           31
   Key Messages and Further Research Needs
   •	 Although there is consensus around key principles for pastoral development; the key
      constraint is the judicious integration of the different interventions into a comprehensive
      ­
      approach that combines stabilization and development measures at the national and subre-
      gional levels.
   •	 Security and justice as basic services are at the heart of a successful development and stabili-
      zation approach because they gain the trust and confidence of the population in the govern-
      ment, and they must be integrated into project design from the start.
   •	 Regional cooperation and collaboration around a consensus-built framework on pastoral
      development and stabilization needs to be strengthened and the World Bank could provide
      support to regional institutions.
   •	 More work is needed on the “economics of stability,” i.e., comparing the broader economic
      returns (including its ripple effect on the regional economy) of increased stability resulting
      from effective pastoral development investments.



November 2011 benefits pastoralist economies by engaging all relevant stake-
holders in the region to share knowledge and coordinate their interventions.8
Furthermore, the Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel (CILSS) is an
important technical partner, and South-South cooperation should be
strengthened between CILSS and IGAD initiatives. Several security initiatives
have already been launched, but these have been minimally executed at the
continental and regional levels (African Union, Economic Community of
West African States, Joint Operational Army Staffs Committee, and Fusion
and Liaison Unit).
   A subregional database could also be a significant asset to support judi-
ciary cooperation and actions. Strong and sustainable support of national
judiciary systems would help prosecute the subregion’s main criminals, whose
connections with local security forces and governments have offered them
impunity up to this point. Such initiatives would enhance governance,
improve the population’s sense of justice, and make fighting organized crime
more efficient.

      savannas), where they will be fed (“finished”) on good feed. The better feeding at

     can result in better access and also encourage the more remote herders to sell their
     weakened animals. An example of a successful pilot comes from Ethiopia. See

Section 4

The Way Forward
We find that pastoral development and stabilization in the Sahel should
focus on the following principles: (1) developing and strengthening a posi-
tive, participatory state presence in underdeveloped and pastoral areas,
which are usually characterized by low population density and low levels of
governance and high border porosity, with the goal of enhancing the state’s
ability to provide security, justice, and other basic services and improving
infrastructure; (2) maintaining mobility and resource access for pastoral
populations; (3)  strengthening health and education services, adapted to
local livelihood conditions; (4) opening livelihood prospects for youth;
(5)  enhancing the social, economic, and political inclusion of pastoralists
into local and national decision-making processes; (6) facilitating outmigra-
tion of surplus labor to other occupations or higher-potential or urban
regions; and (7)  ­maintaining pastoralists’ cultural identity. Therefore, the
approach must feature comprehensive support of pastoralist society and be
focused on addressing problems of inequality, local governance, and
improved relationships with states. It should fulfill the population’s basic
social, cultural, and economic needs and build trust in state authority.
   As discussed, pastoral development alone will not solve the problem of
deteriorating stability.1 Nevertheless, it will encourage populations to rely on
social services; this reliance foments dependence on public institutions and
encourages trust in government.
   Pastoral development must become an integrated package to be promoted
in real partnership with target populations. It should focus on employment
generation, increasing productivity, and reducing pastoralists’ vulnerability. It
must also strengthen education, animal and human health services, and
infrastructure development in underused areas, and recognize pastoralists’
rights, including mobility.
   Pastoral development must be accompanied by measures to enhance sta-
bilization. Necessary prerequisites should be met in terms of security and
justice provision, infrastructural efforts, and governance. These measures
must encompass training security forces with a strong local component
(although the World Bank cannot be involved in providing direct support in
this regard, partnerships should be established with relevant authorities on
the ground); rewarding the use of local knowledge and skills against criminal
activities; and providing access to security and justice to the local population
as a trust-building mechanism. Foreign partners will also need to engage in
long-term commitments.
   Given the guiding principles outlined above, the following specific policy
recommendations emerge from this note:
1.	 Provide a “level playing field” for pastoralists, in particular by conduct-
    ing dialogue with them on an equal basis and by designing development

34	                                         Pastoralism Development in the Sahel
                     interventions according to their needs, rather than to the needs of
                     governments.
               2.	   Eliminate the arbitrary (and often informal) taxation of transhumance
                     routes and livestock trade.
               3.	   Clarify the roles and mandates of traditional and formal governance to
                     ensure unbiased conflict resolution.
               4.	   Strengthen pastoral codes and their implementation, with the aim of
                     reducing limitations on movement and improving secured access to
                     water and dry season grazing, while mitigating conflict resulting from
                     emerging land grabbing.
               5.	   Stop competition from dumped powder milk and imported meat, which
                     stalls investments in local breeding activities.
               6.	   Induce the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to
                     strengthen its lead on regional integration issues, and specifically to see
                     that its decision/regulation on transhumance becomes implemented in a
                     more effective and expedient manner.




Box 4.1  Proposal for Pilot Development Areas in Mali:
Ménaka and Tessalit
Ménaka and Taoudeni received regional status in December 2011. Ménaka is a major livestock
area, and Taoudeni is an important transhumance sector. Pilot projects could be promoted in
these two new regions. Focusing on the Ménaka region would be particularly relevant, for the
following reasons:

•	 It is a symbol: Every rebellion starts in Ménaka, with militants from Kidal (1990/2012).
•	 It offers a favorable context for pastoralism and breeding (geography, pasture, tradition,
   ­
   population); it is thus a good place to improve/develop/professionalize pastoralism.
•	 It has a multiethnic population with a tradition of peaceful relationship/cohabitation (Tuareg,
   Songhaï, Peul).
•	 It can be used as leverage on subregional stabilization: at the border with Niger, close to
   Niamey, on the Kidal/Tahoua-Tassara axis (strategic in terms of both trafficking and
   pastoralism).
•	 It is the right time in terms of governance (it is a new region and has positive, authoritative,
   and legitimate influencers, such as the Amenokal of the Ioullimiden).

Tessalit municipality (including the border town In-Khalil), in the north of the Kidal region,
could also be a pilot area, because of

•	 its location (border with Algeria);
•	 significant infrastructures (airport; well at In-Khalil—a drilling belonging to the municipality,
   which provided revenues until 2012);
•	 a multiethnic population (with a long tradition of contacts with Westerners, until
   recently); and
•	 the strategic importance of the In-Khalil axis, in terms of both trade and security.


               Pastoralism Development in the Sahel	                                                   35
   As a first step, such an integrated package could be tested in pilot areas
where the population is receptive to combating illicit activities and institu-
tional prospects are favorable. Lessons for an integrated approach could be
taken from the launching of the Stratégie pour le Développement et la
Sécurité des Zones Saharo-Sahéliennes du Niger (SDS Sahel-Niger)
(Mohamed, n.d.). Communes are to be the entry point for actions envisaged
by SDS Sahel-Niger, with actions programmed according to the prevailing
situation in each commune; local responsibility, internalization of implemen-
tation, and ownership by populations will be encouraged. However, financial
pledges in support of SDS Sahel-Niger need to be confirmed. The main ­foreign
partner is the European Union, and Niger is to supply as much as 50 percent
of the financing.
