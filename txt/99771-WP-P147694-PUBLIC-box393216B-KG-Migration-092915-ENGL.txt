EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This paper examines the impact of labor migration1 from a welfare and social development perspective.
Rather than focusing on regulatory and legal aspects determining migration, this note centers on the impacts
of migration on the domestic welfare of households2 in the Kyrgyz Republic. The profiling of labor
migration and identification of knowledge gaps are used to inform the development of strategies for more
effective and sustainable welfare impacts from labor migration and remittances.

Trends
The report begins by taking stock of the number and characteristics of labor migrants. What types of
individuals are leaving the country? Since labor migration is fundamentally a household decision, the
characteristics of the household are examined next. Are migrant households benefitting from remittances
and labor migration? How are households faring in terms of housing and the education of children? How
are household members faring in terms of their labor choices, wages, and what are the educational choices
of the youth? Lastly, what are the monetary benefits of labor migration? Are households with migrants
better off than households without migrants3?

Labor migration has been an increasingly large phenomenon beginning in the early 2000s. During the
period where survey data is available4, roughly 200,000 labor migrants are counted in the survey, a number
much lower than other estimates5, but still about 10 percent of the working population.

Labor migrants are not a random segment of the population, and are motivated by economic considerations.
Minimum wages in the Kyrgyz Republic is the lowest among all CIS countries, even lower than its poorer
neighbor Tajikistan. Similar to other countries, migrants are mostly young males with low education and
from the poorer southern rural regions. They, work in low-skilled occupations and over time skilled
manufacturing workers have reduced while unskilled workers are more common.

Since 2008, hourly wages abroad (by sector and profession) have slowly declined, while real wages
domestically has increased. These two factors lead to a declining wage differential from working abroad.
This trend is not fully explained by changes in demographic characteristics. A declining wage differential
can strongly impact incentives to migrate as well as remittance income. In fact in the data, we do see a
decline in the number of labor migrants in recent years, however, it is not clear if either of these trends will
be long-term.

Migrant households have low levels of domestic sources of income and social assistance. In recent years,
households with members who are labor migrants are becoming more dependent on remittance income, and
therefore more vulnerable to economic shocks. For example in 2008, 34.4 percent of total income in migrant
households were from remittances compared to 46.1 percent in 2013. It appears at least from the data that

1 Labor migration in this report refers to migration abroad, and in the case of the Kyrgyz Republic, migration mainly to Russia.
The welfare of internal migration is not extensively discussed. Since there is no official migration survey, this report uses publicly
available Labor Force and Household Budget Surveys. This obviously yields technical measurement and representativeness
challenges that are discussed in detail in the Annex.
2 Households are differentiated between being migrant and non-migrant, which has some advantages over classifying households

as either remittance or non-remittance receiving. Differentiating households by those who have migrants, takes into account that a
labor migrant reduces the domestic labor supply of a household and that some households with migrants may not receive
remittances at all. Therefore, this captures a more holistic measurement of the welfare impacts from labor migration.
3 For this question, it is important to take into account the selection process of becoming migrant households.
4
  The primary data source for this report is the Kyrgyz Integrated Household Survey 2008-2013. At the time of this
report the 2014 data is not yet available but would reveal interesting trends in light of recent regional economic
challenges.
5
  Other estimates range from 500,000 to even a million labor migrants.

                                                                 vi
there is an increasing divide between households that receive enough income through domestic channels
and do not need any additional sources of income, and households who are becoming more dependent on
remittances as an income source and safety net.

Poorer regions have higher rates of migration. In terms of welfare, migrant households are getting poorer.
In fact, in 2013, the poverty rate of migrant households exceeded non-migrant households (39 vs 36.7
percent respectively6). This is in sharp contrast to just 5 years earlier where the poverty rate of migrant
households was much lower than non-migrant households (23.9 vs 33.9 percent respectively). Many of the
temporal determinants and drivers of these trends are difficult to decipher using the KIHS for reasons that
are explained more fully in the Annex. To put shortly, the analysis in this report is completed using data
that is not ideal for studying migration in both its structure and variable content. A comprehensive migration
survey would be incredibly insightful and useful.

Current Context
Recent events have made labor migration in the Kyrgyz Republic a central topic of interest. The slowdown
of the Russian economy, devaluation of the ruble, and pending accession into the Eurasian Economic Union
(EEU) all have implications on the impact of labor migration towards domestic welfare. National accounts
data have shown large declines in remittances in November and December of 2014 (NBKR). It will be
important to corroborate this with household data from 2014 as national accounting confounds transfers
that are remittances and transfers that are business transactions (Mogilevsky and Atamanov, 2008).

The impacts from accession into the EEU is one of the main points of interest for policy makers.
Umurzakov, Poletaev, and Hasaova (2014) provide some insights to potential impacts based on 16 expert
interviews. In terms of welfare, there are many implications as Kyrgyz labor migrants will not be subject
to tightening Russian migration controls and regulations. With accession to the EEU, Kyrgyz migrants will
have the same rights as other laborers in Russia. At the time of this report, the Kyrgyz Republic has yet to
join the EEU, and has delayed entry a number of instances. The timing of its accession is a point of
uncertainty. If the Kyrgyz Republic does ascend, labor migration will have few bottlenecks as member
countries will enjoy free movement of labor. However, as long as the Kyrgyz Republic is not a member,
benefits from labor migration will diminish as the minimum cost to migrate climbs to 317 USD including
recurring costs such as monthly fees for patents (Titov, Prokhorova, and Chavez, 2015).

In the short-run, the event of a large flow of return migration to the Kyrgyz Republic seems unlikely. The
latest migration figures show that return migration to the Kyrgyz Republic is much lower than its neighbor
Tajikistan, which will not join the EEU in the short run. Tajik labor migrants will surely face these new
Russian migration laws. On the other hand, labor migrants from the Kyrgyz Republic may be waiting for
ascension after which these new costs will no longer apply to them. Over the period March 2014-2015, the
stock of Kyrgyz migrants in Russia declined by only 0.97 percent while Tajik migrants reduced by 6.8
percent.

However, labor migration is still policy relevant. As recent migrant households are more vulnerable than
before since they have higher dependency on remittances; policies to increase the development impacts of
remittances are also more relevant than ever. Moreover, in 2013, migrant households became poorer than
non-migrant households for the first time over the period with available household data. How do we
increase the development impacts of remittances? This question can be framed from the perspective of how
to increase the amount of potential labor earnings through pre-migration policies, how to make it easier to
send remittances home, and how to educate migrant households to make more productive use out of these

remittances. McKenzie and Yang (2014) review the evidence of policies that increase the development
impact of international migration.
Policy Recommendations
From the regulatory side, the amount of government involvement in labor migration has been small,
especially considering how labor migration is a very large phenomenon. This is an area where the
government may choose to participate more. Many non-regulatory policy recommendations are also
suggested.

      1. Government facilitation of labor migration: Government intervention and oversight can improve
         welfare and migration outcomes. In the Kyrgyz Republic, migrants abroad are less educated and
         rely on networks rather than government programs when finding work abroad (Beishenaly, Levant,
         Ormonbekova, and Shamsiev, 2013). This can lead to underpayment and informal work
         environments. Moreover, the government may pursue bilateral labor agreements with ideal
         destination countries. Agreements can ensure the placement of labor migrants under well-known
         conditions. The facilitation of labor migrants can also be built in a before, during, and after
         framework. Before-migration policies include training, skills development, and job placement.
         During migration facilitation can be monitoring and protecting migrants. After migration policies
         can involve placement in the domestic labor force and utilizing new skills to spur domestic
         entrepreneurship.

      2. Learning from International Experiences: Examining the Philippines7 case and their relationships
         with other countries can offer valuable expertise in managing labor migration policies. The
         Overseas Workers Welfare Administration in the Philippines was established in 1977 to provide
         social and welfare services. It is highly regarded as a very successful program. Regional lessons
         can also be drawn from existing World Bank projects in other regions.

      3. Diversifying destinations: To reduce dependence and regional risk, migrants should diversify their
         choice of destination countries. The Kyrgyz Republic’s reliance on Russia and Kazakhstan may
         largely be a language issue. The institution of language schools can be a solution to increase the
         choice of destination countries.

      4. Guarding against shocks: Migrant households ex-ante have lower levels of domestic income
         (social assistance, pension, and domestic wage incomes) and use remittances as an income “shock
         absorber”. Income and consumption patterns of migrant households are more volatile than patterns
         in non-migrant households. Moreover, the poverty rates of migrant households are increasing over
         time. A stronger study on the vulnerabilities and social status of labor migrants would be useful.
         The government may also wish to help migrant households think of innovative ways to protect
         against shocks by developing appropriate financial instruments.

      5. Financial Literacy: Migrant households in the Kyrgyz Republic underspend remittances in
         investment (Akmoldoev and Budaichieva, 2012). This paper also finds that migrant households do
         not spend any more on education than non-migrant households. The development of financial
         instruments for migrants such as micro-insurance or savings products to invest at home can help
         enhance the impact of remittances. Knowledge on financial literacy is powerful for reducing the
         cost of sending remittances home, increasing the returns from remittances through investment and
         savings, and increasing the sustainability of remittances as a source of income. Financial training
         such as budgeting and money management can also be a useful tool especially for pre-migrants.

        For example, in the Philippines, the government provides financial training before labor migrants
        depart as well as deposit options to minimize the cost of sending remittances.

    6. Skills: Pre-migration training and government support can create pathways for labor migrants into
       better jobs in higher skilled sectors. The bulk of Kyrgyz labor migrants work in low skilled
       occupations and the majority have completed only general secondary education. Training,
       upgrading of skills, and recognition of skills in countries of destination would help migrants secure
       better employment in host countries, earn more income, and obtain better jobs when they return
       home.

    7. Data monitoring of return migrants: Labor migration unarguably plays a large role in the
       economic welfare of Kyrgyz citizens. While this report profiles labor migrants and their households
       to the best extent possible8, there are still important knowledge gaps that need to be filled that
       cannot be answered using existing surveys. For example, what are return migrants doing and where
       do they work? Do young migrants return to school? These are all important questions to understand
       the longer run impacts of labor migration. Are the number of labor migrants really declining?


International organizations and the government the Kyrgyz Republic are familiar with many of the
recommendations listed above. There is great progress on many fronts as the Kyrgyz Republic works to
better serve its labor migrants. For example, the IOM has helped launch employment centers in Bishkek
and Osh. The World Bank has facilitated technical assistance and expert consultations on improving the
legal and institutional framework for migration management. These efforts should continue as well as filling
knowledge gaps for the purposes of enhancing the development impacts of labor migration.

 There are many challenges to studying migration without a proper survey honed to examine this topic specifically.
For example, the lack of sample rotation in the KIHS does not ensure year to year representativeness.

                                             CHAPTER 1
                                              INTRODUCTION

1.1     Kyrgyzstan is a sending country in terms of international labor migration, and the impacts of labor
migration are of interest for a number of reasons. One is the sheer size of remittances as a proportion of
GDP; over a third in 2013. There are a large number of individuals who are labor migrants; estimates
ranging from half a million to one million. Another point of interest is the evidence from other countries
that migration and remittances are welfare enhancing (World Bank, 2010ab; Adams Jr. and Page, 2005;
Acosta et al, 2008). Yet, contrarily at the macro-level, remittances have not been found to promote
economic growth (Clemens and McKenzie, 2014).

1.2     Understanding Kyrgyz migration and its relationship to employment and domestic welfare is
extremely important in the current period. The recent Russian crisis and devaluation of the Russian ruble
has put a strain on labor migration and remittances, which are channels for safety nets and income
generation. Since the majority of Kyrgyz migrants work in Russia, the Russian economic downturn is
expected to impact the Kyrgyz Republic a great deal. How will the welfare of households be impacted as
income from remittances start to decline?

1.3     Income, economic reasons, and unemployment are leading indicators for migration. The vast
majority of Kyrgyz labor migrants aboard are in Moscow (92 percent), and most of the remaining are
located in Kazakhstan (8 percent) according to an Eurasian Development Bank report (2013). The
difference in incomes that a labor migrant earns in Moscow compared to in the Kyrgyz Republic is
substantial, as much as 10 times more a month. The majority of labor migrants are employed in low skilled
occupations.

1.4      A large proportion of the domestic population benefits from some amount of remittances. In the
national surveys, about 20 percent of households have a member who is working abroad. As the crisis in
Russia begins to unfold, and return migration increases, it is important to evaluate who labor migrants are,
what their families are like, and what are their characteristics. These insights will help the country prepare
for the amount of return migration.

1.5      This is not the first time that the Russian economy faced an economic crisis affecting remittance
flows to the Kyrgyz Republic. In 2009, remittances to the Kyrgyz Republic dropped as the Russian GDP
contracted by 7.8 percent. This did not affect remittance flows drastically, which is consistent with existing
literature that finds remittances flows to be resilient in times of crisis, and also be consumption smoothing.
(Sirkeci, Cohen, and Ratha, 2012; Kose, Islamaj, Ratha, De, and Yousefi, 2015).

1.6      However, common reasons why remittances may be resilient during times of crisis may not apply
to the current Kyrgyz context and the current Russian economic downturn. Remittance flows in November
and December of 2014 have already shown visible dips. Foremost, in the current economic conditions, there
are added challenges such as currency devaluation, tougher migration policy, and regulations that are
making labor migration to Russia less lucrative, easy, or attractive. The cost of passports to go abroad,
permits, new requirements for proficiency tests in Russian language and history are all new costs to
migration that did not exist during the 2009 financial crisis period. There is an absence of diversification of
destinations for Kyrgyz migrants; in 2014, the vast majority of migrants are in Russia. A component of
Kyrgyz migrants are seasonal and more vulnerable to shocks. The majority of Kyrgyz migrants are also

1.7     Existing literature on Kyrgyz labor migration often focuses on the amount of remittances received
rather than welfare of the domestic households. ADB 2008 study (Mogilevsky and Atamanov, 2008)
provides a comprehensive study of remittances in Central Asia with a focus on financial sector and fiscal
considerations. However, there is less a focus on welfare aspects. An EDB 2013 study focuses on push-pull
factors of migration but also does not focus on its impact on domestic poverty (Beishenaly, Levant,
Ormonbekova, Shamshiev, 2013). A recent World Bank migration survey on skills has a migration
component but few migration questions (CALISS, 2013).

1.8     Labor migrant is a strategy for individuals and households to improve their welfare when it cannot
be achieved domestically. Since not all labor migrants from the Kyrgyz Republic choose to remain in their
host country and remittances are sent to family, the intention is fundamentally to improve household
welfare. This note examines trends in labor migration and ultimately at the household level. Many studies
on the benefits and resilience or remittances has been carried out using macroeconomic data. The collection
of national aggregates of remittances is fundamentally different than its collection at the household level.
Since macro trends in remittance recordings often confound private and enterprise related transfers, they
are less ideal for studying household and individual welfare. Collection at the household level is more
revealing of household-level welfare impacts.

1.9       The following sections are arranged as follows. The note begins with a brief description of the data
in Section 1. Section 2 examines the number and characteristics of labor migrants. Section 3 examines and
compares the distribution and characteristics of households with and without labor migrants. The welfare
impacts of labor migration are explored in Section 4, namely the impact of remittances on poverty reduction
and socioeconomic outcomes. Section 5 concludes. Annexes also provide important information on the
data; its structure and limitations.

2.1     As a proportion of the population, the number of labor migrants abroad in the Kyrgyz Republic is
very high. In 2013, the country had a population of approximately 5.7 million people. In some estimates,
the number of labor migrants is as high as one million. Since such a large proportion of the working age
population is abroad, it is important to track this figure, understand who they are, what they are doing, and
how this is impacting domestic development and growth.

2.2     The Labor Force Survey (LFS) in the Kyrgyz Republic Integrated Household Survey (KIHS)9
allows for the identification of labor migrants as household members who are absent and working abroad.
An employed individual is identified to be either a domestic worker, an internal migrant, or a migrant abroad
based on their location of work in the quarterly LFS. When these workers are absent from the household
during the time of the interview, other household members can report on their employment and wage details.


                                                    A.     THE NUMBER OF LABOR MIGRANTS


2.3     Over the period 2008 to 2013, the number of labor migrants captured by the Kyrgyz Republic
Integrated Household Survey averaged around 200,000. The number of labor migrants increased from
2008 to 2011, but then fell in 2012 and 201310, both in the number of internal and international labor
migrants. The largest increase in the number of labor migrants abroad was the period from 2008-9 right
before the financial crisis. The Russian economy rebounded in 2010 after the financial crisis, but since then,
GDP growth has been declining. In 2012, the country experienced a year of zero growth. Continued declines
in migration abroad may be influenced by Russia’s poor economic growth and currency devaluation. In
2013, the growth rate of GDP in Russia was 1.3 percent.

9The 2008 to 2012 data is based on sampling that originated in 2003 using the 2001 Census. In 2013, a new sample was drawn.
10As a caution, it should be noted that poor household rotation in the sample may exaggerate some trends. For example, if the
survey is not sufficiently rotated, average age would increase.


                                                                           3
2.4     Seasonality in migration is present since migrants tend to return home during the winter
(Error! Reference source not found.). This is corroborated in the LFS data since there are generally the
ewest number of workers in quarters 1 and 4 of each year when the weather is colder. Many labor migrants
work in construction, and they would be least likely to work these times of the year.

2.5      The number of labor migrants in the KIHS is lower than estimated by other sources. The
National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic estimates the number of labor migrants abroad to
be 457,000 in 2011 and the Eurasian Development Bank (Beishenaly, Levant, Ormonbekova, and
Shamsiev, 2013) estimates over a million. Other expert estimates of 25 percent of the labor force is abroad
(Umurzakov, Poletaev, and Hasanova, 2014). It is possible that labor migrants who have been away from
the household for a prolonged period of time are not included in the KIHS roster. Adult relatives that have
moved away to work may not be considered by respondents to be in the household, even though these
households receive remittances from them. Another possible reason for the low count of labor migrants is
that entire families who have moved abroad would be missing from the KIHS. Russian administrative data
on the number of migrants are not clear since there is a break in 2011/2012 on how migrants are counted.

2.6     In 2012, the Kyrgyz economy experienced a period of zero growth, which affected all types of
household absenteeism. Low growth should be a push-factor that increases the number of labor migrants
abroad. However, the number of labor migrants actually decreased in 2012. One possibility is that as it
became relatively more expensive to travel abroad and existing migrants abroad simply started sending
more money home. Absence from the household also decreased in the Kyrgyz Republic for other reasons.
The overall decrease in absent household members in 2012 is substantial as the number of members living
with relatives dropped more than half, and the number of students abroad also dropped.

2.7      Workers abroad comprise about 10 percent of the total employed work force ( Figure 2.2).
While domestic employment levels has been slowly increasing since 2009, employment of internal and
international labor migrants have experienced larger fluctuations and sharp declines beginning in 2012.

11 While there is a sharp decline in internal migration in 2013, there are no real indications that internal labor migration has
experienced a decline, and this trend may be a result of resampling in 2013. Since internal migrants is a relative small proportion
of the total sample of individuals, these estimates may not be robust


                                                                      4
                            B.     CHARACTERISTICS OF LABOR MIGRANTS


2.8      Labor migration is an individual or collective household choice often made under economic
considerations. Individuals who have difficulty finding work in their current location will choose to
relocate where they think they can find a job or receive higher returns. Households with low domestic
income in terms of wages or social assistance will seek income sources from abroad. For example, younger
and more able-bodied members may go work if older members are not earning enough or not receiving
sufficient social assistance. In the Kyrgyz Republic, the wage premium from working in Russia and
Kazakhstan is a pull factor for the poor and rich alike.

2.9      Labor migrants working abroad are more likely to be male, younger, and less likely to be married
than workers who remain in the Kyrgyz Republic. Error! Reference source not found. illustrates basic
haracteristics of labor migrants as well as domestic and internal migrants for comparison. Labor migrants
are not likely to be the head of household, but rather the sons and daughters in the household. Migrants who
are heads of their own households tend to participate in internal migration, likely so they are not away from
their families for too long. While international migrants live with their parents, about half are also married,
suggesting that labor migrants are part of intergenerational households.

2.10     Males are much more likely to leave the country for work. In 2010, this gender gap closed a bit,
when the proportion of female labor migrants abroad was at its largest share over this period, 29.4 percent.
In 2010, the number of labor migrants increased in total as well. The addition of females could be similar
to the “added-worker” effect that is seen by other countries during times of crisis as well. In Turkey, during
the financial crisis, the proportion of married females participating in the labor force increased, to
supplement household wages.

2.11    Social networks are key in facilitating migration. The presence of family and friends abroad is
a strong determinant for migrants deciding to emigrate, and the expat community also provides assistance
and support in looking for a job and finding accommodations. The presence of immigrant occupational
networks has been repeatedly observed across different countries and migrants of different nationalities.
Networks facilitates in job search. Not only that, migrants who succeed in certain occupations or have tried
and tested the labor market have many advantages. Patel and Vella (2013) find that immigrants in
occupations with a large existing network of fellow countrymen in the same occupation earn higher wages
than immigrants in occupations without a network.


Age and Education

2.12     Labor migration is a common activity among individuals who are young. In 2013, on average
migrants abroad were 28.2 years of age compared to 36.7 years for domestic workers. In 2013, about 17
percent of workers between 15 and 24 years of age were working abroad. Not only is this a large proportion,
it also means that these individuals are not enrolling in higher levels of education. It is unclear if these
migrants are only delaying their education or never return to school to pursue higher education. The
proportion of young workers who were abroad peaked in 2011. In 2011, 21 percent of working youths aged
15-24 were abroad at some point in the year.

2.13    Labor migrants abroad are less educated. About two-thirds of labor migrants have completed a
general secondary degree, which is expected from a young pool of migrants who work in low skilled jobs.
Domestic workers are much more educated than both internal and international migrant workers; over a
third have completed a specialized secondary or tertiary degree. Perhaps enticed by relatively high earnings
for low-skilled work, the composition of labor migrants abroad has become less educated over time (Figure
2.4). The average of labor migrants has not changed significantly over this period.

2.14    Out-migration of youths is similar to some extent to other country experiences. Migrants have
lower safety nets and are more likely to be early school leavers. In the EU countries, this is based on migrant
vulnerabilities compared to the native population (Nouwen, Clycq, Ulicna, 2015). While this is a different
scenario since all Kyrgyz are natives, the EU case is comparable in the sense of who are the socially
vulnerable.

2.15     Low returns to education abroad can discourage youths from enrolling in higher education.
In fact, enrollment in tertiary education in the Kyrgyz Republic has been flat since 2009. The dominance
of migration among the population may lead to under development of human capital in the country.
Chiquiar and Hansen (2005) find similar trends of migrants from Mexico to the United States. McKenzie
and Rapaport (2005) also illustrate that migration and low returns to education has a disincentive effect on
education attainment

2.16     Forward looking, one important policy and development consideration is to increase the
understanding of the welfare of young workers and their families after migration. When the young
are spending their youth as labor migrants, this puts pressure on the quality of the labor force in later years.
If the prospects of migration are affecting the educational decisions of the youth, this could be a severe
social problem. The majority of labor migrants have intentions to return to the Kyrgyz Republic; only 6 and
9 percent want to stay in Russia and Kazakhstan respectively (Beishenaly, Levant, Ormonbekova, and
Shamsiev, 2013). Therefore, their educational and career plans upon return are important to understand as
well. Using the current survey, since individuals cannot be tracked, it is not possible to understand the
dynamics of return migrants.


Sector and Labor Market Characteristics

2.17    Over time, the composition of professions of labor migrants abroad has stayed primarily in
manufacturing, though the proportion of manufacturing workers has shifted from skilled to
unskilled (Figure 2.6). In 2008, an estimated 112,700 labor migrants worked in skilled manufacturing and
31,468 worked in unskilled manufacturing. By 2013, only 72,245 worked in skilled manufacturing and
88,917 worked in unskilled manufacturing. The proportion of labor migrants working in unskilled
manufacturing increased from 15.8 percent in 2008 to 44.6 percent in 2013.

2.18     The professions of migrants differ from those of domestic workers (Figure 2.7). In contrast to
domestic workers, the majority of migrant workers abroad are mainly employed in manufacturing and lower
skilled work. The top three professional classifications, which includes 96.4 percent of migrants are skilled
manufacturing, unskilled manufacturing, and service workers. The majority of internal labor migrants,
though to a smaller degree, also work in these three professional areas. The primary differences between
domestic workers and those who migrate are the shares of workers in high medium professions and
agriculture.

2.19     Comparing the sectors of employment, migrants abroad primarily work in construction and
retail sectors. Construction is the top sector of employment of migrant workers abroad, though the share
of workers in this sector has declined from 2008 to 2013 (49.3 to 35.3 percent respectively). In 2013, the


                                                                     7
percent of labor migrants in retail is 35 percent, if the trend continues, construction will no longer be the
top sector of employment.

2.20    One good trend is that the proportion of labor migrants who are working in informal
contracts or verbal agreements is declining. In 2008, 58.4 percent of migrants abroad worked under
verbal agreements compared to 37.6 percent in 2013 (Error! Reference source not found.). Moreover,
he decline in informal contracts is present across all professions.

2.21     Some literature finds that return migrants are more productive, spur innovation, or hold
more patents than workers who never migrated. These are all potential benefits of migration. A negative
aspect is occupational downgrading of migrants when abroad. These are all important questions which are
not easily answered using the KIHS and LFS. Principally because individuals cannot be tracked across
years or quarters. Return migrants cannot be identified, and pre-migration labor history cannot be tracked.
These are just some reasons why a migration specific survey would be indispensable.


Wages

2.22     Economic reasons are the primary motivation to migrate. An EDB report on labor migration in
the Kyrgyz Republic finds this to be almost universally the reason in poorer regions, and to a small degree
lesser in wealthier regions or Bishkek (Beishenaly, Levant, Ormonbekova, and Shamsiev, 2013). In the
EDB survey, very few cited other reasons for migration such as political instability of skill acquisition. The
official minimum wage in the Kyrgyz Republic is lower than even in Tajikistan; $17 per month and $52
per month respectively12. At these levels, a household with two adults earning minimum wage would be
living below poverty.

2.23     Average monthly wages across almost all sectors are higher abroad, but barely so by 2013.
Figure 2.8 illustrates average wages by location of work. Average hourly wages are shown for the top three
sectors and professions in 2008 and 2013. Wages are predominantly from work in Russia. Wages earned
by workers abroad are two or three times higher than domestic workers in manufacturing. In the sectors
that are most common to labor migrants, workers earn about double that of domestic workers. Construction
is the most popular sector for labor migrants abroad, however, average earnings of labor migrants is lower
than earnings of natives in host countries. In 2012, construction workers of Russian nationality earned an
average of 25,13113 Russian rubles in the previous month, or about 33,676 Soms.

2.24    Wages are higher abroad, however the premium from working abroad has diminished over
time (Figure 2.9). From 2008 to 2013, the difference between domestic and international hourly wages
have diminished. Wages are becoming more similar because both domestic wages are increasing and
because foreign wages are declining or flat. This could also be related to changes in the composition of
workers as the Kyrgyz labor migrant becoming younger and less skilled, though composition is not fully
explanatory of the diminishing wage gap.

2.25     Figure 2.10 illustrates the wage premium from working abroad for the top 3 professions across all
years. The decline in the gap between foreign and domestic hourly wages has been shrinking in
manufacturing from 2008 to 2013 almost year to year. Domestic wages in the last period increased faster
than foreign wages. In the most recent period of survey data, domestic wages have increased in the two
most popular migrant sectors; construction and services. This may coincide with the presence of domestic
skill shortages.

2.26    The percent of domestic services firms citing an inadequately educated workforce as a major
constraint has also increased from 2009 to 2013 (Figure 2.11). In the latest 2014 administrative data, over

half of migrants in Russia are in the services sector. The lack of adequacy can be related to the shortage of
skills as more and more labor migrants are working in the services sector abroad. The proportion of
manufacturing firms that site the constraint to be a major one has increased at a much smaller degree.

2.27     Macroeconomic conditions influence the number of labor migrants as well as their earnings.
While the number of labor migrants was highest during the crisis, average income was also the lowest
(Figure 2.12). By 2013, average monthly earnings of labor migrants was much lower than in 2008 with the
number of labor migrants also declining. The number of workers with zero income was higher in 2009 and
2011. This suggests that the crisis did not deter the volume or quantity of workers, but there were price
effects that resulted in lower returns to labor migrants. The lower returns actually increased the number of

             Notes: Sample = workers aged 16-64, and working abroad. Wages are income from primary work (zarplata). Quarterly labor force
             population weights are applied (vesakv) for quarterly data, and annual weights are applied for annual statistics (vesa1). Monetary
             values are in 2010 KGS, adjusted by the CPI. Zero income is removed for coding reasons. In the KIHS, zero reported income
             captures different scenarios. Zero can be because there is zero income, the household does not want to respond, or the household
             does not know.

3.1      Since many labor migrants are abroad to provide income for their families and not solely for
individual gain, it is important to observe migration trends at the household level as well. Understanding
the type of households that benefit from migrants is also a useful profiling exercise. It is very possible that
certain types of households have a higher propensity to migrate than others. For example, households with
low domestic income through wages or social assistance are more likely to have members of the household
who are migrants.

3.2     Migrant households are defined as those who reported at least one household member whose
location of work is abroad in any quarter from the Labor Force Survey14. This is a better indication than
defining migrant households as only those who receive positive remittances. To illustrate the full impact of
welfare from labor migration, it should be accounted the instances where households have migrants but did
not receive remittances as well as the difference in the domestic household labor supply.


                                         A.         REGIONAL AND ECONOMIC DISTRIBUTION OF HOUSEHOLDS


3.3     Over time, the proportion of households with labor migrants has declined (Figure 3.1). In
2008, 19 percent of households had at least one labor migrant abroad, compared to 12.6 percent of
households in 2013. Note that if an entire household has migrated, then this household would not be a
candidate in the KIHS. This is one possibility for the underreporting of migration in the KIHS compared to
national statistics.

3.4     Rural regions have higher proportions of migrant households than urban areas. Over time,
the number of migrant households has dropped dramatically in rural areas, and only marginally in urban
areas. The percent of migrant households in rural regions ranged from 26 percent in 2008 to 19 percent in

14
  Another source of information to identify workers is the household roster. However, internal and international migrants cannot
be differentiated using the household roster. Only in the LFS, can labor migrants be differentiated between internal and international
migrants. There are small instances where absent household members reported in the Q1 household roster are not present in the
LFS, but this is a very small proportion. Since the LFS is available for four quarters, it is a better instrument for using to identify
households with migrant workers.

2013 (Figure 3.2). This large decline translates into approximately 150,000 to 200,000 households annually.
About 9-11 percent of urban households had migrant workers abroad; or about 50,000 households, a number
that remained relatively stable over the period of analysis.

3.5      The incidence of labor migration varies across regions. It is interesting why there is virtually no
migration in Naryn while its neighboring region Osh has one of the highest rates of labor migration.
Network effects are undocumented but can influence the concentration of labor migrants. For example, if
certain labor migrants in Issykul became very successful abroad, they may attract even more migrants from
the same region. Migrants abroad will often live together with other members from the same village.

3.6     Southern regions with the largest number of poor, also tend to have the highest rate of
migrant households. In both urban and rural areas, Osh, Jalal-Aba, and Batken have the highest rate of
migrant households; and at rates much higher than other regions (Figure 3.3). Southern regions are some
of the poorest regions. This is not surprising since economic reasons such as unemployment and low
domestic wages are the primary drivers of migration. These regions don’t necessarily have the highest
poverty rate, but do have some of the largest number of poor (Error! Reference source not found.).

3.7     There are regions that are poor with also very little international migration. For example, the
Dzhety-Oghuz district in the Issy kul oblast has a very high number of poor as well but the Issy kul region
has a low rate of international migration. There regions also do not have high levels of internal migration.

3.8      The drop in the number of labor migrants in 2011-2012 appears to be driven by a termination
of migration activity rather than migrant households moving to out of the country. This can be seen
by examining a sub-sample of panel households that are in the sample continuously from 2008 to 2012.
Error! Reference source not found. in the Annex illustrates the proportion of households exiting and
ntering the survey. The highest proportion of migrant households exiting the survey was between 2009 and
2010, where 13.3 percent of households were migrant households. Moreover, there was also a large amount
of migration activity in the population since 8.7 percent of the newly sampled households were also migrant
households. However, overall migration activity began to slow down. Between 2011 and 2012, only 9.9 of
exiting households were migrant households and 5.1 percent of replacements were migrant households.

3.9      As stated earlier, possible reasons for a slowdown in migration are improving wages
domestically and lower wage premiums from working in Russia. However, estimating the flow of
migrants is difficult and often imprecise, with levels varying from source to source. Moreover, the structure
of the KIHS survey, with poor household rotation, results in a data set that is more longitudinal rather than
cross-sectional. Therefore, there may be some bias in the year to year trends. However, it is some comfort
that the number of migrants continues to decline in 2013 when the sample of households was refreshed.
This seems to indicate a real decline in the proportion of households that are migrating. Though, the true
nature of this is best revealed in a survey that is specialized with migration questions where these dynamics
can be asked more directly.



                 B.    CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOUSEHOLD AND HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS


3.10     The composition of households and migrants themselves is an important point of study. Many
studies on remittances and labor migrants are conducted using small scale qualitative focus groups
(Tynaliev and McLean, 2011; Isabaeva, 2011) or is based on earlier data (Agadjanian et al, 2008;
Mogilevsky and Atamanov, 2008). After such recent events as the 2010 revolution and financial crisis, a
current study of labor migrant profiles is useful. Remittances are highly poverty reducing among migrant
households. Due to the current economic down turn, both remittances and labor migration is expected to
decline.

3.11    Labor migration, both internal and foreign impacts social aspects of life. Labor migrants in the
recent period are extremely different than those twenty years ago. The types of households that have migrant
household members are also changing. The migrant members are less likely to be the heads of households,
but rather adult children. Current migrants are young, and often skip the prospects of a college education
and immediately immigrate to Russia after high school.

3.12    Error! Reference source not found. illustrates the many differences in the characteristics of
igrant and non-migrant households. Consistently across all years, households without migrants are
smaller, however their dependency ratio is higher indicating that households without migrants have larger
shares of children or elderly. The dependency ratio for migrant households is lower. It appears that the
choice of migration is not necessarily investment into the youth. Instead there is more evidence that
remittance income is being spent on assets. Households without migrants also are better educated. A larger
proportion of heads of household in non-migrant households have a higher education, and less likely to
have lower levels of education.

3.13     Error! Reference source not found. shows regression results on the determinants of being a
migrant household controlling for a variety of characteristics simultaneously. Migrant households
have lower social income and lower dependency ratios, lower levels of education, and are located in rural
areas. The migrating youths from these households are low skilled and their households are poor. Migrant
households have lower pension and social assistance income, or social pre-migration income. The choice
to migrate could is driven by vulnerability and to earn additional income to supplement low levels of income
that is acquired domestically. Contrary to research in other countries, the sheer size of households itself is
not so much a determining factor of being a migrant household versus the dependency ratio of the
household.

much more likely to be working in agriculture and have unspecified labor contracts. In non-migrant
households, a larger proportion of employed members work in high medium occupations. Over time,
domestic workers in non-migrant households are more likely to be females. The average education level of
domestic workers in migrant households are also higher, which highlights the selection of younger less
educated workers traveling abroad to earn higher wages, whereas individuals with higher education may

3.15   Heads of household in migrant households are less likely to be employed than their
counterparts in non-migrant households. In migrant households, members are working less, either
because they are unable to or there is no need to because of large remittance income. The gap in the
employment rate in urban areas has widened over time, the gap has narrowed in rural areas (Figure 3.3).

3.16     Table 3.3 illustrates the determinants of employment for household members that are located
domestically, focusing on if these individuals are more likely to work if they are in a migrant or non-migrant
household. From 2008-2010, domestic working age household members in migrant households were less
likely to be working than similar household members in non-migrant households. Starting in 2011, they
were more likely to be working. The reason for the increased employment of domestic workers may be
related to the lower power of remittances and reduction in wages from abroad. Note that the wages from
abroad should be an upper bound of remittances sent home since some foreign wages are spent abroad.
Domestic workers in migrant households earn less than those in non-migrant households. This is true even
after controlling for a number of individual and regional characteristics ( Error! Reference source not
ound.).

3.17    In migrant households, employment rates for 15-18 year olds are much higher than in non-
migrant households (Figure 3.5). While young people are completing basic primary and secondary, they
are not pursuing higher education. Kroeger and Anderson (2014) find that during the volatile period of
2005-2009, boys aged 14-18 from remittance receiving households were less likely to be in enrolled in
school than others. Though the effects they find are small, remittances did not improve education outcomes
of male children in remittance-receiving households.

3.18     There are many positive economic aspects of migration, but also many social costs. For
example, divorce rates have increased, especially in southern regions where migration rates are high.
Disunion of the family negatively impacts children. Children are often left in the care of relatives or
grandparents. This trend has led to the term “social orphanship”, often present in households where both
adults are absent and children do not have access to education. Migrant households do not spend more on
education than non-migrant households. Analyzing the set of households who remained in the sample across
all five years, while being a migrant household does correlate with higher consumption in a given year, it
does not correlate with higher education expenditures (in total or in per capita terms).

3.19    Overtime, wealthier households (net of remittances) are migrating less . To determine how
wealth is related to migration, it is useful to rank households based on domestic income excluding
remittances. This is illustrative of household conditions that are a determining factor on whether additional
income from remittances would be beneficial. Two measures of domestic wealth are used: total income net
of remittances, and only domestic wage income. A decline of migration is apparent in households at all
income quintiles except for the bottom 20th, when wealth is measured as total income net of any remittance
income or only domestic wages (Figure 3.6).

3.20    Over time, households that have labor migrants are becoming more dependent on
remittances, as it starts to comprise larger shares of total household income. The percentage of migrant
households in the bottom 20 is increasing over time, which can be interpreted that a large number of
households are becoming increasingly dependent on remittance income. The trend in migration and wealth
is even more evident when income quintiles are based only on domestic wages alone. In households where
income is already high, there may be no need to earn additional income or to send household members
abroad. Or it may be the case that households with the lowest amount of remittance income have simply

stopped migrating as domestic wages have started to increase. Whatever the reason, the current pool of
migrant households are more vulnerable to shocks given such a large proportion of their income is from
remittances rather than domestic sources.

                            THE WELFARE IMPACT OF LABOR MIGRATION



4.1     There are many potential welfare benefits from labor migration for the household. In some
countries, the education enrollment of children is higher and child work declines. These are all potential
benefits from remittances. On the other hand, labor migration may be present because the family is poor.

4.2     It is not obvious that migrant households are absolutely better off than non-migrant households.
Migrant households are poorer ex-ante, and their expenditures can be spent on luxury goods rather than
important investment pieces. Since reporting of large purchases in housing tend to be underreported, it is
not clear if there is investment by migrant households.

4.3     The ADB (Mogilevsky and Atamanov, 2008) finds that most migrant households receive
remittances only for a year and only 10 percent of households receive remittances for more than five years.
This suggests that as a household decision, migrants have a temporary role for fast wealth accumulation.
As individuals, migrants may choose to remain abroad. Some labor migrants return to the Kyrgyz Republic,
primarily for family concerns or to start their own business. An EDB (Beishenaly, Levant, Ormonbekova,
and Shamsiev, 2013) study reports the most common reason of emigrants from Russian returning to the
Kyrgyz Republic is for family concerns.

4.4      This section compares the welfare of migrant and non-migrant households. Income and
consumption patterns are analyzed and compared. In terms of income, receipts of remittances are of most
interest. Income and consumption are often not reported in a consistent manner, and some effort is made to
at least explain the gaps between reporting. For example, the poverty rate of migrant households is higher
despite the large reporting of remittance income.


                                              A.    INCOME


4.5     In this section on the study of household income, household-level income data is used.
Household income (questionnaire 6) is listed for individuals 7 years and older for the last 1, 2, or 3 months
as designated by the respondent. Compared to individual income from the Labor Force Survey, household
income data includes additional categories of income from property and household production.
Additionally, if remittances are perceived as gifts, this would also be captured in the household income
module but not the Labor Force Survey. The LFS is used to assess labor income of migrants, however in
terms of household welfare, the household income file is used.

4.6     Reported income is higher than consumption reporting in the KIHS. This is unusual compared
to other countries since usually reported monetary income is less than consumption expenditures in
household budget surveys. Underreporting in income is an expected reality in household surveys due to
high nonresponse rates. One example of this is the high rate of zero reporting in the wage variable. In the
Labor Force Survey, earnings of absent household members or the labor migrants are reported by household
members who may not know their income and this is left blank. Moreover, households would be reluctant
to report any income that was acquired illegally or informally. In general, consumption values tend to
exceed income reporting. Households may be more open about daily food and non-food expenditures than
about how much they are earning.

4.7     The contribution of different types of income to total household income per capita is illustrated in
Figure 4.1. Income values are taken from the household income file. Remittances are equal to the sum of
household income from employment outside of the Kyrgyz Republic and assistance from family or friends
who live outside of the Kyrgyz Republic.

4.8     Migrant households report much higher income than non-migrant households, primarily due
to remittances16. Household remittance income per labor migrant has been cyclical from 2008 to 2012.
Migrant households not only have substantial remittance income, it constitutes over half of total income in
many cases. All other components of income is lower in migrant households (other, domestic wages, social
assistance, unemployment, property, and pension incomes). One important distinction is that wages are
domestic wages, excluding labor income from abroad. Labor income from abroad is classified under
remittances.

4.9     Over time, migrant household income has been more volatile than non-migrant household
income17. Among non-migrant households, per capita household income steadily increased from 2008 to
2013. However among migrant households, income declined, bottomed out in 2010 during the crisis and
then began to increase again.

4.10   Aside from the remittance component of income, all other components of income are lower
in migrant households. Other income components include domestic wages, social assistance,
unemployment, property, pension, and other. The largest gap is in property income. In 2012, non-migrant
households had property income that was three times higher than in migrant households. However in 2009
and 2011, this difference was even higher.




16 Household remittance income in includes gifts from friends and family, which is why migrant labor income is an insufficient
characterization of remittances.
17 Some of these factors could be associated with the changing composition of migrant households as this data is not a panel and

nor it is stratified by migrant status.

4.12    Since migrant households in the Kyrgyz Republic have lower levels of domestic income,
remittances do contribute to development. For example in the case of Tajikistan, remittances have been
referred to as a “social shock absorber”, which is a substitute for social protection when the domestic labor
market or social assistance is poor (Kireyev, 2006). This paper also finds that pension income is much lower
among the elderly in migrant households than non-migrant households. Migration is strongly influenced by
a household’s economic state and lack of resources and assistance domestically.

4.14     Fiscally, there is an underlying issue of pension disbursement for labor migrants who return
to the Kyrgyz Republic after age 40. Under the current regime, labor migrants in Russia pay 10-13%
income tax, 17% non-resident tax, so 30% of their income remains in Russia. The non-resident tax is paid
for the first 6 months, and afterwards labor migrants pay taxes like a Russian citizen. However, because
there is so much seasonality, the 6 month period restarts a lot. For seasonal migrants, they have no rights
to social pensions in Russia, and also no pensions in the Kyrgyz Republic. Governments are currently
working on this to get taxes transferred to the Kyrgyz Republic. There is already an agreement like this
between Russian and Belarussia. There might be changes with the customs union as well.

4.15    Over time, migrant households exhibit an increasing dependency on remittance income and
declining shares of income in domestic wages. From 2008 to 2013, the proportion of remittances as a
share of household income has been increasing in migrant households. This holds both in terms of total and
per capita income levels. On the other hand, the ratio of domestic wages to foreign remittances has nearly
halved over this period.

4.16    In the Kyrgyz Republic, personal remittances as a percentage of GDP are one of the highest
in the world. In 2012, the Kyrgyz Republic ranked 2nd in the world in this regard, remittances comprised
30.75 percent of GDP, or valued at just under 2 billion USD. Though national accounts may be
overestimating remittances. Only Tajikistan had a higher rate of remittances as a proportion of GDP, at 47.5
percent (World Bank). However, in terms of value, many other countries receive much larger sums of
remittances. India, China, and Mexico receive over 20 billion USD in remittances (World Bank Remittance
Trends 2007).

4.17     In 2013, total household remittances computed using the KIHS totaled just under one billion
USD (2005). This is lower than official estimates, by about half, but underreporting of remittance data in a
national household survey is expected. The accuracy of national accounting itself is also somewhat
questionable. National accounting makes the assumption that any money transfers made by individuals or
amounts less than $3000 are remittances. National accounting may be overestimating remittances when
some transfers are actually forms of trade. When comparing the distribution of denominations of money
transfers through financial institutions and households, household report receiving much smaller
denominations. Therefore, larger denominations counted in national accounts are likely not private
remittances (Mogilevsky and Atamanov, 2008).

4.18    At the household level, remittances can have a large impact on welfare. In other countries,
remittances and international migration has also been found to reduce poverty (Adams Jr. and Page, 2005).
In Latin America and the Caribbean, international remittances have also been found to reduce poverty and
inequality (Acosta, Calderon, Fajnzylber, and Lopez, 2008).

4.19     The poorest18 migrant households receive the largest amount of remittances per capita.
Poverty ranking is based on non-remittance income. In 2013, the poorest 20 percent of migrant households
received 15,246 KGS in remittances per person annually, substantially higher than the wealthier 80 percent
(Figure 4.5). However, the difference between remittances per capita received by poor and rich households
has narrowed over time. It should not be that surprising that household remittance income has not dropped
drastically in the data despite a slowing Russian economy since remittance declines begin only in November
2014.

4.20    In the Kyrgyz Republic, remittance income plays a very large poverty reduction role for
migrant households. From 2008 to 2013, income poverty for migrant households declined a net of 5.6
percentage points. Among migrant households, remittances played the largest role in poverty reduction.
Domestic wages on the other hand contributed to explaining an increase in poverty. Incomes of migrant
households experienced a net decrease of 311 KGS from 2008 to 2013, with remittances contributing to an

effects from wage of domestic household members and the household employment share.

4.21     On the other hand for non-migrant households, domestic income sources rather than
remittances had the largest poverty reduction impact. Among these households, pension and domestic
wage income contributed the most to their poverty reduction and income growth (Error! Reference source
ot found.). However, employment is not contributing to any poverty reduction. The domestic labor market
still shows rigidities.

4.22    In some other countries, households receiving remittances have been shown to have higher
expenditure on education than non-remittance receiving households (Egypt and Morocco,
WB2010a), reduces the probability of child work (Egypt, WB2010a). Yet in the Kyrgyz Republic,
children aged 15-18 in migrant households are less likely to be enrolled in school and more likely to be
employed than children in non-migrant households.

4.23     Globally, there is little evidence of an impact from remittances onto economic growth at the
national level (Clemens and McKenzie, 2014, World Bank, 2006). As Clemens and McKenzie
summarize, “Migration and remittances clearly have first-order effects on poverty at the origin….but
detecting their effects on growth of the origin economy is likely to remain elusive”. Some reasons for this
is the use of remittances on immediate consumption needs rather than investment.

4.24    In the case of the Kyrgyz Republic, Akmoldoev and Budaichieva (2012) find that remittances
are mostly spent on consumption rather than investment, and therefore reducing its impact on
growth. There are some anecdotal evidence that migrant families have improper use of remittances.
Assistance on family budget regulation could be very useful to promote productive spending on education,
children rather than luxury items.

have declined. Figure 4.7 illustrates the trend in average household expenditure per capita between migrant
and non-migrant households. The trend in expenditures are similar between non-migrant migrant
households; over time average expenditures is declining.

4.26     One immediate observation is that while income is much higher among migrant households
than non-migrant households, average consumption between these two groups are almost identical.
Migrant and non-migrant households have similar consumption patterns even though income in migrant
households was much higher. So why are consumption patterns so much more similar? There are a couple
explanations for this. First migrant households are more likely to make large purchases that are infrequent
and not well captured in the survey. Only about 1 percent of the sample reported any purchases of real
estate including land, houses, apartments, or cottages. Among those who did report real estate purchase,
expenditures among migrant households were higher. However, overall consumption of migrant
households is still lower. Another possibility of lower expenditures is higher savings.

4.27    Another reason for the difference between income and consumption reporting among
migrant households is higher savings rates. Migrant households are more likely to save than non-migrant
households. According to FINDEX (2011), 38 percent of individuals 15 years of age and older in the
Kyrgyz Republic saved in the last 12 months. In the KIHS, household reporting of savings is much lower,
but migrant households are two to three times more likely to save. An ADB report (Mogilevsky and
Atamanov, 2008) also finds savings rates to be higher in migrant households; 59.9 percent of remittance
receiving households save compared to 37.3 percent of non-remittance households.

4.28     Table 4.2 shows that migrant households have higher consumption per capita than non-
migrant households controlling for a variety household characteristics. This is important in
establishing that both consumption and income are higher among migrant households. However, over time
the average per capita consumption of migrant households have reduced and become more similar to non-

migrant household levels. In recent years, migrant households are also more likely to be from the poorest
segments of society.

4.29     One motivation of migration is to accumulate money for large purchases such as housing,
property, or to open a business (Taylor et al, 1996). Tynaliev and McLean (2011) conduct a small
qualitative study and find that migrant workers are likely to start their own business when returning to the
Kyrgyz Republic and also invest in housing and real estate. This can generate employment for neighbors
and increase welfare at home.

4.30      Home improvement can be a large area of expenditures but may not be well captured in the
KIHS. Higher income may lend itself to purchases or consumption of larger goods and even housing. In
urban areas, migrant households are more likely to make repairs to their home. There is some evidence of
spending on housing in migrant households. Migrant households tend to have larger living areas, live in
newer dwellings. However they are more poorly connected to public grids such as electricity and energy,
and also have rougher material for walls and roofs (See Error! Reference source not found. for housing
tatistics).

4.31    Differences in housing materials between migrant and non-migrant households are more
apparent in urban areas. In urban areas, materials for roofs and walls in migrant households are much
simpler than in non-migrant households. In 2012, 55.4 percent of migrant households had walls made of
crude airbricks (adobe) compared to 33.1 percent of non-migrant households. The same is true of wall
materials; in urban areas 7.7 percent of migrant households have roofing made from roofing slates
compared to 26 percent of non-migrant households (Error! Reference source not found.). In rural areas,
he materials for housing between migrant and non-migrant households are more similar.

4.32    Migrant households are not spending more on education. When similar regressions are
estimated using education expenditure per capita or total education expenditure as a dependent variable,


                                                              26
education expenditures do not significantly vary between migrant and non-migrant households. Kroeger
and Anderson (2014) also find that remittances did not improve education outcomes of male children in
remittance-receiving households between 2005 and 2009. On average, migrant households in rural areas
have higher educational expenditures than non-migrant households, whereas the converse is true in urban
areas. Over time, only in urban areas are education expenditures increasing. This could be for a number of
reasons, that families with children move to urban areas with better schools or urban areas have intrinsically
higher educational costs.

4.33    Over time, the average consumption of both rural and urban migrant households have
declined, though much for migrant households in urban areas. The spending patterns of migrant
households is an important activity that requires sharper analysis. In 2012 and 2013, urban migrant
households have lower average consumption per capita than rural migrant households. The deterioration of
the welfare of urban migrants is important to understand. Some information that would be very informative
to help differentiate different spending behavior is asking households explicitly their reason for having
labor migrants. This would be revealing about why certain types of expenditures are highest.

4.34   The welfare aggregate is household consumption per capita following national definitions.
There are some advantages to measuring welfare using consumption as opposed to income. Daily
consumption is a better representation of welfare than income that can be lumpy over the year. While
income may be smoothed, consumption is a more accurate measure of welfare of living standards
throughout the year and the regularity of consumption.

4.35    Shared prosperity is the measure of the mean consumption growth of the bottom 40 percent
of the population. Figure 4.10 illustrates the growth of mean consumption for 4 groups of the population;
non-migrant and migrant households in the Top 60 and Bottom 40. The relative growth of migrant
household consumption very much depends on the period. For example, the growth of migrant households
in the bottom 40 was higher than non-migrants from 2009-2010 and 2012-2013, but was lower in other
years. One period where migrants suffered was between 2011 and 2012. In this period, consumption of
migrant households declined, while non-migrant households still experienced some amount of positive
consumption growth.

4.36    Poorer regions have higher rates of migration (Figure 4.11). In 2013, Batken had the highest
poverty rate as well as the highest proportion of the working population that were abroad. This does not
mean that migration itself is not welfare enhancing since the poverty rates of non-migrant households in
Batken might be very high while the poverty rate of migrant households are low. Though it still poses some
questions as to how welfare enhancing labor migration can be or if there are sufficient spillovers from labor
migration since some researchers believe that wealthy migrant families spend remittance income on
neighborhood projects and employing other locals.

4.37    The poverty rate of migrant households has increased over time. Inequality is decreasing
among migrant and non-migrant households as well, unfortunately due to increasing poverty. Recall in
Figure 3.6, there was descriptive evidence that migrant households were increasingly likely to be from the
lower pre-remittance income distribution. Migrant household incomes consist of large shares of remittances
that can be sensitive to macroeconomic conditions; without remittance income, they are much poorer than
non-migrant households. The poverty rates of non-migrant households have remained relatively stable.
However in migrant households, poverty rates have been steadily increasing from 2008 to 2013 (Figure


                                                                              28
4.12). In 2010, the increase in poverty rate may be related to the revolution or the financial crisis. In 2012,
the country experience a period of zero growth and poorer households may have started to send labor
migrants abroad.

4.38    The convergence in the poverty rates between migrant and non-migrant households is mainly
due to increasing poverty in migrant households. First, it is important to note that poverty here is based
on consumption. While migrant households showed much higher incomes than non-migrant households,
discrepancies between income and consumption may lead to a different welfare story. Remittances are
poverty alleviating for migrant households, yet households that are choosing to migrate are initially (pre-
migration) poorer over time. As noted earlier the number of migrant households are declining as well, so
one possibility is that the wealthiest migrant households over time has stopped migrating or has completely
moved out of the country.

4.39    In rural areas, non-migrant households are poorer than migrant households, while in urban
areas the opposite is the case. The difference in poverty between migrant and non-migrant households is
more apparent in rural areas (Figure 4.13). Migrant households are much better off than non-migrant
households in rural areas. However, in urban areas, poverty between migrant and non-migrant household
has been much more similar until 2012. There is a large divergence in poverty between migrant and non-
migrant households in 2012. In rural areas, migrant households become much less poor, and in urban areas
these households become much poorer relative to non-migrant households.

  year. The poverty line is pline_dc, national absolute poverty, reflects threshold of meeting food and nonfood needs. The welfare aggregate

4.40     Urban poverty peaked in 2012, and to a larger degree for migrant households. 2012 was a
year of zero growth in the Kyrgyz Republic. While the spike in 2012 urban migrant poverty is substantial,
it is consistent with some other indicators from the data. For example, when the value of dwellings for
urban migrant households has declined significantly in 2012; valuations in 2012 were a bit more than half
of valuations in 2011. The wage gap (of non-migrants) is also increasing (Figure 4.2). The rise of urban
migrant poverty can be related to many other corroborating statistics: increase in the wage gap with
domestic workers, lower employment rate of members in migrant households, lower dwelling values, lower
education enrollment rates. It is not clear how much of the increase in urban poverty is due to internal
migration. When examining just the panel set of households who are in the survey between 2008 and 2012,
this subgroup also experienced sharp increases in poverty in 2012.

4.41    The rise in urban migrant household poverty is driven by Jalal-Abad, Batken, and Osh
regions. Contrary, it is not driven by Bishkek since in 2011-2013, there are no migrant households surveyed
in Bishkek city. While Bishkek does have a large internal migrant population, it seems that the migrant
population in general may be under sampled in this city.

4.42     Trends in poverty are much more volatile among migrant households, which may be related
to “churning” of migrant households. Concerning the length of receiving remittances, over half of
households received remittances for one year of less, while only 10 percent of households received
remittances for at least five years (Mogilevsky and Atamanov, 2008). Therefore, a household that was a
migrant household in one year could easily become a non-migrant household in the following year. There
is a factor of selection that contributes to the volatility of welfare indicators. Naturally households that are
poorer or are in need of income will become migrant households. However, the magnitude of the spike in
urban poverty for migrant households is still puzzling.

4.43     In the sample of households of the KIHS, the number of migrant households interviewed has
been steadily declining, but by an incredibly large proportion in 2012, from 591 households in 2011
to 507 households in 2012. Since the sample is not stratified, and sample rotation is small, it is difficult to
assess how representative the decline of migrant households is of the actual situation. Further investigation
of why the sample of migrant households declined so dramatically and if this is linked with the jumps in
poverty trends is an important follow-up activity. The recent volatility of labor migrant welfare should also
be a priority for future study.

                                                 CONCLUSION



5.1     Kyrgyzstan is home to a large number of labor migrants and the amount of remittances as a
percentage of GDP is one of the highest in the world. Labor migration increased substantially in the early
2000’s. To ensure that this activity is sustainable in the long-term, it is important to work to enhance the
impact of remittances and to properly facilitate labor migration in all phases, before, during, and after
migration. Policies at all stages are relevant as the impact of labor migration and its trends in remittances
are vulnerable to regional events and the economic health of Russia.

5.2      In recent years, migrant households are becoming more vulnerable to economic shocks since they
have higher dependency on remittances. Moreover, in 2013, migrant households are poorer than non-
migrant households. Therefore, policies to increase the development impacts of remittances are more
relevant than ever. How do we increase the development impacts of remittances? This question can be
framed from the perspective of how to increase the amount of potential labor earnings through pre-
migration policies, how to make it easier to send remittances home, and how to educate migrant households
to make more productive use out of these remittances. McKenzie and Yang (2014) review the evidence of
policies that increase the development impact of international migration.

5.3    Based on what could be analyzed about labor migrant households and comparing them relative to
non-migrant households, a number of policy recommendations are suggested both along regulatory and
non-regulatory dimensions.

5.4      From the regulatory side, a stronger government presence is important. Government intervention
and oversight can improve welfare and migration outcomes. In the Kyrgyz Republic, migrants abroad are
less educated and rely on networks rather than government programs when finding work abroad
(Beishenaly, Levant, Ormonbekova, and Shamsiev, 2013). This can lead to underpayment and informal
work environments. To reduce dependence and regional risk, migrants should diversify their choice of
destination countries. The Kyrgyz Republic’s reliance on Russia and Kazakhstan may largely be a language
issue. The institution of language schools can be a solution to increase the choice of destination countries.
Moreover, the government may pursue bilateral labor agreements with select destination countries.
Agreements can ensure the placement of labor migrants under well-known conditions.

5.5      There are many learning opportunities that can be offered through international experiences and
through conducting migration surveys and data monitoring of return migrants. The Philippines can offer
valuable experience and expertise in managing labor migration policies, where the government is very
interactive with the management and facilitation of labor migrants, before, during, and after. Regional
lessons can also be drawn from existing World Bank projects in other regions. Labor migration unarguably
plays a large role in the economic welfare of Kyrgyz citizens. While this report profiles labor migrants and
their households to the best extent possible19, there are still important knowledge gaps that need to be filled
that cannot be answered using existing surveys. For example, what are return migrants doing and where do
they work? Do young migrants return to school? Are the number of labor migrants really declining? These
are all important questions to understand the longer run impacts of labor migration. A migration survey
would be valuable to accurately understand the welfare of migrant households, and to overcome the
challenges in using a household budget and labor force survey that is not well suited to answering migration
questions. A targeted survey will also make it possible to follow return migrants and understand their
19
  There are many challenges to studying migration without a proper survey honed to examine this topic specifically.
For example, the lack of sample rotation in the KIHS does not ensure year to year representativeness.

integration into the domestic labor market or lack thereof. This is especially important if the government
needs to anticipate a potentially large return migration of young and low educated workers. These return
migrants may not prefer to enroll in school but continue to be bread winners for their families.

5.6      Policies along the lines of financial literacy, skills training, and guarding against shocks also areas
that can improve the well-being of migrant households. Migrant households in the Kyrgyz Republic
underspend remittances in investment (Akmoldoev and Budaichieva, 2012). The development of financial
instruments for migrants such as micro-insurance or savings products to invest at home can help enhance
the impact of remittances. Knowledge on financial literacy is powerful for reducing the cost of sending
remittances home, increasing the returns from remittances through investment and savings, and increasing
the sustainability of remittances as a source of income. Financial training such as budgeting and money
management can also be a useful tool especially for pre-migrants. For example, in the Philippines, the
government provides financial training before labor migrants depart as well as deposit options to minimize
the cost of sending remittances. Pre-migration training and government support can create pathways for
labor migrants into better jobs in higher skilled sectors. The bulk of labor migrants work in low skilled
occupations and the majority have completed only general secondary education. Training, upgrading of
skills, and recognition of skills in countries of destination would also help migrants when they return home
to get better jobs. Income and consumption patterns of migrant households are more volatile than patterns
in non-migrant households. Moreover, the poverty rates of migrant households are increasing over time. A
stronger study on the vulnerabilities and social status of labor migrants would be useful. The government
may also wish to help migrant households think of innovative ways to protect against shocks by developing
appropriate financial instruments. .

5.7      International organizations and the government the Kyrgyz Republic are familiar with many of the
recommendations listed above. There is great progress on many fronts as the Kyrgyz Republic works to
better serve its labor migrants. For example, the IOM has helped launch employment centers in Bishkek
and Osh. The World Bank has facilitated technical assistance and expert consultations on improving the
legal and institutional framework for migration management. These efforts should continue as well as filling
knowledge gaps for the purposes of enhancing the development impacts of labor migration.

Notes: Annual household income components are in per-capita terms in 2005 KGS. Migrant households are defined based on
the employment file, if at least one person in the household was working abroad over the year. Incomes are from the KIHS
household level income file and harmonized according to ECAPOV guidelines. The poverty line is the national absolute poverty
line.

ANNEX A2: KIHS Data

1. The primary source of data for this paper is the Kyrgyz Republic Integrated Household Survey
   (KIHS). This survey is not ideal to study migration since there is no effort to keep the sample
   representative of migration activity. However, there is a wealth of data and households and individuals
   can be identified as migrants. Data is available for the years 2008-2013 and presented at the annual
   level. The KIHS is a quarterly survey, interviewing approximately 5,000 households each quarter. Most
   of the households that are interviewed are the same across quarters. Monetary values are reported in
   Kyrgyz Soms (KGS) and in 2010 real values.

2. The KIHS sample was redrawn in 2003 and 2013, using the 2001 and 2013 censes respectively.
   From 2003 to 2012, the sample was drawn using the 2001 census. In 2013, the sample was redrawn
   using the 2013 census.

3. Weights are population representative at the rural/urban and oblast level. In 2012, the resident
   population was approximately 5.6 million. Household weights are also used. In the labor force survey,
   annual and quarterly weights are available.

4. The KIHS is not necessarily representative of migrant and non-migrant populations. For example,
   when a household leaves the sample in one location, it is replaced by a similar household in the same
   location and along a similar set of characteristics such as household size and the age of the head of
   household. However, the migrant status of the household is not one of these factors. Over time, as
   households exit and enter the sample, trends over time on migration are not likely to be preserved. This
   issue can be problematic as migrant households are likely to move and hence leave the sample, but
   households nearby that can be replacements are more likely to be non-migrant households.

5. There are two potential ways that labor migrants can be identified in KIHS, the household roster
   and the Labor Force Survey. First, the household roster (questionnaire 1) that is collected in the first
   quarter of each year has a question about household members being present in the house or absent. If
   household members are absent, work is an option for the reason for absence. In this case, these
   individuals are identified as labor migrants. There are a couple of disadvantages from this. The biggest
   disadvantage is that absence for work is not specified as international or domestic work. Secondly, this
   roster is only complete once a year which may bias labor migration that is seasonal.

6. The LFS is the preferred source to identify labor migrants, since this is the only source where domestic
   and international migrants can be differentiated. The second source of information is from the Labor
   Force Survey (questionnaire 4). In the LFS, basic information, economic activity, and income
   information is recorded for members of the household aged 15 and over. Labor migrants are those who
   report their location of work to be abroad. Other members of the household can report information
   about labor migrants when they are absent. One concern is that the household roster may be a more
   accurate reflection of household composition since the LFS is long and if household members
   experience survey fatigue, they may not report on absent members. However, this is not the case.
   Virtually all labor migrants identified in the household roster in quarter 1 are also present in quarter 1
   of the LFS. Since there are no advantages of using the household roster to identify labor migrants, this
   paper uses the LFS to identify labor migrants and migrant households.

7. Migrant households are defined as those who reported at least one household member whose location
   of work is abroad over the year. We do not control for the duration of absence.

8. Both household and individual level income data are used in this study. The Labor Force Survey
   (questionnaire 4) reports individual level income for the last month for members of the household 15
   years and over. Household income (questionnaire 6) lists aggregate household income received from
    individuals 7 years and older for the last 1, 2, or 3 months as designated by the respondent. The
    advantage of examining income using the Labor Force Survey is that we can directly link individual
    characteristics to earnings. This is especially useful to understand which members of the household is
    working abroad and if certain factors such as skills or profession affect their earnings. The advantage
    of the household income module is that it includes additional categories of income from property and
    household production. Additionally, if remittances are perceived as gifts, this would also be captured
    in the household income module but not the LFS. Therefore the LFS is used to assess labor income of
    migrants, however in terms of household welfare, the household income file is used.

9. The sample is supposed to be rotated about 25 percent per year, but in practice, perhaps only 10
   percent is rotated. There are some clear implications from poor rotation such as the duration of labor
   migrants abroad working is increasing, reduction in migration, reduction of wealthier households in
   migration, slight aging of migrants. On average, characteristics of the head of household may be
   evolving in ways that do not reflect the population; ie aging. The implications for migrant
   characteristics are even greater since one reason a household is dropped from the sample is because of
   migration.

Other Data Issues

10. In addition, the CALISS survey is used to gain information on subjective poverty and perspectives on
    financial activity. Moreover, the CALISS was conducted in 2013 and offers more recent information.

11. Since the primary data source is not a migration survey, there are limitations as to what can be examined
    and studied.

        a. Status of return migrants: do they go to school? Open a store? What are long-term personal
           impacts from remittances

        b. Dynamics, long-term welfare impacts, are there sustainable improvements in household
           welfare?

        c. Household welfare after migration ends

        d. Measuring migration of entire households (because this may be more likely with higher skill
           workers)

        e. When entire families migrate away from the Kyrgyz Republic

        f.   Direction of causality. Ex) is employment rate among other household members in migrant
             households low because of the high amount of remittances? Or was it a determining factor in
             migration?

12. However, trends in the number of labor migrants may be impacted by the rotation element in the
    survey. One caution in using the KIHS for migration analysis is that there is no conscious effort to
    make the sample representative of migrant households, or the sample is not stratified by migration
    status. If many migrant households leave the sample and are not replaced with similar migrant
    households, the trend in the number of migrants will decline over time. This decline would be correct
    if migrant households are actually moving out of the country or there is a decline in migration and it is
    less likely to sample another migrant household. However, the representativeness is not clear especially
    for small sample replacements.

13. The degree of sample rotation has reduced over time, and migrant households are more likely to leave
    the sample than to enter the sample. Since household identification ids are unique, households can be
    identified as those that are new to the sample and those that are leaving. 13.3 percent of households
    leaving the sample in 2009 were migrant households. However, the new households that replaced them
    in 2010, only 8.7 percent were migrant households. This differential was even more severe in the 2011
    and 2012 household replacement. In 2012, only 485 households were new to the sample; out of a sample
    of 5,000. In 2012, the number of labor migrants captured by the KIHS dropped dramatically. In this
    year, the country experienced zero economic growth and it is highly likely that many migrant
    households with household members abroad left the country. However, among households that
    remained in the sample, the number of labor migrants did not decline at such a rate in 2012.

14. Low sample rotation in the KIHS can skew estimates of migration rates. An important activity to
    preserve representativeness in household budget surveys is to rotate the sample of households that are
    interviewed. In the case of the KIHS, rotation is limited. In 5 years, 2008-2012, 69 percent of
    households have been interviewed in all years. Poor rotation can lead to data problems such as an
    “aging” population, less education spending and more health spending. When studying migration, the
    rotation is also important to capture new households that are migrating. In 2013, the sample was
    completely rotated, new samples are best to compare trends in migration.
