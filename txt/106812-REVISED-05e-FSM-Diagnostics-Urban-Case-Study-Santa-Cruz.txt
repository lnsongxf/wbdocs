This report is a city case study of a World Bank Economic and Sector Work on Fecal Sludge
Management: Diagnostics for Service Delivery in Urban Areas (P146128). The Task Team
Leaders were Isabel Blackett and Peter Hawkins. Other World Bank team members included Zael
Sanz, Ravikumar Joseph, Chris Heymans and Guy Hutton.

This report is based on work conducted between January 2014 and February 2015 by Oxford
Policy Management (OPM) in partnership with the Water, Engineering and Development Centre
(WEDC) at Loughborough University. The core research team was Ian Ross (OPM), Rebecca
Scott (WEDC), Ana Mujica (OPM) and Mike Smith (WEDC). The broader team included Zach
White, Rashid Zaman and Simon Brook from OPM, as well as Andy Cotton and Sam Kayaga from
WEDC. Andy Peal (Independent Consultant) also contributed to certain aspects of the
methodology.

Key inputs in terms of data collection for the Santa Cruz study were also made by SNV Bolivia
under the leadership of Gonzalo Ameller. In addition, Humberto Cáceres (World Bank consultant)
interviewed key informants and made an initial assessment of the political, social and economic
situation of the city.

1          Introduction and research framework

1.1        About this report
This report summarises the main findings of a case study on fecal sludge management in Santa
Cruz, Bolivia. It is part of ‘Fecal Sludge Management: Diagnostics for Service Delivery in Poor
Urban Areas’, hereafter “the FSM research project”. This work is funded by the World Bank Water
and Sanitation Programme (WSP). There are five city case studies as part of this project
(Balikpapan, Dhaka, Hawassa, Lima and Santa Cruz). The overall objective of this assignment is
to “work with the WSP urban sanitation team to develop the methodology, design and survey
instruments, undertake analysis of data collected from five field case studies (linked to World Bank
operations projects), refine the diagnostic tools, and develop decision-making tools and guidelines
for the development of improved FSM services.” Specific objectives of the Santa Cruz case study
are listed in the next section.

This document is part of a project deliverable designed to be internal at this stage. Therefore, it
does not contain much background information, and the assumed audience is the WSP project
team and other stakeholders familiar with the Santa Cruz FSM context.

The report’s structure is detailed below. It begins with a background to the research and the city,
moving into several sections analysing the urban sanitation context, which are not specific to FSM.
Thereafter, the report’s focus is FSM services in part icular.


1.2        Study rationale and objectives
It is very common for poor people living in urban areas of most low-income countries to either use
on-site sanitation facilities or defecate in the open. Even when improved on-site options are used
to contain feces, there generally exist few services for collection, transport and disposal or
treatment of the resulting fecal sludge. Fewer opportunities for resource recovery through end-use
of fecal sludge exist. The service delivery gaps within and between stages of the sanitation service
chain become more apparent as sanitation coverage increases in poor urban areas. Failure to
ensure strong links throughout the fecal sludge management (FSM) service chain results in
untreated fecal sludge (FS) contaminating the environment, with serious implications for human
health.

Despite increasing demands for FSM services, there are few tools and guidelines to help city
planners navigate complex FSM situations. This study aims to build on existing frameworks and
tools, in particular the City Service Delivery Assessment (CSDA) scorecard and the Fecal Waste
Flow Diagram (FWFD). The aim is to produce diagnostic and decision-making tools that are based
in tried-and-tested strategic planning approaches and frameworks, with a focus on practicality.
Critically, updates to the tools and guidelines will be based on primary data collection in five cities.
In most of the cities, this is supported by interaction with city stakeholders involved in ongoing
World Bank lending. Acknowledging the difficulty of reforming FSM services in cities, political
economy questions around FSM are explicitly included as part of the overall analysis.

The specific objectives of the study are:

        To provide quantitative and qualitative data on the sanitation situation in Santa Cruz from a
         socio-economic perspective, specifically as it relates to FSM;

        To do the above in such a way that the data is representative of non-sewered areas of
         Santa Cruz, which are also the lowest-income sectors of the city; and

        To inform the development of analytical tools and guidelines, by “road -testing” draft tools
         using primary data collection.

The study was therefore primarily socio-economic rather than technical. It did not aim to carry out
technical inspections of infrastructure or produce detailed maps with neighbourhood-level analysis
and recommendations. For those who have previously worked in the sanitation sector in Santa
Cruz, there may be few surprises, but the report does offer representative data to back-up what
has previously been reported in smaller or more general studies.


1.3        Research framework
During the inception stage, the OPM/WEDC team developed a Research Framework (RF), based
on the overarching research questions implicit in the TOR and draft research protocol. From these
questions, a logical set of project components was developed. These became the basis for the
design of data collection instruments that would enable information to be collected for the
indicators making up each component.

The approach is to place all components – as well as ensuing results – of the study within the
context of the FSM service chain, to optimise its relevance and effectiveness. The Tools and
Guidelines document provides the data and analytical framework used to produce the outputs, and
how to apply them.

This report is sub-divided into three groups of chapters. The initial chapter describes the city
background and there are three chapters which cover the urban sanitation context without a
specific focus on FSM. The rest of the report considers FSM services and service delivery.

2          Background to Santa Cruz city

2.1        Santa Cruz overview
The Santa Cruz Metropolitan Area (referred to Santa Cruz hereinafter) is the second largest urban
area in Bolivia, encompassing six municipalities (Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Cotoca, Porongo, La
Guardia, El Torno and Warnes) and having around 1.9 million inhabitants. Santa Cruz is located in
eastern Bolivia at an altitude of 416 m above sea level, experiencing a subtropical climate with an
average humidity of 68% and an annual average temperature of 25°C. Maximum temperatures of
up to 38°C can be reached in the summer months (December to March), while minimum
temperatures of around 6°C can be experienced in the winter months (June to August) (Cáceres
Magnus, 2015; WSP, 2010).

As a major economic centre in Bolivia, Santa Cruz has faced high population growth since the
1980s, mainly driven by rural-urban migration, with growth averaging around 5% between 1996
and 2001 and 4% between 2001 and 2012 (Caceres Magnus, 2015; Rivera, 2010). Most of these
new urban inhabitants have settled in the suburbs or peri-urban areas of the city, where growth has
been reported to almost double that observed in the “core” area – population growth in peri-urban
areas of Santa Cruz was estimated at 7% between 1992 and 2012 (WSP, 2016).

As has been observed in other Latin American countries, urbanisation trends have not been
coupled with equal access to basic services, mainly electricity, water and sanitation. For the
country as a whole, access to piped water on premises in urban areas increased from 80 to 96%
between 1990 and 2015. However, access to improved sanitation (excluding shared facilities) was
just 61% by 2015, with 4% of urban dwellers still practising open defecation (WHO/UNICEF JMP,
2015). Moreover, 2013 estimates suggest that only 30% of all urban wastewater in Bolivia is
effectively treated, with only 74% of municipalities across the country having a wastewater
treatment plant (WSP, 2016).

Water supply and sewerage services in Santa Cruz are provided by 10 different cooperatives, as
shown in Figure 1 below. Altogether they provide drinkable water to over 96% of the population
(both piped into premises and through public taps). SAGUAPAC (Cooperativa de Servicios
Públicos de Santa Cruz Ltda.) is the main and largest service provider.

2012 Census data suggests that around 92% of households have water piped into dwelling, while
5% rely on public taps and the remaining 2% on wells (protected and unprotected), rainwater or
springs, and other unimproved sources. Porongo and Cotoca have the lowest piped into dwelling
coverage, reaching 61% and 72% respectively (Table 1).

2.2        Santa Cruz sanitation context
As described in the previous section, while access to improved drinking water sources is almost
universal in urban areas in Bolivia, sanitation coverage is still a challenge, with only 61% of the
urban population having access to an improved facility. In particular, 2012 Census data for Santa
Cruz suggests that around 47% of the population was connected to sewerage, with 21% and 26%
of facilities emptying into a septic tank or a lined pit respectively, and 6% of households having no

sanitation facility, i.e. practising open defecation1. Porongo, Cotoca and El Torno have the highest
proportions of households without a sanitation facility, with 26%, 21% and 21% respectively.

Figure 2 further shows the distribution of sanitation coverage by wealth quintiles 2. As expected,
access to sewerage increases with wealth, with only 4% of households in the lowest quintile having
access as compared to 87% in the highest quintile. Meanwhile, the proportion of households
without a facility or practising OD decreases with wealth: while 23% of households in the lowest
quintile have no facility, all households in the highest quintile have access to sewerage or on-site
sanitation.

Although it would be ideal to have more information on the type of user-interface (i.e. the type of
sanitation facility used), the focus of this study is primarily the management of fecal sludge from
on-site sanitation (OSS) facilities (i.e. the containment stage) and, to an extent, all forms of fecal
waste flows, including sewerage, through to end-use / disposal (see Figure 3 below).

This study is not focusing on the structural conditions or the OSS facilities themselves, so much as
the extent to which they contain / do not contain fecal sludge and what happens to the fecal sludge
from this stage onwards. For this reason, the household survey, and later sections of this report,
refer to different categories for household sanitation facilities and assesses fecal sludge
management in relation to the service chain above.


2.3        FSM in Santa Cruz
Later sections of this report will identify the scale of FSM services and its implications, based on
primary and secondary qualitative and quantitative data. Here, the roles legally assigned to the key
actors that currently are and could be involved in FSM are briefly presented, based on previous
WSP studies, key informant interviews and field experience gathered by the World Bank
consultant. The list is not exhaustive. How this plays out in reality is covered in Section 6.

3          Fecal waste flow diagrams

3.1        Introduction
Fecal Waste Flow Diagrams (also known as ‘shit flow’ dia grams or SFDs) are an innovation arising
from WSP’s 12-city study of FSM (Peal & Evans, 2013). In short, an SFD is a visualisation of how
fecal waste (fecal sludge or wastewater) flows along the sanitation service chain. At each stage of
the chain, the proportion of fecal waste that is or is not effectively managed to the next stage of the
chain is indicated.3

This means that where fecal waste is deemed to be:

        Effectively managed from one stage of the chain to the next (for example, where
         wastewater from cistern flush toilets is effectively transported through sewers to a
         designated treatment site, or fecal sludge is transported by a tanker to a designated
         disposal site), the SFD shows the flow of fecal waste continuing along the chain – and the
         arrow representing that flow of fecal waste to the next stage remains green;

        Not effectively managed from one stage of the chain to the next (for example, where
         wastewater leaks from sewers before reaching a designated treatment site, or fecal sludge
         is dumped into the environment or drainage channels), then the SFD shows the fecal waste
         “dropping out” of the service chain – and the arrow representing that flow of fecal waste
         turns brown.

The proportion of fecal waste that is effectively managed all the way to the end of the service chain
is indicated as “safely managed”, with the remaining proportion that has dropped -out of the chain
deemed “unsafely managed”. The primary destination of that “unsafe” fecal waste is indicated (e.g.
receiving waters, general environment, drains, etc.).4 Thus far, SFDs in different cities have been
undertaken using different methodologies, as is often necessary in the context of poor data
availability. Furthermore, most SFDs so far (including those in the 12-city study) were undertaken
using secondary data and expert estimates. This study is amongst the first to use primary
household survey data and field-based observations to construct SFDs. A group of urban
sanitation experts is currently discussing the ‘roll-out’ of the use of SFDs, for which other
methodologies will be developed.5

For this study, SFDs are being developed which are indicative of (i) the city-wide situation, and (ii)
the situation in low-income settlements (see Annex A for more information). For Santa Cruz, the
former is based on both primary and secondary data, whereas the latter is based solely on primary
data collection in non-sewered areas (which are generally low-income areas), as part of sub-
sample A.

  Previous iterations of SFDs distinguished between safe and unsafe practices, but here we refer to effective / ineffective
management. This progression has been made because it is difficult be sure of the safety of the process, but if the fecal
waste is managed to the next stage of the sanitation service chain, we can say it is considered an effective process.

  It is acknowledged that FS may pass from irrigation channels into other water bodies, e.g. rivers, but the diagram
focuses on the primary destination. It was beyond the scope of this study to be able to track the pathways of sludge
beyond the household, e.g. which canals did it pass through and where was its eventual destination.

3.2           Methodology
The city-wide SFD is based on both primary and secondary data as neither sub-sample in the
household survey was representative of Santa Cruz as a whole.6 The 2012 Census was used as a
reference to estimate the proportions of different types of sanitation and containment technologies
used, with primary household data projected to match the Census proportions. Estimates for the
proportions of FS that are effectively emptied and transported were also based on primary
household survey data.7

For the SFD in non-sewered areas, data from the following household survey question was used:

            What type of sanitation facility does this dwelling have?8

For Santa Cruz, this question encompasses both sanitation and containment technologies. It
should be noted that the household’s response is taken as given , as it was not possible to confirm
responses by observation.

To analyse this data, an SFD matrix was created – a blank matrix is shown in Table 4 below. It
shows which data sources are used and how they are analysed into categories of effective and
ineffective management of fecal waste through the stages of the service chain. Results for Santa
Cruz are shown in the next section.

Firstly, household survey data on use of infrastructure (question above) is used to allocate
households to five categories shown in the column marked (1) in the figure below:

     (i)        Sewered (off-site centralised or decentralised): toilets connected to sewers (not on-
                site sanitation).
     (ii)       On-site storage – emptiable: on-site sanitation (OSS) toilets (involving pits or septic
                tanks) that can be emptied. However, they can also be connected to drains through an
                overflow, to avoid the need for emptying. These toilets are emptiable but may or may
                not be emptied.
     (iii)      On-site storage – single-use / pit covered: OSS toilets where pits or tanks are
                covered and / or abandoned once full. These toilets may be emptiable but are never
                emptied.
     (iv)       On-site non-storage – straight to drain / similar: OSS toilets which connect directly
                to drains, water bodies or open ground. These toilets are therefore non-emptiable.
     (v)        Open defecation (OD): self-explanatory.

The question of emptiability is key. Category (ii) above is denoted as emptiable, meaning that this
containment option involves a pit or a tank which fills with FS. Between the two extremes of a
closed system and a system which never fills up, there is a spectrum of scenarios. For example,
some tanks may have an overflow to the drain but may still require emptying if they become
blocked. These categories were designed to be applicable around the world. As it happens, the
6
  In other cities in this five-city study, sub-sample A was designed to be representative of the whole city. However, given
that data collection in Santa Cruz was mainly carried out to assess the viability of a call centre for FS services, sub-
sample A is representative of non-sewered areas of the city. For more information on sampling, please refer to Annex A.
7
   The only containment facilities that are formally emptied are septic tanks, septic tanks and soakaways and cement-
lined pits. Among households with these types of facilities, the household survey suggests that only 27% are emptied.
Secondary data about the total number of discharges at the SAGUAPAC treatment plant shows that there were 15,974
discharges in 2014, of which 80% correspond to domestic FS. Assuming that each discharge is the equivalent of 1.5
households, then 19,169 households were served in 2014. This is equal to 33% of households having their FS effectively
transported and treated.
8
  This question encompasses both characteristics of the sanitation facility as well as the type of containment. Responses
include (i) latrine to unlined pit, (ii) latrine to lined pit, (iii) pour-flush to off-set lined pit, (iv) flush to soakaway, (v) flush to
septic tank, (vi) flush to septic tank and soakaway, and (vii) no facility.

vast majority of households in Santa Cruz fall into category (i), as there is 49% sewerage. In non-
sewered areas, most households fall into category (ii), as most households have a septic tank.

Data collected through the household survey are allocated in column (2) below (a key shows the
meaning of the colour-coding of cells by data source). Next, the proportions for each of the stages
of the chain are allocated. As can be seen from the emptying column, marked (3), a certain
proportion of the population’s FS which is collected is emptied by a service provider, with the
remaining FS not emptied (e.g. overflows to drains).

The rest of the matrix follows a similar logic. Full SFD matrices for Santa Cruz (city-wide) and non-
sewered areas (sub-sample A) are presented in Annex B, along with further methodological notes.
This section has given a brief overview of where the data underlying the SFDs comes from. The
SFDs themselves are more intuitively appealing and are presented in the next section.

It should be noted that since data comes from a household survey and the Census, the proportions
in the matrices are proportions of households rather than FS volumes.9

  The impression given by the SFD therefore involves assumptions that (i) each person produces the same amount of
FS, and (ii) pit accumulation rates are constant across the city. This is an approximation but the most pragmatic
approach in the context of uncertainty around FS volumes. FS volume only really becomes an issue when considering
the extent of change in service levels needed to deal with the amounts. This study is primarily about identifying the
broader picture of where the management of FS is or is not effective, not what volumes are being managed or
mismanaged.

3.3        Results
Firstly, the secondary data and household survey results, which are inputs to the SFD, are shown
in the tables below. They are reported separately for the whole city of Santa Cruz and non-
sewered areas (sub-sample A). After that, a separate SFD matrix and diagram for each area are
presented.

3.3.1      Census and household survey results as an input to the SFD

In most countries, national household surveys usually collect data on the type of sanitation facility
(e.g. cistern flush, pour/manual flush, pit latrine, hanging toilet, etc.). However, in Bolivia only the
type of containment/facility discharge is inquired about in the Census and other similar surveys.
Nonetheless, the household survey asks about both sanitation and containment technologies,
allowing for projections to be made to estimate city-wide coverage. Figure 4 below depicts the
definitions used for primary data collection. The household survey also provides information about
the emptying rate for septic tanks, septic tanks with soakaways, and cement-lined pits (all other
technologies are deemed to be non-emptiable). Finally, the proportion of households for which FS
is effectively transported was estimated using the number of discharges recorded at SAGUAPAC
treatment plants, assuming that (i) 80% of total discharges are domestic; and (ii) each discharge is
equivalent to 1.5 households.

The SFD for non-sewered areas only relies on household survey data (i.e. type of sanitation and
containment technologies, and proportion of households that empty their tanks) and estimations for
the proportion of households for which FS is effectively transported, as described above.

Table 5 shows the type of sanitation and containment systems for Santa Cruz city-wide (based on
the 2012 Census and the household survey) and non-sewered areas of the city (only household
survey data). City-wide, 41% of households have a facility that discharges into a septic tank, as
compared to 70% in non-sewered areas. Surprisingly, while 5% of households city-wide have no
sanitation facility, only 1% of households in non-sewered areas reported not having a facility – this
is likely due to sampling issues.

The table above shows the basic categories, but it is also important to consider the proportion of
these which are shared. This is relevant, not just in terms of developing the standardised indicators
of the WHO / UNICEF JMP, but also because the FSM arrangements for shared latrines are likely
to be different from those of ‘private’ latrines from a management perspective. This is because
accountability for dealing with full or blocked pits or tanks, as well as payment for FSM services,
may be less clear-cut in a ‘shared’ situation, recognising that this label could refer to a large
number of scenarios. The technology and service used would be as for private facilities, while
noting that shared pits/tanks would be likely to fill more quickly, depending on the number of users.

As can be seen from Table 6 below, 69% of households in non-sewered areas used a facility
considered improved under JMP definitions (see footnotes below). However, this value should be
read with some caution as, even if the facility is classified as improved by standard definitions, its
quality and maintenance may not always be adequate. Nearly a quarter of households (24%)
reported sharing their facility (improved or unimproved).

Data on sharing was not available for in the 2012 Census and thus we were not able to estimate
JMP categories for Santa Cruz city-wide.

For completeness and consistency with other case study reports, it is important to explain that
results were grouped into risk categories based on the relative risk to public health from a
combination of the type of containment arrangement and where the FS and effluent empty to:

        Low-risk categories are those where the FS can be considered to be contained (in JMP
         terms), at least in relation to the first stage of the service chain.

        High-risk categories are those where the FS goes directly into the environment and so
         potentially poses a risk of exposure to the public, whether via drainage systems or water
         bodies with which people interact (especially children).

        Medium-risk categories are those where there is at least some containment in a pit or
         septic tank, but those pits / tanks either: (a) have outlets connected to drains that allow only
         partially digested effluent to flow through, or (b) are unlined / permeable, allowing FS to
         leach into the surrounding soil and groundwater that may be used for domestic purposes
         (e.g. washing clothes). These scenarios still represent a risk, but it is somewhat lower than
         contact with fresh FS as in the high-risk category above.

The results are shown in Table 7 below. At the city-wide level, 5.2% of households have high-risk
blackwater management practices as compared to only 1% of households in non-sewered areas.
The most common category was low risk for both city-wide (90%) and non-sewered areas (70%),

10
   The JMP definition of a shared facility is one which is used by 2 or more households (including a public facility).
Improved facilities included all types of facilities listed in the household survey except latrines and no facilities / OD.
11
   “Unimproved shared” is not a category usually reported by the JMP, but it is useful to report for our purposes so we
can see the full proportion of households sharing latrines.

Finally, it is worth considering the reported household behaviour in the context of septic tanks / pits
filling up. This was assessed by asking about the action taken by the household when their tank or
pit last filled up. As can be seen in Table 8, the majority of households did not empty their septic
tanks or pits (73%). Households with a flush to cement-lined pit had a

3.3.2      Presentation of SFDs

Using all these results, two sets of SFD matrices and diagrams were constructed: one giving a city-
wide picture based on both primary and secondary data, and one focused on non-sewered areas
and based mainly on sub-sample A of the household survey. These are presented as Figure 5 and
Figure 6 below. SFDs work on the same principle as the matrix shown ab ove. Household’s toilet
technology and associated containment method is shown on the left, with intermediate steps and
primary destination of the FS shown along the sanitation service chain.

What is clear from the city-wide SFD is that the majority (72%) of FS in Santa Cruz is not
effectively managed. While 49% of households have a sewer connection, about 25% of
wastewater does not receive effective treatment – only SAGUAPAC’s wastewater treatment plant
provide adequate treatment. For households that have emptiable on-site storage (septic tanks with
soakaways, septic tanks and cement-lined pits), data from the household survey suggest that
between 17% to 30% of households empty their pit / tank depending on the type of containment.
Furthermore, based on data for the number of FS discharges at the SAGUAPAC treatment plant in
2014, it is estimated that around a third of FS collected is actually transported to the SAGUAPAC

treatment facility. Thus, only 4% of households that use emptiable systems manage their FS
effectively. Open defecation and facilities that empty straight to drains account for around 5% of
households. Finally, single-use on-site storage (i.e. latrines with unlined pits), which eventually
allow FS to leach into the surrounding environment, account for around 1% of households. Overall,
31% of emptiable OSS is deemed to be ineffectively managed, mainly driven by the lack of
guidance and standards for their construction, but also by poor knowledge on adequate
maintenance practices.

                  and household survey




Considering next the SFD for the non-sewered sample (Figure 6), it is observed that the vast
majority of households (70%) have a septic tank or a septic tank and a soakaway, with an
additional 17% having a cement-lined pit, all of which are emptiable technologies. As is the case
for the city-wide SFD, around 17% of cement-lined pits, 24% of septic tanks and 30% of septic
tanks with soakaways are emptied. Assuming as well that the proportion of ERTLs that reach a
SAGUAPAC treatment facility is the same across city-wide and non-sewered areas, then only 8%
of the FS collected is effectively treated. Only 9% of households use single-use on-site storage
(lined and unlined pits), for which none of the FS is effectively managed: these containment
systems are reported to allow FS to seep into the surrounding environment. Overall, 92% of FS in
non-sewered areas in Santa Cruz is ineffectively managed.

3.4        Implications of the SFDs for FSM in Santa Cruz
The SFDs show that the majority of the FS in Santa Cruz is not effectively managed: at the city-
wide level, 72% of all FS produced by households goes to the surrounding environment and
receiving waters, while in non-sewered areas, 92% of all FS is not treated. Although almost half the
city’s population has access to sewerage, only 2 4% of waste collected is effectively treated, with
the remaining FS not receiving adequate treatment (25%). The majority of households that are not
connected to sewerage use emptiable on-site facilities that discharge into a septic tank with a
soakaway, a septic tank or a cement-lined pit. However, many of these facilities are not properly
built and maintained, with FS seeping into the surrounding environment. Even when emptied, not
all FS reaches a treatment facility as not all service providers operate in the formal market and are
thus not allowed to discharge the FS collected at SAGUAPAC’s treatment plant. Single use on-site
storage facilities (i.e. covered when full) are also used, but evidence from KIIs and FGDs also
suggest that FS leaches into the surrounding environment in these cases.

From these SFDs, it is clear that the key challenges in Santa Cruz are (i) ensuring adequate FS
containment and maintenance for on-site facilities; (ii) improving the effectiveness and capacity of
treatment for FS collected through sewerage or by FS emptying and transport service providers;
and (iii) eliminating open defecation.

4          FSM   services:                         Potential         Demand    and        Supply
           Management

4.1        Introduction
In economic theory, markets for goods and services operate on the basis of demand and supply.
This chapter provides a brief assessment of demand and supply for FSM services in Santa Cruz.
At this stage, it is important to note the difference between potential (or notional) demand and
effective demand. The potential demand for FSM services is the quantity (and type) of services
which would be demanded in the absence of any market failures or distortions. This is different
from effective demand, which is the quantity (and type) of services actually purchased in the
context of current supply and prices.

A simple way of illustrating this is to note that 45% of households city-wide use OSS (i.e. potential
demand), of which only 12% are emptied, suggesting a relatively low effective demand. Reasons
for a gap between potential demand and effective demand in Santa Cruz include: (i) poorly built
infrastructure (pits or septic tanks) that either leach into the ground and have never filled up or do
not allow for adequate maintenance activities to be carried out; (ii) practice of building a new pit
when the one in use fills up; (iii) lack of knowledge about the required maintenance for emptiable
facilities; (iv) lack of knowledge or disregard for environmental concerns; and (v) tariffs for FS
emptying and transport services being higher than consumers’ willingness and/or ability to pay
(Cáceres Magnus, 2015; SNV, 2015; WSP, 2010).

There can be different definitions of potential demand in the context of FSM, with varying layers of
complexity. The simplest definition is as per the above, i.e. services that would be demanded if all
households with OSS used emptying services and were willing and able to pay. Qualifications
could be added for different scenarios, for example given (i) emptying of pits/tanks every 10 years
on average, (ii) regularly desludging once a year, (iii) 30% of households unable to pay the market
price and a further 20% are unwilling, and so on. For this study, we have kept things simple.

Santa Cruz has a relatively developed FSM market, with the first emptying service providers
appearing around 25 years ago. There are currently 27 registered FS emptying and transport
service providers (ERTLs) – however, only 14 of them currently transport the collected FS to a
SAGUAPAC wastewater treatment plant, the only cooperative that currently has an adequate
treatment facility (WSP, 2016). Tariffs for services have been reported to be high by households –
indeed, WSP studies suggest that ERTLs operate under oligopolistic competition (i.e. service
providers make informal agreements about tariffs to guarantee some level of profit) (WSP, 2010).

Demand is mainly driven by the need for corrective (e.g. pit/tank is overflowing) rather than
preventive measures (e.g. regular desludging). Poorly built infrastructure also reduces the demand
for FS emptying and transport services, as few pits/tanks are reported to fill up. Moreover, in some
cases, there is no hatch for emptying, forcing ERTLs to break through the floor to reach the
pit/tank, leaving many households unsatisfied with the service provided. Households that rely on
traditional latrines, where FS is contained in unlined pits, also have a tendency to build a new pit
once the one in use fills up, further discouraging demand for FSM services.


4.2        Methodology
This sub-section sets out key dimensions of demand and supply, and the data collected that is
related to these aspects. It was not intended to collect comprehensive data on demand and supply,
given the broad scope of the research and the limitations of some of the instruments used.

4.2.1      Demand

The research framework (see Section 1.3) poses the following question: What is the existing
customer demand and preferences for FSM services? i.e. the current effective demand. This is
discussed in three parts: (a) physical and economic determinants of household demand, (b)
household satisfaction with current services, and (c) barriers faced by households in obtaining
FSM services12. This list is not meant to be exhaustive, but rather considers key elements for
answering the questions in the research framework.

Physical and economic determinants of household demand

It is useful to separate the physical and economic determinants of household demand because the
differences between them have implications for any potential interventions, either in stimulating or
responding to demand. Physical determinants are related to geography and infrastructure,
whereas economic determinants are more to do with markets and finance.

The main determinants are set out in Table 9 and Table 10 below, describing its relevance and the
way they have been measured by the research instruments (if data is available).

Other barriers which households face in obtaining FSM services

Some reasons for a gap between potential and effective demand for FSM services in Santa Cruz
are already listed above (e.g. physical access to households and willingness to pay). However,
there are many other potential barriers which households may face in securing FSM services.

Some of the barriers to accessing services have not been possible to predict ex ante. They were
therefore explored in the qualitative research, particularly through FGDs with community members
and an ethnographic study of OSS use in non-sewered areas. Several of the discussion questions
focused around perceptions and opinions of existing services, and what participants would like to
see in terms of improved services in the future. Discussions were semi-structured, with participants
able to discuss questions more openly, so allowing for the identification of further determinants of
demand not otherwise addressed in the household survey. The Generic Data Collection
Instruments contain the full list of topics and questions addressed.

4.2.2      Supply

On the supply side, the research questions were around the current status and quality of FSM
service delivery, with a focus on assessing current technical and institutional capacity (i.e. the
scope and quality of services). This was assessed mainly through the report submitted by the WSP
consultant as well as other key WSP studies in Santa Cruz.

4.3        Findings: household demand for services
The results in each key area are presented below, with an overall assessment provided in the
concluding section, alongside implications for FSM in Santa Cruz.

4.3.1      Determinants of household demand

Accessibility

Whether a service provider can actually get to the facility requiring emptying (as well as the
household’s perception of this) will be a key determinant of demand for services. Data to assess
accessibility focused on the characteristics of the dwelling as well as the facility itself.

On one hand, the type of building influences the extent and nature of the emptying required. Table
11 shows that the majority of households live in owned residences (65%), most of which are
houses (likely to be single-storey). This is followed by rented (18%) or on loan (10%) arrangements
of single rooms or huts. An aspect to note is that 2% of dwellings are “illegally owned”, i.e. they are
probably located in occupied plots of land, with no property rights. Although potentially accessible,
these households usually have little incentive to invest in adequate sanitation facilities and
maintaining them given the vulnerability of their tenancy status.

Focusing on the facility itself, Table 12 below shows the accessibility of the main pit/tank structure
for households that have an emptiable structure (either septic tanks or soakaways). The majority of
households have a purpose-built hatch, which will facilitate the provision of FS emptying services,
with 17% of households requiring the removal of the squatting plate or lid. Although not captured
by the household survey, some households also require their lids or tanks to be perforated to allow
for FS extraction (SNV, 2015).

Overall, from the perspective of accessibility it is clear that there do not seem to be any significant
difficulties in accessing neither the dwelling nor the facilities themselves. However, there is no
evidence related to the quality of the roads and other geographical characteristics (e.g. hilly areas)
that may hinder ease of access for ERTLs.

Fill rate

Data on the type of containment was already shown in Table 5 above. The household survey also
collected information on the dimensions of the pit/tank as reported by the household, as well as the
time taken between the previous and the last emptying, which allow for an estimation of the
average fill rate for on-site facilities.

Table 13 shows the average estimated volume for soakaways and septic tanks in non-sewered
areas. Soakaways are commonly deeper and are thus able to contain a larger volume of FS (i.e.
20.0m3) as compared to septic tanks, which on average contain around 6.0m3.

Households were also asked how long it usually took for their pit to fill up, which is considered
more relevant and also a more reliable indicator for households to estimate. The results are shown
in Table 14 below for soakaways and septic tanks separately. The data shows that among the 11
households using soakaways, the majority take between 7 to 12 months to fill up (36%). For the 71
households using septic tanks, a fifth reported their tank filling in less than 6 months, followed by
18% of households who said their tank took between 2 to 3 years to fill up. Long fill-up rates for
septic tanks may be associated with poor construction or installation, with some reported to have
leakages and punctures to delay the need for emptying (Herreira Patiño et al, 2015).

Despite differences in the time ranges between the two types of containment systems, the average
time does not seem to differ as widely, with soakaways taking, on average, 2.6 years (standard
deviation of 1.04) to fill up as compared to 2.4 years (standard deviation of 0.27) for septic tanks.

Moving on to data on shared facilities, the average number of households per sanitation facility in
non-sewered areas was 1.2.13 It is also worth considering the number of people which were
sharing facilities in more detail, as shown in Table 15 below.14 This comes directly from data
reported by households. It should be noted that the average household size in non-sewered areas
was 5.8 people.

As shown below, the majority of sanitation facilities were shared with fewer than 6 people (56%).
This also holds for all types of facilities, with the exception of latrines to lined pits, of which 50% are
shared with 6-10 people. Flush to septic tanks are generally more private, with 71% of them being
shared with less than 6 people. About a quarter of facilities are shared between 6 to 10 people.

   For this estimate, households with private facilities (not sharing with other households) are included and coded as 1. If
these households are excluded, the average number of households per facility increases to 2.5.

   These data are drawn from the following household survey questions: “ How many households share this dwelling or
plot?”, “How many people live in this dwelling or plot?” and “How many sanitation facilities are functioning in this dwelling
or plot?”

Financial aspects

As noted above, data on willingness to pay (WTP) was collected through the household survey.
Data for the amount paid the last time the pit/septic tank was emptied is also available, with
additional information collected through FGDs and available in other WSP studies.

First though, it is worth briefly considering finance for containment. Based on information gathered
through FGDs, the estimated cost of a latrine to lined / unlined pit ranges between US $38 (250
Bs) and US $145 (1,000 Bs) as compared to US $2,177 ($15,000 Bs) for a flush to septic tank
(including superstructure and labour). This is consistent with the information provided by different
households in a parallel WSP ethnographic study: investments in containment range between US
$62 ($430 Bs) for a latrine to an unlined pit to US $1,742 ($12,000 Bs) for a flush to a septic tank
and soakaway, as shown in Table 16 below. Given that around 80% of household heads in Santa
Cruz have a monthly income of less than US $435 ($3,000 Bs), which is usually the main source of
income for households, it is clear that investing in adequate emptiable facilities requires significant
efforts and planning, and may even be unaffordable to some households.15

Table 17 shows household’s maximum willingness to pay for emptying services .16 The majority of
households (72%) are concentrated in a range of between US $36 - $51 per emptying and
transport service. Only 5% of households would be willing to pay more than US $87 per service.

Willingness to pay is below the average payment currently made by households for FS emptying
and transport – on average, households have paid US $68 (470 Bs) in the past. This suggests that
some households may not be considering FSM services as an affordable alternative – indeed, the
minimum wage in Bolivia is around US $240 (1,656 Bs), which means that FS emptying services
would amount to 28% of the monthly income.17 Thus, there may be some scope to increase
demand if prices for FSM services become are lowered, e.g. through increased competition
between ERTLs.

   Based on household survey data.

   Households were probed for all the listed prices above, answering ‘yes’ in cases where they were willing to pay the
cost given and ‘no’ in cases where the cost seemed too high.
17
   We may be over-estimating the proportion of costs for FS emptying and transport within household income as
households, especially the poor, have several sources of income.

Incentives

The incentives that drive demand for improved FSM services are mainly influenced by ownership
(of both the facility and the plot/dwelling itself), previous investments in constructing and
maintaining the sanitation facility (as described above), and the current quality of the facility.
Households may also be encouraged to use FS emptying and transport services if neighbourhood
pressures for safe FS disposal increase or if they have limited space in their plots to build a new
pit/tank.


4.4        Findings: supply of FSM services
As set put in Section 4.2.2, the supply side assessment is mainly related to the current status and
quality of FSM service delivery. This was described in KIIs with service providers, but also relies on
previous WSP studies and data on annual volumes and number of discharges by ERTLs.

4.4.1      Services effectively supplied

The first stage of the supply analysis should be to consider what services are supplied in the
market, where effective supply intersects with effective demand. Some relevant context was
already provided in Section 3.3.2 by the SFDs, especially Table 8 – this table shows that when
pits/tanks fill up, around 27% of households in non-sewered areas use FS emptying and transport
services, mainly due to overflow.

Table 18 shows the type of service provider used by households for emptying and transport. Given
that the FSM market has been in place for around 25 years, 95% of households hire an ERTL with
a vacuum truck (mechanical emptying) to empty their pits/tanks. Only 5% of households rely on
their members or other relatives for emptying. Since some of the ERTLs are small firms, many of
which are family-owned, it is unclear whether households who empty their pits/tanks use
mechanical or manual emptying.

Households were also asked about their knowledge of where FS was discharged after emptying.
Households were only asked at the initial discharge point, so they are not always in a position to
know where service providers eventually discharge to – indeed, 96% do not know where the FS is
transported to. However, among the households that knew, the majority reported contents being
transported to a wastewater treatment plant.

As mentioned in the previous section, households paid an average of US $68 (470 Bs) for FS
emptying and transport services. Table 20 shows the average price paid by type of service hired.
The cost of cleaning a septic tank (US $61) or a septic tank and a soakaway (US $69) is lower
than hiring an ERTL to clean a soakaway only (US $76). This is probably related to the fact that
soakaways may be more difficult to access, with lids/covers having to be removed or broken,
whereas septic tanks are more likely to have a hatch for emptying.

Households were also asked about their views regarding some of the aspects of FS emptying and
transport services that could be improved. Figure 7 shows that among households who have an
emptiable facility, 73% of them think that the cost could be “improved”, i.e. services could be
cheaper. Both ERTLs’ reliability (37%) and hygiene practices (35%) could also be improved –
indeed, a diagnosis of ERTLs capacity, infrastructure and technology used suggests that workers

do not always use adequate protection equipment (e.g. gloves, masks, etc.), while some of the

4.4.2      Service provider capacity

Manual emptying

There are no legal/formal manual emptying services in Santa Cruz. Manual emptying is likely to be
practiced by households who empty their pits/tanks themselves and potentially, some informal
service providers.

Mechanical emptying

Mechanical emptying is provided by FS emptying and transport service providers (ERTLs), of
which 27 are legally registered to the Water Supply and Basic Sanitation Supervision and Societal
Oversight Authority (AAPS). However, given the constitutional ban on private-sector participation in
the provision of water supply and sanitation services in Bolivia, there may be some private sector
firms illegally operating in the Santa Cruz market – previous studies mentioned there were over 40
ERTLs (see Rivera, 2010); whether these firms have been forced out of the market because of
increased competition or they have entered the informal market is unknown. It must also be noted
that the registration and formalisation process for ERTLs has 14 different steps, some of which are
not easy to comply, so some of the ERTLs that are currently operating in the market may actually
be in the process of becoming formalised.

ERTLs are generally subcontracted by one of the ten utilities/cooperatives (EPSAs) that currently
provide water supply and sanitation (WSS) services in Santa Cruz. Through this subcontract,
ERTLs agree on a fee rate to use the EPSAs ’ treatment facilities for FS discharge after emptying.
However, only SAGUAPAC, the main WSS cooperative has an adequate wastewater treatment

FS collected is treated inadequately or dumped illegally to the surrounding environment. WSP
(2016) estimates that around 24,000 m 3 of FS are illegally dumped every year.

Table 21 shows the capacity of ERTLs operating in Santa Cruz for which data is available and that
serve household demand for FS emptying and transport. Total capacity in 2013 was equal to
778,591 litres, provided by 64 vacuum trucks and 21 different firms. Between 60 and 65% of trucks
are refurbished (e.g. vacuums, container) in Santa Cruz. All of the ERTLs are small enterprises,
having a total of between 2 and 6 employees – indeed, some of these firms are actually family-
owned entrepreneurships.

Table 22 shows the number of discharges and volume of FS transported by ERTLs between 2011
and 2013. For the majority of ERTLs, both the number of discharges and volume transported have
increased across time, although some smaller firms seem to be shrinking or are being displaced
(e.g. Belen) by larger competitors (e.g. San Jorge, Servi Master). Overall, the number of
discharges has grown by 20% while the volume transported has grown by 31% between 2011 and
2013.

   Based on these data and demand projections for FS emptying and transport services, it seems
   ERTLs have sufficient flexibility to cope with increasing demand in the medium-term (see SNV,
   2015). However, in the extreme case in which all OSS facilities were to become emptiable (e.g.
   changing lined and unlined pits into cement-lined pits or other emptiable type of containment) and
   maintenance was carried out on a frequent basis (e.g. once per year), then current ERTLs capacity
   would be insufficient to meet demand, and investments would be needed to either increase the
   fleet number or its capacity.

5          City Service Delivery Assessment

5.1        Introduction
The FSM City Service Delivery Assessment (CSDA) is a crucial part of the analysis of FSM
services. It answers an overarching question around the quality of the FSM enabling environment,
the level of FSM service development and the level of commitment to FSM service sustainability.
The aim of the CSDA is to allow an objective assessment of FSM service performance through all
stages of the service chain, so as to identify priorities for reform. The Prognosis for Change (in the
next section) then attempts to explain why the CSDA looks like it does.

The CSDA format builds on an approach developed under the 12-city study (Peal & Evans, 2013).
In turn, the 12-city method was based on similar exercises in water and sanitation (e.g. Country
Status Overviews produced by WSP).

The CSDA is arranged around three broad areas: (1) enabling services, (2) developing services,
and (3) sustaining services. This is illustrated in Table 23 below, alongside the key question
associated with each area, and the indicators used.

                                        the current service outcomes?                 Service Outcomes



5.2        Methodology
The CSDA aims to be fully objective and transparent, so the analysis is clear and stakeholders can
engage with it and update it over time as the situation improves. It is primarily a qualitative
analysis, based on a review of key documents and interviews with stakeholders at the city level.
WSP’s overall study design was that the OPM/WEDC team designed the methodology, but did not
do primary data collection (for more information, please refer to Annex A). For analyses such as
the CSDA and PFC, it is very hard to separate data collection from analysis. Therefore, the
collection and preliminary analysis was conducted by a short-term consultant contracted by WSP,
Humberto Cáceres Magnus.

There are several questions beneath each of the nine overall indicators in Table 23 above, with 19
questions in total. For each question, there are objective criteria to enable a score to be given for
the city, with 0 (poor), 0.5 (developing) or 1 (good) on that question. Each question is scored along
the whole service chain from containment to disposal. An example is given in Table 24 below, for
the first question under the “policy” indicator.

Once all 19 questions are scored, the next step is to aggregate those scores into a city scorecard,
by summing together the scores for each indicator (policy, planning, etc.). Because there are
different numbers of questions for each indicator, a final step is required, which is to normalise the
scores to a total out of 3 for each indicator. This is achieved by dividing the city score for that
indicator by the maximum possible city score, multiplying by 3, and finally rounding to the nearest
0.5. This process delivers the overall CSDA scorecard. The output for Santa Cruz is shown in
Figure 8 below.

5.3        Findings
The overall CSDA scorecard for Santa Cruz is shown above in Figure 8. An explanation for each
score allocated to the full set of 19 questions is shown in Annex C, while the following sub-sections
summarise the implications of those results.

5.3.1      Enabling

The enabling environment refers to the current policy, planning and budgetary arrangements made
for FS services. The city of Santa Cruz currently has a poor enabling environment – while all FSM
components are considered in water, sanitation or environmental policies, there is no planning and
thus, no budget allocated for FSM activities. In particular, the Municipal Ordinance No. 031 of 2001
enacts the Municipal Regulation for Wastewater and Sludge Management in Santa Cruz, explicitly
indicating that households without access to sewerage must rely on alternative systems or services
for containment, emptying and transport of wastewater and sludge. Standards for emptying and
transport services are set out (e.g. types of trucks to be used, health and safety equipment for
workers), while Articles 53, 55 and 57 forbid the disposal of wastewater or sludge in public roads,
natural water bodies or any other unauthorised area. Article 45 also ordains that the wastewater /
sludge producer is “under the obligation of cleaning its septic tank at least once per year” .

In addition, the AAPS Administrative Regulatory Resolution No. 227 of 2010 (i) recognises the
existence of septic tanks, latrines and ecological sanitation in areas where there is no access to
sewerage; (ii) allows EPSAs (i.e. water supply and sanitation service providers) to provide low-cost
FS emptying and transport services (directly or via a third-party) in areas where no sewerage
expansion is planned in the short-run; and (iii) regulates ERTLs (i.e. FS emptying and transport
service providers) to ensure FS is discharged at treatment facilities and they comply with all legal
and environmental standards. Furthermore, the AAPS Administrative Regulatory Resolution No.
546 of 2014 establishes the operational and technical standards under which ERTLs must operate,
and the 2016-20 National Sanitation Plan sets out a wastewater reuse policy.

Despite the existence of a relatively comprehensive policy framework, the roles and responsibilities
of municipal and national institutions remains unclear – indeed, there is limited engagement from
municipal authorities in the provision of water supply and sanitation services, and hence FSM
(WSP, 2016). This lack of designated responsibilities directly hinders the operationalisation of the
regulatory mechanisms stipulated in the AAPS resolutions above; the AAPS itself is also known to
have limited capacity to enforce regulations. Another issue with the current regulatory framework
are the rules for formal registration and certification of ERTLs: many of these service providers are
family or micro businesses that are unable to comply with all the requirements, e.g. social security
for all employees, having a designated office space, etc.

The main deficiencies in the enabling environment are related to planning and budgetary
allocations: on one hand, the 2011-2015 Sector Development Plan for Basic Sanitation only
considered access to sewerage for people in urban and peri-urban areas, and although FSM is
encompassed in the policy and legislation described above, there are no specific targets. On the
other hand, given the current limitations for ERTLs to formalise, there are little incentives for FSM
investments. Most resources in urban areas are currently being directed towards the expansion of
the sewerage network and the construction of new wastewater treatment plants, with SAGUAPAC
allocating some resources to increase FS discharge capacity at treatment plants and the AAPS
working on improving regulatory mechanisms.

5.3.2      Developing

The developing environment has to do with the level of expenditure or investments, the degree of
equity, and the quality and quantity of services provided across the FSM chain. Santa Cruz is
currently at a developing stage, with a good range of FS emptying and transport services of decent
quality and with enough capacity to meet current demand.

Despite the existence of several ERTLs, the FS emptying and transport services are offered under
oligopolistic competition (as described in Section 4.2.2), where there is a tacit agreement between
service providers on the price for emptying and transport that allows for higher profits to be made
as compared to purely competitive markets. With these prices, services remain largely
unaffordable to the poorest households, amounting to almost a third of the current minimum wage.
The costs for containment are more aligned with households’ ability to pay – however, the type of
OSS facilities built by the poorest are rarely deemed as effective containment.

Given the above, as well as the prioritisation of investments in sewerage and treatment facilities,
services cannot be deemed equitable, which is one of the areas where Santa Cruz significantly
under-performs. Although the city has made significant investments in improving FS services,
especially with the support of WSP, most of the focus so far has been on the supply side, i. e.
standardising and formalising EPSAs and ERTLs activities. Recent initiatives aimed at increasing
competitiveness across ERTLs (e.g. a call centre for FSM services) may reduce prices and allow
for increased access among the urban poor. However, more emphasis needs to be placed on
these populations, especially with increasing rural-urban migration and urbanisation trends.

Regarding the quantity and quality of the services provided, FSM emptying, transport and
treatment services are generally good, but there are still improvements to be made with regards to
the availability of treatment facilities for FS discharge (currently, ERTLs can only discharge at the
main SAGUAPAC treatment facility), ensuring that all FS emptied is actually transported to a
treatment plant, and also guaranteeing that ERTLs comply with all administrative and technical
standards (e.g. AAPS registration, provision of health and safety equipment, use of adequate
trucks and emptying tools, etc.). There are still no formal services for FS reuse in Santa Cruz, so
this is also an area that requires prioritisation.

5.3.3      Sustaining

The sustaining environment captures the status of operation and maintenance (O&M), the
provisions made for service expansion and the current outcomes with regards to public health and
the percentage of FS that is effectively managed. Overall, the city of Santa Cruz is at a developing
stage.

Regarding O&M, although ERTLs do not systematically keep financial records, especially the
smallest firms, both Caceres Magnus (2015) and SNV (2015) show that the majority of ERTLs are
currently making profits after discounting O&M costs. As mentioned in the enabling and developing
sections above, the Municipal Ordinance No. 031 of 2011, all other AAPS regulations, and the
documents drafted with WSP support have set out the norms, standards and sanctions for FS
emptying, transport and treatment services. Although the local environmental authority is in charge
of defining the norms and standards for OSS facilities (i.e. containment), these do not seem to be
available, except for septic tanks and soakaways. There are no specific standards and sanctions
for FS reuse either.

Moreover, reporting for FS emptying, transport and treatment is currently being undertaken for
registered ERTLs, but there is no data for firms that operate in the informal market, nor is there


© Oxford Policy Management                                                                         34
Fecal Sludge Management in Santa Cruz, Bolivia – Case Study Report


adequate monitoring of how much FS is effectively contained and the frequency of maintenance of
OSS facilities. The AAPS Administrative Regulatory Resolution No. 546 of 2014 provides some
guidance on the frequency of reporting on to the AAPS, but this is yet to be fully operationalised.

In what concerns FS services expansion, so far no policies and procedures have been developed
to stimulate demand. Although the creation of a call centre for FS emptying and transport services
may encourage demand, especially among low-income households, investments also need to be
made to ensure that containment facilities are adequately built and maintained to ensure the
sustainability of demand. However, government measures for sector development have been
taken forwards through the Technical Assistance provide by WSP for emptying, transport and
treatment. Further efforts are required to ensure these measures are sustainable, e.g. by including
specific targets in national or city-level sanitation plans, and also to strengthen FS containment and
reuse sub-sectors.

Finally, performance with regards to service outcomes is relatively good: the percentage of total FS
generated by the city that is managed effectively at containment, emptying and transport stages is
above 50% (as shown in Figure 5), and thus the public health risks at these stages are between
low and medium. Health risks at containment are deemed to be high as some of the OSS facilities
are not built properly, leaching into the surrounding environment, while many other overflow due to
poor maintenance. Risk is deemed at a medium level for emptying as some ERTLs use faulty
equipment and not all personnel is adequately protected.

5.3.4      Implications of the CSDA scorecard

The resulting CSDA scorecard for Santa Cruz suggests that service delivery is poor for the
enabling environment, but developing across the developing and sustaining environments. Indeed,
Santa Cruz has a relatively developed FSM context for Latin America with a comprehensive
regulatory framework for emptying, transport and treatment, as well as 27 operational and formal
FS emptying and transport service providers that seem to be financially sustainable (i.e. current
demand allows firms to cover their O&M expenses and in some cases, make some profit).

Nonetheless, there are several issues that need to be improved. On one hand, although there are
containment standards for rural areas, where OSS is more predominant, there are limited
standards or regulations for containment, which are only existent for septic tanks and soakaways,
and are not necessarily acknowledged. These are key to ensure that FS does not end-up in the
surrounding environment or receiving waters, but also to encourage household demand for FS
emptying and transport services. Efforts should also be made to ensure containment standards are
disseminated across non-sewered areas to increase compliance, especially given the limited
capacity for monitoring and enforcement. A regulatory framework is also required for FS reuse –
although there have been some initiatives directed at regulating wastewater reuse in other cities of
Bolivia, there are no frameworks for FS reuse in urban areas. On the other hand, more capacity
(both financially and with human resources) needs to be given to the AAPS and other local
authorities to improve the enforcement of regulations, especially regarding ERTL formalisation and
adequate FS treatment.

Another issue that needs to be addressed is the lack of equity of the current FSM market – the
average cost of a FS emptying and transport service is US $68, which amounts to almost a third of
the Bolivian minimum wage and thus remains unaffordable to the poorest households. Indeed,
there have been reports of some households puncturing their septic tanks to delay fill-up rates.
Costs could be reduced by increasing market competition or providing some sort of cross-subsidy
for the poorest households. Service provision could also be improved by enforcing technical

standards for FS emptying and transport as to minimise health risks for both consumers and
suppliers.

Finally, although significant efforts have been made since 2009 with WSP’s support, ways to
maintain political buy-in need to be explored to ensure the FSM sector is also prioritised and focus
is not solely directed towards expanding the sewerage network or building new treatment plants.
Planning and budget allocations need to include FSM to ensure services are sustainable in the
medium- to long-term – this cannot be achieved without a full commitment all relevant stakeholders
(including government, private sector, civil society, etc).

6          Prognosis for Change

6.1        Introduction
This chapter provides a Prognosis for Change (PFC), by considering the positions of various
stakeholders, in particular the institutions and incentives at play. In the sanitation sector, key
studies considering these questions include a multi-country study carried out by WSP with OPM
(WSP, 2010) and a series of papers by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI, 2013). In
addition, SANDEC’s recent FSM book includes a chapter on stakeholder analysis, which is a key
methodology for this kind of analysis (Strande et al, 2014). Through this prognosis for change, it is
intended to understand three elements, which are briefly outlined below and in Figure 9.

Firstly, a PFC considers how institutions function. Here, institutions are defined as “the rules and
norms governing human interaction”, rather than a narrower definition of organisations. Institutions
can be formal – such as codified laws, e.g. a by-law about where FS can be legally dumped – and
informal, as is the case of social norms, such as prevailing attitudes towards reusing FS in
agriculture.

Secondly, a PFC considers the incentives which institutions provide to different stakeholders. A
stakeholder is any individual or group with an interest in the outcomes of a policy. In FSM,
stakeholders may include sludge truck companies, the municipality, or poor households.
Stakeholders can be defined broadly or narrowly defined as required by the breadth and depth of
the analysis. For example, the former stakeholders could be narrowed to recent entrants to the
sludge truck market, the planning department of the municipality, or poor female dwellers. This
allows for a more nuanced analysis rather than taking all organisations as homogeneous.

Third, a PFC considers how stakeholders exert influence. Here, influence is defined as the formal
or informal power to cause something or to prevent it from occurring. In FSM, it might be worth
considering municipality by-laws on fecal sludge. A municipality may have formal legal power, but if
all their by-laws are openly flouted by service providers without fear of punishment, then their
influence is very low by that measure. They may however have informal power to influence the
FSM market in other ways, such as the actions undertaken by employees when they identify a
blocked sewer pipe.

Finally, for a PFC to be practically useful, it should also consider the implications of the findings for
effective engagement in a reform or change process. This involves the assessment of the options
for engagement, and weighing them up in the context of the prevalent power dynamics and likely
response of stakeholders.

6.2        Methodology
In this study, developing a PFC was only one concern alongside a large number of other research
components. There was therefore a balance to be struck. The approach was to link a focussed
PFC closely to the service delivery assessment, presented in the previous section (Section 5). The
aim is therefore to explain why the CSDA is as it is – in other words, to explore why service
delivery blockages exist and what entry points are available to stakeholders to try and resolve
them.

Undertaking a PFC is primarily a qualitative exercise. It relies mainly on Key Informant Interviews
(KIIs) with relevant stakeholders and focus group discussions, alongside secondary data in the
form of key sector documents, reports and studies. As noted in Section 5.2 for the CSDA
methodology, the OPM/WEDC team did not conduct the primary data collection and preliminary
analysis, which was carried out by other consultants contracted by the World Bank. Reports from
these consultants were the primary inputs for the construction of this PFC.

Developing a PFC requires a structure in order to be clearly analysed and communicated. There
are a bewildering number of tools available, which can be applied to particular questions as to
explore some of the issues described in Section 5. Many tools which are commonly used, including
in this study, are contained in a sourcebook which OPM produced for the World Bank (Holland,
2007). The main tools used include institutional responsibility analysis, stakeholder analysis and
process mapping.


6.3        Findings
As noted above, the main objective is to explore why the CSDA results are as they are. For Santa
Cruz, the CSDA is broadly yellow (i.e. “developing” scores), with red (i.e. “poor” scores) for
planning, budget and expenditure, and the reuse stage of the FS chain. Scores for the areas of the
chain across the developing and sustaining environments are between 1 and 3 (“developing” to
“good”), with generally good performance for emptying, transport and treatment stages, especially
regarding outputs, O&M and service outcomes. Thus, the job of the PFC in the Santa Cruz context
is to try and explain “why is this the status of FSM” an d what the prognosis for change is.

At this stage, it is worth reconsidering Santa Cruz’ context and the responsibility of key actors,
which were briefly set out in Section 2.3.

6.3.1      Santa Cruz’ FSM context

Overall, 49% of households in Santa Cruz are connected to the sewerage network, with the
remaining households using on-site sanitation (46%) or practising open defecation (5%). In
addition, household survey data suggests that, among households using OSS or practising OD,
around 69% have an improved sanitation facility, 22% have a shared facility, and the remaining 9%
have an unimproved facility.

Focussing exclusively on the demand for FSM services, among households using OSS, 27% claim
to empty their tanks / pits, with 95% of them using FS emptying and transport services provided by
ERTLs. Services seem to be mainly used for facilities discharging into a septic tank with soakaway
or a septic tank, with a frequency of 6 months for the majority of septic tanks and between 7 to 12
months for most soakaways – however, the average reported fill-up rate is around 2.5 years for all
types of OSS facilities. Although around 83% of containment facilities have an access point for
emptying, the majority are not properly built (e.g. some household perforate their septic tanks to
reduce the fill-up rate, recent proliferation of lined but bottomless pits) with FS leaching into the
surrounding environment. Considering that around two thirds of the FS collected does not reach a
treatment facility, estimates suggest that in non-sewered areas of Santa Cruz only around 8% of
total FS is effectively managed (see Figure 6).

Santa Cruz has a relatively developed FSM market, with 27 ERTLs formally (i.e. registered)
operating. Previous studies suggest that the price setting occurs under oligopolistic competition,
with ERTLs making higher profits than expected in a purely competitive market. On average,
households pay US $68 per FS emptying and transport service, which amounts to almost a third of
the current Bolivian minimum wage. When asked about FS service satisfaction, 73% of households
consider that prices could be “improved”, suggesting that the cost for FS emptying and transport is
indeed too high for the average household in non-sewered areas.

Although the developing and sustaining environments are both at a developing stage, the enabling
environment remains poor – despite the existence of FSM policy, there are very limited planning
and budgetary arrangements. FSM services remain inequitable (i.e. unaffordable to the very poor)
and without clear governmental support – most of the focus is still on sewerage expansion and the
construction of wastewater treatment plants. Another area that requires further attention is FS
reuse: there is some policy development happening with the support of WSP, but it mainly refers to
wastewater reuse for irrigation with no explicit mention of FS reuse in urban or peri-urban areas.

6.3.2      Mapping institutional responsibilities

The focus of the PFC is on how institutions function, the incentives which those institutions provide
to stakeholders, and how those stakeholders exert influence. It is therefore important to understand
who those stakeholders are, alongside their formal and informal roles. A useful tool to do this is
institutional responsibility mapping, as set out in Table 25 below. Stakeholders have been
categorised by sector (e.g. national or local government, private, etc.), and both their formal
responsibilities (‘what should be happening’) and the reality (‘what actually happens’) in FSM in
Santa Cruz are described. A final column summarises some of the main challenges faced.

The main messages are the following:

        Roles and responsibilities across national, departmental and municipal governments may
         be clearly defined but are not clearly understood / practiced, with the Ministry of
         Environment and Water having limited participation in the design of FSM policies, the Santa
         Cruz department also remaining relatively inactive given that services seem to be

         adequately provided by the municipalities, and the municipalities subsequently remaining
         on the margin and trusting EPSAs to be adequately managing and monitoring ERTLs.

        The lack of defined roles and responsibilities for FSM impacts on the availability and
         allocation of financial and human resources for FSM both regarding budget and planning
         but also for the effective implementation of the regulatory framework. For instance, the
         AAPS has limited capacity to support ERTLs in fulfilling all registration and certification
         requirements and also ensure that services are adequately provided. The focus on ERTL
         registration and certification (which pertains more to the AAPS and the SNI) may also be
         distracting national, departmental and municipal governments from broader FSM issues.

        Regarding the supply of FSM services, EPSAs have contracted ERTLs for the provision of
         FS emptying and transport services, but only SAGUAPAC has adequate facilities for FS
         discharge and treatment. This reduces competition among EPSAs and does not allow
         ERTLs to comply with environmental standards. Moreover, given the nature of some of the
         ERTLs (i.e. small or family-businesses), almost half of them remain unregistered and thus
         operate partially or fully in the informal market. Given the limited capacity of the AAPS and
         SNI to do effective monitoring, ERTLs sometimes also engage in tax evasion.

        On the demand side, households, commercial establishments and the industry / oil
         businesses all seem to be paying higher prices than they would otherwise pay in a
         competitive market. There are also issues regarding the quality of construction of OSS
         facilities (not all of them are emptiable or leach into the surrounding environment) and
         awareness of the required frequency of maintenance activities.

6.3.3      Influence and interests of stakeholders

When considering reform options, as would be the case with the introduction of a call centre for FS
emptying and transport services, it is crucial to consider how stakeholders might respond, e.g. who
would be supportive and who would oppose – in other words, their interest or whether they stand
to gain or lose from any change to the status quo. With a limited amount of time and effort to put
into preparing the ground and working with different stakeholders, it would be wise to use that time
efficiently and target it at the right people. Therefore, information about stakeholders’ interests is
not enough. It must be used in combination with an analysis of their relative influence. This will
allow to identify who potentially opposes the reform and, among them who has enough decisive
power to prevent it from being implemented. We will use the introduction of the call centre for the
provision of FS services as an illustrative example, but this analysis can be carried out for any
other initiative considered for the improvement of FSM services in Santa Cruz.

Interest and influence can be scored and mapped onto a stakeholder matrix, as in Figure 10 below.
Although stakeholder matrices can help start a conversation about stakeholder engagement in
reform processes, they have inherent limitations, e.g. it is not possible to be certain about how
different stakeholders would respond, stakeholders are not homogeneous, etc. In the matrix shown
below, the question of whether each stakeholder would support or oppose the creation of a call
centre to enhance competition for the provision of FS emptying and transport services is
considered. Their relative interest and influence to cause or prevent such a change is assessed
and scored on a scale from -10 to 10. Thus, a score of (-10,-10) represents a stakeholder that
strongly opposes the reform but has minimal influence, while a score of (10, 10) is representative
of a stakeholder that shows strong support and is also decisive for the reform to be implemented.

Figure 10 suggests that the majority of stakeholders would support or strongly support the creation
of a call centre in Santa Cruz for the provision of FS emptying and transport services. This is partly
based on KIIs carried out by SNV with different stakeholders to assess the viability of this initiative.

Starting with national level stakeholders, the Ministry of Environment and Water (MMAyA) was
placed in a neutral position with significant influence, given its overview of all the water supply and
sanitation sector, but also its limited involvement in the design and implementation of FSM policies
in urban areas, especially with decentralisation of responsibilities to departmental and municipal
levels. On the contrary, the National Tax Service (SNI) would potentially have minimal influence
(as the call centre would only operate with registered ERTLs), but may display some support as
the call centre would help enforce monitoring and thus reduce tax evasion. Finally, the AAPS,
given its regulatory functions and vigilance over tariffs and prices, as well as its active involvement
in the design and implementation of FSM policies, is deemed to be decisive and also highly
supportive as the call centre would help it fulfil its monitoring obligations by providing key
information on the number of discharges, FS volume treated, FS origin, etc. The AAPS also
believes the call centre would improve the quality of FSM services and would guarantee a fair price
to consumers (SNV, 2015).

At the departmental level, the Santa Cruz government could potentially have some significant
influence, given its mandate over municipalities, and would likely support the call centre as it would
contribute to its responsibility of guaranteeing adequate FS emptying, transport and treatment
services. However, the Santa Cruz Environmental Authority is likely to have little influence and take
a neutral position: although the call centre may increase demand and thus the proportion of FS that
is effectively managed, it may also divert more active investments on treatment plants or other
initiatives directly targeted at environmental management.

At the municipal level, local governments are decisive (given their direct mandate over the
provision of water supply and sanitation services) and will strongly support the call centre given the
potential benefits to consumers and also its possibility for enhancing monitoring and enforcement
of FSM policy and regulations. Similarly, the EPSAs will strongly support the creation of the call
centre, but have a lower level of influence. In particular, EPSAs believe that there is likely to be an
increase in demand and thus increased competition and improved price-setting (SNV, 2015).
Finally, the ERTLs will strongly oppose the initiative: they argue that firms are highly
heterogeneous in terms of size, interests and market development capacity, which would difficult
price-setting. They would also distrust the transparency of the call centre in monitoring and
allocating FS emptying and transport services to the cheapest supplier. ERTLs are deemed to be
decisive in this case because a call centre cannot be established or maintained without their full
cooperation (Ibid, 2015).

Lastly, with regards to households, commercial establishments and industry, all of them have
minimal or some influence – since households are likely to be the main beneficiaries, a higher level
of influence has been allocated to them. Assuming prices for FS emptying and transport services
are likely to decrease in a context of higher competition between ERTLs, then these stakeholders
would also be supportive of the introduction of a call centre. However, the industry and oil
businesses, given their higher ability to pay, would potentially express more indifference; thus, their
lower level of support.

6.3.4      Illustrating the incentive problem

It is also helpful to consider the problem of poor FSM in Santa Cruz in two dimensions. The first
dimension is static, that is, the way households, service providers and government stakeholders
are currently dealing with OSS and FSM (partly described in Table 25 above). The second
dimension is dynamic – the city is changing both spatially and demographically (e.g. increased
migration from rural areas). In terms of policy, the static problem requires an action that could be
implemented immediately but may have a slow response over time – for example, there may be
ways of persuading households to improve their OSS facilities and carry out maintenance on a

frequent basis. However, the dynamic problem requires long-term involvement and engagement in
areas that are more the domain of urban planning than sanitation policy and practice, e.g. ensuring
that rural migrants settle in adequate areas that allow for the effective provision of water supply
and sanitation services.

A useful tool to illustrate these problems is process mapping. This tool aims to understand the
interaction between formal and informal “steps” in a process and identify entry points for
engagement. Similarly to the stakeholder matrix, it is important to assess the roles of the key
stakeholders in a process, how and where they exert influence, and the incentives they face in
both formal and informal systems.

For this analysis, we have focussed on the process for requesting FS emptying and transport
services when a septic tank fills up. This is shown in Figure 11 below. The central column shows
the formal process that is supposed to be followed by the household, while the right column shows
elements of the informal processes, i.e. what really happens.

Once a septic tank fills up, the household calls an ERTL to request an FS emptying and transport
service. The ERTL should then provide the services, ideally within the day, and transport the FS to
an EPSA treatment facility to ensure effective management. In reality, however, not all septic tanks
are properly built or adequately maintained, making demand more unreliable and also making it
more difficult for ERTLs to provide an adequate service. Once an ERTL is reached, they are not
always readily available and may not be able to provide FSM services in a timely manner.
Moreover, even if the services are provided, these are not necessarily of the highest quality, with
some ERTLs not having adequate or properly maintained equipment. Only around half of ERTLs
are currently registered, with the remaining ones operating in an informal environment and
possibly, evading taxes. Finally, once FS is collected from the household, only 33% is effectively
transported and discharged at a treatment plant, with the remaining FS being discharged in the
surrounding environment or at treatment facility that does not provide effective treatment for FS.

The divergence between formal and informal processes gives rise to different entry points to
improve FSM services. All of these entry points are aligned with some of the deficiencies identified
in the enabling, developing and sustaining environments in the CSDA. First, it would be helpful for
households if there were publicly available standards for the construction of OSS containment
facilities and these were adequately disseminated – enforcement is likely to be more difficult given
that many households are built by informal contractors or families themselves. Second, the AAPS
and EPSAs should continue their efforts to encourage ERTLs formalisation, but efforts should also
be directed towards consumers (e.g. households, commercial establishments, etc.) to encourage
them to request receipts for the services received from ERTLs. Third, to ensure that services are
adequately provided, the administrative and technical standards encompassed in the AAPS
Administrative Regulatory Resolution No. 546 of 2014 should be enforced. Finally, to increase the
proportion of FS that is effectively managed, it is necessary to either invest in the construction of
new wastewater and FS treatment facilities to be managed by other EPSAs besides SAGUAPAC,
or the latter’s wastewater and FS treatment capacity needs to be increased. Flexibility in the
contracts between ERTLs and EPSAs to ensure SAGUAPAC treatment facilities are always used
in the meantime may also improve the effectiveness of FS management.

6.3.5      Implications for FSM in Santa Cruz

This chapter has explained why the CSDA for Santa Cruz is poor for the enabling environment and
at a developing stage across the developing and sustaining environments. As described in earlier
sections, although the regulatory framework and services are relatively well developed across the
emptying, transport and treatment stages of the FSM chain, a stakeholder mapping analysis
reveals that the roles and responsibilities across different government levels are not clearly
understood, with central/national and departmental governments remaining largely inactive in the
design of FSM policy and provision of services. This is partly explained by the decentralisation of
water and sanitation services in the 90s, which allocated responsibilities to the lowest levels of
government in an attempt to increase government accountability to the electorate, among other
concerns. However, for decentralisation to be effective, financial resources need to be allocated to
the sector, and more specifically, to FSM. This requires more political buy-in for FSM, and
subsequently, more active participation in the design of FSM policies and programmes.

Regarding the actual supply of FSM services, although the contractual arrangements between
EPSAs and ERTLs seem to be operating relatively well, SAGUAPAC is currently the only WSS
utility that can offer adequate treatment for FS. This may reduce competition between EPSAs and
also limits the ability of ERTLs to comply with technical and environmental standards. ERTLs
service provision is also hindered by the existence of very demanding requirements for
formalisation as compared to their average size (e.g. number of employees, emptying trucks, etc.)

and nature (e.g. micro-firms or family businesses). On the demand side, households in non-
sewered areas, especially the very poor, are not familiar or are unable to afford adequate
containment options, with many pits, soakaways and septic tanks leaching into the surrounding
environment. Although the law suggests that septic tanks should be emptied or checked once per
year, households do not seem to be aware of this legislation nor is it enforced.

If a reform to develop or improve FSM was proposed, the stakeholder matrix analysis suggests
that, given the limited involvement in FSM to date from central/national and departmental
governments, they are likely to take a neutral or slightly supportive position, despite them being
highly influential for the implementation of any initiative in the WSS sector. Both the AAPS and the
SNI, given their direct role in the formalisation of ERTLs, are likely to be supportive and
decisive/highly influential, with the likely exception of cases in which revenues collected through
formalisation processes are reduced. At the departmental level, stakeholders are also likely to be
supportive, mainly because reforms to improve FSM would contribute to their responsibility of
guaranteeing adequate access to water and sanitation within the department of Santa Cruz,
although potentially less influential than central-level government institutions. Finally, both
municipal stakeholders and consumers (households, commercial establishments and industry) will
likely support all measures to improve FSM, with the exception of reforms that increase
competition among ERTLs, as this will lead to a reduction in profits and the exit of the most
inefficient operators, which may deter some EPSAs and ERTLs to give their full support. However,
all of these stakeholders, on their own, are less decisive, and they would only be able to drive a
reform is some sort of “collective action” is undertaken.

Lastly, a process mapping analysis points to some of the interventions that could be carried out to
improve FSM services. These include: (i) developing standards for OSS containment, which are
publicly accessible and acknowledged by all citizens and government counterparts; (ii) support
ERTL formalisation with consumer education or sanctions if formal service providers are not
contracted; (iii) enforce ERTLs administrative and technical standards; and (iv) increase FS
treatment capacity.

7          Conclusions and recommendations
The study has identified several key challenges in ensuring continued provision of safe sanitation
services to all citizens in Santa Cruz. Besides inherent issues related to heightened rural-urban
migration and thus, increased urbanisation, other concerns relate to:

        Lack of adequate containment facilities and maintenance – many of the pits / tanks built in
         peri-urban areas leach into the surrounding environment. Given a high water table and poor
         maintenance on behalf of households, sanitation facilities also tend to overflow. It is mainly
         in these “emergency” cases when FS emptying and transport services are demanded. Poor
         containment is also reinforced by the lack of or unawareness of construction standards and
         guidelines, and insufficient vigilance.

        High inequity across the FSM service provision chain – while there are 27 different ERTLs
         operating in Santa Cruz, FS emptying and transport services remain unaffordable for the
         poorest and most vulnerable households. The cost of adequate sanitation and containment
         infrastructure is also high.

        No frameworks for FS reuse – although wastewater reuse for irrigation has been explored,
         FS reuse has not been considered yet. FS is currently discharged at one of SAGUAPAC’s
         treatment plants with other EPSAs not having the capacity or the facilities to receive
         collected FS.

Whatever interventions are proposed as a result of detailed, extensive and focused studies to
address these challenges, and recognising that Santa Cruz citizens will need to rely on on-site
sanitation facilities for the next 15-20 years (as sewerage coverage will not grow as fast as the
urban population), the findings of this study recommend:

    1. Ensuring adequate infrastructure is available at all stages of the FSM chain, focussing
       mainly on containment and treatment. As mentioned in WSP (2016), technical norms and
       guidelines for the construction of sanitation, containment and treatment facilities need to be
       established and enforced by municipal governments.

    2. Procedures and regulations for ERTL formalisation should be more flexible and aligned with
       the nature of service providers (i.e. small micro or family businesses), which currently face
       significant barriers to meet AAPS and SNI requirements. Besides the direct benefits
       perceived by these firms with formalisation, competition will increase as more businesses
       become formal, increasing the efficiency and equity of the FSM market.

    3. Affordability and access to FS emptying and transport services needs to be guaranteed.
       Besides finding ways to increase competition among ERTLs, cross-subsidies or alternative
       payment schemes should also be considered to increase access for the poorest and most
       vulnerable.

    4. Although the FSM market is relatively developed in Santa Cruz, the enabling environment
       is still focussed on the provision of sewerage services. FSM is encompassed in policy at
       different stages, but with several gaps containment and reuse. However, national or
       municipal water and sanitation plans have no targets for FSM components or OSS, and
       thus, there are no budget allocations for them either. Public sector institutions are already
       struggling to monitor and enforce recent FSM regulations, so more resources (including
       personnel) are needed by the sector. Established plans and budgets may also encourage
       political buy-in, especially at lower levels of government.

Annex A               Methodology

The overall case study methodology is explained in the Tools and guidelines and Data Collection
Instrument.

A.1      Overall design
A key component of this study was primary data collection, since it aimed to build on an earlier 12-
city FSM study based only on secondary data (Peal & Evans, 2013). The study had six different
data collection instruments, four quantitative and two qualitative, each of which contribute to
various project components. These instruments are summarised in Table 26 below.

The overall design decided by WSP was that the OPM/WEDC team should lead on methodology
and analysis, while actual data collection would be managed by two types of consultants
contracted separately. A local NGO, SNV Bolivia, was contracted by WSP to conduct primary data
collection except for the Key Informant Interviews. In addition, a short-term consultant (Humberto
Cáceres Magnus) was contracted to conduct the Key Informant Interviews and produce a draft of
the Service Delivery Assessment and Prognosis for Change.

Detailed research protocols for the instruments in the table above are available in a separate
instruments report here. This section briefly summarises each instrument, and the ensuing section
describes the sampling approach.

Household survey

The household survey aimed to collect data from households using on-site sanitation regarding
their use of FSM services and preferences for future FSM services. The household survey informs

multiple components of this research. The sampling was carefully planned so as to allow
representative conclusions to be drawn from households in non-sewered areas of Santa Cruz
Metropolitan Area18, and separate conclusions for lowest-income non-sewered areas19 in
particular, on a purposive basis. Questionnaire sections included a household roster, dwelling
characteristics, use of water and sanitation infrastructure, satisfaction and planning on sanitation,
maintenance and emptying, and interest in the development of a call centre and willingness to pay.

Key informant interviews

Key informant interviews (KIIs) are the way in which primary information was sought to address
key questions about how both the ‘enabling environment’ and the operating environment affects
FSM services (past, current and future). KIIs were held with stakeholders having responsibility or
interest in FSM services at city-level and beyond, allowing the enabling and operating
environments to be better understood in relation to their influence within the city.

Focus group discussions

The objective of focus group discussions (FGDs) with residents of informal settlements was to
gather qualitative data that would complement, validate, or perhaps challenge responses made
during the household survey. Questions focused on obtaining information relating to household
sanitation and FSM practices (particularly identifying the practices of “others”, as individuals are
reluctant to talk honestly about their own, or their families’ practices), service levels, past
interventions, risks and other issues associated with FSM services that affect their community.

A.2      Sampling
A.2.1 Household survey

The main sampling method design was for the household survey, with the sampling approaches for
other instruments using the selected clusters as a basis. Therefore, the household survey is
discussed first, and the remaining instruments are covered afterwards. Overall, it is crucial to
understand that in the sampling, two pictures were being sought: the first to give an understanding
of the situation of households in (1) non-sewered areas of Santa Cruz, and (2) a specific
understanding of the situation in lowest-income areas.

Given that the main purpose of the household survey was to assess the feasibility of creating a call
centre to provide FS emptying and transport services, the study population were households that
rely on on-site sanitation and are not prioritised in any sanitation plan to get access to sewerage in
the short term. There were two sub-sample areas (denoted A and B). Sub-sample A was
representative of non-sewered areas (4,425 eligible households) while sub-sample B focused on
the lowest-income non-sewered households (5,151 eligible households). Sub-sample B is not
representative as households were purposively selected to be able to locate and focus on the most
vulnerable on-site sanitation users. The aim was to get estimates at minimum cost and
administrative burden. Hence, the sample has a relatively small size as compared to what would
be necessary for studies with different objectives (e.g. an evaluation aiming to attribute impact to a
specific sanitation intervention).




18
   In the other case country studies, sampling was designed to draw representative conclusions for the city as a whole,
and lowest-income non-sewered areas in particular.
19
   Lowest-income areas were selected based on an estimated wealth index based on average household assets at the
block (i.e. manzana) level.

Fecal Sludge Management in Santa Cruz, Bolivia – Case Study Report


Sub-samples and sampling units

For sub-sample A, the Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) were blocks or manzanas. For sub-sample
B, households were chosen among the lowest-income blocks (i.e. lowest and second quintiles).
The latter were chosen based on an estimated assets wealth index at the block level – household
assets were averaged across the entire block, and these were then used in the Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) for the estimation of the wealth index. The Secondary Sampling Units
(SSUs) were households using on-site sanitation in both cases.

Sample sizes

To be consistent with other city case studies, the sample size for each sub-sample was 360
households, giving a total number of 720 households surveyed across both sub-samples.

A.2.2 Other instruments

Key informant interviews

The total number of interviews required, as well as the range and extent of questioning, was
influenced by the availability of current and reliable data from other sources, as well as constraints
on time and resources. Selection of interviewees was purposive, based on advice received from
stakeholders and existing knowledge of the World Bank consultant.

Focus group discussions

FGDs were distributed as follows:

        2 FGDs were held in public and private institutions (e.g. schools, health facilities, etc.);

        2 FGDs were held with high- or medium-level income households that have septic tanks;

        2 FGDs were held with low-income households that have septic tanks and use FS emptying
         and transport services;

        2 FGDs were held with low-income households that have a soakaway or lined pit and carry
         out maintenance activities;

        1 FGD was held with low-income households who have lined pits (as a temporary
         sanitation alternative) and do not use FS emptying and transport services; and

        1 FGD was held with low-income households who have an unlined pit and thus do not use
         or require FS emptying and transport services.

A.3      Fieldwork implementation
Pretesting, training and piloting

Initial pre-testing was carried out by SNV to refine the instruments –data collection instruments
were piloted in one urban community, excluding those PSUs which were part of the sample.

Field team composition and data collection




© Oxford Policy Management                                                                              54
Fecal Sludge Management in Santa Cruz, Bolivia – Case Study Report


For the quantitative survey, field teams were composed by one Supervisor and four Household
Enumerators. An experienced Field Manager was responsible for ensuring overall management,
field implementation and quality assurance.

The field teams collected the majority of the data from the 60 sampled PSUs in 4 weeks during
April 2015.

Data entry, cleaning and analysis

The quantitative survey data were entered into SPSS at SNV’s offices in Bolivia, using various data
quality checks, including range checks, skips and internal consistency checks. After data cleaning
checks, data were then transferred into the statistical software Stata. Data were analysed using
Stata in OPM’s offices in Oxford.

A.4      Limitations
This study has two key limitations which need to be considered to understand the strengths and
weaknesses of the data and the conclusions that can and cannot be drawn from the analysis.
These should be considered in the context of the objectives of the study (see Section 1.2 in the
main report). These are:

        Socio-economic survey – household surveys with enumerators skilled in social research
         can only really ask questions of householders. Although enumerators were trained to
         observe and identify different characteristics of sanitation facilities, they cannot always
         make accurate technical inspections of the infrastructure, which would require a different
         skillset. Therefore, it is necessary to take the household’s responses at face value (e.g.
         about the destination of their blackwater).

        Sampling method – sample surveys are designed to estimate indicators for a broader
         population. Therefore, they cannot produce detailed data for specific neighbourhoods
         without dramatically increasing the sample size and appropriate stratification. The sample
         size for this study is relatively small compared to what would be necessary for an impact
         evaluation, for example. In a similar vein, transect walks aimed to build up a broad picture
         rather than specific maps or explanations for individual neighbourhoods. Finally, the study
         only focuses on non-sewered residential areas and households of Santa Cruz, excluding
         sewered residential areas, and all public establishments and institutions.
