I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in Comoros perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues Facing Comoros
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Comoros
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information

II. Methodology
From January to March 2016, 160 stakeholders of the WBG in Comoros were invited to provide
their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion survey.
Participants were drawn from the Office of the President/Prime Minister; office of a minister;
office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments/implementation agencies; Project
Management Units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of WBG projects; consultants/
contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs; island governments; bilateral/
multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/
private banks; NGOs/community based organizations; the media; independent government
institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; youth groups; academia/research institutes/think
tanks; the judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 134 stakeholders participated in
the survey (84% response rate).
Some respondents received and returned the questionnaires via post, courier, or email; others
completed the questionnaire with the presence of a representative of the independent fielding
agency. Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Comoros; their overall attitudes
toward the WBG; the WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and
activities; working with the WBG; the WBG’s future role in Comoros; and the WBG’s
communication and information sharing.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey (COS) must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.
The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY’13 (response rate is 84%, N=126). Data were weighted to reach the same
stakeholder composition in two years, which allows for year comparisons. Stakeholder groups
which were not present in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents
who belonged to the “other” stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, mean
ratings, percentages of respondents, and the total number of respondents in both years are
slightly different from those of the original data reported in the FY’13 COS report and the non-
weighted data presented in appendices A, B, C, D, and F. For the weighted stakeholder
breakdown and year comparison results, please refer to Appendix E (page 99).

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
      For further analyses, the small number of respondents from the office of a minister were
       combined with respondents from the Office of the President/Prime Minister; respondents
       from the financial sector/private banks were combined with those from private sector
       organizations; respondents from NGOs/community based organizations and trade unions
       were combined in the “CSO” category; and the few respondents from independent
       government institutions and the judiciary branch were included in the “Other” category.
       There were no respondents from private foundations, youth groups, and faith-based
       groups.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
       Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s Country Survey and the FY’13 Country
        Survey had statistically similar levels of familiarity with the WBG (weighted mean in
        FY’16 = 5.2; weighted mean in FY’13 = 5.4)1.
       Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
        with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Comoros, and significantly,
        moderately correlated with the extent to which the WBG plays a relevant role in
        development in Comoros, and the extent to which the WBG contributes to the country’s
        development results.

IV. General Issues Facing Comoros
Headed in the Right Direction2
          Year comparison: This year’s respondents were significantly less likely to believe that
           Comoros is headed in the right direction compared to respondents in the FY’13 Country
           Survey.
          Stakeholder groups: In this year’s Country Survey, majorities of respondents from the
           Office of the President/Prime Minister/Minister and employees of ministries/ministerial
           departments/implementation agencies indicated that Comoros is headed in the right
           direction, whereas respondents from bilateral/multilateral agencies were least positive
           about the prospect of Comoros.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Comoros, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty four specific areas
of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Comoros. The areas
       determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at disaster management;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at agricultural development;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at environmental sustainability;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at energy/electricity; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at equality of opportunity.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Comoros, suggesting that ratings of
       effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The area determined to be key driver from these
       analyses was:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at crime and violence.

Appendix E: Responses to Selected Questions by Year19
All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means of the FY 2016 data and the total number of respondents
indicated will be slightly different from the aggregated responses in Appendix A. Similarly, responses from FY 2013
respondents and the total number of respondents indicated may differ from those reported in the FY 2013 COS report.

FY 2013 Number of comparable respondents = 123  FY 2016 Number of comparable respondents = 132

By weighting, the FY 2013 and FY 2016 samples have the same stakeholder composition and thus are comparable. The
weighted percentage of a stakeholder group is determined by the extent to which the World Bank Group interacts with them
in the country and the percentage this group usually makes up in the past aggregated annual global data. The weighted
stakeholder breakdown is presented below:

   Investment Project Financing: Investment loans, credits and grants provide financing for a wide range of activities aimed
at creating the physical and social infrastructure necessary to reduce poverty and create sustainable development.
Development Policy Financing (DPF) provides rapidly-disbursing financing to help a borrower address actual or anticipated
development financing requirements of domestic or external origins. DPF aims to help the borrower achieve sustainable
poverty reduction through a program of policy and institutional actions, for example, strengthening public financial
management, improving the investment climate, addressing bottlenecks to improve service delivery, and diversifying the
economy. Trust funds (TFs) administered by IBRD and IDA complement the WBG’s operations. They allow scaling up of
activities, notably in fragile and crisis-affected situations; enable the Bank to provide assistance when its own ability to lend
is limited; provide immediate assistance in response to natural disasters and other emergencies; and pilot innovations that
are later mainstreamed into the Bank’s operations.
