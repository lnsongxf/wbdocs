THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: DB2014 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2014 that capture the effects of such
factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practic e or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

       The seller requests and obtains the land registry excerpt from a
       competent court land registry office as the proof of ownership and to
       check the property against encumbrances. In practice, the excerpt must
       be obtained by the seller before starting the transaction formally. This
       information need to be obtained in hard copy and be sealed to have
       legal validity. The seller may hire a lawyer to perform this task. The           1 day

       The Court Tax is BAM 10 . Typically, an extract for a property with no

      Notarization of sale-purchase agreement

      "The law on Notary of the Federal Republic of Bosnia & Herzegovina that
      passed in 2002 and became applicable in May 2007 prescribes notaries
      as the competent authority in the process of transferring a real estate or
      acquiring the ownership rights over the same or other real rights.
      According to the law, the purchase agreement of the real estate must be
      prepared as a notary deed. The cost of the procedure of notarization of
      the sale-purchase agreement depends on the value of the real estate at
      the time of purchase. Parties provide the notary with the land registry
      excerpt (obtained in Procedure 1) and well as with a court excerpt
      (obtained in Procedure 2). The presence of both parties is necessary at
      the notary's office or verification of the signatures should be based on a
      special power of notary. The notary needs to be provided with the
      following documents:
      (1) The land registry excerpt as well as the copy of the cadastre plan
      proving the ownership over the property;
      (2) The extract from the company’s court registry certifying the person is
      authorized to act on behalf on the company and to sign the purchase
      agreement;
      (3) The approval of the founder (i.e. the General Assembly or Supervisory
      Board if applicable) for selling the property in case that the value of the
3     property exceeds the amount of 1/3 of the company’s book value.                1 day        500 BAM

      New Tariff of Notary Fees and Compensations has been passed on July
      24, 2013 and published in Official Gazzete of FB&H No. 57/13 and the
      same in general decresed the notary fees and compensations. Thus, the
      notary fee depends on the value of the property and will be calculated as
      follows:

      For the property with value of:
      0,00 BAM to 5.000,00 BAM - the fee is 200,00 BAM
      5.001,00 BAM to 50.000,00 BAM - the fee is 270,00 BAM
      50.001,00 BAM to 100.000,00 BAM - fee is 350,00 BAM

      When the value of the subject of a legal transaction or other official
      action is over 100,000 BAM, notary is, besides the fee of 350,00 BAM,
      obliged to charge an additional fee of 50,00 BAM for every started
      100.000,00 BAM in the part in which the value of the official action
      exceeds 100.000,00 BAM, but in the amount not greater than 2.000,00
      BAM.
