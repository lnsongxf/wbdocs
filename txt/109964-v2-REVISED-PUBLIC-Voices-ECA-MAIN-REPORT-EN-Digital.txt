The Middle Class
and Economic Mobility




People were frightened after the Soviet Union collapsed. There were no jobs.
How could we live? And, now, people are obtaining land and taking a risk.
They’re starting farms. They’re building houses. They’re striving for a better
future. They’re educating their children.

                                              —Man in rural area, Kazakhstan

Certain people come into a better financial situation almost by night, while
some people do not have money even for the basic needs. Those are social
differences that did not exist in the previous years. The middle class existed.
Now you either have nothing or you have too much.

T
        he recent performance of Europe and Central Asia in
        growth, poverty reduction and shared prosperity has
        varied widely within and across countries. Using new
        qualitative data from nine countries in the region, this
chapter explores whether and how people experienced chang-
es in well-being, the factors that have supported or hindered
economic mobility, and the ways in which these diverge among
men and women. The findings suggest that access to good jobs
and the ability to withstand shocks are critical to improving liv-
ing standards, climbing the Ladder of Life and joining the middle
class. However, welfare improvements are often out of reach, as
informal institutions and social norms that exclude many medi-
ate access to these opportunities.

Jobs: The Weak Link between
Growth and Shared Prosperity


We have many people who have finished secondary school, but there are no
  new jobs, and the government does not help you find a new or better job.

                                            —Woman, rural FYR Macedonia

         obs are the weakest link between growth and shared
         prosperity in Europe and Central Asia. Only one adult in
         two works, and, if they do work, many are involved in
         low-productivity activities, often in the informal sector.
Job prospects are particularly dismal among women with less
than secondary educational attainment, youth, and older work-
ers. They are at risk of being left behind. Other people feel it, too.
While they may want formal jobs in the public sector that provide
security and a regular paycheck, they are met with a different real-
ity when they look for work.

Conversations with residents in communities across the region
have shed light on the economic and social barriers to produc-
tive employment, especially barriers related to aspirations, so-
cial norms, and connections on which quantitative evidence is
lacking. Because many of these barriers are perceived to be be-
yond the control of the individual, they can be particularly dis-
couraging and often lead to hopelessness.

This chapter discusses these barriers to productive work, their ef-
fect on various groups, and how countries can strengthen the role
of jobs in promoting shared prosperity by devising instruments to
reduce or overcome such barriers. The conclusion is clear: there
is a need to expand the jobs policy toolkit to consistently address
the critical “non-traditional” barriers to employment.

Jobs and Shared Prosperity:
Youth’s Perspectives



The education we receive and the skills we learn are poor relative to what is
required to meet the responsibilities of the available jobs.

W           hat about the next generation? Young men and wom-
            en in Europe and Central Asia have higher expecta-
            tions about their job prospects compared to the older
generation. It is also striking that youth still look for jobs, mostly
in the public sector, resembling traditional jobs in pre-transition
times. However, they face a number of challenges in finding em-
ployment or setting up a business. Young women and men face
hurdles that are either unique or more marked among youth than
among adults, including lack of experience, lack of access to in-
formation on labor market prospects, lack of effective networks,
and lack of access to productive inputs such as land and credit.
A notable barrier among young women is the lack of affordable,
trustworthy childcare facilities, besides social norms and tradi-
tions that prevent women from searching for and finding employ-
ment. Young people in the region think that the greater availability
of jobs, more training, better information about vacancies, access
to loans and day-care services, and family support would improve
their chances to overcome these barriers.

annex i: regional Methodology


This report is based on data gathered using the qualitative methodology devel-
oped by a multi-sectoral World Bank team (Patti Petesch, Giorgia Demarchi, María
E. Dávalos and Indhira Santos). The same methodology and instruments were used
for fieldwork in nine ECA countries (Bosnia and Herzegovina, FYR Macedonia, Geor-
gia, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Kyrgyz Republic, Serbia, Tajikistan and Turkey). The data
collection took place between April and September 2013, and was conducted by
local research teams.68

Purposive sampling was used to select 4 to 6 communities in each of the nine coun-
tries, to provide a diverse range of experiences on the study topics. The community
was taken as the unit of analysis, and was conceived as a relatively well-defined
neighborhood or village where people generally know each other. Researchers
ensured a balance between rural and urban areas, between better-off and worse-
off communities, and –where relevant- between different ethnic groups. Better-off
communities were conceived as having a large share of formal sector workers or
entrepreneurs, and they were in many cases middle-class neighborhoods. In con-
trast, worse-off communities were thought of as inhabited mostly by informal sector
workers, relying on lower-productivity economic activities.

A total of 43 communities were sampled.

The data collection tools in all countries featured a mix of instruments (see table
below). The tools comprised a community questionnaire, two focus group discus-
sions with adults (one with people who work, and one with people who are out of
work), life story interviews, key informant interviews (one with an employer and one

with employment agency staff), and in seven countries focus group discussions with
youth (in a total of 34 communities). The focus group discussions were conducted
with men and women separately. This provided a fundamental gender lens, which
complemented the views on gender-specific issues investigated through direct
questions on such topic. Field coordinators were also instructed to select respon-
dents with a variety of demographic and employment profiles, to ensure further di-
versity in labor markets and mobility experiences.

The detailed methodology guide contained precise questions and instructions for
local field coordinators, facilitators and note-takers. It included a mix of closed-end-
ed and open-ended questions, and relied on the use of visuals and other such tools.
An example of this is the Ladder of Life activity, conducted within focus group discus-
sions with working men and women, to explore levels of well-being and mobility at
the community level.

The exercise entitled the Ladder of Life was used to explore mobility trends and fac-
tors, as well as their gender dimensions. The activity was only conducted in focus
groups discussions with employed adults. Focus group members began to build
their ladder by detailing in their own words the characteristics of the “best off” and
“worst off” households residing in their community. The traits of each were then
noted by the focus group facilitator on a flip chart with just the top (for the best
off) and bottom (worst off) steps of a ladder depicted. Focus group members then
moved on to outline the characteristics of households on a step added just above
the bottom step (or step one). Next, they described any additional steps needed to
capture the different levels of well-being that they perceived to be present in their
community. Most ladders featured between three and six steps, representing differ-
ent levels of well-being perceived to exist in their society. The descriptions included
types of assets, jobs, education levels, as well as personality and attitude traits that
are common at the different levels. After identifying the community poverty line and
the steps seen to belong in the middle class, focus groups were asked to distribute
100 households in their community across the steps, representing first the current
situation and then the distribution ten years ago. Focus groups then move on to
discussing trends in inequality and reasons for mobility up and down.
