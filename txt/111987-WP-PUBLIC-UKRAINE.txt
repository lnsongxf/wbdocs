The Project Development Objective is to improve the quality of water and wastewater services and increase
the energy efficiency of select water and sanitation utilities.
The Project addresses (i) institutional strengthening for utilities toward improved operational efficiency; (ii)
rehabilitation investment needs in water and wastewater in Odessa, Ivano-Frankivsk, and Chernihiv; and (iii) the
need to finance urgent energy-efficiency investments in 14 water and sanitation utilities.
Results achieved:
The project started implementation slowly, due to the low readiness of investment projects for financing, a
reflection of the low capacity in many municipalities and utilities. However, more recently, the project has made
steady implementation progress, meeting the expected objectives.
      Energy-efficiency investment subprojects were completed in 12 participating cities—Kolomyia, Nova
         Kakhovka, Drogobych, Cherkasy, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Kamyanets-Podilskiy, Ivano-Frankivsk,
         Novograd-Volynskyi, Odessa, Kalush and Kremenchuk and in each city, the achieved results far
         exceeded the target of having at least 15 percent energy savings.
      Specifically, energy efficiency improved by 35 percent in Kolomyia, 30 percent in Cherkasy, 25 percent
         in Drogobych, 21 percent in Kamyanets-Podilskiy, and 20 percent in Nova Kakhovka.
      As an example, in Kolomyia, a new water pumping station was opened, resulting in fewer breakdowns
         in the water supply system. The water utility company, which is owned by the city council, estimates
         annual savings of about 1 million kilowatt hours of electricity.
      Business plans have been developed by three participating utilities to improve their strategic planning
         and enhance their decision-making practices, and ultimately they are expected to have a positive impact
         on the utilities’ financial situation.
      In total, the project is expected to reach 4 million people, who will have better access to clean, safe, and
         reliable water.

Key Partners: (i) the Ministry for Regional Development, Construction, Housing and Communal Services is
responsible for the overall policy setting as well as for project implementation; (ii) the municipal authorities of
Odessa, Ivano-Frankivsk, and Chernihiv, which have regional Project Management Units; and (iii) 11 other
municipal utilities in participating cities.
Key Development Partner is the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), which has
provided SKr 35,844,217 (an equivalent of about US$5.5 million) in support of institutional strengthening and
energy efficiency under the Urban Infrastructure Project.

The Project Development Objective is to improve the quality and efficiency of water, wastewater, and solid
waste services in selected cities in Ukraine.
The Project addresses some of the challenges the water and sanitation sector face through: (i) advancing
institutional reform; (ii) supporting sustainable improvements in service; and (iii) promoting recycling, reducing
solid waste, and supporting reduction of environmental hazards in 10 participating water and sanitation utilities.

Results expected:
The new Urban Infrastructure Project-2 was approved to continue providing investment financing to the sector
as well as technical assistance for building the capacity of water institutions. This will be achieved through three
components:

       Component 1, urban infrastructure investments (US$ 335 million), will support the rehabilitation and
        reconstruction of water supply, sanitation, and solid waste infrastructure in 10 cities (Kyiv, Kharkiv,
        Donetsk, Zhytomyr, Kirovohrad, Ternopil, Kolomyia, Ivano-Frankivsk, Cherkasy, and Kramatorsk);
       Component 2 (US$10 million) will support improvements in sustainable service delivery through
        institutional strengthening and capacity building; and
       Component 3 (US$5 million), will support project management and implementation. The project will also
        support the transition toward more efficient and financially sustainable utilities.
       In total, the project is expected to result in better access to water, wastewater, and solid waste services to
        over 6 million citizens across Ukraine.

Key Partners: (i) the Ministry for Regional Development, Construction, Housing and Communal Services is
responsible for the overall policy setting as well as for project implementation; (ii) the water utility companies, or
vodokanals, in Kyiv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kharkiv, Kolomyia, Donetsk, Kramatorsk, Kirovohrad, Zhytomyr,
Cherkasy, and Ternopil have regional Project Management Units; and (iii) Kharkiv Municipal company for Waste
Management.
Key Development Partners: the Clean Technology Fund (CTF), which has provided US$50 million in support
of institutional strengthening and energy efficiency under the project. An additional US$7 million grant from
SIDA, will cofinance institutional strengthening and capacity-building activities.

The Project Development Objective is to improve the energy efficiency and quality of service of selected
Ukrainian district heating companies, improve their financial viability, and decrease their CO2 emissions.
The Project addresses some of the challenges in one of the most energy-intensive economies in the world through
(i) improving the efficiency of 10 participating district heating companies; (ii) introducing individual heat
substations on a large scale, which is expected to have a transformational impact on the country’s district heating
sector; and (ii) providing capacity building.

Results expected:
This new project focuses on improving the quality of services and the efficiency of 10 Ukrainian district heating
utilities that cover about 30 percent of the Ukrainian heat market. The overall aim of the project is to improve the
quality and reliability of services of participating utilities, increase their efficiency, decrease the costs of their
services in the medium term and improve their environmental footprint. This will be achieved through:

       Energy-efficiency investments that will include the rehabilitation of boiler houses, the replacement of
        network pipes, and the installation of mini-combined heat and power stations (CHPs), individual heat
        substations, and building-level heat meters;
       Technical assistance and capacity building for participating district heating utilities and for the Ministry
        for Regional Development, Construction, Housing and Communal Services, which oversees project
        implementation. This will involve guidance and training in project implementation; capacity building and
        knowledge-sharing workshops for the participating companies; and sector-wide knowledge sharing and
        project results dissemination workshops as well as surveys among the participating companies’ customers.
       The expected outcomes from the activities are projected lifetime fuel savings of 560 gigawatt hours (GWh)
        per year in 10 municipalities in Ukraine and an annual reduction in CO2 emissions of 330,000 metric tons.
       In total, the project is expected to help in reducing costs, enhancing reliability of service, and improving
        the overall quality of the heat supplied to over 3 million Ukrainians.

Key Partners: (i) the Ministry for Regional Development, Construction, Housing and Communal Services is

The Project Development Objective is to improve the security, reliability, efficiency, and quality of the power
supply through the rehabilitation of transmission substations and the strengthening of the power transmission
network. The project targets improved services to consumers through a reduction in transmission losses and
improved voltage quality in transmission substations. The project also aims to improve the institutional capacity
and technical capabilities of the transmission system operator, UkrEnergo (UE), so that it can ensure the secure
and reliable operation of the high-voltage power grid and therefore provide an improved quality of services to
consumers.
The Project addresses a range of interconnected sector issues by (i) the rehabilitation of transmission
substations, which includes the replacement of outdated high-voltage equipment and the installation of modern
protective relaying and substation automation systems; (ii) the strengthening of the transmission network, which
includes expansion of the existing 330-kilovolt Bar substation and construction of the 72.9 km-long, 330-kilovolt
transmission line; (iii) the stabilization of the Crimea Electric Power Grid; (iv) institutional development for UE,
which includes the establishment of a corporate-wide management information system (MIS) in UE; and (v) the
implementation of the Grid Code.
Results achieved:
     The project had a slow start, but by mid-2012 all tender packages were finalized and contracts signed.
        Two major contracts for the reconstruction of Bar substation and construction of the 72.9 km-long
        Dniester-Bar transmission line have been completed.
     These completed upgrades will make the Ukrainian power grid more reliable and efficient, as they will
        help improve the company’s services and significantly reduce power losses and outages in the
        transmission network.
     Moreover, the improvements at the Bar Substation will ensure more stable voltage in the grid through
        continuous power transmission, using the resources of the Dniester Hydropower Plant to full capacity,
        which will generate savings of about UAH 250 million (US$31.2 million) a year.
Key Partners: The Bank team worked closely with (a) the Ministry of Energy and Coal Industry, which was
responsible for overall policy setting; (b) UkrEnergo (UE), the ultimate beneficiary of the loan and implementing
agency of the project in the rehabilitation of the transmission system; (c) the National Energy Regulatory
Commission (NERC), the independent power sector regulator charged with implementation of the new
Wholesale Electricity Market Model; and (d) the Energy Program Coordination Unit (EPCU), responsible for

From 2007 to 2013, Ukraine increased hydropower production from 5.2 to 7.1 percent in the total energy mix,
producing 13.7 terawatt hours (out of 193.5 terawatt hours of total power produced), and in the first six months
of 2014, production reached 5.5 terawatt hours, or 6.1 percent of the total energy mix. These investments
enabled the power system to keep its supply costs low, as the rehabilitation of hydropower assets was a low-cost
supply option.
The Project Development Objective is to improve the operational stability and reliability of the power supply
by increasing the regulating capacity, efficiency, and safety of hydroelectric plants, and therefore, facilitate the
unimpeded operation and opening up of the electricity market in Ukraine.
The Project addresses a range of interconnected sector issues by the (1) rehabilitation of hydroelectric plants
through the refurbishment of 73 hydroelectric units and associated plant equipment at nine hydroelectric plants;
(2) rehabilitation and upgrading of the existing dam safety monitoring systems, as well as the installation of new
dam safety monitoring systems and the rehabilitation of drainage facilities and spillway gates on six dams on the
Dnipro River and one dam on the Dniester River; (3) institutional development of UkrHydroEnergo (UHE)
through the establishment of a corporate-wide management information system (MIS); (4) implementation of
the Energy Sector Reform and Development Program; and (5) implementation of the new Wholesale Electricity
Market (WEM) concept.
Results achieved:
      The up-to-date rehabilitation of 59 hydropower units in four hydroelectric plants has been completed
         under the project, and the installed capacity of the rehabilitated hydroelectric plants was increased by
         about 156.3 megawatts by August 2014.
      The energy generated by Ukraine’s hydropower stations is the cheapest source of electricity (24.94
         kopiykas per kilowatt hour compared with more than 126 kopiykas per kilowatt hour generated by wind
         power). The project also pioneered the concept of carbon financing in Ukraine, as it was the first Joint
         Implementation Project under the Kyoto Protocol in the country.
      Bank studies are also contributing to improving the legal framework of the energy sector. The National
         Energy Regulatory Commission has successfully completed work on the new WEM model and has
         started to gradually implement it, which will bring many benefits, such as: new investments and security
         of supply, real competition, the possibility for demand-side participation, investments in own
         generation, and better utilization of generation and transmission capacities. A new WEM law was
         ratified by the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine’s Parliament) in October 2013 and became effective on January
         1, 2014, after it was signed by the president.
Key Partners: The Bank team worked closely with (a) the Ministry of Energy and Coal, which was responsible
for the overall policy setting; (b) UkrHydroEnergo, the ultimate beneficiary of the loan and implementing agency
of the project; (c) the National Energy Regulatory Commission, charged with implementation of the new WEM
model; and (d) the Energy Program Coordination Unit, responsible for implementation of the Energy Sector
Reform and Development Program at the Ministry of Energy and Coal Industry.
Key Development Partners include the EBRD and the EIB, which are also working with UHE on the
rehabilitation of hydropower stations, and the EC, with which the Bank team has coordinated closely on policy
issues.

As Ukraine moves to gain market share in Europe and other developed markets, especially for high value added
products, some transport will inevitably shift from rail to road. At present, the modal split of freight transport
remains typical of a Soviet era economy: road transport contributes relatively little. Official statistics show that less
than 10 percent of freight traffic (in ton-kilometers) is by road, but this is changing quickly, leading to capacity
constraints on parts of the road network. According to 2005 data, about 13 percent of the state network was in
poor or very poor condition and required urgent investments, and about 26 percent of the state network was in
fair condition, still needing to be upgraded to European technical and safety standards. Road safety is a serious
issue in Ukraine, which has one of the worst records in the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region in terms of
road accidents and fatalities.
The Project Development Objective was to improve the condition and quality of sections between Boryspil
and Lubny of the M-03 road and increase traffic safety on the roads.
The Project addresses the development objective mostly through (i) the upgrade of 150 kilometers of the Kyiv-
Kharkiv road between Boryspil and Poltava, and (ii) the elimination of about 40 “accident black spots” through a
variety of measures.
Results achieved:
Three of six large road rehabilitation contracts totaling roughly US$170 million (prior to the application of price
adjustments) and 157 kilometers (km) are completed.

The road upgrading works funded from the World Bank loan on the M-03 road between Boryspil and Lubny
improved the International Roughness Index up to 1.4. The elimination of black spots contributes to the
improvement of road safety toward European Union (EU) levels on the M-18 road on the section between
Simferopol and Alushta and will decrease fatalities in road accidents from eight to four victims per 10,000 vehicles
by the end of the project.

The technical assistance to the state road agency UKRAVTODOR focused on the introduction of performance-
based road maintenance contracts in Ukraine. Such contracts should help UKRAVTODOR to modernize the
management and maintenance of the road network under its responsibility. It is expected that such contracts will
lead to establishing a more efficient management of roads in Ukraine. In 2014, UKRAVTODOR signed a contract
for performance-based road maintenance.

Key Partners: The World Bank team is working closely with UKRAVTODOR, the Government’s road agency
in charge of managing and maintaining the main road network.
Key Development Partners include EBRD, which is planning to fund the performance-based road contracts
that are being prepared with funding from the World Bank loan for this project.

Ukraine is among the most energy-intensive economies in the world. For example, energy consumption to heat
buildings is estimated to be roughly 3–5 times that of Western Europe, and the energy consumption of Ukrainian
buildings is estimated to be about 2–2.5 times worse than in Western Europe. Low energy prices encourage high
energy consumption and create unsustainable fiscal subsidies. For example, gas prices for district heating
companies and households remain artificially low, creating a significant deficit for the integrated oil and gas
company and sizable fiscal subsidies. In addition, limited metering and the absence of consumption-based billing
in the heating sector further encourage energy waste.
The Government of Ukraine has made it a strategic priority to reduce Ukraine’s energy intensity. The industrial
sector, particularly heavy industry, is expected to be the primary source of energy savings if the country’s
production technologies could be updated. In the steel sector, for example, this could reduce energy
consumption per unit of output more than fourfold. Other sectors, such as chemical, agricultural, and food
production, are estimated to potentially benefit from equally significant energy savings, as are municipalities.
Energy savings at the municipal level can be realized in public buildings and municipal services (district heating,
water, waste management). Financing for these types of industrial and municipal energy-efficiency projects has
been constrained by the financial crisis, which brought lending to a virtual standstill.

The Project Development Objective is to contribute to improved energy efficiency by industrial and
commercial companies, municipalities, municipally owned enterprises, and energy service companies by
facilitating sustainable financial intermediation for the financing of energy-efficiency investments. The project
is a Financial Intermediary Loan to UkrEximBank, which has a successful track record in lending to industrial
companies for energy-efficiency projects. In addition, UkrEximBank will on-lend the funds to participating
banks to create a financial market for energy-efficiency projects. The project will also help develop energy
efficiency projects in the municipal sector by identifying and financing bankable pilot projects.
The project has one component: financing energy-efficiency investments in the industrial and municipal sector.
The Ministry of Regional Development and Housing will benefit from capacity-building measures to prepare
municipal energy-efficiency projects under a Clean Technology Fund grant.
Expected Results: The project is expected to reduce energy consumption by industrial end users and
municipalities as well as increase lending for energy-efficiency projects. Sixteen subprojects in the industrial
sector have been approved with a record financing of US$110 million, helping to change the production
technology of a cement factory to a more energy-efficient dry production method. Two participating banks are
financing energy efficiency in the industrial and municipal sectors.
Key Partners: (i) UkrEximBank, the executing agency for the credit line as a financial intermediary and
implementer of the proposed project; (ii) State Agency of Ukraine for Efficient Use of Energy Resources
(SAER), which is responsible for developing energy-efficiency policies in Ukraine and overseeing their
implementation; and (iii) commercial banks, which could become participating banks under the project.
Key Development Partners: The World Bank team has been closely coordinating with IFC, EBRD, the U.S.
Agency for International Development (USAID), EIB, EC, and private sector representatives on policy issues
and ongoing technical assistance activities related to energy efficiency, particularly at the municipal level.

The Second Road and Safety Improvement Project is aimed at improving the transport and operational status of
the international highway M-03 Kyiv-Kharkiv-Dovzhansky in the section Lubny-Poltava. It is a logical
continuation of the first Roads and Safety Improvement Project, and it is also expected to improve the
transportation operational status of this road in the Boryspil-Lubny section.
The need for the urgent repair and rehabilitation of highway M-03 Kyiv-Kharkiv-Dovzhansky in the section
Lubny-Poltava is due to the critical condition of the road surface: about 64 percent does not meet the strength
requirements and needs increased solidity, and 23 percent does not meet the requirements for evenness and
requires additional leveling layers and new asphalt pavement. That means that almost 70 percent of the road needs
an overhaul, and every year this number will rapidly increase. In addition, more than 36 percent of the surfaced
portion does not meet the requirements of traffic safety for the coefficient of adhesion.
In some sections potholes, cracks and rutting are responsible for slowing traffic down to 40 –50 kilometers per
hour (kmh) while the project provides for an estimated safe speed of 100–140 kmh, or the maximum speed
permitted by the traffic rules, 90–110 kmh.
Improving traffic conditions on this road is extremely important because it provides the maintenance and
development of the trade and economic, cultural, tourist, and other transport links of Ukraine with Russia, Belarus,
the European Union, and other European countries.
The project objective is to bring the transport and operating condition of road M-03 Kyiv-Kharkiv-Dovzhansky in
the section of Lubny to Poltava to the European level and improve the transport and operating condition of principal
roads by using the risk map and protocols of assessment of the International Road Assessment Program (iRAP).
The project performs the tasks of (1) bringing the design, technical, and geometrical parameters of the road M-03
Kyiv-Kharkiv-Dovzhansky in the section of Lubny to Poltava, as well as the bridges, overpasses, and other structures
on it, in line with the requirements of applicable regulations, and (2) improving road safety in sections of the principal
roads in Ukraine.
Results achieved:
      Contracts amounting to US$230.7 million have been awarded. A contract for black spots elimination,
           identified under the iRAP, is planned.
      After upgrading the M-03 road, traffic will improve in the section between Lubny and Poltava. Black
           spots elimination will improve road safety on the principal roads of Ukraine.
      The technical assistance provided to UKRAVTODOR (the State Agency of Highways of Ukraine) is
           focused on the modernization of management and maintenance of the road networks for which
           UKRAVTODOR is responsible. It is expected that this will lead to improving the management of roads
           in Ukraine.
Key Partners: UKRAVTODOR is responsible for the management and maintenance of the main road network.
Key Development Partners include EBRD, EIB, and EU, which are actively involved in addressing the problems
of the road sector. Industry experts from the World Bank, EBRD, and EIB make joint visits to Ukraine every six
months on a regular basis to discuss the problems of the road transport sector with the Government.

The first phase of the ENPI East Countries FLEG Program (€6 million) closed on December 31, 2012 and successfully
met its objectives. The FLEG I final report was delivered to the donors in June 2013. The EC and the Bank signed an
Administration Agreement for the second phase (€9 million) in December 2012, to be implemented through 2016 in
the seven ENPI East countries (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, and Russia) and regionally,
in partnership with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
The program builds on and further develops initiatives and activities undertaken during implementation of the first
EU-funded FLEG Program (2008–12).
The Program Development Objective is to strengthen forest governance in the participating countries through
improving implementation of relevant international processes; enhancing their forest policy, legislation, and
institutional arrangements; and developing, testing, and evaluating sustainable forest management models at the local
level on a pilot basis for future replication.
The Ukraine FLEG Program team prepared a draft country work plan, which was agreed to by the National Program
Advisory Committee in June 2013 and formally approved by the Program Steering Committee in Minsk in October
2013. In the first year of activities implementation in Ukraine (which ended on June 30, 2014), the Ukraine FLEG
Program focused on four Ukraine-specific priority areas: i) supporting dialogue on forest policy issues; ii) assessing
and improving law enforcement and governance in the forest sector and thus improving forest legislation; iii)
developing and improving practical measures aimed at ensuring multi-purpose, sustainable, and intensive forest
management; and iv) increasing transparency in the forest sector through raising public awareness, disseminating
knowledge and education, monitoring the situation, and supporting management-related decisions.
Expected results:
• A time-bound roadmap for regional follow-up meeting(s) to ensure the implementation of the 2005 St. Petersburg
  FLEG Ministerial Declaration has been prepared and approved by the EC and the participating countries, and
  progress in implementation is regularly monitored.
• All participating countries have analyzed their forest policies and made decisions on reform processes, which are
  monitored and are being implemented on schedule.
• EU member states’ forest sector knowledge is made available to the participating countries. Knowledge exchange
  between the participating countries and EU member states is ongoing.
• Understanding and implementation of FLEG principles by forest practitioners and other stakeholders has
  improved as demonstrated in stakeholder surveys.
• Access to modern technology and information to improve forest law enforcement and forest governance has
  improved.
Key Partners: The Bank team works closely with forest, environmental/resource management, and law
enforcement agencies, businesses, academia, and the civil society groups of participating countries.
Key Development Partners are European Commission of the European Communities, the International Union for

The Project Development Objective is to improve the performance of Ukraine’s social assistance and social
services system for low-income families.
The Project would improve the performance of Ukraine’s social assistance and social services system for low-
income families.

This would be achieved by: (a) expanding the Guaranteed Minimum Income (GMI) program to increase the access
of the extreme poor to a last-resort poverty reduction program; (b) supporting measures for more efficient
administration of social benefits and services through: (i) strengthening performance management to be supported
by the national management information system (MIS); (ii) streamlining oversight and control procedures under a
central unit for social inspection, and (iii) integrating data on benefits and services into a single MIS for all local
offices under the Ministry of Social Policy’s (MoSP) subordination; and (c) designing and implementing a full range
of social welfare services aimed at vulnerable children in four selected oblasts, from prevention to quality of service
delivery and the de-institutionalization of children.

Results expected:
       Increased access of the extreme poor to the GMI program measured by (1) the share of individuals
        from the poorest decile receiving GMI, which will increase from 10 percent in 2012 (baseline) to 16
        percent in 2019; and (2) increases in the GMI budget (at least threefold in nominal terms);
       Improved administration of benefits and services measured by the creation of (3) an effective and
        efficient system to prevent, detect, deter, and monitor error, fraud, and corruption (EFC) in place; and (4)
        an MIS that collects social assistance and service programs’ information nationwide;
       Enhanced provision of family-based care to support families in need and vulnerable families
        measured by an increase of 40 percent in the number of children de-institutionalized and moved to
        alternative forms of care in three selected pilot regions (oblasts). The fourth pilot oblast will be addressing
        the de-institutionalization of disabled children specifically, and will not be accounted for in the project
        development impact?? (PDI), given the variation in strategies and placement.

The Project Development Objective is to improve the quality of health services in selected oblasts, with special
focus on the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and cancer and the
enhancement of the efficiency of the health care system.

The proposed project will have three components:
    Component 1: Improving service delivery at the local level. Under this component the project would
       provide financing to selected oblasts to carry out investment subprojects aimed at the prevention, early
       detection, and treatment of cardiovascular diseases and cancer and at increased efficiency in the health
       care delivery system.
    Component 2: Strengthening Ministry of Health (MoH) governance. All the activities in Component 2
       have been clustered around five thematic areas, with MoH as the implementing agency: Payment System
       Reform, e-Health/Information Systems Development, Public Health, Information and Communications,
       and Capacity Building.
    Component 3: Supporting project implementation and monitoring and evaluation. This component
       would support the Project Consultancy Support Unit (PCSU) at the national level, responsible for project
       implementation support and technical assistance to the oblasts. In addition, it would sponsor
       complementary data collection and analytical activities for monitoring results.

Expected results from this project are cancer (breast, cervical) detected at earlier stages, a larger share of patients
with high blood pressure under control, improved quality management (prevention, diagnosis, and treatment) of
CVDs, enhanced hospital efficiency, and a reduction in average in-patient length of stay.

Key Partners: (i) the Ministry of Health of Ukraine is responsible for the implementation of health sector reforms
and effective delivery of the project; and (ii) the Oblast State Administrations (OSAs) are responsible for the
implementation of Component 1.

Myronivsky Hliboprodukt (MHP), is one of the leading Ukrainian poultry producers. IFC first invested in MHP
back in 2003. Since then the company has grown into one of the largest poultry producers in Eastern Europe,
controlling about half of the chicken market in Ukraine, a country of over 40 million people. MHP sells about
40 percent of its products in Ukraine through a network of small and medium-sized businesses and franchises,
supporting economic activity across the country.

Project Development Objective
IFC’s latest financing will support MHP, which employs over 30,000 people, in its plans to expand and further
contribute to the development of Ukraine’s agribusiness sector, a key driver for the economy.




Key Expected Results:
It is expected that with the IFC financing the project will help to:
    Support food security: MHP’s overall volumes are expected to increase as a result of the project and
     contribute to improved food security in Ukraine and beyond by efficiently converting grain to meat
     through supporting a leading and efficient poultry producer;
    Provide a demonstration effect: by supporting MHP, a socially responsible and efficient producer with a
     solid track record, IFC’s investment, which includes a B Loan, will encourage foreign and local investors
     to invest in Ukraine’s economy in crisis times;
    Support job preservation and creation: MHP currently employs 30,000 staff, including 11,400 women.
     Direct employment is expected to increase.




Key Partners: MHP.

Galnaftogaz is a leading Ukrainian fuel retailer. With headquarters in Lviv, Galnaftogaz is a long-standing IFC
client, receiving advisory and investment services since 2003. Historically, its core market was the western part
of Ukraine, but it wanted to expand and become a nationwide network. It now has a significant presence in
central and southern Ukraine and aspires to further expand in the east, where there are fewer modern format
gas filling stations.

Project Development Objective. IFC is helping provide the joint venture with a long-term financing package
that is currently not possible to secure from commercial banks or capital markets locally, bolstering the
infrastructure for petrochemicals distribution and expanding access to high-quality fuel services across the
country. Through the project, IFC supports companies that continue to invest, expand, and create jobs despite
the challenging economic environment in the country. IFC’s mobilization efforts also help increase flows of
commercial financing into Ukraine and contribute to the country’s economic development. This is IFC’s fifth
engagement with Galnaftogaz, which owns and operates a network of 390 fueling stations and employs over
5,500 people. When IFC first engaged with Galnaftogaz, it employed 2,000 people.


Key Expected Results:
It is expected that with the new IFC financing, the project will help achieve:
       Support for the development of Ukraine’s infrastructure according to modern and safe standards and
        the introduction of higher service standards in the region through Galnaftogaz’ OKKO filling stations
        and convenience stores;
       Provision of reliably cleaner, high-quality fuels to Ukrainian automotive consumers;
       Employment generation/preservation: the investment is expected to create over 400 permanent jobs;
       Linkages to local suppliers: the stations’ convenience stores, automotive services, and fast food
        restaurants will provide opportunities for local suppliers who supply the goods sold.

Ukraine Crop Receipts Program
Project start: July 2013
Project closure: July 2016

Considering Ukraine’s export potential in agribusiness and its ability to play a global role in food security, IFC
is implementing several advisory programs in the sector aimed at (i) improving the business environment by
developing transparent and consistent regulations, improving access to finance for farmers by developing agri-
insurance, and building the capacity of local banks through an agri-finance program; and (ii) enhancing the
competitiveness of local producers.
Investment Climate for Agribusiness: improves the business environment in the agricultural sector by
developing transparent and consistent regulations. Ukraine Agri-Insurance Development Project: aims to
boost the use of agri-insurance as a risk-management tool fostering access to finance via the use of insured crops
as collateral. Agri-Finance Project: helps increase access to finance for Ukrainian farmers through financial
institutions. The Crop Receipts Program aims to support the introduction of crop receipts, a new financial
instrument for Ukraine that will make high-quality seeds and other inputs more affordable for small and
medium-scale farmers, helping boost agricultural productivity. Ukraine Resource Efficiency Program:
promotes better practices and increased investments in water, energy, and other resource-efficient projects in
agribusiness. Sustainable Development of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise (SME) Farmers:
promotes improved crop and horticultural farming methods to be implemented by medium and small-scale
farmers in Ukraine, helping maximize its farming potential and increase output, a key for global food security.
Agri-Standards Advisory: works with food producers across the supply chain to promote implementation of
internationally recognized food safety principles and enhance environmental and social standards
Programs Development Objective
IFC Advisory work for agribusiness aims at helping Ukraine maximize its potential in the sector. The key areas
of focus include:
      improving agricultural productivity by transferring technologies and practices and increasing economies
          of scale in farm production and processing;
      developing and adopting modern financial instruments for agriculture and for food retail; in particular,
          enactment of the law on agri-insurance and crop receipts was supported;
      linking farmers to markets;
      reducing risk and vulnerability and facilitating agricultural entry and exit;
      supporting legislation to cancel an obligatory requirement to register export contracts;
      enhancing environmental services and sustainability.
Key partners: The IFC advisory programs in Ukraine’s agribusiness sector are implemented in partnership with
the Governments of Austria, Canada, Finland, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.

Ukraine is among the most energy-intensive economies in the world. The Ukrainian Government has made it a
strategic priority to reduce Ukraine’s energy intensity. IFC is implementing advisory programs aimed at helping
the country improve energy efficiency in the residential and industrial sectors and support a better access to
finance for companies and owners of the multifamily buildings implementing energy-efficient improvements.

The Ukraine Residential Energy Efficiency Project is designed to create an effective legal and institutional
platform to support local Ukrainian homeowner associations in obtaining access to financing for energy-efficient
modernization projects in multifamily residential buildings. Through the project, IFC aims to facilitate
investment in energy efficiency in Ukraine’s residential sector.

The Ukraine Sustainable Energy Finance Project seeks to establish a sustainable market for sustainable
energy finance (SEF) products in Ukraine targeted at the industrial sector by supporting the development of
financially viable sustainable energy finance-lending products through local financial institutions; strengthening
the capacity and effectiveness of local technical experts; and building awareness and demand for sustainable
energy finance.

The Projects’ Development Objectives: The projects are building off of IFC’s experience implementing
similar energy-efficiency projects in the ECA region and will contribute to increasing investments in sustainable
energy, energy–efficiency, and climate change–related projects across the region. The work will help create a
platform to support local banks to develop and market energy-efficiency products to the industrial and
residential sectors and strengthen the capacity and effectiveness of local experts.

In close cooperation with government agencies, the Ukraine Residential Energy Efficiency Project
developed legislation to enable local homeowner association companies to access finance to improve energy
efficiency in residential buildings. The project has also worked with two pilot cities—Vinnitsa and Lviv—to
increase awareness about residential energy-efficiency improvements and plans to work with up to 10
municipalities across Ukraine by providing advice and consultants.

Key Partners: These programs are implemented in Ukraine in partnership with the Governments of Austria,
the Netherlands, and Switzerland
MULTILATERAL INVESTMENT GUARANTEE AGENCY PROJECTS IN UKRAINE




                                       Project name: Porsche Mobility

Fiscal year: 2014
Guarantee holder: Porsche Corporate Finance GmbH
Investor country: Austria
Project Board date: September 11, 2013
Gross exposure: US$23.9 million


On September 23, 2013, MIGA issued guarantees of US$23.9 million covering shareholder loans by Porsche
Corporate Finance GmbH of Austria to Porsche Mobility TOV (PM) in Ukraine. The coverage is for a period
of up to 15 years against the risks of transfer restriction, expropriation, and war and civil disturbance.

The project will refinance the subsidiary’s activities in financing Volkswagen and Audi vehicles and support
their growth in Ukraine in an environment of limited liquidity. PM will provide financial services (automotive
loans) mostly for micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) and individuals who might not qualify
for bank loans or would find them unaffordable.

The Eurozone crisis has had a severe impact on domestic banks in Ukraine and the sector is still facing
challenges. A high nonperforming loan (NPL) ratio makes access to new financing particularly onerous, as high
interest rate levels and collateral requirements make it difficult for MSMEs and individuals to qualify for fresh
credit lines. The project supports the development of the private sector in Ukraine by providing affordable
finance in the form of leasing and loans to businesses and individuals.

The project is consistent with the World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Strategy for Ukraine, which
emphasizes the need to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) to improve productivity and create new jobs in
the private sector. It also aims to contribute to the World Bank Group’s strategy of providing targeted financing
for MSMEs.
                                    Project name: Raiffeisen Bank AVAL

Fiscal year: 2013
Guarantee holder: Raiffeisen Bank International AG
Investor country: Austria
Project Board date: June 11, 2013
Gross exposure: US$142.5 million


On June 21, 2013, MIGA issued a guarantee of US$142.5 million covering a loan guarantee by Raiffeisen Bank
International AG (RBI) of Austria in support of funds raised by its Ukrainian subsidiary Raiffeisen Bank AVAL
(RBAV). The coverage is for a period of up to eight years against the risks of transfer restriction and
expropriation of funds.

The state of Ukraine’s economy continues to remain delicate in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis as a
result of spillover effects from its Eurozone neighbors.

The project will continue to bolster the capital base of a systemically important bank, strengthening the banking
sector in Ukraine in a difficult macroeconomic environment.

RBAV provides new credit to the economy—in particular to corporates, farms, and small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) that create jobs and foster economic activity and growth.

MIGA’s guarantee to the project is fully consistent with the World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Strategy
for Ukraine that calls for job creation and the attraction of FDI to improve productivity and international
competitiveness. It is also consistent with the goals of the Vienna 2 Initiative for the countries of Central,
Eastern, and South East Europe—through which MIGA seeks to support Western banks active in the region.
             Project name: ProCredit Group Central Bank Mandatory Reserves Coverage

Fiscal year: 2012
Guarantee holder: ProCredit Holding AG & Co. KGaA
Investor country: Germany
Project Board date: December 01, 2011
Gross exposure: US$4.0 million


On December 22, 2011, MIGA issued a guarantee of €3 million (about US$4.0 million equivalent) to cover an
investment by ProCredit Holding AG & Co. KGaA in its subsidiary in Ukraine. The coverage is for a period
of up to 10 years against the risk of expropriation of funds for mandatory reserves held by the subsidiary in the
central bank of its jurisdiction.

MIGA provided coverage of US$5.6 million under the project in FY11. This additional coverage brings MIGA’s
exposure under the project to US$9.6 million.

This project is part of a master contract that MIGA has issued. ProCredit Holding AG & Co. KGaA is
headquartered in Germany and is the parent company of 21 banks (ProCredit group). The ProCredit group is
a provider of finance to some 750,000 MSMEs in Latin America, Eastern and Central Europe, and Africa.
Throughout the world, banks are required to maintain mandatory reserves with the central banks of their
respective jurisdictions. Currently, the ProCredit group’s capital adequacy ratio (CAR) is calculated according
to Basel II, but in the future it will also be calculated according to the German Banking Act. Under this act, at
a consolidated level, reserves deposited at the various central banks can attract a risk weighting of 100 or even
150 percent, depending on the country. This risk weighting determines the amount of equity required to
maintain a specified CAR in accordance with the German Banking Act.

ProCredit Holding AG & Co. KGaA approached MIGA to obtain capital relief from the CAR requirements.
By obtaining MIGA’s insurance against the risk of expropriation of funds, the risk weighting for mandatory
reserves held at the central bank can be reduced. A lower risk weighting would allow ProCredit Holding AG &
Co. KGaA to free up equity currently tied up for CAR maintenance purposes, thereby allowing these funds to
be injected into its subsidiary banks. This in turn will allow ProCredit Holding AG & Co. KGaA’s emerging
market subsidiary banks across its network to increase their lending activities.

MIGA’s support will allow ProCredit Holding AG & Co. KGaA to direct equity to subsidiaries with the greatest
need. The additional services these banks offer are helping to stimulate growth, generate employment, and
reduce poverty.

MIGA’s support for this project is aligned with the World Bank Group’s microfinance strategy, which includes
improving the supply of microfinance in large but underserved markets; enhancing deposit capacity by assisting
microfinance institutions in savings mobilization; promoting capacity building; creating and shaping markets;
and fostering innovation.
                                   Project name: Whirlpool Ukraine LLC

Fiscal year: 2012
Guarantee holder: n.v. Whirlpool Europe Coordination Center s.a.
Investor country: Belgium
Project Board date: May 30, 2012
Gross exposure: US$6.6 million


On June 22, 2012, MIGA issued a guarantee of US$6.6 million to cover a non-shareholder loan from n.v.
Whirlpool Europe Coordination Center s.a. of Belgium to Whirlpool Ukraine LLC. The coverage is for a period
of up to three years against the risks of transfer restriction, expropriation, and war and civil disturbance.

Whirlpool Ukraine (WU) is the local sales office for Whirlpool Corporation, a global leader in the home
appliance industry. It sells air conditioners, washing machines, microwaves, dishwashers, built-in stoves, hoods,
and built-in ovens to distributors, wholesalers, and retailers in Ukraine. WU’s operations comprise a sales office
in downtown Kyiv and a warehouse in the outskirts of the city. WU buys its inventory from other Whirlpool
entities and from third-party vendors. The company receives the products fully assembled, stores them in its
warehouse until they are sold, and delivers them to its customers. WU plans to serve the Moldova, Georgia,
Uzbekistan, Armenia, and Azerbaijan markets in the future.

WU has been having a positive development impact in Kyiv since its conversion into a sales operation in 2011.
The operation has hired six additional employees for a total of 30 permanent positions and expects to open
new positions as the company grows and expands into new markets. WU also participates in knowledge transfer
by encouraging its employees to take courses at Whirlpool University, Whirlpool’s internal training program.
Courses are designed to help the company’s personnel develop leadership, operational, and cross-functional
competencies.

The project is aligned with the World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Strategy for Ukraine, which advocates
focusing on growth, competitiveness, and job creation, improvements in the business climate, and the
promotion of domestic investment and FDIs to achieve productivity improvements.

The project was underwritten through MIGA’s Small Investment Program.

Fiscal year: 2011
Guarantee holder: ProCredit Holding
Investor country: Germany
Project Board date: November 23, 2010
Gross exposure: US$5.6 million


On December 22, 2010, MIGA issued a guarantee of US$5.6 million to ProCredit Holding (PCH) covering its
investment in its subsidiary in Ukraine. The coverage is for a period of up to 10 years against the risk of
expropriation of funds for mandatory reserves held by the subsidiary in the central bank of its jurisdiction.

This project is part of a master contract that MIGA has issued. PCH is headquartered in Germany and is the
parent company of 21 banks (ProCredit group). The ProCredit group is a provider of finance to some 750,000
MSMEs in Latin America, Eastern and Central Europe, and Africa. Throughout the world, banks are required

The guarantee issued by MIGA will help PCH obtain capital relief from the CAR requirements. By obtaining
MIGA’s insurance against the risk of expropriation of funds, the risk weighting for mandatory reserves held at
the central bank can be reduced. A lower risk weighting will allow PCH to free up equity currently tied up for
CAR maintenance purposes, thereby allowing these funds to be injected into its subsidiary banks. This in turn
will allow PCH’s emerging market subsidiary banks across its network to increase their lending activities.

MIGA’s support will help PCH optimize its capital management across its 21 banks, allowing PCH to direct
equity to subsidiaries with the greatest need. These banks will be able to offer additional financial services to
MSMEs at a time of macroeconomic challenges. Supporting productive small businesses will help stimulate
growth, generate employment, and reduce poverty.

MIGA’s support for this project is aligned with the World Bank Group’s microfinance strategy, which includes

                                Project name: Raiffeisen Leasing Aval LLC

Fiscal year: 2009
Guarantee holder: Raiffeisen Zentralbank Österreich AG
Investor country: Austria
Project Board date: October 28, 2008
Gross exposure: US$142.5 million



MIGA has issued a guarantee of US$142.5 million covering Raiffeisen Zentralbank Österreich AG’s (RZB)
US$150 million shareholder loan to its leasing subsidiary in Ukraine, Raiffeisen Leasing Aval LLC (RLAV). The
coverage is for a period of up to seven years against the risks of transfer restriction and expropriation of funds.

RZB’s shareholder loan will enable RLAV to respond to rapidly growing demand for leasing products in
Ukraine. RLAV will use the proceeds of the shareholder loan to support its leasing portfolio of equipment and
machinery to Ukrainian enterprises across various sectors. A substantial part of this funding is expected to
benefit SMEs and support investments in agriculture. The SME sector is an underserved segment of the
Ukrainian market, as SMEs often do not qualify for bank financing and lack the capital to purchase fixed assets
to grow their businesses. RZB’s shareholder loan is also expected to help RLAV to support the share of long-
term leases in its portfolio. This is MIGA’s second guarantee in support of RLAV.

Ukraine is among the countries in the region hardest hit by the global economic crisis. Until September 2008,
it was one of Europe’s fastest-growing economies, with annual growth of more than 7 percent for eight years.
The crisis has dried up foreign loans, crippled banks with defaults, and triggered massive layoffs.

The World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Strategy for Ukraine emphasizes the need to support the
development of non-bank financial institutions, including leasing companies, to deepen the financial sector,
broaden the availability of financial instruments to Ukrainian enterprises, and support private investment. This
investment fits well with the Country Partnership Strategy. First, it promotes the involvement of strategic
foreign investors, such as RZB, which are playing an important role in the development of the leasing industry
in Ukraine in these difficult times. Second, this project is expected to support investments in the agribusiness
sector, an important area for job creation and the development of local industries.
          Project name: Joint Stock Commercial Bank for Social Development Ukrsotsbank

Fiscal year: 2009
Guarantee holder: UniCredit Bank Austria AG
Investor country: Austria
Project Board date: October 28, 2008
Gross exposure: US$247.0 million


MIGA has issued a guarantee of US$247 million covering a US$260 million shareholder loan from UniCredit
Bank Austria AG (UBA) to Joint Stock Commercial Bank for Social Development Ukrsotsbank (USB) of
Ukraine. The coverage is for a period of up to seven years against the risks of transfer restriction, expropriation,
and war and civil disturbance.

UBA is a subholding company of UniCredit Group of Italy. USB, Ukraine’s fourth-largest bank, was acquired
by UniCredit through UBA in January 2008. The long-term shareholder loan is expected to provide USB with
liquidity at a time of limited availability of long-term funding. This is expected to improve USB’s asset-liability
management.

Ukraine is among the East European countries hardest hit by the global financial turmoil. Economic growth
averaged above 7 percent in the country between 2000 and 2007, but the global downturn has seen investors
and lenders withdraw. The country’s stocks, banks, and currency have all suffered. MIGA’s support to the
country’s banking sector is part of the World Bank Group’s efforts to help crisis-hit countries cope with the
turmoil in the global financial markets.

Over the medium to long term, the World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Strategy for Ukraine places a
strong emphasis on improving the environment for private sector development and identifies building financial
institutions as a priority area. This project is consistent with the first pillar —sustaining growth and improving
competitiveness—of the World Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy for Ukraine.
                                 Project name: OJSC Raiffeisen Bank Aval

Fiscal year 2008
Guarantee holder: Raiffeisen Zentralbank Österreich AG
Investor country: Austria
Gross exposure: US$380.0 million


MIGA has issued a guarantee of US$380 million to Raiffeisen Zentralbank Österreich AG (RZB) of Austria
covering its shareholder loan of US$400 million to its subsidiary, OJSC Raiffeisen Bank Aval. MIGA’s
guarantee is for a period of up to six years and provides coverage against the risks of transfer restriction and
expropriation of funds.

RZB’s shareholder loan will provide funding to Raiffeisen Bank Aval to enable it to expand its portfolio and
improve the range and quality of its banking services. Proceeds of the loan are expected to be on-lent primarily
to individuals and SMEs, mostly for long-term assets such as residential and commercial mortgages.

The retail business potential of Ukrainian banks is currently limited by a shortage of long-term funding in the
local market. This loan from RZB is designed to provide Raiffeisen Bank Aval, the second-largest lender in the
country, with the long-term funding needed to increase its reach into underserved markets. In particular, the
project is expected to support the role of Raiffeisen Bank Aval as one of the market leaders in SME banking.
SME loans currently account for about 20 percent of the bank’s total portfolio, and in 2006, Raiffeisen Bank
Aval established a SME business unit.

The World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Strategy for Ukraine places a strong emphasis on improving the
environment for private sector development and identifies building financial institutions as a priority area. This
project will help Ukraine’s private sector gain access to banking and financial products to help the country
achieve sustainable growth.
                                  Project name Can-Pack (Ukraine) Ltd.

Fiscal year: 2008
Guarantee holder: Can-Pack S.A.
Investor country: Poland
Project Board date: June 17, 2008
Gross exposure: US$21.0 million


MIGA has issued guarantees totaling US$21.04 million to Can-Pack S.A of Poland covering its equity
investment, shareholder loan, and management contract with Can-Pack (Ukraine) Ltd. The coverage is against
the risks of transfer restriction, expropriation, and war and civil disturbance. The equity investment and
management contract will be covered for a period of up to 10 years. The duration of the coverage under the
shareholder loan will be four years.

The project involves the expansion of an existing aluminum beverage can production plant in Vyshgorod,
Ukraine for which MIGA is currently providing coverage. MIGA’s coverage is being modified to cover an
increase in the equity investment, a management contract with the project enterprise, and the issuance of a new
shareholder loan to the project.

The plant has been operating since 2003. The expansion of the production line will include the installation,
assembly, and operation of new equipment. The expansion will increase the plant’s production capacity from
the current 1,700 cans per minute to 2,400—an increase from 650 million to 950 million cans per year. To
accommodate the increase in finished products and materials, a new warehouse will be built on land adjacent
to the existing plant.

Can-Pack S.A.—through its subsidiary Can Pack Ukraine Ltd.—is the largest producer of beverage cans in
Ukraine and the fourth-largest beverage can producer in Europe. The increase in production capacity is
expected to help the project company meet the growing demand for canned beverages in Ukraine and maintain
its market share in the country, as well as in Kazakhstan, Georgia, Russia, and other Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) countries.

The project is expected to create local employment during the construction and design phases of the new
expansion, as well as for the operation of new equipment. The transfer of high-tech manufacturing equipment
from Poland is expected to yield positive developmental benefits in the form of training for local staff, for
which an annual budget of US$200,000 has been allocated. The expansion is also expected to generate tax
revenues of approximately US$7.5 million in present value terms over 11 years of operation.

Improving competitiveness and supporting the modernization of production is a priority area for World Bank
Group activities in Ukraine.

MIGA has issued a guarantee of US$142.5 million to Bank Austria, a member of UniCredit Group, covering
its shareholder loan to Joint Stock Commercial Bank Ukrsotsbank (USB) in Ukraine. The coverage is for a
period of up to 11 years against the risks of transfer restriction, expropriation, and war and civil disturbance.

The project involves a subordinated shareholder loan of US$150 million from Bank Austria to USB, Ukraine’s
fourth-largest bank. Bank Austria is responsible for UniCredit Group’s operations in Central and East Europe
and is USB’s direct parent company. The loan increased USB’s regulatory capital, aiming to strengthen the bank
and allow it to grow in a sustainable manner.

One of the two pillars of the World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Strategy for Ukraine is sustaining
growth and improving competitiveness. This encompasses the need to deepen the financial sector and to
improve its stability in order to facilitate business growth and spur private investment. Foreign participation in
Ukraine’s banking sector is also expected to lead to a rapid transfer of product and credit -risk management
expertise.
                           Project name: Raiffeisen Leasing Aval LLC (RLAV)

Fiscal year: 2008
Guarantee holder: Raiffeisen Zentralbank Österreich AG
Investor country: Austria
Gross exposure: US$47.5 million



MIGA has issued a guarantee of US$47.5 million to Raiffeisen Zentralbank Österreich AG (RZB) covering its
shareholder loan of US$50 million to its leasing subsidiary in Ukraine, Raiffeisen Leasing Aval LLP (RLAV).
The guarantee is covering the risks of transfer restriction and expropriation of funds for a period of up to six
years.

RZB’s shareholder loan is expected to enable RLAV to respond to the rapidly growing demand for leasing
products in Ukraine. RLAV will use the proceeds of the shareholder loan to extend long-term leases of
equipment, machinery, and vehicles to Ukrainian enterprises across various sectors. A substantial part of the
loan has benefited SMEs and supported investment in agriculture, both of which were underserved segments
of the leasing market identified by a survey conducted by IFC.

This is MIGA’s first guarantee in support of RZB’s leasing operations in Ukraine. By supporting a global
financial institution’s new leasing subsidiary, MIGA will also contribute to the development of the leasing sector
in Ukraine. MIGA is playing an important role in this transaction, as political risk mitigation is a key requirement
for the lender to proceed with this investment.

The World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Strategy for Ukraine places a strong emphasis on improving the
environment for private sector development and identifies building financial institutions as a priority area. The
project is expected to help Ukraine’s private sector gain greater access to financial products and help the country
achieve sustainable growth. It is, therefore, consistent with the World Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy for
Ukraine.

previous contract issued to Can-Pack S.A. in 2003, reflecting Can-Pack’s transfer of 47 percent control of Can-
Pack Ukraine to Pol-Am-Pack. The guarantees cover the investors’ equity investment in the project. The
coverage protects against the risks of expropriation, war and civil disturbance, and transfer restriction.

The project involves the operation of an aluminum beverage can production plant. MIGA is also providing
coverage for a shareholder loan and a management and technical assistance contract for the project under
guarantees issued in 2003.
