Introduction
Cloud computing is still a relatively new concept and one that is rapidly evolving to meet ever
changing technological demands and needs. This document provides a high level overview of
cloud computing as well a comparison of two large public cloud vendors.

Vendor selection can be one of the most challenging parts of migrating to the cloud. The
number of vendors and their various attributes can be overwhelming. In addition, vendors
frequently do not provide the same metrics and attributes making comparisons even more
challenging. The vendor comparison compares two of the largest public cloud vendors in terms
of size, global reach, and variety of offerings. This section is intended to provide a guideline for
vendor comparisons that governments may undertake.


What is Cloud Computing?
According to the National Institution of Standards and Technology, cloud computing is a model
for enabling ever present, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of
configurable computing resources (i.e., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services)
that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service
provider interaction (U.S. Department of Commerce, 2011). In other words, cloud computing
can also be referred to as on-demand computing. It is a way for users to get continual access to
shared computing resources, such as servers, storage, and sometimes services, as needed.

Essential Characteristics
There are five essential characteristics that define the cloud, as shown in the schematic below.

                                                                                                       Page 4 of 30

Resource Pooling
The cloud provider pools all computing resources to serve multiple customers (U.S. Department
of Commerce, 2011). These customers can be both external, in the case of a public cloud
provider, who might be serving multiple organizations, or internal, in the case of a private data
center which may be serving multiple departments. The pooled computing resources are
assigned as and when needed, but released and reassigned for other purposes when not being
used. Instead of the traditional approach of allocating a single server or amount of space to an
application, computing resources are dynamically allocated as needed. This optimization of the
infrastructure typically reduces overall infrastructure costs and limits risks such as server
failure.

However, the downside to resource pooling is that you have multiple users, groups, or
organizations using the same computing resources. This concurrent use of shared computing
resources by multiple users, also known as tenants, is referred to as multitenancy. As part of
multitenancy, applications still need to be isolated from each other so that problems in one
application do not affect others. In addition, access to one application does not mean access is
provided to other applications using the same computing resources.

On-Demand Self-Service
Cloud services are provided on request (U.S. Department of Commerce, 2011). Users can
request computing resources, such as server time and network storage, as needed,
automatically, without requiring human interaction with the service provider. This automation
is generally considered more efficient and less error-prone than traditional provisioning
processes where requests must be submitted and servers manually set up and configured. The
downside is that individuals may request resources whenever they need them, but may not
release them when they no longer need them. Automated tools can help with this as well.

Cloud Computing Overview

Rapid Elasticity
Computing resources can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically,
enabling applications to scale rapidly in line with demand. The computing resources available
for provisioning may be requested in any quantity at any time. This enables more effective
utilization of the available infrastructure (U.S. Department of Commerce, 2011). To better
understand this concept, it helps to understand what it means for an application to scale.

An application can scale either vertically or horizontally. Vertically means the existing
application instance is using more of a specific resource, horizontally means adding additional
instances of an application or nodes. An example of scaling horizontally would be going from
one web server to three and an example of scaling vertically would be going from 4 GB of
memory to 16GB.




Traditionally, computing resources have been allocated with additional contingency in case it is
needed. Elasticity refers to the ability for a platform to be dynamic and adaptable as opposed
to static. A cloud platform is elastic and can adapt to increasing and decreasing utilization by
rapidly expanding and shrinking computing capacity for a given application or application
service. In the diagram below the overall application infrastructure that is used is significantly
less in the elastic, cloud based approach.

                                          Elastic (Cloud) Approach




Broad Network Access
Computing resources are available over the network and accessed through standard devices
such as computers or mobile phones (U.S. Department of Commerce, 2011). It is important to
keep in mind how a cloud will be reached and what the network availability and bandwidth
capacity is before choosing a particular cloud solution.

Measured Service
Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by tracking usage at a level
appropriate to the type of service (i.e., storage, processing, network bandwidth, or active user
accounts) (U.S. Department of Commerce, 2011). Payment for these services are based on this
usage. This is also known as “pay per use”.

Service Models
There are three service models in cloud computing: (i) Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), (ii)
Platform as a Service (PaaS), and (iii) Software as a Service (SaaS).




Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
Infrastructure as a Service provides the capability to request (or provision) processing, storage,
network, and other fundamental computing resources; the requester is able to deploy and run
operating systems and applications (U.S. Department of Commerce, 2011). The requester does
not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating
systems, storage, and deployed applications; and limited or no control of the networking
components (i.e. host firewalls).




Platform as a Service (PaaS)
Platform as a Service provides the capability to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure, user-
created or owned applications created using programming languages, libraries, services, and
tools supported by the provider (U.S. Department of Commerce, 2011). The requester does
not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating
systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration

settings for the application-hosting environment. If an application currently resides on an
unsupported operating system i.e. UNIX, the application will need to be updated to run on a
supported operating system i.e. Linux or take advantage of an IaaS offering where any
operating system can be installed.




Software as a Service (SaaS)
Software as a Service provides the capability to use the provider’s applications running on a
cloud infrastructure (U.S. Department of Commerce, 2011). The applications are accessible
from various user devices through either an interface, such as a web browser (i.e., web-based
email), or a program interface (i.e. Office 365). The requester does not manage or control the
underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, or storage.
Individual applications cannot be altered but there may be user configuration settings that can
be adjusted.

Cloud Computing Overview


Deployment Models
There are four deployment models to choose from when considering migrating to the cloud.




To understand when to use a particular deployment model as the preferred choice, the models
have been compared across five categories – Security, Reliability, Flexibility, Cost, and Vendor
Lock-in (degree of difficulty to migrate to a different model if needed in the future). These
comparisons are primarily for legacy applications. For each category there is a description and
a general score. The score is in relation to the other models.

The table below describes the scoring used in this section.

  -     In comparison to other deployment models, this model is neutral or average in this area.
       In comparison to other deployment models, this model is weak in this area.

Private Cloud
A private cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization
comprising multiple users (i.e. departments). It may be owned, managed, and operated by the
organization, a third party, or some combination, and it may exist on or off the premises.

               Private clouds are typically more secure than alternatives as the servers
 Security      are controlled and no other organization has access to them (Pham,                           
               2011).

               Depending upon the infrastructure within a country, a private cloud,
               especially if there is a direct line connecting the cloud to the
               government buildings, may be more reliable than alternatives. For
 Reliability   example, if the Internet is frequently slow or unavailable during the day                    
               during times of high traffic, then making the internet the primary
               method of reaching key applications may impact day to day business
               activities.
               A private cloud can be geared towards a particular government’s needs.
 Flexibility   It can be built based on the specific requirements that an agency or                         
               department needs.

               would be performed by the government or third party vendor.
               Once an application is virtualized, it is much easier to move from
               platform to platform. However, a specific virtualization software must

               amount of lock-in to a specific vendor, but not significantly more or less
               than any other cloud option.

Public Cloud
A public cloud infrastructure is provisioned for use by any organization that wishes to pay for
computing resources (U.S. Department of Commerce, 2011). It may be owned, managed, and
operated by a business or outside organization. The infrastructure exists on the premises of the
cloud provider rather than the users.

Cloud Computing Overview



For the purposes of this toolkit, there is also a deployment model called local public cloud. This
term applies to a local public cloud provider whose premises are within the country’s borders.
This may be the only option if a government has strict laws or policies around the storage and
transport of data.

 Category                                  Description                                           Public     Local Public
               For governments in particular, there is a risk of having classified
               or sensitive data located outside the country’s borders. There is

               While there are companies that specialize in enabling users to
               move from one cloud platform to another, it does require effort.
               In addition, once the government gets rid of hardware or

               difficult to move all applications back to government data
               centers without investing time and money. Thus, going with a
               public cloud provider results in a certain level of vendor lock-in.

Community Cloud
The community cloud is provisioned for exclusive use by a specific community of consumers
from organizations that have shared concerns (i.e., mission, security requirements, policy, and
compliance considerations) (U.S. Department of Commerce, 2011). It may be owned, managed,
and operated by one or more of the organizations in the community, a third party, or some
combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises. Community clouds are frequently
used by government or educational institutions that consist of a number of different entities
(i.e. departments or colleges).

Community cloud is a form of private cloud with multiple tenants where all of the tenants are
part of the same parent organization. For the purposes of this toolkit, if multiple departments
or ministries decide to utilize the same private cloud then private cloud and community cloud
are equivalent. For example, if both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Defense want

to use the same private cloud, but the Ministry of Defense does not want employees from the
Ministry of Finance to have access to the defense data, then you have a private cloud with two
tenants. This is now a community cloud. The addition of another tenant does impact the
security and flexibility of the offering in relation to a private cloud that is dedicated to a single
tenant. A private cloud with multiple tenants must be able to offer the technical architectures
both need. For example, if the Ministry of Finance has primarily .Net applications running on
Windows servers and the Ministry of Defense has primarily Java applications running on Red
Hat Linux, the private cloud must now offer both platforms. In addition, appropriate security
needs to be in place to ensure that access is restricted to the appropriate individuals. This is
especially true if any database consolidation takes place.

               Cost is greatly dependent upon whether the community cloud is owned

Hybrid Cloud
A hybrid cloud infrastructure consists of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures (private,
community, or public) that remain separate, but are bound together by standardized or
proprietary technology which enables data and application portability (U.S. Department of
Commerce, 2011). A hybrid cloud is almost always a combination of public and private and is
the combination considered in this section. The most common scenario is a predominantly
private cloud that “borrows” computing resources from a public cloud when it experiences
spikes in data. One example is taxes. Most people submit their taxes within a one month
period of time. During the rest of the year there is minimal use of those tax applications.

Cloud Computing Overview


Revenue agencies must have enough computing resources to handle the peak demand before
taxes are due. In a hybrid environment, that additional demand is handled by public cloud
computing resources. This enables the agency to not have to maintain all those additional
computing resources on a day to day basis.

               minimized.
               If applications are also using public cloud computing resources, they
               typically must be compatible with the public cloud. Since public cloud
               providers may limit the operating systems or databases that they

               provide, a hybrid approach may require that applications be upgraded                          -

               the public cloud.
               Future setup and maintenance costs will be lower than with a purely
               private cloud approach, since excess capacity will be freed up. Rather
               than keep computing resources on hand to deal with peak demand,

               which can be expensive in the beginning.
               Private clouds still require virtualization software. Moving applications

organizations than others.

It should be noted that not all organizations should move to the cloud. Before selecting a
deployment model, an organization first needs to consider the benefits and risks of moving to
the cloud in the first place.

Benefits
Cloud computing has opened up new possibilities and enables numerous potential benefits,
including significant cost savings, faster innovation, and greater flexibility. The following are the
common benefits gained from cloud system implementation.

Faster Development of Applications
Cloud computing allows applications to be created and implemented faster. For many
governments and organizations it can take weeks, if not longer, to order new servers, set them
up, and then build a new application. A cloud system would enable computing resources to be
available within hours instead of weeks (Rodier, 2011).

Cost Saving
Infrastructure is expensive to purchase, to operate and to maintain. Cloud services are typically
pay as you go, or “on-demand”, which allows end-users to utilize computing resources as
needed. It maximizes the utilization of computing resources and reduces the operation and
maintenance costs especially during non-peak times. Cost savings are impacted by current IT
expenditure, current hardware life cycles, and which deployment model is chosen.

Improve Operations (Agility and Scalability)
Limited computing resources can prevent applications from running as quickly as they could or
from running at all if the resources are needed for other applications. For example, a
government has a processor intensive census program that runs once every ten years and runs
on the same server as an application that shows who is eligible to vote. It may not be possible
to generate a list of voters and process the census results at the same time. The cloud can help
by automatically supplying additional computing resources during heavy system use.

Growth can also exceed a system’s capabilities. Perhaps in the past most citizens went to their
local government office to apply for benefits or get a driver’s license, but with the growth of
mobile phones, they can now reach these applications online. This sudden spike of usage may
require more processing power than was originally planned for or purchased. Without the
cloud, such a spike of usage might cause the system to crash or become inaccessible. With the
cloud, additional computing resources are added as needed and removed when no longer
required. (Microsoft, 2011)

Cloud Computing Overview



Disaster Recovery and High Availability
Many public cloud service providers have data centers located in multiple locations. This
provides a failover location in the event that the primary location becomes unavailable due to a
security event, natural disaster, or human error. This capability keeps the government
operating seamlessly.

Modernization
Many governments have servers with a variety of software components on them. There may
be multiple versions of Linux or Windows operating systems, the same for different versions of
databases, or even programming languages. Moving to the cloud typically gives governments
the opportunity to standardize their technology architecture across the government or across a
department. This increases the ease of maintenance and the ability to add additional features
and functionality to applications going forward.

Technological Advantage or Competition
Governments have a mandate to provide services to their citizens. As part of pursuing this
mandate, government may consider implementing a cloud strategy. Alternatively, a
government may consider implementing a cloud strategy in order to gain or maintain a
perceived technical advantage. This advantage could be in either the public or private sector.
A government may work to build demand or skills in the area of cloud computing in order to
encourage the development of certain skills or products in the private sector.

Security
Major public cloud service providers have their own security protections against internal and
external threats. They also support top-line security protocols commonly used. While anything
you put on a public server is at higher risk than a computer not connected to an external
network, public cloud service providers have security expertise, operation expertise, and are
typically up to date on the latest security technologies.

Private clouds have a certain level of security, especially if they are directly connected to the
users they serve rather than accessed via the Internet. However, organizations using private
clouds generally have a smaller skilled security team than a public cloud provider would.

Risks
Cost - No economies of scale
There are economies of scale that come from owning an entire data center. Adding one more
server is cheaper than the first one was. In the cloud, every CPU and GB needed will cost the
same, whether you use 200 or 200 million. Savings are greatest if there are large spikes in
usage that cause storage or servers to sit idle when not in use. In the cloud, you only need to
pay for those additional computing resources when used. This can also make it more

Cloud Computing Overview


challenging to predict monthly costs. Sudden increase in usage of an application can result in a
sudden jump in costs.

Vendor Lock-In
Whether the decision is to build a private cloud or go to a public cloud, there will be a certain
amount of vendor lock-in. The degree of lock-in varies, particularly when it comes to deciding
to move out of a public cloud. Once you exceed existing computing resources, it is much harder
to leave the cloud. This should be considered if you think you might need to make changes in
the future due to data or other concerns.

Infrastructure
If the network infrastructure is unreliable or is already highly utilized then moving to the cloud
may be too much of a burden on the existing infrastructure. It could cause applications to crash
or be inaccessible. In such situations the network infrastructure must either be upgraded
before considering a move to a public or hybrid cloud or, alternative, a private cloud on a
dedicated line should be considered.


Migrating Applications
An important step in planning for a cloud implementation is deciding which applications to
move. Not all applications should be moved to the cloud. There are many attributes that are
considered in the application assessment, but some of the most important categories to
consider are structure, dependency, connectivity, and reliability.

Structure
A large, single-tiered legacy application typically isn't a good fit for the cloud. In a single-tier
application the user interface, business logic, and data storage are all located on the same
machine. While these applications are typically the easiest to design, they are also the least
scalable. Efficiencies are gained when an application is scalable and the load can be spread
over several instances. This also helps with disaster recovery as it enables a failure in one part
of the system to be mitigated without affecting other parts of the system.

Dependency
Applications that depend on specific hardware—such as a particular chip set or an external
device such as a fingerprint reader—might not be a good fit for the cloud, unless those
dependencies are specifically addressed. Similarly, if an application depends on an operating
system or set of libraries that cannot be used in the cloud, or cannot be virtualized, that
application should not be moved to the cloud.

Connectivity
Applications that interface with or use computing resources that will not be reachable from the
cloud, including other applications or storage, are typically poor candidates for migration. For

example, if tax data cannot be moved to the cloud, you might not move an application that
accesses the tax data frequently throughout the day. In some situations, these issues can be
resolved with a custom network setup, but how well this works depends on the chosen cloud
environment.

Reliability
Applications by their nature are not perfect, but the more reliable an application is, the longer it
can run before encountering a problem. Applications that are known to be unreliable should be
reviewed as a possible candidate for rewriting or replacing, since known functionality issues
may become worse when migrating an application to a new platform. Trying to migrate an
unreliable application may not only increase the effort required to perform the migration, but
also fail to achieve the benefits of moving to the cloud.

Virtualization
Overview
Cloud computing is built upon the ability to virtualize applications, regardless of the
deployment model selected. Understanding virtualization is key to understanding how pricing
works in the cloud. A high level knowledge of this area will enable the creation of more
accurate estimates and thus better, and more cost effective, utilization of cloud computing
resources. It will also assist with the building of a business case around implementing a cloud
computing system.

When researching cloud providers and other various cloud service offerings there will be
frequent references to virtual central processing units (vCPUs) and virtual cores (vCores). These
components differ from their physical counterparts in a manner that is not always very straight
forward. NOTE: Amazon Web Services (AWS) uses the term vCPU whereas Azure uses vCore.
Conceptually, they are the same.

The main goal when virtualizing a server is to be able to run multiple applications on the same
server. Each application has its own space, or virtual machine, on the server. One way to look
at this is to think of a physical server as a house. Each room is a virtual machine and each
member of the family, or application, gets their own room. The software that enables the
creation of these rooms is called a hypervisor. A hypervisor is a piece of software, hardware, or
firmware that creates and runs virtual machines. The hypervisor can either be installed directly
on the server or on top of the operating system running on the server. The following diagram
shows how three applications running on a virtualized server might look, depending on where
the hypervisor is installed.

Cloud Computing Overview




Once a hypervisor is installed, either on the host operating system or directly on the server then
the hypervisor manages the physical computing resources (i.e. CPU, memory, etc.) and
allocates computing resources to create virtual machines instances upon user request. The
guest operating system is installed on the virtual machine instance. Applications can then be
installed on the guest operating system and accessed by users.

An increasingly common practice is to take virtualization to the next level and build containers
that can easily be moved from server to server. Instead of rooms, the server now has multiple
houses and each house can be picked up as a single unit and moved somewhere else as
needed. The following diagram shows how container-based virtualization is delivered from a
physical server.




Unlike traditional virtual machines, containers do not have a guest operating system installed,
but it does require that the physical server have a host operating system. The container itself
contains the application in addition to all the components needed for that application and uses

the host operating system. This means there is less wasted computing making for a more
efficient system, and is also easier to move when needed.

Sizing
When taking applications that currently reside on a physical server and moving them to a
virtual machine, it can be challenging to determine how much of various computing resources
(i.e. storage, memory, CPUs, etc.) to assign to the application. The recommended approach is
to determine what your peak utilization of your current resources over a period of time (ideally
12 months). If that is not possible, then request the same cloud computing resources as the
current physical server and monitor the application for the next 12 months to determine
utilization, and refine any budget estimates. Based on computing resource usage, the
computing resources can be scaled either up or down.

Conclusions
Increasingly, citizens expect that they can complete tasks online rather than going into an office
and waiting in line. In addition, the amount of digital data is growing across the globe and is
expected to continue to do so. The ability to take advantage of this data and use it to help
improve efficiencies within the government and provide better services to citizens is driving
many governments to consider cloud platforms. Cloud has the possibility to enable
government employees to work from anywhere and citizens to get access to information from
their phones or homes. It can enable governments to quickly deploy applications and new
functionality.

While cloud has the power to connect, it also comes with risks. Moving data outside of secure
locations opens it up for attack. This can be especially true if a limited number of employees
with skills in security has led to the development of applications that are particularly
vulnerable. Legacy applications that were not originally designed for the cloud may have to be
updated, a potentially time consuming undertaking.

It should also be noted, that while much focus is placed on the potential cost savings of cloud,
much of those savings are difficult to quantify. Many benefits of cloud enable governments to
avoid costs in the future. For example, the implementation of a scalable infrastructure can
reduce future capacity costs, and faster development of applications reduces development
costs. However, these costs do not reduce the current IT budget, and are sometimes
overlooked (Neville Cannon, 2015).

The preferred deployment model and path to implementation will be different for every
country, and possibly even differ by departments or ministries within the same country. It may
be that an agriculture application can move to the public cloud, but a finance application should
consider a private cloud. Then the government must decide if everyone should use the same
solution or if there should be multiple solutions. A Cloud Readiness Assessment will provide
insight into the current state of a country, and will help provide insight into where a country is
now, and what recommendations there are for the future.

            Public Cloud Vendor Comparison
            If a government decides to go with a public cloud setup then the next step is to determine
            which vendor to select. Vendors usually have multiple offerings, and it can be challenging to
            compare vendors. Comparisons are typically further complicated by different vendors using
            different terminology and units. It is recommended that, even if deciding to pursue a private
            cloud, governments still assess public cloud vendors to determine a baseline of offerings and
            service level agreements that they may wish to provide. In order to assist with any future
            comparisons governments may undertake, a vendor comparison can be found in this section for
            reference.

            Azure and Amazon were chosen due to their breadth of services and geographic offerings. This
            report is not recommending one vendor over another, but only providing an example of a
            vendor assessment to provide guidance to governments on developing vendor requirements
            for their own vendor assessments.

            Price is a key factor, especially as it can differ per region. Unlike private clouds, public clouds
            are not fully customizable. Pricing can vary depending upon the components and services
            provided by the public cloud service provider and also how the government utilizes those
            computing resources. A rough baseline for public cloud pricing can be found in the tables in
            this section.

            At this time, there is no data center in Africa for Azure or Amazon, so it is recommended that
            African countries consider either using a data center on the European continent or a local cloud
            provider. If a local provider is selected, it is recommended the provider be assessed based on
            the general concepts and specific recommendations outlined in this report. Please be aware
            that actual pricing can vary based on utilization and contracting (i.e. predicted infrastructure
            usage, upfront payment, transaction volume, sizing, etc.).
