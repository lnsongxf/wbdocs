THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW

environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practic e or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.

      It grants only the right to build the project as designed; it does not
      authorize construction. The permit ensures that the project meets all
      relevant regulations and is valid for 3 years. The application for a frame
      permit must contain all relevant information on the project,
      architectural drawings, and other requirements, according to the
      Planning and Building Act and other relevant regulations. The legal
      maximum time to complete this procedure is 84 days.

      In practice, obtaining the frame permit in Oslo currently takes about 3
      months. The reasons for the delayed executive work are:
      • High building activity
      • A corresponding increase in building applications
      • A shortage of manpower in the building authorities

        BuildCo must ensure that a construction oversight plan is drawn up.
        Such a plan should be included in the application or be submitted while
        the application for a start-up permit is being reviewed at the latest. The
        construction may be monitored by means of documented self-
        inspections or by an independent enterprise. The developer, the
        applicant, the designer, and the contractor in charge must provide the
        information necessary to monitor the construction. The latter is
        normally executed through self-inspection. The legal maximum time to
        complete this stage is 84 days. Obtaining a start-up permit in Oslo
        currently takes 3 weeks on average.

        Obtain approval from the Municipal Building Authorities upon
        completion of the project

        BuildCo must obtain an approval from the Municipality upon
        completion of the project. If the final approval is not issued within the
   9    deadline, the silence-is-consent rule is applied and the building may be     10 days       no charge
        used.

        The Water and Sewage Authorities must be present when the

        determining the time for the connection. Such a request must be
        received by the authorities at 10 a.m. (at the latest) the day before the
        connection is to take place. The receipt for the paid connection fee
        must be attached to the request form where the connection time and
        place are determined.

        For 2010, the City Parliament of Oslo has established that the taxes to
        be paid for water and sewage connection are NOK 41.24 per sq. m. for          1 day       NOK 95,752

        public pipelines (both water and sewage pipelines -- that is, the water
        supply from purification plant to the consumer, and sewage transport
        from the consumer to waste water plant). A reduction is given when the
        land plot is larger than 3,000 square meters and utilization is less than
        12.5% (not applicable in the Doing Business case).

       Submit an application for registration of transfer at the Land

       There is no need for a lawyer or notary to be involved in the process. The
       application is a standard form and may be acquired in book stores and
       the internet. The fee to receive the title is NOK 525 and the stamp duty
       tax is 2.5% of the value of the property. If the transaction is financed by
       debt, the buyer has to pay a public fee to register a mortgage bond,
       equal to NOK 1,935. Upon refinancing an existing mortgage loan within
       the same loan frame, the fee to register a new mortgage deed or
       transporting the old mortgage deed to the new one, has been reduced
       to NOK 215. As of April 1st, 2005 the registration fee and the transfer tax
       is to be paid after the registration, not before, and can be paid online.
       Until 2004 the registration process had been performed by the local
       courts under the supervision of a judge (however the work is mainly                                   NOK 525

       Procedure (the registration process, in other words) has increased
       temporarily. The current process goes as follows: First, the required
       documents will be received and registered by the registry in the daily
       book. Second, the relevant data will be entered into database. Third, staff
       members will verify the data. Fourth, a deed stamped by the Register is
       sent by ordinary mail to the buyer. An invoice is also sent for the
       registration fees and stamp duty, and the payment can be made online.

Doing Business measures the efficiency of the judicial
system in resolving a commercial dispute before             Time to file and serve the case
local courts. Following the step-by-step evolution of       Time for trial and obtaining judgment
a standardized case study, it collects data relating to

a commercial lawsuit. The ranking on the ease of          Cost required to complete procedures (% of

The dispute in the case study involves the breach of a
sales contract between 2 domestic businesses. The           Enforcement costs
case study assumes that the court hears an expert on
the quality of the goods in dispute. This distinguishes
the case from simple debt enforcement. To make the
data comparable across economies, Doing Business
uses several assumptions about the case:
       The seller and buyer are located in the
        economy’s largest business city. For the 11
        economies with a population of more than               The seller requests a pretrial attachment to

ENFORCING CONTRACTS
Economies in all regions have improved contract                   reducing backlogs by introducing periodic reviews to
enforcement in recent years. A judiciary can be improved          clear inactive cases from the docket and by making
in different ways. Higher-income economies tend to look           procedures faster. What reforms making it easier (or
for ways to enhance efficiency by introducing new                 more difficult) to enforce contracts has Doing Business
technology. Lower-income economies often work on                  recorded in Norway (table 10.1)?
