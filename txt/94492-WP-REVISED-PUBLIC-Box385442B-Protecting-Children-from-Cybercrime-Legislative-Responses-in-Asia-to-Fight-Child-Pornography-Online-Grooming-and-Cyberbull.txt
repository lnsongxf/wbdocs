 PREFACE


Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have developed at an increasingly fast rate over the last two
decades. Recent rapid advances in ICTs have provided both children and adults with benefits and opportunities
in terms of socialization, education, and entertainment. In particular, the development of ICTs has provided
children and adolescents using the Internet and associated technologies with new spaces to interact and form
social relationships with others, such as chatrooms, peer-to-peer (P2P) websites, and social networking sites.

Such technological innovations simultaneously have allowed violence to be committed by, with, and through the
use of ICTs, including violence against children. Accordingly, children using the Internet and associated
technologies become vulnerable to ICT-facilitated child abuse and exploitation and such child abuse and
exploitation are often difficult to detect and address.

In the framework of the Global Forum on Law, Justice and Development (GFLJD), the World Bank and the
International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children have undertaken an Asian Regional Study on Legislative
Responses for the Protection of Children from Violence through Information and Communication Technologies
(hereafter referred to as “this Regional Study”) in response to a growing concern over the use of ICTs to commit
violence against children.

This Regional Study provides an overview of 17 targeted Asian countries’ legislative responses to online child
abuse and exploitation, with a particular focus on activities related to child pornography (also known as “child
abuse images”), online grooming, and cyberbullying. This Regional Study pays special attention to: 1) analyzing
legislative measures to address violence against children committed by, with, and through the use of ICTs in
alignment with relevant international instruments; 2) presenting examples of good practice in a legal enabling
environment for child online protection at a national level in compliance with relevant international standards;
and 3) highlighting recommendations for strengthening the national legal framework to handle ICT-facilitated
child abuse and exploitation amongst the 17 Asian countries analyzed.

I. INTRODUCTION
Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have rapidly developed over the last two decades. Recent
rapid advances in ICTs have allowed adults, as well as children, to enjoy unprecedented opportunities and
benefits in terms of socialization, education, and entertainment. In particular, the development of ICTs has
provided children and adolescents using the Internet and associated technologies 1 with new spaces to interact
and form social relationships with others, such as chatrooms, peer-to-peer (P2P) websites, and social
networking sites.

At the same time, technological innovation has enabled crimes, including crimes against children, to be
committed by the use of ICTs. Children and adolescents using the Internet and associated technologies are more
vulnerable to online abuse and exploitation than adults. To begin with, children and adolescents using the
Internet and associated technologies are often poorly equipped to fully understand the potential risk of being
exposed to illegal activities committed through the use of ICTs. In addition, because technological development
is fast-paced and due to the fact that children are usually faster adopters of new technologies than adults, it may
be difficult for parents, guardians, and caregivers to monitor their children’s online activities.

Furthermore, violence against children committed through the use of ICTs is more difficult to detect and address
than traditional forms of violence against children. For example, there was a recent case in the United States
involving a child perpetrator who is convicted of engaging in a child exploitation enterprise, conspiracy to
advertise and distribute child pornography and accessing a computer with intent to view child pornography by
using Tor-network-based child pornography website. The website used by the above-mentioned child
perpetrator was accessible only through Tor, an Internet application specifically designed to facilitate
anonymous communication. 2 Virtual currencies (i.e., bitcoin) have become popular payment methods for those
who participate in transactions to purchase child pornography or intend to earn a profit by committing crimes
against children in the Internet environment. One reason criminals have begun to use virtual currencies is that
most countries do not yet apply existing law and regulation, which govern traditional currencies backed by
central banks, to virtual currencies, which are decentralized. The technological innovations that allow Internet
users to anonymously surf Tor-network-based websites and engage in electronic transactions by using virtual
currencies, which are not easily governed with existing laws and regulations, make it harder for law enforcement
agencies to detect suspicious activities, identify perpetrators, and investigate and prosecute illegal activities
against children when such activities are committed by the use of ICTs. 3

A holistic approach to fight cybercrime against children, including adopting policies and legislation, raising
awareness, building capacity, and providing technical assistance, is required to address the multi-dimensional
threat that cybercrime poses. Furthermore, such an approach must involve various stakeholders, including
children, families, communities, governments, members of civil society, and the private sector, in order to

“Pact of Rio de Janeiro”), ‘child’ and ‘children and adolescents’ are used to denote all human beings below the age of 18 years and everyone under the age
of 18 needs protection from sexual exploitation. Article 1 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (hereafter also referred to as “CRC”) states that “For
the purposes of the present Convention, a child means every human being below the age of eighteen years unless under the law applicable to the child,
majority is attained earlier”.

comprehensively and effectively fight ICT-facilitated child abuse and exploitation. 4 Among various approaches to
dealing with violence against children using ICTs, this Regional Study will primarily focus on legislative responses
for child online protection. First, the adoption of appropriate domestic law for child online protection is
important because the absence of adequate laws addressing online child abuse and exploitation can create
loopholes in the law and such a legal vacuum may increase the chances of children falling victim to such
exploitation and abuse. Further, a review of the existing legal framework addressing ICT-facilitated crimes
against children is crucial considering that in order to tackle crime with a transnational nature international
cooperation must be enhanced through a globally harmonized legal framework to address the underlying
activities that should be criminalized and subject to punishment. An analysis of domestic law in alignment with
relevant international practice may help to identify the areas to be progressed by individual countries, with a
view to allowing for consistency of domestic law and enhancing international cooperation related to the
prevention and combating of ICT-facilitated crimes against children.

While responding to the growing need for globally harmonized domestic legislation to fight violence against
children committed with the use of ICTs, it is important to note that international instruments that are directly
or indirectly relevant to online child abuse and exploitation have been developed. Such international tools can
provide individual countries with guidance regarding international standards, and accordingly, can help
individual countries enact new laws or amend existing laws, in order to curb violence against children committed
by the use of ICTs in compliance with relevant international good practices. However, in order for such
international instruments to be more effective, it will be vital to raise awareness of existing international tools
related to ICT-facilitated child abuse and exploitation with a view to improving the ratification status of such
international tools. Furthermore, after individual countries’ adoption of relevant international instruments,
strengthening the monitoring mechanisms focused on the implementation of international tools will also be
necessary to ensure fulfillment of specific countries’ commitments to comply with international standards.

II. OBJECTIVES AND METHODOLOGY

A. Objectives
The purpose of this Regional Study is to enhance the protection of children by supporting legislative responses
to deal with ICT-facilitated child abuse and exploitation in 17 targeted Asian countries. As such, it aims to: 1)
provide an analysis of domestic law in alignment with relevant international instruments; 2) present examples of
good legal practices for child online protection at a national level that comply with related international
standards; and 3) strengthen national legal frameworks to deal with issues of online child abuse and exploitation
amongst the 17 Asian countries analyzed.

B. Methodology
This Regional Study examines legislative responses that address ICT-facilitated child abuse and exploitation with
a primary focus on: 1) activities related to child pornography 5 (also known as “child abuse images” 6); 2) online
grooming 7; and 3) cyberbullying 8, the most common forms of violence against children committed by, with, and
through the use of ICTs.

All of the international instruments that are directly or indirectly related to the areas discussed by this Regional
Study are considered. Specifically, international instruments that address child pornography offenses and online
grooming offenses are used to analyze the provisions of domestic law, especially when such instruments contain
specific definitions of these offenses, as well as provisions requiring punishment for criminalized actions. An
analysis of conduct like cyberbullying, advertising child sex tourism 9 online, and sexting 10 covered by this
Regional Study primarily focuses on domestic law due to the lack of relevant international instruments providing
definitions.

Regulation, national action plans, and policy relevant to issues covered by this Regional Study are also
considered in addition to the review of domestic law based on its texts, directly or indirectly pertaining to child
pornography, online grooming, cyberbullying, advertising child sex tourism online, and sexting.

  For the purposes of this Regional Study, unless provided otherwise, the term “child pornography” refers to any representation, by whatever means, of a
child engaged in real or simulated explicit sexual activities or any representation of the sexual parts of a child for primarily sexual purposes in accordance
with Article 2 (c) of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography,
(hereafter also referred to as “OPSC”).
6
  Footnote 3 of the Pact of Rio de Janeiro provides that “Increasingly the term ‘child abuse images’ is being used to refer to the sexual exploitation of
children and adolescents in pornography. This is to reflect the seriousness of the phenomenon and to emphasize that pornographic images of children are
in fact records of a crime being committed. However, many laws use the term ‘child pornography’ and it is therefore used in this document”.
7
 For the purposes of this Regional Study, the term “online grooming” is the intentional proposal, through information and communication technologies, of
an adult to meet a child who has not reached the age of sexual consent, for the purpose of engaging in sexual activities or producing child pornography,
when this proposal has been followed by material acts leading to such a meeting in accordance with Article 23 of the Council of Europe Convention on the
Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse (hereafter also referred to as “Lanzarote Convention”).
8
  For the purposes of this Regional Study the term “cyberbullying” is the use of information and communication technologies to support deliberate,
repeated and hostile behavior by an individual or group that is intended to harm others. Bill Belsey, Cyberbullying Information, What Is Cyberbullying?,
http://www.cyberbullying.org/pdf/Cyberbullying_Information.pdf (last visited Oct. 24, 2014).
9
 For the purposes of this Regional Study, the term “child sex tourism” is the sexual exploitation of children by a person or persons who travel from their
home district, home geographical region, or home country in order to have sexual contact with children. Child sex tourists can be domestic travelers as
well as international tourists. ECPAT, COMBATING CHILD SEX TOURISM: QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS (2008), at 6, available at

This Regional Study takes stock of existing sources including, but not limited to: 1) country reports presented to
the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child regarding the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of
the Child (CRC) and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Sale of Children,
Child Prostitution and Child Pornography (OPSC); 2) reports of the UN Special Representatives on the Sale of
Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography presented to the UN General Assembly; 3) individual
countries’ statistics indicating the use of ICTs presented by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU); 4)
country profiles of cybercrime legislation and discussion papers produced by the Council of Europe; 5) reports
on child pornography/child abuse images and child sex tourism prepared by End Child Prostitution, Child
Pornography and Trafficking of Children for Sexual Purposes (ECPAT); 6) Handbook on the Optional Protocol to
the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography
published by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF); and 7) research and studies conducted by the
International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (ICMEC).

Peer Review Process
The information on each individual country’s legislative, regulatory, and policy responses to violence against
children committed by, with, and through the use of ICTs, contained in Appendix B (Table 2 – Individual Country
Information), was subject to a peer review process from August 20, 2014 to October 27, 2014. The information
for 8 countries out of the 17 targeted Asian countries (Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Republic of Korea,
Singapore, Thailand, and Timor-Leste) was confirmed, verified, and updated based on the valuable input from
six peer reviewers who partner with ICMEC.

III. RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL INSTRUMENTS
The international and regional instruments, directly or indirectly pertaining to issues covered by this Regional
Study, serve as guidelines for: 1) drawing up outlines of key topics to be addressed; 2) designing and developing
Appendix B (Table 2 – Individual Country Information) to be used for analyzing domestic law, regulation, and
policy; and 3) capturing good in-country practices in alignment with international or regional good practices in
the areas of child online protection. International and regional tools related to areas reviewed for this Regional
Study are considered baselines for: 4) identifying gaps in domestic law compared to good practice at the
international and regional levels, especially when making recommendations, with a view to helping subject
countries strengthen legislative responses to violence against children committed by the use of the Internet and
associated technologies.

     1. Convention on the Rights of the Child
     The Convention on the Rights of the Child 11 (hereafter also referred to as “CRC”) aims to ensure a wide
     range of human rights for children – including civil, cultural, economic, political, and social rights.

     Article 1 of the CRC provides that “For the purposes of the present Convention, a child means every human
     being below the age of 18 years unless under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier”.

     Article 34 of the CRC requires States Parties to take all appropriate measures to address the sexual
     exploitation and sexual abuse of children, including measures to prevent the exploitative use of children in
     pornographic performances and materials.

     All of the 17 Asian countries analyzed (Brunei Darussalam, 1995; Cambodia, 1992; China, 1992; Democratic
     People’s Republic of Korea, 1990; India, 1992; Indonesia, 1990; Japan, 1994; Lao People’s Democratic
     Republic, 1991; Malaysia, 1995; Mongolia, 1990; Myanmar, 1991; Philippines, 1990; Republic of Korea,
     1991; Singapore, 1995; Thailand, 1992; Timor-Leste, 2003; and Vietnam, 1990) have ratified or acceded to
     the CRC as of October 24, 2014.12 Accession has the same legal effect as ratification by the terms of the
     Convention according to Article 49 of the CRC.

     2. Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Sale of Children, Child
     Prostitution and Child Pornography
     The primary international tool serving as guidance for this Regional Study is the Optional Protocol to the
     Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography 13
     (hereafter also referred to as “OPSC”). 14

     Among the countries analyzed, 15 have ratified or acceded to the OPSC (Brunei Darussalam, 2006;
     Cambodia, 2002; China, 2002; India, 2005; Indonesia, 2012; Japan, 2005; Lao People’s Democratic Republic,

  State Parties to the OPSC were concerned about the growing availability of child pornography on the Internet and other evolving technologies, and
recalling the International Conference on Combating Child Pornography on the Internet, held in Vienna in 1999, in particular its conclusion calling for the
worldwide criminalization of the production, distribution, exportation, transmission, importation, intentional possession and advertising of child
pornography, and stressing the importance of closer cooperation and partnership between governments and the Internet industry.


                                                                            5
     2006; Malaysia, 2012; Mongolia, 2003; Myanmar, 2012; Philippines, 2002; Republic of Korea, 2004;
     Thailand, 2006; Timor-Leste, 2003; and Vietnam, 2001). However, 2 countries (Democratic People’s Republic
     of Korea and Singapore) have not ratified the OPSC as of October 24, 2014. 15 Accession has the same legal
     effect as ratification by the terms of the Convention according to Article 14 of the OPSC.

     The OPSC may be deemed as one of the most important international legally binding instruments that can
     be used to analyze the legislative and regulatory approaches of Asian countries to address child
     pornography offenses in alignment with relevant international standards. The OPSC contains provisions
     mandating State Parties to criminalize illicit conduct in relation to child pornography, in addition to providing
     a definition of child pornography under its Article 2 (c) as stated below.

           Article 3 (1) (c) of the OPSC requires State Parties to create offenses covering the acts of producing,
            distributing, disseminating, importing, exporting, offering, selling child pornography or possessing
            it for the purpose of production, distribution, dissemination, importation, exportation, offer, or
            sale.
           Article 3 (3) of the OPSC obliges State Parties to make such offenses punishable by appropriate
            penalties that take into account their grave nature.
           Article 3 (4) of the OPSC mandates State Parties to take measures, whether appropriate, to establish
            liability of legal persons for offenses established in its Article 3 (1), subject to the provisions of their
            national laws and such liability may be criminal, civil, or administrative.
           Article 4 (2) of the OPSC stipulates that a State Party may take such measures as may be necessary
            to establish extraterritorial jurisdiction over the offenses referred to in Article 3 (1) in one of the
            following cases: (a) when the alleged offender is a national of that State or a person who has
            habitual residence in its territory; or (b) when the victim is a national of that State.
           Article 7 (a) of the OPSC states that State Parties shall, subject to the provisions of their national law,
            take measures to provide for: (i) the confiscation of assets used to commit or facilitate offenses
            under the present protocol; and (ii) the confiscation of proceeds derived from such offenses.

     Article 3 (1) (a) of the OPSC states that each State Party shall ensure that, as a minimum, the acts of
     producing, distributing, disseminating, importing, exporting, offering, selling, or possessing for the above
     purposes child pornography as defined in its Article 2 are fully covered under “its criminal or penal law”,
     whether such offenses are committed domestically or transnationally or on an individual or organized basis.
     However, amongst the 17 Asian countries analyzed, only 9 (Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, India, Indonesia,
     Japan, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Philippines, Republic of Korea, and Timor-Leste) have provisions
     under their domestic law that criminalize all or part of the illicit acts related to child pornography described
     in Article 3 (1) (c) of the OPSC as stated below (V. Analysis of the legislative responses to crimes against
     children in alignment with relevant international instruments, B. Punishment of conducts related to child
     pornography, B.1. Production, distribution, dissemination, importation, exportation, offer, sale, and
     possession of child pornography). Amongst these 9 countries, only 2 countries (Brunei Darussalam and

     criminalize acts related to child pornography under special laws.

     Article 3 (2) of the OPSC stipulates that subject to the provisions of the national law of a State Party, the
     same shall apply to an attempt to commit any of the said acts, and to complicity or participation in any of

     the said acts. The legal systems of the countries analyzed are diverse, including civil law systems, common
     law systems, or mixed legal systems combining both civil law and common law aspects. 16 Irrespective of
     their legal systems, among the 17 Asian countries analyzed, 16 countries (with the exception of Cambodia)
     have provisions under their Criminal Codes (also known as “Penal Codes”) addressing criminal liability for
     complicity of a crime, participation in a crime, or attempt to commit a crime. In addition, the Criminal Codes
     of these 16 countries contain provisions criminalizing activities related to child pornography, pornography,
     or obscenity. Further, in the case of Cambodia, Article 4 of the Law on Suppression of Human Trafficking and
     Sexual Exploitation contains provisions establishing criminal liability for an attempted crime or participation
     in a crime. Articles 38, 39, 40, and 41 of the Law on Suppression of Human Trafficking and Sexual
     Exploitation specify punishment for child pornography and pornography offenses. No special attention was
     given to the targeted Asian countries’ compliance with Article 3 (2) of the OPSC, which is usually present in
     their legislation. However, the importance of adopting legislative measures to punish any person who
     attempts to commit child pornography offenses or aids/abets to commit acts related to child pornography
     mentioned in Article 3 (1) (c) of the OPSC is discussed below (VIII. Conclusion and Recommendations, B.
     Recommendations).

     3. Convention concerning the prohibition and immediate action for the elimination of the worst forms of
     child labor, 1999 (No. 182)
     The International Labour Organization (ILO) adopted the Convention concerning the prohibition and
     immediate action for the elimination of the worst forms of child labor, 1999 (No. 182) 17 in 1999 (hereafter
     referred to as “the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999”), obliging each member that ratifies this
     Convention to take immediate and effective measures to secure the prohibition and elimination of the worst
     forms of child labor as a matter of urgency under its Article 1. The definition of the term “the worst forms of
     child labor”, for the purposes of this Convention, comprises the use, procuring, or offering of a child for the
     production of pornography or for pornographic performance according to its Article 3 (b).

     Among the 17 targeted countries included in this Regional Study, 15 countries (Brunei Darussalam, 2008;
     Cambodia, 2006; China, 2002; Indonesia, 2000; Japan, 2001; Lao People’s Democratic Republic, 2005;
     Malaysia, 2000; Mongolia, 2001; Myanmar, 2013; Philippines, 2000; Republic of Korea, 2001; Singapore,
     2001; Thailand, 2001; Timor-Leste, 2009; and Vietnam, 2000) have ratified the Worst Forms of Child Labour
     Convention, 1999. However, 2 countries (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and India) have not ratified
     the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention as of October 24, 2014. 18

   The preamble of the Convention on Cybercrime states that the Member States of the Council of Europe and the other States signatory were convinced
of the need to pursue, as a member of priority, a common criminal policy aimed at the protection of society against cybercrime, inter alia, by adopting
appropriate legislation and fostering international cooperation.


                                                                            7
     Convention on Cybercrime has provisions criminalizing child pornography offenses committed by the use of
     a computer system, provided that such commission is intentional and without right.

     The Convention on Cybercrime is open for signature by the Member States of the Council of Europe and by
     non-Member States of the Council of Europe, which have participated in its elaboration and subject to
     ratification pursuant to its Article 36. In addition, the Convention on Cybercrime is open for accession by
     other non-Member States according to its Article 37. Amongst the 17 targeted Asian countries, only Japan
     has signed and ratified the Convention on Cybercrime.
     Accession has the same legal effect as ratification by the terms of the Convention on Cybercrime provided
     under Articles 36 and 37 of the Convention on Cybercrime.

     5. Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse
     The Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse 21 (also called the
     “Lanzarote Convention”) contains provisions addressing child pornography offenses (its Article 20) and
     online grooming offenses (its Article 23). The Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual
     Exploitation and Sexual Abuse is open for ratification by the Member States of the Council of Europe. In
     addition, this Convention is open for accession by non-Member States of the Council of Europe. However,
     none of the 17 targeted Asian countries have signed or acceded to it as of October 27, 2014. 22

     6. Economic and Social Council Resolution 2011/33 on Prevention, Protection and International
     Cooperation against the Use of New Information Technologies to Abuse and/or Exploit Children
     The UN Economic and Social Council issued a Resolution entitled “Economic and Social Council Resolution
     2011/33 on Prevention, protection and international cooperation against the use of new information
     technologies to abuse and/or exploit children” 23 (hereafter also referred to as “ECOSOC Resolution
     2011/33”).

     ECOSOC Resolution 2011/33 stresses that new information and communication technologies and
     applications are being misused to commit child sexual exploitation crimes. In addition, the ECOSOC
     Resolution highlights that technical developments have permitted the emergence of crimes such as the
     production, distribution, or possession of child sexual abuse images, audio or video, the exposure of children
     to harmful content, the grooming, harassment, and sexual abuse of children, and cyberbullying.

     7. Rio de Janeiro Pact to Prevent and Stop Sexual Exploitation of Children and Adolescents
     The World Congress III against the Sexual Exploitation of Children and Adolescents was hosted in Rio de
     Janeiro, Brazil (November 25-28, 2008) to review the development and action taken in follow up to the
     Stockholm Declaration and Agenda for Action (1996) 24 and the Yokohama Global Commitment (2001). 25

     to be taken at a national level in order to prevent, prohibit, and criminalize certain forms of sexual
     exploitation of children and adolescents 27 with a particular focus on abuse of children and adolescents

IV. ASIAN COUNTRIES – STATISTICAL INDICATORS, AS WELL AS THE SIMILARITIES OF THE LEGAL AND
    REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

A. STATISTICAL INDICATORS

Statistical indicators discussed in this Regional Study include: a) the total population and the population’s age
structure; and b) the level of ICT usage. 28 Before addressing this statistical information, it is necessary to address
the meanings of “developing country” and “developed country”, which indicate the level of economic
development and affect the above-mentioned data.

There are currently no standardized definitions of the terms “developing country” and “developed country” that
are commonly accepted by the international community. However, according to the World Bank, the term
“developing”, in the context of “developing countries” for lending purposes, is used to denote low- and middle-
income countries, while the term “high income country” refers to a “developed country” for the same purposes.
The World Bank states that these terms do not imply that all economies in the group are experiencing similar
levels of development or that other economies have reached a preferred or final stage of development. 29

For the purposes of this Regional Study, the criteria used by the World Bank to classify a specific country as
either a “developing country” or a “developed country” based on its Gross National Income (GNI) per capita per
year are utilized. It should be noted that the term “high-income country” does not necessarily equate to the
term “developed country”, and the same is true for the interchangeability of the terms “middle and low income
country” and “developing country”.

The terms “developing country” and “developed country” can be defined according to each country’s GNI per
capita per year. For the current 2015 fiscal year of the World Bank (from July 1, 2014 to June 30, 2015), a
country with a GNI per capita per year of $12,746 or more is defined as a “developed country” (or high-income
country), whereas a country with a GNI per capita per year less than $12,746 is defined as a “developing
country” (or low- and middle-income country).

For the purposes of this Regional Study:
    • 4 countries (Brunei Darussalam, Japan, Republic of Korea, and Singapore) are considered as “developed
        countries”; and
    • 13 countries (Cambodia, China, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, India, Indonesia, Lao People’s
        Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand, Timor-Leste, and Vietnam)
        are deemed to be “developing countries”.

        A.1. Data concerning population

        Data concerning the populations of the countries analyzed indicates that the level of economic development
        in each country may affect the age structure of the population.




28
  Appendix A (Table 1 – Population data and ICT statistics) provides information on the total population, the population’s age structure, and the level of
ICT usage in the 17 targeted Asian countries.
29
     Data, Country and Lending Groups, WORLD BANK, http://data.worldbank.org/about/country-and-lending-groups#High_income (last visited Jan. 19, 2015).


                                                                           10
     The 17 Asian countries analyzed have a combined total population of 3,433,699,663 inhabitants (July 2014
     est.). 30 Two countries (China and India) have approximately 75% of the population among the countries
     reviewed (China – 1,355,692,576, 39% of the total population of the 17 Asian countries analyzed; India –
     1,236,344,631, 36% of the total population of the 17 targeted Asian countries). There are also 3 countries
     (Indonesia, Japan, and Philippines) whose estimated populations are more than 100,000,000 inhabitants
     each (Indonesia – 253,609,643; Japan – 127,103,388; and Philippines – 107,668,231).

     Among the 17 Asian countries analyzed, it is estimated that the average of the age group from 0 through 14
     years of age represents 25% of the entire population. In addition, the average of the age group from 15
     through 24 years of age represents 17.2% of the total population as of July 2014.

     Generally, the population of the 17 targeted Asian countries is very young. However, in 3 developed
     countries, there is a smaller average percentage of young people between 15 and 24 years of age (Japan –
     13.2%; Republic of Korea – 14.1%; and Singapore – 13.4%).

     A.2. Data related to the use of ICTs

     Data related to the use of ICTs by the 17 Asian countries analyzed indicates that the level of economic
     development in each country may affect the availability of ICTs.

     Four developed countries (Brunei Darussalam, Japan, Republic of Korea, and Singapore), in general, enjoy
     higher levels of Internet access at home and as individual Internet users than developing countries. Overall,
     mobile-broadband subscriptions are more affordable in developed countries than in developing countries –
     with the exception of Brunei Darussalam. Accordingly, the legal framework to deal with offenses against
     children through the use of ICTs in these 4 developed countries show favorable or moderate alignment with
     relevant international standards, as compared to other developing countries in the Asian region, as
     discussed below (VIII. Conclusion and Recommendations, A. Conclusion).

           A.2.a. Individuals using the Internet

           Among 16 of the Asian countries analyzed (excluding the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea 31), it is
           estimated that the average percentage of individuals using the Internet represents 37.5% of the total
           population. In addition, it is estimated that among the 4 developed countries, the average percentage of
           individual Internet users is 77.1%. The average percentage of individual Internet users for the 12
           developing countries is 24.3%.

           A.2.b. Mobile-broadband subscriptions per 100 inhabitants

           The average of the mobile-broadband subscriptions per 100 inhabitants for 16 Asian countries analyzed
           (excluding the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea 32) is 34.9.

          The average of the mobile-broadband subscriptions per 100 inhabitants for the 3 developed countries
          (Japan, Republic of Korea, and Singapore) is 120.3. The average of the mobile-broadband subscriptions
          per 100 inhabitants for 12 developing countries is 16.0. Although Brunei Darussalam, for the purposes of
          this Regional Study, can be classified as a developed country due to its high income based on the GNI
          per capita per year, the mobile-broadband subscriptions per 100 inhabitants of Brunei Darussalam is
          6.5, which is lower than the average of mobile-broadband subscriptions per 100 inhabitants for the 12
          developing countries, as well as that for all of the 16 Asian countries analyzed (excluding the Democratic
          People’s Republic of Korea).

          A.2.c. Households with Internet access at home

          The average percentage of households with Internet access at home for 15 Asian countries analyzed
          (with the exception of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Timor-Leste 33) is 37.8%. It is
          estimated that the average percentage of households with Internet access at home for 4 developed
          countries is 86.5%. However, the average percentage of households with Internet access at home for 11
          developing countries is 20.1%.

B. SIMILARITIES OF THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

Similarities in the legislative and regulatory responses to violence against children using ICTs, among the 17
Asian countries analyzed, may provide opportunities for the adoption of harmonized legal and regulatory tools
to address such violence in the region. Accordingly, similarities between the legal and regulatory measures
adopted by these countries in terms of prevention and combat of crimes against children using ICTs may also
facilitate broader international cooperation.

     B.1. Obscenity Regimes

     All of the 17 Asian countries analyzed criminalize the production and distribution of child pornography or
     obscene materials (or pornography) in general under their domestic law. With the exception of Timor Leste,
     the other 16 countries have enacted obscenity regimes that may also be applicable to child pornography
     offenses, regardless of the enactment of legislation specific to child pornography as stated below (V.
     Analysis of the legislative responses to crimes against children in alignment with relevant international
     instruments, A. Legislation regarding child pornography, A.1. Legislation specific to child pornography). The
     Penal Code of Timor-Leste addresses only child pornography offenses.

     B.2. Internet Content Control

     Among the countries analyzed, in 12 (Brunei Darussalam, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Lao People’s
     Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Philippines, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam), primary
     responsibility for controlling online content is vested with ISPs and/or Internet Content Providers in
     accordance with domestic law and/or regulation. Furthermore, in the case of Cambodia, cybercafés have a
     duty to prohibit their users from accessing any websites with pornographic or obscene materials pursuant to
     the provisions of the Circular on Preventive Measures related to Internet Café Service issued by the

33
   There are no reliable data issued by the ITU concerning Internet access at home in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Timor-Leste as of
2013. See Country Profile, D.P.R. Korea, http://www.itu.int/net4/itu-d/icteye/CountryProfile.aspx#AsiaPacific; Country Profile, Timor-Leste, ITU,

                                                                        12
    Cambodian Government. In those 13 countries, information containing content which is obscene,
    pornographic, or harmful to a child or a juvenile (such as child pornography, sexual exploitation of a child) is
    classified as “prohibited online contents” under their domestic law, regulation, notification, or Codes of
    Practice.

    Under domestic law or regulation adopted by 13 countries, Internet Content Providers or owners/operators
    of cybercafés must take necessary measures to prohibit their users from engaging in activities involving
    information with harmful content (i.e., through installing filtering systems, reporting suspected or
    discovered incidents to relevant authorities, adopting technical measures to prevent further transmission of
    illegal content, and blocking websites that host such illegal content). Additionally, ISPs, Internet Content
    Providers, or cybercafé owners/operators may be held liable if prohibited content is made available using
    their services or is made available to children using a public computer at their business establishment,
    unless it is proven that they have exercised due diligence or there are significant technical difficulties in
    detecting suspected cases in advance and/or preventing the further transmission of prohibited contents on
    their own networks or facilities.

    In cases where countries do not have legislation and/or regulations that specifically address ICT-facilitated
    offenses against children, legal and/or regulatory approaches that require ISPs and other relevant actors to
    control content harmful to children on the Internet do not eliminate the need for adoption of specific
    legislative and regulatory measures to deal with offenses against children committed through the use of
    ICTs. These approaches may, however, reduce the availability of materials with content that is harmful to
    children including, but not limited to child pornography.

    In addition, if countries have legislation and/or regulation that specifically deals with crimes against children
    committed with the use of ICTs, the role of ISPs and relevant actors to control harmful content on the
    Internet contributes to preventing the occurrence of such crimes in advance (i.e., filtering) and/or facilitating
    the investigation and prosecution of ICT-facilitated crimes against children by enabling relevant law
    enforcement agencies or officers to be informed of the occurrence of such crime (i.e., reporting). 34

    The role of ISPs and other relevant actors in relation to the control of Internet content is further discussed in
    Appendix B (Table 2 – Individual Country Information).

V. ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATIVE RESPONSES TO CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN IN ALIGNMENT WITH
   RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL INSTRUMENTS

A. LEGISLATION REGARDING CHILD PORNOGRAPHY

         A.1. Legislation specific to child pornography

         Article 34 of the CRC requires States Parties to take all appropriate measures to protect children from all
         forms of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse, including measures to prevent the exploitative use of children
         in pornographic performances and materials.

         In addition, Article 3 (1) (c) of the OPSC mandates States Parties to criminalize acts related to child
         pornography, whether committed domestically or transnationally, on an individual or organized basis.

         Furthermore, Articles 1 and 3 (b) of the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No. 182) require
         States Parties to take immediate and effective measures to secure the prohibition and elimination of the
         use, procuring, or offering of a child for the production of pornography or for pornographic performance.

         Moreover, the Plan of Action of the Pact of Rio de Janeiro calls on States to criminalize the production,
         distribution, receipt, and possession of child pornography.

         This part of the Regional Study (V. Analysis of the legislative responses to crimes against children in
         alignment with relevant international instruments, A. Legislation regarding child pornography, A.1.
         Legislation specific to child pornography) reviews domestic law that specifically criminalizes activities related
         to child pornography. Labor legislation that simply bans the “worst forms of child labor”, among which is
         child pornography, without specifying criminal offenses and criminal penalties, is not considered as
         “legislation specific to child pornography.” The same is true for national legislation that defines “sexual
         exploitation” or “sexual abuse” to include child pornography (usually in the child protection law) but, once
         again, does not enumerate criminal offenses and criminal penalties. 35

         Moreover, a country in which there is a general ban on pornography, regardless of whether the individuals
         being depicted are adults or children, is not considered to have “legislation specific to child pornography”,
         unless there is also a sentencing enhancement provided for pornography offenses committed against
         children. 36

         For the purposes of addressing this part of the Regional Study (V. Analysis of the legislative responses to
         crimes against children in alignment with relevant international instruments, A. Legislation regarding child
         pornography, A.1. Legislation specific to child pornography), the term “child pornography” includes, but is
         not limited to, any representation, by whatever means, of a child engaged in real or simulated explicit sexual
         activities or any representation of the sexual parts of a child for primarily sexual purposes (Article 2 (c) of the
         OPSC), as well as the use of a child to create such a representation. 37

     Among the 17 Asian countries analyzed:
       • 16 countries (Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Lao People’s Democratic
           Republic, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Philippines, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Thailand, Timor-
           Leste, and Vietnam) are considered to have legislation specific to child pornography; and
       • 1 country (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) has not yet enacted legislation with specific
           regard to child pornography as of November 22, 2014, although its Criminal Law 2012 criminalizes
           activities involving objects that reflect decadent, carnal, or foul content.

            Brunei Darussalam
             The principal legislation specific to child pornography is the Penal Code (amended by the Penal Code
             Amendment Order 2012).

                 The Penal Code also contains provisions punishing any person who commits obscenity offenses,
                 which may also govern child pornography related crimes.

            Cambodia
             The primary law that criminalizes child pornography offenses, as well as pornography offenses, is
             the Law on Suppression of Human Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation (also referred to as “LSHTSE”)
             (passed by the National Assembly on December 20, 2007 and approved in its entirety by the Senate

             pornographic material for profit and dissemination of pornography without the aim of profit,
             regardless of whether the individuals being depicted in pornography are adults or children.
             Dissemination of pornographic material to a minor under the age of 18 years attracts more severe
             punishment.

                 Furthermore, the production, duplication, publication, sale, or dissemination of pornographic
                 material for profit and the dissemination of pornographic materials as stipulated in Article 363,
                 paragraph 1 and Article 364, paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, encompasses such activities as the
                 production, duplication, publication, sale, or dissemination of child pornography pursuant to Judicial
                 Interpretations 2004 and 2010. 38, 39

                 Article 6 of Judicial Interpretation 2004 criminalizes the use of the Internet or mobile
                 communication terminals and voicemail platforms to produce, reproduce, publish, sell, or
                 disseminate obscene electronic information concretely depicting sexual acts by minors not having
                 reached 18 years of age with a severe penalty in accordance with the provisions of Article 363,

               million to 500 million rupiah, or both.

               In addition, the Criminal Code punishes any person who engages in activities related to a writing of
               which the person knows the content, or a portrait or object known to the person to be offensive
               against decency. 40

           activities involving items advertising pornography, regardless of whether the individuals being
           depicted are adults or children. The Criminal Code further articulates that when any person commits
           such pornography offense by the use of violence against a minor, that person shall be subject to a
           heightened penalty.

              Moreover, the Law Combating Pornography and Prostitution (enacted in 1998 and last amended in
              2012) (also known as “Law against Pornography and Prostitution”) (hereafter also referred to as

                                              18
        A.2. Existence of a clear definition of child pornography

        Article 2 (c) of the OPSC defines the term “child pornography” as any representation, by whatever means, of
        a child engaged in real or simulated explicit sexual activities or any representation of the sexual parts of a
        child for primarily sexual purposes.

        Furthermore, Article 9 (2) (a) of the Convention on Cybercrime stipulates that the term “child pornography”
        shall include pornographic material that visually depicts a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct.

        In addition, the Plan of Action of the Pact of Rio de Janeiro calls on States to adopt a clear definition of child
        pornography in accordance with international standards.

        To be considered a country with a clear definition of child pornography, such country shall have a provision
        under domestic legislation that provides a definition of child pornography in accordance with international
        instruments as discussed above. The definition should include, at a minimum, the visual representation or
        depiction of a child engaged in a (real or simulated) sexual display, act, or performance. 42

        Additionally, there may be words or phrases within a definition of “child pornography” that require further
        explanation. For example, terms such as “simulated sexual conduct,” “sexually explicit conduct,” “lewd,
        obscene and lascivious exhibition of the genitals”, and “sexual display, act, or performance” are all deserving
        of definitions. Moreover, it is imperative that, with the advent of the Internet and associated technology,
        mention be made of all the forms child pornography can take including, but not limited to, film, DVD, CD‐
        ROM, diskette, CD‐R, and other electronic media. 43

        Among the 17 Asian countries analyzed:
          • 5 countries (Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Japan, Philippines, and Republic of Korea) provide a clear
              definition of “child pornography” under their legal systems;
          • 2 countries (India and Timor-Leste) have domestic laws that can possibly be deemed to provide a
              definition of “child pornography” in any form;
          • 1 country (Indonesia) provides a definition of “child pornography” in the elucidation of the law, in
              addition to defining “pornography” by law;
          • 3 countries (China, Myanmar, and Singapore) provide a definition of “pornographic materials” or
              “obscene objects” under their domestic laws; and
          • 6 countries (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Malaysia,
              Mongolia, Thailand, and Vietnam) provide neither a definition of “child pornography” nor
              “pornographic/obscene objects” under their domestic legislation.

        In the case of Indonesia, the term “pornography” is defined as “any sexual material that is made by humans
        in the form of a picture, sketch, illustration, photo, text, sounds, moving picture, animations, cartoon,
        conversation, gestures, or other forms of messages through various forms of communication media and/or
        public performance, which contain obscenity or exploitation and violates sexual morality in society”
        pursuant to Article 1, point 1 of the Anti-Pornography Law. 44 Furthermore, the elucidation of Article 4,

     paragraph (1), letter f of the Anti-Pornography Law defines the term “child pornography” as any form of
     pornography that involves children or involves adults performing or acting as children.

     In respect of Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Laotian law does not provide a clear definition of child
     pornography. However, child pornographic materials include films, magazines, photographs, videos, VCDs,
     DVDs, and other items depicting child pornography pursuant to Article 86 of the Law on the Protection of
     Rights and Interests of Children.

             such interpretation includes child pornography made by electronic means. 45

            Cambodia
             Article 40 of the Law on Suppression of Human Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation defines “child
             pornography” as a visible material, such as a photograph or videotape, including a material in
             electronic form, depicting a minor’s naked figure, which excites or stimulates sexual desire.

             effective as of July 15, 2014), the term “child pornography” is defined as “photographs, recording
             media containing electromagnetic records or any other medium which depicts the pose of a child,
             which falls under any of the following items, in a visible way: (i) any pose of a child engaged in sexual
             intercourse or any conduct similar to sexual intercourse; (ii) any pose of a child having his or her
             genital organs touched by another person or of a child touching another person’s genital organs,
             which arouses or stimulates the viewer’s sexual desire; (iii) any pose of a child wholly or partially
             naked, which deliberately exposes or emphasizes sexual parts (genital organs, parts around genital
             organs, buttocks, or chest), and arouses or stimulates the viewer's sexual desire”.

                In addition, Article 2 (3) of this Act stipulates that an “electromagnetic record” is any record that is
                produced by electronic, magnetic, or any other means unrecognizable by natural perceptive
                functions and used for data-processing by a computer.

           A.2.b. Country that is possibly considered to provide a definition of child pornography

            India
             Indian law possibly provides a definition of child pornography as elaborated below.

                 Section 13 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act indicates that “child pornography
                 in any form” is “any form of media” that “uses a child” for the purposes of sexual gratification, as
                 well as includes: (a) any representation of the sexual organs of a child; (b) any representation of a
                 child engaged in real or simulated sexual acts (with or without penetration); (c) any indecent or
                 obscene representation of a child. The term “child pornography in any form” is also referred to as
                 “pornographic material in any form involving a child” under Section 15 of this Act that punishes any
                 person who stores such material for commercial purposes.

                 The phrase “any form of media” mentioned in Section 13 of the Protection of Children from Sexual
                 Offenses Act includes programs or advertisements telecast by television channels or on the Internet
                 or any electronic form or printed form. The Explanation to Section 13 of this Act further articulates
                 that the expression “use a child” means involving a child through any medium like print, electronic,
                 computer, or any other technology for preparation, production, offering, transmitting, publishing,
                 facilitation, and distribution of the pornographic material.

                 Pursuant to Section 67B of the IT Act, “child pornography in electronic form” includes any material
                 in any electronic form 47 that: (a) depicts children engaged in a sexually explicit act or conduct; or (b)
                 depicts children in an obscene or indecent or sexually explicit manner. Section 67B of the IT Act
                 criminalizes prescribed activities related to such materials.
46
   According to Article 2, subparagraph 4 of the Act on the Protection of Children and Juveniles from Sexual Abuse , the term “purchasing child or juvenile
sex” refers to doing any of the following acts to a child or juvenile or compelling them to do such an act, in return for offering or promising to offer money
and valuables or other property gains, services or convenience to those who arrange the purchase of child or juvenile sex, or those who actually protect
and supervise the child or juvenile, or any other person: (a) sexual intercourse; (b) pseudo-sexual intercourse using parts of the body, such as the mouth
and anus, or implements; (c) touching or exposing the whole or part of the body, which causes sexual humiliation or repugnance of ordinary people; (d)
masturbation.
47
  The IT Act provides a definition of “electronic form” referred to in Section 67B of this Act. According to Section 2 (1) (r) of the IT Act, the term “electronic
form”, with reference to the term “information”, means any information generated, sent, received or stored in media, magnetic, optical, computer
memory, micro film, computer generated microfiche or similar device. Pursuant to Section 2 (1) (v) of the IT Act, the term “information” includes data,
message, text, images, sound, voice, codes, computer programs, software and databases, or micro film or computer generated microfiche.


                                                                               21
                    With respect to defining the term “obscenity” referred to in Section 67B of the IT Act, Section 67 of
                    the IT Act provides which materials may be deemed “obscene” as stated below. Material in any
                    electronic form may be considered obscene if it is lascivious or appeals to the prurient interest or if
                    its effect is, or (where it comprises two or more distinct items) the effect of any one of its items, is, if
                    taken as a whole, such as to tend to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely, having regard to all
                    relevant circumstances, to read, see, or hear the matter contained or embodied in it.

               Timor-Leste
                The Penal Code possibly provides a definition of child pornography as stated below.

                    Article 176 (1) of the Penal Code indicates that “child pornography” in this Code refers to any
                    material which uses, exposes, or represents a minor aged less than 17 years of age performing real
                    or simulated sexual activity or, by any other means, exhibits the sexual activity or sexual organs of a
                    minor for predominantly sexual purposes. Article 176 (2) of the Penal Code criminalizes prescribed
                    activities related to child pornography.

        A.3. Age of a potential victim of activities related to child pornography

        The OPSC does not provide a definition of a “child”, although its Article 2 (c) provides a definition of “child
        pornography”.

        However, Article 1 of the CRC states that a “child”, for the purposes of the present Convention, is every
        human being below the age of 18 years, unless under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained
        earlier. Furthermore, States Parties are required to take all appropriate measures to address the sexual
        exploitation and sexual abuse of children, including measures to prevent the exploitative use of children in
        pornographic performances and materials, pursuant to Article 34 of the CRC.

        In addition, Footnote 1 of the Pact of Rio de Janeiro articulates that throughout the document, the terms
        “child” and “children and adolescents” are used to denote all human beings below the age of 18 years.
        Moreover, the Plan of Action of the Pact of Rio de Janeiro calls on States to criminalize the production,
        distribution, receipt, and possession of child pornography.

        Accordingly, children under the age of 18 are required to receive protection from offenses related to child
        pornography, regardless of the age of consent to sexual activity, which is normally lower, in accordance with
        Article 1 of the CRC and Footnote 1 of the Pact of Rio de Janeiro.

        For the purposes of addressing this part of the Regional Study (V. Analysis of the legislative responses to
        crimes against children in alignment with relevant international instruments, A. Legislation regarding child
        pornography, A.3. Age of a potential victim of activities related to child pornography), the term “child
        pornography” includes, but is not limited to, any representation, by whatever means, of a child engaged in
        real or simulated explicit sexual activities or any representation of the sexual parts of a child for primarily
        sexual purposes (Article 2 (c) of the OPSC), as well as the use of a child to create such a representation. 48

        Among the 16 Asian countries analyzed – all except the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the legal
        system of which is not considered to have legislation specific to child pornography:
            • 11 countries (Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Lao People’s Democratic
               Republic, Malaysia, Philippines, Republic of Korea, and Thailand) consider everyone under the age of
               18 years as a potential victim of activities related to child pornography under their legal systems;
               and
            • 5 countries (Mongolia, Myanmar, Singapore, Timor-Leste, and Vietnam) consider everyone under
               the age of 16 to 17 years as a potential victim of activities related to child pornography under their
               domestic law (Myanmar, Singapore, and Timor-Leste) or there are disparities amongst the
               provisions of their domestic law in terms of a definition of “child” (Mongolia and Vietnam).

               Brunei Darussalam
                Bruneian law considers everyone under 18 years of age as a potential victim of child pornography
                offenses as stipulated in Sections 293A and 293B of the Penal Code, regardless of the age of sexual
                consent pursuant to Section 293C (1) (f) of this Code, which states that “child” means a person
                under the age of 18 years.

                   In Brunei Darussalam, the age of consent to sexual intercourse is 14 years for a female, although
                   sexual intercourse between a man with his own wife who are not under 13 years of age, is not
                   considered rape pursuant to Section 375 of the Penal Code. However, it is a crime for any person to
                   have or attempt to have carnal knowledge of a girl under the age of 16 years, except by way of
                   marriage, according to Section 2 of the Unlawful Carnal Knowledge Act.

               Cambodia
                Article 7 of the Law on Suppression of Human Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation considers everyone
                under the age of 18 years as a potential victim of child pornography as provided in Articles 40 and 41
                of this Law.

                   In Cambodia, the age of consent to sexual intercourse or an indecent act is 15 years for both men
                   and women pursuant to Articles 42 and 43 of the Law on Suppression of Human Trafficking and
                   Sexual Exploitation.

               China
                Chinese law, along with Judicial Interpretation 2004, considers everyone under the age of 18 years
                as a potential victim of activities related to child pornography.

                   Article 364, paragraph 4 of the Criminal Law severely punishes anyone who disseminates
                   pornographic materials to a minor under the age of 18 years as compared to dissemination of such
                   materials to a non-minor stipulated in Article 364, paragraph 1 of this Law. In addition, pursuant to
                   Article 6 of the Judicial Interpretation 2004, those who, with or without the aim of profit, use the
                   Internet or mobile telecommunications terminals to produce, reproduce, sell, publish, or
                   disseminate obscene electronic information concretely depicting sexual acts by minors who have
                   not reached 18 years of age shall be punished severely according to Article 363, paragraph 1 and
                   Article 364, paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. 49

  pornography that explicitly contains child pornography prohibited and punishable by the Anti-
  Pornography Law. Article 1, point 4 of the Anti-Pornography Law defines “children” herein as those
  below 18 years of age.

A.4. Criminal liability of children involved in pornography

The Plan of Action of the Pact of Rio de Janeiro calls on all States to ensure that child victims of sexual
exploitation are not criminalized or punished for crimes committed in the course of their exploitation, but to
give them the status of victims in law.

Moreover, criminal liability must focus on an adult offender, who is responsible for the exploitation of a
child and on the crimes he/she committed against that child. Accordingly, it is important to analyze the


                                                   25
minimum age for criminal responsibility under domestic law as countries may punish child offenders
involved in pornography because they are criminally liable.

16 targeted Asian countries – all except Timor-Leste whose Penal Code only deals with child pornography
offenses – govern crimes involving pornography or obscenity under their domestic law (whether Criminal
Codes/Penal Codes or special laws) as stated above (V. Analysis of the legislative responses to crimes against
children in alignment with relevant international instruments, A. Legislation regarding child pornography,
A.1. Legislation specific to child pornography). All of these 16 countries also address the minimum age for
criminal responsibility under their domestic law (whether Criminal Codes/Penal Codes or special laws).

Among the 16 Asian countries that criminalize obscenity or pornography offenses under their legal systems:
  • 1 country (Cambodia) has a law that does not address the criminal responsibility of children under
      18 years old for all crimes in cases of both child offenders and child victims;
  • 1 country (Philippines) has enacted legislation that does not punish child offenders under the age of
      18 years under prescribed circumstances and does not punish child victims involved in all crimes
      under its law; and
  • 14 countries (Brunei Darussalam, China, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, India, Indonesia,
      Japan, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Republic of Korea,
      Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam) do not address the criminal liability of children involved in
      pornography in cases of child victims, not child offenders.

     Cambodia
      Cambodian law does not address the criminal liability of children involved in pornography for their
      participation in the case of child victims as well as child offenders. Although pornography offenses
      are specified by Articles 38 and 39 of the Law on Suppression of Human Trafficking and Sexual
      Exploitation, the legal age for criminal responsibility in Cambodia starts at 18 years of age pursuant
      to Article 38 of the Criminal Code.

     Philippines
      Philippine law does not address the criminal liability of children involved in pornography as victims.
      Sections 18 and 19 of the Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009, however, address mandatory services
      and programs for victims of child pornography.

        In the case of child offenders, the minimum age of criminal liability in the Philippines shall be
        addressed by Republic Act 9344, an Act Establishing a Comprehensive Juvenile Justice and Welfare
        System, Creating the Juvenile Justice and Welfare Council under the Department of Justice,
        Appropriating Funds Therefor and For Other Purposes (also known as “Juvenile Justice and Welfare
        Act of 2006”), as amended by Republic Act No. 10630, An Act Strengthening the Juvenile Justice
        System in the Philippines, amending for the purpose of Republic Act No. 9344, otherwise known as
        “Juvenile Justice and Welfare Act of 2006” and Appropriating Funds Therefor (also known as the
        “Act Establishing a Comprehensive Juvenile Justice and Welfare System, Creating the Juvenile justice
        and Welfare Council under the Department of Social Welfare and Development, Appropriating
        Funds Therefor, and for Other Purposes”) (hereafter referred to as “Republic Act No. 9344, as
        amended by Republic Act No. 10630”).

        According to Section 6 of the Republic Act No. 9344, as amended by Republic Act No. 10630, a child
        15 years of age or under at the time of the commission of the offense shall be exempt from criminal
        liability. Section 6 of the Republic Act No. 9344, as amended by Republic Act No. 10630, further

                                                   26
           articulates that a child over 15 years of age, but below 18 years of age, shall be exempt from
           criminal liability and be subjected to an intervention program, unless he/she has acted with
           discernment, in which case, such child shall be subjected to the appropriate proceedings in
           accordance with this Act.

   distributing, disseminating, importing, exporting, offering, selling or possessing child pornography for the
   purpose of production, distribution, dissemination, import, export, offer, or sale”.

   Furthermore, Article 9 of the Convention on Cybercrime requires each party to adopt legislative and other
   measures to criminalize the following acts under its domestic law, when committed intentionally and
   without right: a) producing child pornography for the purpose of its distribution through a computer system;
   b) offering, making available, distributing, or transmitting child pornography through a computer system;
   and c) possessing child pornography in a computer system or on a computer-data storage medium.

   16 countries out of the 17 countries reviewed (excluding Timor-Leste which has a Penal Code that only
   addresses child pornography offenses) have enacted obscenity regimes that may also be applicable to child
   pornography offenses, regardless of the enactment of legislation specific to child pornography, as stated
   above (V. Analysis of the legislative responses to crimes against children in alignment with relevant
   international instruments, A. Legislation regarding child pornography, A.1. Legislation specific to child
   pornography). In addition, 17 Asian countries criminalize the production and distribution of materials with
   child pornography or obscenity/pornography in general under their domestic law as enumerated below.

   For the purposes of addressing this part (V. Analysis of the legislative responses to crimes against children in
   alignment with relevant international instruments, B. Punishment of conducts related to child pornography,
   B.1. Production, distribution, dissemination, importation, exportation, offer, sale, and possession of child
   pornography), in cases where a country has provisions criminalizing child pornography and pornography
   offenses respectively under its domestic law (whether the same law or different laws), provisions that
   specifically apply to child pornography activities shall prevail over provisions that address activities related
   to pornographic or obscene materials. However, if countries do not have provisions under their domestic
   law that explicitly cover all or some of the illicit activities related to child pornography mentioned in Article 3
   (1) (c) of the OPSC, provisions that address pornography or obscenity offenses shall be considered.

   In general, among the 17 Asian countries analyzed:
       • 9 countries (Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Japan, Lao People’s Democratic
           Republic, Philippines, Republic of Korea, and Timor-Leste) have provisions under their domestic law
           that criminalize all or part of the illicit activities in relation to child pornography mentioned in Article
           3 (1) (c) of the OPSC; and
       • 8 countries (China, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar,
           Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam) have provisions under their domestic legislation that punish any
           person who engages in offenses related to obscene objects and/or pornographic materials in
           general, which may also be applicable to child pornography.

B.1.a. Producing child pornography

Article 3 (1) (c) of the OPSC obliges States Parties to criminalize production of child pornography. In
addition, Article 9 (1) (a) of the Convention on Cybercrime requires each party to adopt legislative
measures to make it a criminal offense to produce child pornography for the purpose of its distribution
through a computer system under its domestic law, when committed intentionally and without right.

Concerning the production of child pornography, among the 17 Asian countries analyzed:
• 6 countries (Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Philippines, Republic of Korea,
   and Timor-Leste) have explicit provisions under their domestic law that criminalize the mere
   production of child pornography;
• 2 countries (Brunei Darussalam and India) have provisions under their domestic legislation that
   possibly outlaw producing child pornography, in addition to provisions that explicitly create offenses
   relating to the production of obscene objects for the purposes of the distribution, etc.;
• 1 country (Japan) has a law that addresses criminal offenses and penalties for the production of
   child pornography for the purposes of providing it to others or for the purposes of distribution, etc.;
• 3 countries (China, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, and Mongolia) have legislative measures
   that make it illegal to produce obscene objects, pornography, or decadent objects in general; and
• 5 countries (Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam) criminalize the production of
   obscene objects in general for the purposes of distribution, etc., under their domestic legislation.

There are countries that criminalize acts related to the production of child pornography. In Brunei
Darussalam, according to Section 293B (1) (a) of the Penal Code, any person who “takes” an indecent or
obscene photograph or pseudo-photograph of a child shall be guilty of an offense. In India, Section 67B
(b) of the IT Act makes it illegal to “create” text or digital images depicting children in an obscene or
indecent or sexually explicit manner.

B.1.b. Distributing or disseminating child pornography

Article 3 (1) (c) of the OPSC requires State Parties to criminalize distributing or disseminating child
pornography.

Likewise, according to Article 9 (1) (c) of the Convention on Cybercrime, each party shall adopt such
legislative measures as may be necessary to establish an act of distributing and transmitting child
pornography through a computer system as criminal offenses under its domestic law, when committed
intentionally and without right.

In light of the distribution or dissemination of child pornography, among the 17 Asian countries
analyzed:
• In 9 countries (Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Japan, Lao People’s Democratic
     Republic, Philippines, Republic of Korea, and Timor-Leste), their domestic laws explicitly prescribe
     penalties for offenses involving the distribution or dissemination of child pornography; and
• 8 countries (China, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar,
     Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam) criminalize the distribution or dissemination of pornography in
     general under their domestic law.




                                               28
              Furthermore, regarding the transmission of child pornography, among the 17 Asian countries analyzed:
              • 2 countries (India and Philippines) provide for the punishment of transmitting child pornography;
                  and
              • 1 country (Singapore) criminalizes the transmission of obscene objects in general, which may also
                  encompass child pornography.

              B.1.c. Offering child pornography

              Article 3 (1) (c) of the OPSC obliges States Parties to address an act of offering child pornography.

              In addition, Article 9 (1) (b) of the Convention on Cybercrime requires Each Party to establish a criminal
              offense involving offering or making available child pornography through a computer system under its
              domestic law, when committed without right and intentionally.

              Although the OPSC does not provide which acts can be deemed as “offering child pornography”, for the
              purposes of this Regional Study, the term “offering child pornography” referred to in Article 3 (1) (c) of
              the OPSC will be considered as the proposition, proposal, suggestion, or presentation of child
              pornography, with commercial or non-commercial intent, making it available to others. 50

              However, because the OPSC does not provide an official interpretation of the term “offer” in relation to
              child pornography, it is acknowledged that there may be differences between countries with domestic
              law that explicitly uses the terms “offer”, “provision” or “make available” in relation to child
              pornography, and countries with domestic law that does not use such terms explicitly.

              Article 9 (1) (b) of the Convention on Cybercrime criminalizes “offering” child pornography through a
              computer system, when committed intentionally and without right. Furthermore, Explanatory Report 95
              to the Convention on Cybercrime provides that “offering” child pornography through a computer system
              is intended to cover soliciting others to obtain child pornography and implies that the person offering
              the material can actually provide it. Moreover, Explanatory Report 95 to the Convention on Cybercrime
              articulates that “making available” is intended to cover the placing of child pornography online for the
              use of others, e.g., by means of creating child pornography sites. It also encompasses the creation or
              compilation of hyperlinks to child pornography sites in order to facilitate access to child pornography. 51

              In relation to offering child pornography, among the 17 Asian countries analyzed:
              • 6 countries (Brunei Darussalam 52, Indonesia, Japan, Philippines, Republic of Korea, and Timor-Leste)
                   explicitly enumerate criminal offenses and penalties for offering or providing child pornography
                   under their domestic law;
              • 4 countries (India, Malaysia, Myanmar, and Singapore) explicitly make it an offense to offer to do
                   activities related to obscene objects under their Penal Codes, which may also cover an act of
                   offering to commit conducts involving child pornography; 53

   In Brunei Darussalam, in the context of criminalizing acts related to obscene articles in general, Section 292 of the Penal Code has the same language as
the Penal Codes of India, Malaysia, Myanmar, and Singapore. However, Section 293B of the Bruneian Penal Code explicitly criminalizes offering an
indecent or obscene photograph of a child for acquisition by another person. Thus, Brunei Darussalam is classified within the group of countries that
explicitly criminalize offering child pornography.


                                                                               29
           •     2 countries (Cambodia and Lao People’s Democratic Republic) criminalize other acts constituting
                 making available child pornography, although the provisions under their domestic laws do not use
                 explicit terms, such as offering, providing, or making available;
           •     3 countries (China, Thailand, and Vietnam) criminalize other acts constituting making available
                 pornographic, obscene, or decadent objects in general, although the provisions under their
                 domestic law do not use explicit terms, such as offering, providing, or making available; and
           •     2 countries (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Mongolia) do not have explicit or relevant
                 provisions addressing the acts of offering, providing, or making available child pornography, or
                 pornography in general, under their legal systems.

           The form of “making available” child pornography can include, but is not limited to, the following act
           based on synonyms of “making available”: a) display or publicly display; b) publish; c) circulate; or d)
           spread. Among the countries that do not have explicit terms, such as “offer”, “provide”, or “make
           available” in relation to the criminalization of child pornography or pornography in general, Cambodia
           and Lao People’s Democratic Republic explicitly criminalize the display or public display of child
           pornography under their domestic law. Furthermore, China outlaws the publication of pornographic
           material for the purposes of profit under its Criminal Law. Moreover, Thailand’s Penal Code makes it
           illegal, in order to assist trading of obscene materials, etc. to propagate or spread the news that such
           obscene materials may be obtained from any person or by any means. In Vietnam, the Penal Code
           covers acts of circulating decadent objects or debauched cultural products, for the purposes of
           dissemination, etc.

           It is also important to note that in 5 countries (Brunei Darussalam, India, Malaysia, Myanmar, and
           Singapore), Section 292 of their Penal Codes explicitly makes it illegal to “in any manner” put into
           circulation obscene objects or articles.

           B.1.d. Importing, exporting, or selling child pornography

           Article 3 (1) (c) of the OPSC stipulates that the act of importing, exporting, or selling child pornography
           shall constitute a criminal offense. It is important to note that, amongst the chain of action to
           commercialize child pornography, Article 3 (1) (c) of the OPSC does not require States Parties to
           criminalize the conduct of buying child pornography from domestic individuals or legal persons, as long
           as such act is committed for personal use (without taking any further actions constituting selling,
           exporting, offering, disseminating, or distributing the purchased child pornography). However, Article 3
           (1) (c) of the OPSC does oblige State Parties to criminalize the conducts of buying child pornography
           from foreign persons or legal entities (importing it) and selling child pornography domestically (selling it)
           or internationally (exporting it).

           In respect of the importation and exportation of child pornography, among the 17 Asian countries
           analyzed:
           • 5 countries (Indonesia, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Philippines, Republic of Korea, and Timor-
               Leste) criminalize the importation and exportation of child pornography without the intent to
               distribute, etc. pursuant to their domestic legislation;

53
   In four countries (India, Malaysia, Myanmar, and Singapore), while not specific to child pornography, Section 292 of their respective Penal Codes
criminalize offering to do any of the following: a) sell, let to hire, distribute, publicly exhibit, or in any manner put into circulation obscene objects; b) for
purposes of sale, hire, distribution, public exhibition or circulation, make, produce, possess, import, export etc. the obscene objects; or c) advertise or
make known where to procure the obscene objects.


                                                                               30
             •     2 countries (Cambodia and Japan) punish those who import and export child pornography for the
                   purposes of distribution, etc. under their domestic law; and
             •     8 countries (Brunei Darussalam, China, India, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Singapore, and
                   Thailand) have provisions that penalize any person who commits the offenses involving importing
                   and/or exporting obscene objects in general for profit or for the purposes of distribution, etc. or
                   regardless of such purposes as mentioned above.

             However, unlike the countries discussed above, in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Article
             183 of Criminal Law 2012 only criminalizes importing decadent objects, etc.

             In addition, the Penal Code of Vietnam does not specify criminal penalties for importing and exporting
             debauched cultural products. However, Pursuant to Article 12, Clause 3, Point c of Decree
             No.91/2011/ND-CP, a fine of between VND 15,000,000 and 20,000,000, as a form of administrative
             sanction, shall be imposed for importing toys or games that promote pornography.

             Additionally, with respect to the sale of child pornography, among the 17 Asian countries analyzed:
             • 6 countries (Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Philippines, Republic of Korea,
                and Timor-Leste) create offenses relating to the sale of child pornography under their domestic law;
             • 8 countries (Brunei Darussalam, India, Japan, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Singapore, and
                Thailand) prescribe the offense of the sale of obscene objects or pornography in general under their
                domestic law; and
             • 2 countries (China and Vietnam) have provisions under their domestic laws criminalizing the sale of
                pornographic material or debauched cultural products for the purposes of profit or dissemination,
                etc.

             The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea does not address the sale of decadent objects under its
             Criminal Law 2012.

             In the respect of Thailand, Section 287 (2) of the Penal Code punishes any person who carries on the
             “trade” of or participates in the “trade” of obscene materials or things outlined in Section 287 (1) of this
             Code. Also, as regards Indonesia, Article 29 of the Anti-Pornography Law punishes any person who
             “trades” pornography that explicitly contains child pornography as referred to in Article 4, paragraph (1),
             letter f of this Law. Considering that the term “trade” can be defined as the action of buying and selling
             goods and services, 54 the Thai and Indonesian legal systems can be deemed to criminalize the sale of
             obscene or pornographic materials in general, which may also govern the sale of child pornographic
             items.

             B.1.e. Possession of child pornography

             Interpreted strictly, Article 3 (1) (c) of the OPSC obliges States Parties to criminalize the possession of
             child pornography only when this possession is “for the above purposes” of producing, distributing,
             disseminating, importing, exporting, offering, or selling. The United Nations Committee on the Rights of
             the Child has nevertheless encouraged countries to prohibit the simple possession of child

              pornography. 55 Accordingly, special attention is given to the countries that criminalize mere possession
              of child pornography without the intent to distribute.

              Based on the text of Article 3 (1) (c) of the OPSC as stated above, countries which criminalize possession
              with intent to distribute, etc. as well as countries that criminalize mere possession (possession without
              the intent to distribute), are considered to comply with the OPSC.

              With respect to the possession of child pornography, among the 17 Asian countries analyzed:
              • 7 countries (Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Japan, Philippines, Republic of Korea, and
                 Timor-Leste) criminalize the possession of child pornography without the intent to distribute, etc. or
                 possession of child pornography for the purposes of distribution, etc., or both; 56
              • 1 country (India) specifies punishment for storing pornographic material in any form involving a child
                 for commercial purposes and possessing any obscene objects for the purposes of distribution, etc.; 57
              • 4 countries (Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore 58, and Thailand) make it an offense to possess obscene
                 objects in general with the intent to distribute under their Penal Code;
              • 1 country (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) punishes any person who illegally keeps decadent
                 objects under its domestic law; and
              • 4 countries (China, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Mongolia, and Vietnam) do not criminalize
                 the possession of child pornography or pornography in general, regardless of the intent to
                 distribute, under their domestic law.

              Regarding Mongolia, the Criminal Code does not criminalize possession of child pornography or
              pornography in general. However, according to Article 5.2 of the Law Combating Pornography and
              Prostitution Act, storing items advertising pornography for the purposes of distribution, etc. shall be
              prohibited. A first-time breach referred to in Article 5.2 of this Law shall be subject to a fine and
              confiscation of articles related to pornography as forms of administrative sanctions pursuant to Article
              13.2.4 of this Law. If a breach referred to in Article 5.2 of this Law has been repeated within a year, it
              constitutes a criminal offense pursuant to Article 13.1 of the same Law.

              Concerning Vietnam, the Penal Code explicitly punishes any person who stockpiles debauched cultural
              products for the purposes of dissemination. However, considering that the term “stockpile” can be
              defined as acts of accumulating a large stock of (goods or materials), 59 it evokes an image of a larger
              quantity of material than the term “possession”. Thus, the term “stockpile” has a different meaning than

http://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/optional_protocol_eng.pdf.
56
  Amongst these seven countries, one country (Indonesia) only criminalizes possession of child pornography unless authorized by the law; one country
(Cambodia) only punishes any person who possesses child pornography for the purposes of distribution, etc.; four countries (Brunei Darussalam, Japan,
Philippines, and the Republic of Korea) criminalize both simple possession of child pornography (A) and possession of child pornography for the purposes
of distribution, etc. (B) while the penalty for B shall be higher than that for A; and one country (Timor-Leste) provides the same punishment for possessing
child pornography for predominantly sexual purposes and possessing child pornography with the aim of dissemination.
57
   Section 15 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act punishes any person who stores any pornographic material in any form involving a
child for commercial purposes. Furthermore, while not specific to child pornography, Section 292 (2) (a) of the Penal Code criminalizes “possession” of any
obscene objects for the purpose of hire, sale, distribution, or public exhibition/public circulation, etc.
58
  In Singapore, Section 30 of the Films Act punishes any person who has in his possession any obscene film knowing or having reasonable cause to believe
the film to be obscene shall be guilty of an offense and, on conviction, shall be liable to a fine of $1,000 for each such film in his possession (but not to
exceed in the aggregate $40,000) or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both. However, Section 292 (1) (a) of the Penal Code
makes it an offense to possess obscene objects with the intent to distribute with the punishment of an imprisonment for a term which may extend to 3
months, or with a fine, or with both.

           Japan
            Possession of child pornography without the intent to distribute is a crime in Japan following the
            recent amendment of the Child Pornography Prohibiting Act (last amended in June 2014 and
            effective as of July 15, 2014). In the case of possessing child pornography for the purposes of
            providing it to others or distribution, etc., the offender will be subject to heavier punishment than
            for the mere possession of it.

                Prior to this amendment, only the possession of child pornography for the purposes of providing it
                to others or for distribution constituted a criminal offense under the Japanese legal framework.

                Under the Child Pornography Prohibiting Act (last amended in June 2014 and effective as of July 15,
                2014), there is a one-year moratorium on punishment for possessing child pornography prescribed
                in Article 7 (1) of this Act in order to give possessors the time to discard of it. 60

     B.2. Production, distribution, and possession of child pornography, including virtual images and the
     sexually exploitative representation of children, as well as the commercialization

     The Plan of Action of the Pact of Rio de Janeiro calls on States to criminalize the production, distribution,
     possession, and commercialization of child pornography including virtual images and sexually exploitative
     representations of children that do not necessarily use real children in their production (also referred to as
     “virtual child pornography”).

     The Special Rapporteur encourages the Committee on the Rights of the Child to reaffirm that the scope of
     Article 34 of the CRC should be interpreted to include an absolute prohibition on “pseudo-child
     pornography” including “morphing” of child and adult bodies to create virtual child pornographic images,
     after arguing that the Internet renders the traditional legal definition of child pornography, namely the
     visual depiction or use of a child for pornographic purposes, outdated. 61

     Virtual child pornography can be divided into two types including: a) wholly computer-generated child
     pornography; and b) morphed child pornography. In a broad sense, c) child pornography made by using
     youthful-looking adults can be also added as a kind of virtual child pornography. 62

     Wholly computer-generated child pornography refers to visual depictions of child abuse that can be found in
     certain comics, animations, video games, cartoons, etc. and is made with computer-generated images,
     without using any actual children or photos of actual children. Morphed child pornography refers to

     morphed images where the image of a real child is superimposed on the image of an adult to portray child
     sexual abuse. Morphed child pornography is made with photos of actual children manipulated into an
     unidentifiable minor. Child pornography made by using youthful-looking adults refers to pornographic
     images which depict a person appearing to be a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct. 63

     Among the 17 Asian countries analyzed:
       • 1 country (Philippines) has legislation that explicitly criminalizes illicit activities related to child
           pornography including virtual images of children and sexually exploitative representations of
           children;
       • 3 countries (Brunei Darussalam, India, and Republic of Korea) possibly criminalize the production,
           distribution, commercialization, and possession of child pornography including virtual images and
           sexually exploitative representations of children under their domestic legislation;
       • 1 country (Indonesia 64) possibly criminalizes activities related to child pornography, including virtual
           images and sexually exploitative representations of children, by the law, in combination with the
           elucidation of the law;
       • 1 country (Singapore) has law that possibly criminalizes obscenity offenses including virtual images
           and sexually exploitative representations of persons;
       • In 4 countries (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Myanmar, and Thailand), their
           domestic law (Penal Code) has provisions criminalizing offenses involving obscene objects or
           decadent objects embracing sexually exploitative representations (i.e., drawings) of persons; and
       • 7 countries (Cambodia, China, Japan, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Mongolia, Timor-Leste, and
           Vietnam) do not have relevant provisions, which explicitly and/or possibly criminalize the
           production, distribution, commercialization, or possession of child pornography or obscene objects
           including virtual images of children and sexually exploitative representations of children.

            In Japan, there were concerns about the infringement of the freedom of expression in the case of
            including cartoons, animations, and games that involve virtual images and sexually exploitative
            representations of children in the definition of child pornography provided under the Child
            Pornography Prohibiting Act. The amendment to revise the Child Pornography Prohibiting Act
            (approved by both the Lower and Upper Houses of Parliament of Japan in June 2014 and effective as of
            July 15, 2014) excluded mention of sexually explicit manga comics, anime video, and computer-
            generated graphics, which was part of a draft amendment bill to revise the Child Pornography
            Prohibiting Act. Thus, the current Child Pornography Prohibiting Act regulates child pornographic
            images depicting real children. 65

which explicitly contains child pornography.
Furthermore, the elucidation of the Anti-Pornography Law stipulates that “child pornography”, referred to in Article 4, paragraph 1, letter f of this Law,
refers to any form of pornography involving children or involving adults who act or behave like a child.

   Furthermore, concerning sexually exploitative representations of children, Section 3 (b) of the Anti-
   Child Pornography Act of 2009 defines “child pornography” as “any representation” of a child
   engaged or involved in real or simulated explicit sexual activities provided that the meaning of
   explicit sexual activity is defined under Section 3 (c) of this Act.

B.2.b. Country that possibly embraces virtual images and sexually exploitative representations of
children related to child pornography offenses under its domestic law

 Brunei Darussalam
  Section 293C (1) (g) of the Penal Code states that the term “pseudo-photograph” in relation to an
  indecent or obscene photograph or pseudo-photograph of a child as mentioned in Sections 293A
  and 293B of this Code shall mean an image, whether made by computer graphics or otherwise,

    B.3. Accessing and viewing of child pornography

    Although the OPSC does not explicitly cover the acts of accessing and viewing of child pornography, the Plan
    of Action of the Pact of Rio de Janeiro calls on States to criminalize accessing and viewing child pornography.

    Additionally, the ECOSOC Resolution 2011/33 urges Member States to specify the deliberate and repeated
    access to websites containing child sexual abuse and exploitation images and viewing this type of content
    stored online as a criminal offense in their legal system.

    Furthermore, Article 20 of the Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and
    Sexual Abuse provides that Each Party shall take the necessary legislative or other measures to criminalize
    knowingly and intentionally obtaining access, through information and communication technologies, to child
    pornography, when committed without right.

    Among the 17 Asian countries analyzed:
    • 3 countries (Brunei Darussalam, India, and Philippines) have explicit provisions that criminalize accessing
      or viewing child pornography under their domestic legislation; and
    • 14 countries (Cambodia, China, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Indonesia, Japan, Lao People’s
      Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Thailand, Timor-
      Leste, and Vietnam) do not have domestic laws that specify punishment for accessing and/or viewing
      child pornography under their laws.

     Brunei Darussalam
      Section 293B (1) (e) of the Penal Code makes it an offense for any person to access an indecent/obscene
      photograph/pseudo-photograph of a child. Pursuant to Section 293B (3) of this Code, for the purposes
      of Section 293B (1) (e) of this Code, a person shall be deemed to have access to an indecent or obscene
      photograph or pseudo-photograph of a child if he knowingly causes himself to view or transmit the
      indecent or obscene photograph or pseudo-photograph of a child.

     India
      Section 67B (b) of the IT Act explicitly criminalizes browsing any material in any electronic form, which
      depicts children in an obscene or indecent or sexually explicit manner.

     Indonesia
      Article 6 of the Anti-Pornography Law prohibits any person from viewing pornography that explicitly
      contains child pornography unless authorized by the Law. Anyone who violates Article 6 of this Law shall
      be punishable with the penalty set forth by Article 32 of the same Law.

     Philippines
      Sections 4 (j) of the Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009 makes it illegal for any person to willfully access
      any form of child pornography. Any person who contravenes Section 4 (j) of this Act shall be subject to
      criminal liability prescribed by Section 15 (g) of the same Act.

C. OBLIGATION TO MAKE CHILD PORNOGRAPHY OFFENSES PUNISHABLE BY APPROPRIATE PENALTIES

Article 3 (1) (c) of the OPSC requires States Parties to create offenses covering acts of producing, distributing,
disseminating, importing, exporting, offering, selling or possessing for the above purposes, child pornography as

                                                        36
defined in its Article 2 (c), whether committed domestically or transnationally, on an individual or organized
basis.

Furthermore, Article 3 (3) of the OPSC stipulates that each State Party shall make such offenses punishable by
appropriate penalties taking into account their grave nature. The range of criminal penalties for committing
child pornography offenses prescribed under the domestic laws of the 17 Asian countries analyzed is broad.
Criminal penalties for committing child pornography offenses involving production, distribution/dissemination,
sale, importation, exportation, offer, or possession of child pornography stipulated in the domestic legislation
among the 17 targeted Asian countries range from three months up to life imprisonment depending on the
country in which such offense took place. 66

In addition, although Article 3 (3) of the OPSC does not provide a basis on which to determine the
appropriateness of criminal penalties for committing child pornography offenses, the Directive 2011/92/EU of
the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2011 on combating the sexual abuse and sexual
exploitation of children and child pornography, and replacing Council Framework Decision 2004/68/JHA 67
(hereafter also referred to as “Directive 2011/92/EU”) provides recommendations for maximum terms of
imprisonment for certain offenses including, but not limited to: a) production; b) distribution/dissemination; c)
offer; and d) possession of child pornography mentioned in Article 3 (1) (c) of the OPSC. 68

For the purposes of addressing this part (V. Analysis of the legislative responses to crimes against children in
alignment with relevant international instruments, C. Obligation to make child pornography offenses punishable
by appropriate penalties), in the event that a country establishes punishment for child pornography and
pornography offenses respectively under its domestic law (whether the same law or different laws), provisions
that specifically address child pornography offenses shall prevail over provisions that apply to pornography or
obscenity offenses. However, if countries do not have provisions under their domestic law that explicitly cover
all or some of the illicit activities in relation to child pornography mentioned in Article 3 (1) (c) of the OPSC,
provisions that are applicable to pornography or obscenity offenses shall be reviewed.

        C.1. Production of child pornography

        All 17 Asian countries analyzed criminalize the production of child pornography or obscene objects (or
        pornography) with or without the intent to distribute, under their domestic law, which may also be
        applicable to child pornography as stated above.

        Article 5, paragraph 6 of the Directive 2011/92/EU stipulates that production of child pornography shall be
        punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of at least three years. Article 5, paragraph 8 of this
        Directive enables Member States to have discretion to choose whether to punish a producer of child
        pornography with or without the intent to disseminate.



66
   Appendix C (Table 3 – Offenses and Penalties) shall provide a summary of provisions under national laws of the 17 Asian countries analyzed
enumerating offenses and specifying penalties/sanctions with respect to the production, distribution/dissemination, importation/exportation, offer, sale,
and possession of child pornography.

        objects in general with imprisonment for a maximum term up to three months under their Penal Codes.

     C.4. Possession of child pornography

     12 countries out of the 17 Asian countries analyzed (Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Japan,
     Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Timor-Leste, and Thailand) – with the
     exception of 5 countries (China, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Lao People’s Democratic Republic,
     Mongolia, and Vietnam) – have provisions under their domestic laws that explicitly criminalize “possession”
     of child pornography or pornographic/obscene objects with and/or without intent to distribute, which may

     Article 5, paragraph 2 of the Directive 2011/92/EU stipulates that possession of child pornography shall be
     punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of at least one year. Article 5, paragraph 8 of this Directive
     allows Member States to use discretion to decide whether to criminalize possession of child pornography
     with or without intent to disseminate.

     Among these 12 countries that explicitly specify criminal penalties for possessing child pornography or
     obscene objects in general:
     • 10 countries (Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Republic of
        Korea, Thailand, and Timor-Leste) criminalize the simple possession of child pornography or possession
        of child pornography, for the purposes of distribution, etc., or both, with imprisonment for maximum
        terms ranging from at least one year (Japan and Republic of Korea) to 17 years and four months
        (Philippines 73); and



71
  In India, Section 67B (a) of the IT Act punishes any person who publishes a material in any electronic form which depicts children engaged in sexually
explicit act or conduct with a penalty of an imprisonment up to 5 years and a fine. However, Section 292 of the Penal Code makes it illegal to offer to do
any act which is offense under this Section with a penalty of imprisonment up to 2 years and a fine.
72
  In the Philippines, any person who offers any form of child pornography in violation of Section 4 (c) of the Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009 shall
punishable by an imprisonment of reclusion temporal in its maximum period and a fine according to Section 15 (b) of this Act. The maximum period of the

           has in his possession obscene objects, with a penalty of imprisonment up to three months under their
           Penal Codes.

Furthermore, Article 9 of the 2011/92/EU recommends that circumstances that aggravate penalties should be
established in the relevant provisions of national law, when: a) the offense was committed by a member of the
child’s family, a person cohabiting with the child, or a person who has abused a recognized position of trust or
authority; b) the offense was committed by several persons acting together; c) the offense was committed
within the framework of a criminal organization; d) the offender has previously been convicted of offenses of
the same nature; e) the offender has deliberately or recklessly endangered the life of the child; or f) the offense
involved serious violence or caused serious harm to the child.

D. COMMITMENT TO ESTABLISH EXTRATERRITORIAL JURISDICTION OVER CHILD PORNOGRAPHY OFFENSES

Article 4 (2) of the OPSC states that each State Party may take such measures as may be necessary to establish
its extraterritorial jurisdiction over the offenses referred to in Article 3 (1) in one of the following cases: (a) when
the alleged offender is a national of that State or a person who has his habitual residence in its territory; or (b)
when the victim is a national of that State.

As stated earlier, Article 3 (1) (c) of the OPSC obliges States Parties to address acts of producing, distributing,
disseminating, importing, exporting, offering, selling, or possessing for the above purposes child pornography as
defined in its Article 2, whether committed domestically or “transnationally”, on an individual or organized
basis.

Among the 17 Asian countries analyzed, 15 countries – with the exception of the Philippines 75 and Singapore 76 –
establish extraterritorial jurisdiction of the State over child pornography offenses, pornography/obscenity
offenses, or both, on the basis of the nationality of the alleged offender or nationality of the victim:
    • 3 countries (Cambodia, Republic of Korea, and Timor-Leste) establish extraterritorial jurisdiction over
        child pornography offenses based on the nationality of the alleged offender or the nationality of the
        victim;
    • 3 countries (Brunei Darussalam, Japan, and Lao People’s Democratic Republic) establish extraterritorial
        jurisdiction over child pornography offenses when the alleged offender is a national of the State;


74
   In Singapore, the simple possession of obscene films shall constitute a criminal offense pursuant to Section 30 of the Films Act. However, Section 292 of
the Penal Code only punishes any person who, for the purpose of distribution, etc. has in his possession any obscene object, etc.
75
  The Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009 does not contain explicit provisions establishing the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the Philippines over child
pornography offenses stipulated in this Act when the alleged offender is a national of the Philippines or when the victim is a national of the Philippines.
However, Section 22 of the Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009 describes the transnational nature of child pornography offenses. Furthermore, Section 23
of this Act prescribes that the Department of Justice (DOJ), in consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), shall endeavor to include child
pornography among the extraditable offenses in future treaties. Further, Section 16 (c) of the same Act articulates that if the offender is a foreigner,
he/she shall be immediately deported after the complete service of his/her sentence and shall forever be barred from entering the country.
76
   Singapore does not establish its extraterritorial jurisdiction over obscenity offenses stipulated in its domestic legislation. However, Singaporean law has
provisions that establish extraterritorial jurisdiction of Singapore over an offense mentioned in Section 376C of the Penal Code (Commercial sex with minor
under 18 outside Singapore) when the alleged offender is a citizen of a permanent resident of Singapore as stated below.
Section 376C (1) of the Penal Code states that “Any person, being a citizen or a permanent resident of Singapore, who does, outside Singapore, any act
that would, if done in Singapore, constitute an offence under section 376B (Commercial sex with minor under 18), shall be guilty of an offence”.
Furthermore, Section 376C (2) of the Penal Code provides that “A person who is guilty of an offence under this section shall be liable to the same
punishment to which he would have been liable had he been convicted of an offence under section 376B”.


                                                                             40
     •     3 countries (China, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, and Thailand) address extraterritorial
           jurisdiction over pornography offenses or obscenity offenses under their domestic laws, which might
           also cover child pornography offenses, based on the nationality of the alleged offender or the
           nationality of the victim; and
     •     6 countries (India 77, Indonesia 78, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, and Vietnam) allow the application of
           the provisions of the Penal Codes or Criminal Codes governing offenses involving debauched cultural
           products or obscene/indecent objects, which might be also applicable to child pornography offenses, in
           cases where the alleged offender is a national of the State.

     D.1. Country that establishes its extraterritorial jurisdiction over child pornography offenses based on the
     nationality of the alleged offender or the nationality of the victim

      Cambodia
       Cambodia establishes its extraterritorial jurisdiction over child pornography offenses: 1) when the
       alleged offender is its citizen; or 2) when a victim is its citizen, upon the commission of the offense
       pursuant to Article 3 of the Law on Suppression of Human Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation. Articles 40
       and 41 of this Law include provisions addressing child pornography offenses.

      Republic of Korea
       The Republic of Korea establishes its extraterritorial jurisdiction over child or juvenile pornography
       offenses prescribed in the Act on the Protection of Children and Juveniles from Sexual Abuse when: 1)
       the alleged offender is its national; or 2) a victim is its national subject to Articles 3, 6, and 8 of the
       Criminal Act.

           Article 3 of the Criminal Act provides that this Act shall apply to all Korean nationals who commit crimes
           outside of the territory of the Republic of Korea. In addition, Article 33 of the Act on the Protection of
           Children and Juveniles from Sexual Abuse states that where criminally prosecuting a Korean citizen who
           commits a sex offense against a child or juvenile outside of the territory of the Republic of Korea,
           pursuant to Article 3 of the Criminal Act, the State shall endeavor to obtain criminal information swiftly
           from the relevant foreign country and punish such offender.

           Moreover, Article 6 of the Criminal Act stipulates that this Act shall apply to aliens who commit crimes,
           other than those specified in the preceding Article, against the Republic of Korea or her nationals
           outside of the territory of the Republic of Korea. Article 6 of the Criminal Act further articulates that this
           shall not apply in cases where such acts under this Act are in effect at the time of the act do not
           constitute a crime, or the prosecution thereof or the execution of the punishment therefor is remitted.

           Furthermore, pursuant to Article 8 of the Criminal Act, the general provisions of this Act (Articles 1-86)
           shall also apply to such crimes as are provided by other Acts and subordinate statutes unless provided
           otherwise by such Acts and subordinate statutes.


77
  In India, regarding offenses involving child pornography in electronic form, Section 75 of the IT Act (Act to apply for offense or contravention committed
outside India) stipulates that the provisions of this Act shall apply to any offense or contravention committed outside India by any person irrespective of
his nationality if the act or conduct constituting the offense or contravention involves a computer, computer system or computer network located in India.
78
  In Indonesia, concerning online sexual exploitation of children, Article 2 of the Electronic Information and Transactions Law articulates that this Law shall
apply to any person who commits legal acts as governed by this Law, both within jurisdiction of Indonesia and outside jurisdiction of Indonesia, having
legal effect within jurisdiction of Indonesia and/or outside jurisdiction of Indonesia and detrimental to the interest of Indonesia. The term “person” in this
Law refers to an individual, whether an Indonesian citizen, foreign citizen, or legal entity pursuant to Article 1 of the same Law.


                                                                             41
 Timor-Leste
  Pursuant to Article 8 of the Penal Code, except as otherwise provided in treaties and conventions,
  Timorese criminal law is applicable to acts prescribed by its Article 176 (Child Pornography) and as long
  as: (a) the perpetrator is found in Timor-Leste and cannot be extradited or a decision has been made not
  to do so; (b) the acts are committed against Timorese nationals, so long as the perpetrator normally
  lives and is found in Timor-Leste; and (c) the acts are committed by a Timorese national or a foreigner
  against Timorese nationals, so long as the perpetrator is found in Timor-Leste, the acts are equally
  punishable by the legislation of the place in which the acts were committed, and they constitute a crime
  that allows for extradition and it cannot, in the particular case, be granted.

    Application of Timorese law shall be subject to the restrictions set forth by Article 9 of the Penal Code.

D.2. Country that establishes its extraterritorial jurisdiction over child pornography offenses only when
the alleged offender is a national of the State

 Brunei Darussalam
  Section 3 of the Penal Code states that any person liable to be tried for an offense committed beyond
  the limits of Brunei Darussalam shall be dealt with according to the provisions of this Code for any act
  committed beyond Brunei Darussalam in the same manner as if such act had been committed within
  Brunei Darussalam. The Court of a Magistrate has jurisdiction over the offense stipulated in Section
  293A of the Penal Code (Possession of indecent photograph of a child) pursuant to the First Schedule to
  the Criminal Procedure Code (Chapter 7) as amended by the Penal Code (Amendment) Order 2012. In
  addition, the High Court has jurisdiction over the offense prescribed in Section 293B of the Penal Code
  (Taking, distribution, showing, advertisement, or access of indecent photograph of a child) according to
  the First Schedule to the Criminal Procedure Code as amended by the Penal Code (Amendment) Order
  2012.

    In addition, Section 7 (f) of the Criminal Procedure Code provides that subject to the provisions of this
    Code, the jurisdiction of the High Court and the Court of a Magistrate in criminal matters shall extend to
    any offense committed by a subject of His Majesty whether the offense was committed within or
    outside of Brunei Darussalam. Also, Section 3 of the Brunei Nationality Act (Chapter 15) further
    articulates that a subject of His Majesty the Sultan and Yang Di-Pertuan shall have the status of a
    national of Brunei Darussalam.

 Japan
  Article 10 of the Child Pornography Prohibiting Act (Crimes Committed by Japanese Nationals outside
  Japan) states that the crimes prescribed in paragraphs 1 to 7 of Article 7 of this Act (Provision of Child
  Pornography and Other Related Activities) shall be governed by Article 3 of the Penal Code (Crimes
  Committed by Japanese Nationals outside Japan), when such crimes are committed by Japanese
  nationals outside of its own territory.

 Lao People’s Democratic Republic
  Article 4 of the Penal Law stipulates that Lao citizens who commit offenses outside of the territory of the
  Lao People's Democratic Republic shall be charged with and punished for such offenses if they are
  defined as offenses under the Penal Law of the Lao People's Democratic Republic.

    Moreover, the Penal Law provides a definition of the term “offenses” mentioned in Article 4 of this Law.
    Article 6 of the same Law states that all acts and abstentions deemed dangerous to the political,

                                                    42
          economic, or social system of the Lao People's Democratic Republic, to the property of the State,
          collectives or individuals, to the lives, health, integrity, rights or freedom of the people, or to national
          security or public order as provided in the Penal Law or in “other laws” of the Lao People's Democratic
          Republic that define criminal penalties shall be considered offenses.

          Accordingly, Lao People’s Democratic Republic establishes its extraterritorial jurisdiction over child
          pornography offenses prescribed in the Law on the Protection of Rights and Interests of Children subject
          to Article 4 of the Penal Law when the alleged offender is its national.

E. LEGISLATION CRIMINALIZING ONLINE GROOMING OF CHILDREN

     The Plan of Action of the Pact of Rio de Janeiro calls on States to undertake specific and targeted actions to
     prevent and stop the use of the Internet and new technologies for the grooming of children for online and
     offline abuse and for the production and dissemination of child pornography and other materials.

     Article 23 of the Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse
     introduced the offense of grooming, which is referred to as the “solicitation of children for sexual purposes”.
     Article 23 of the Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse
     requires each party to criminalize the intentional proposal, through information and communication
     technologies, of an adult to meet a child who has not reached the age below which it is prohibited to engage
     in sexual activities with a child for the purposes of engaging in sexual activities or producing child
     pornography and where this proposal has been followed by material acts leading to such a meeting. Other
     forms of grooming through real contacts or non-electronic communications are outside the scope of this
     provision because information and communication technologies are stated as means for committing the
     offenses specified by the provision. Accordingly, Article 23 of the Convention on the Protection of Children
     against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse is considered to cover offenses concerning the online
     grooming of a child (also known as “online solicitation of a child for sexual purposes” or “online enticement
     of a child for sexual purposes”). 79, 80, 81

     The grooming of a child represents the initial actions taken by a sex offender to “socialize” or “prepare” the
     child for a sexual relationship. Child grooming is a process that may take place online, or offline, or a
     combination of the two.

     Online enticement (or solicitation) of a child for sexual acts occurs when a sex offender uses the Internet to
     induce, lure, invite, or persuade the child to meet for sexual acts or commit acts of a sexual nature online
     (sending sexually explicit images or videos of themselves to the offender). Sex offenders employ a variety of
     means such as email, social networking sites, instant messaging, bulletin boards, and chat rooms to gain a
     child’s trust and then arrange a face‐to‐face meeting. However, recent reports have shown that in some
     cases meeting offline is not the primary motivation of the sex offender as the Internet, “… enables offenders

                                                                          43
        to limit sexual contact in an online-only environment. In this way they fulfil their sexual motivations without
        the added risk of meeting a child in person.” 82

        Once the relationship with the child is established through online contact, sex offenders may meet with the
        child for sexual activities or show pornography (adult or child) to the child in order to lower his/her
        inhibitions, in an effort to “normalize” what is not normal and to instruct the child in sexual activities.

        The enactment of online grooming or online enticement legislation, with or without the intent to meet
        offline, may help to identify latent sex offenders and preclude later victimization and exploitation of
        children. 83

        In this part (V. Analysis of the legislative responses to crimes against children in alignment with relevant
        international instruments, E. Legislation criminalizing online grooming of children), an overview of the
        legislative responses of the 17 targeted Asian countries to online grooming will be provided. In addition, a
        review of provisions under domestic law that criminalize showing (or distributing) pornography to a child as
        a standalone offense among the 17 Asian countries analyzed shall be addressed separately from online
        grooming in Appendix B (Table 2 – Individual Country Information) and Appendix C (Table 3 – Offenses and
        Penalties).

        Among the 17 Asian countries analyzed:
        • 1 country (Philippines), under its domestic law, has explicit provisions criminalizing grooming, the
          definition of which shall extend to online grooming;
        • 1 country (India) possibly criminalizes acts constituting online grooming, although its domestic
          legislation does not use the explicit terms “grooming” or “online grooming”;
        • 2 countries (Brunei Darussalam and Singapore) have laws that explicitly address sexual grooming;
        • 2 countries (Japan and Republic of Korea) may punish any person who commits acts related to online
          grooming, although their domestic laws do not use the explicit term “grooming” or the term “online
          grooming”; and
        • 11 countries (Cambodia, China, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Indonesia, Lao People’s
          Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Thailand, Timor-Leste, and Vietnam) do not
          explicitly address online grooming or other acts relevant to online grooming under their domestic
          legislation.

        E.1. Country that explicitly criminalizes acts constituting online grooming

               Philippines
                Section 4 (h) of the Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009 prohibits any person from engaging in
                grooming a child. In addition, Section 15 (e) of this Act sets out a criminal penalty for any person
                who is found guilty of violating Section 4 (h) of the same Act.

                    Section 3 (h) of the Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009 defines “grooming” as the act of preparing a
                    child or someone who the offender believes to be a child for sexual activity or a sexual relationship

                     through other means.

                     Anyone under 18 years of age is considered a potential victim of grooming pursuant to Section 3 (a)
                     of the Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009, which defines a “child” as a person below 18 years of
                     age.

        E.2. Country that possibly criminalizes acts constituting online grooming

                   India
                    Although Indian law does not use the explicit term “online grooming”, Section 12 of the Protection
                    of Children from Sexual Offenses Act punishes any person who commits sexual harassment upon a
                    child by repeatedly or constantly following or watching or contacting a child either directly or
                    through electronic, digital, or any other means with sexual intent as mentioned in Section 11 of this
                    Act.

                     Moreover, Section 67B (c) of the IT Act makes it an offense to induce, cultivate, or entice children
                     into an online relationship with one or more children for sexually explicit acts. In addition, Section
                     67B (d) of the IT Act criminalizes facilitating online child abuse. However, the term “facilitate abusing
                     children online” is neither specified nor explained in the IT Act. The general wording “facilitates
                     abusing children online” under Section 67B (d) of the IT Act may cover online grooming unless there
                     is an impediment to the punishment of a preparatory act and with some concerns in respect of over-
                     criminalization. 84

                     Indian law considers everyone under age 18 as a potential victim of online grooming and related
                     activities. Section 2 (1) (d) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act states that “child”
                     means any person below the age of 18 years. In addition, the Explanation to Section 67B of the IT
                     Act states that for the purposes of this Section, the term “children” refers to persons who have not
                     yet completed 18 years of age.

        E.3. Country that explicitly criminalizes sexual grooming

                   Brunei Darussalam and Singapore
                    Both Bruneian law and Singaporean law do not have explicit provisions criminalizing online
                    grooming. However, Section 377G of the Bruneian Penal Code (introduced by Penal Code
                    Amendment Order 2012 of the Brunei Darussalam) and Section 376E of the Singaporean Penal Code
                    (introduced by the Penal Code Amendment Act 2007 of Singapore) criminalize sexual grooming
                    committed by a person of or above the age of 21 years against a child under the age of 16 years.

                     Although both the Bruneian Penal Code and Singaporean Penal Code do not provide a clear
                     definition of “online grooming” or “sexual grooming”, they do address punishable acts that shall
                     constitute sexual grooming offenses. Pursuant to Section 377G (1) of the Bruneian Penal Code and
                     Section 376E (1) of the Singaporean Penal Code, if any person of or above the age of 21 years (A) has
                     met or communicated with another person (B) on two or more occasions, that person shall be guilty
                     of an offense of sexual grooming provided that the following conditions are met:

84
     Id. at 42.




                                                                  45
(a) A intentionally meets B or travels with the intention of meeting B; and
(b) at the time of the acts referred to in paragraph (a)
     (i) A intends to do anything to or in respect of B, during or after the meeting, which if done will
     involve the commission by A of a relevant offense;
     (ii) B is under 16 years of age; and
     (iii) A does not reasonably believe that B is of or above the age of 16 years.

In order to be criminalized for sexual grooming as provided under Section 377G of the Bruneian
Penal Code and Section 376E of the Singaporean Penal Code, the offender must possess the
intention to meet a child to commit prescribed sexual offenses against such child at the time of
meeting the child or at the time of traveling to meet the child.

VI. ADEQUACY OF THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK TO DEAL WITH OFFENSES AGAINST CHILDREN
COMMITTED BY THE USE OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES

A. REQUIREMENT FOR PROFESSIONALS WHO WORK WITH CHILDREN AND INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS TO REPORT CHILD
PORNOGRAPHY OFFENSES

        A.1. Mandatory reporting requirement for professionals who work with children

        Individuals who, in their everyday, professional capacity, come into contact with children and owe a certain
        duty of care to those children shall be required to report suspected child pornography activities and/or child
        pornography offenses to law enforcement or another agency. This is due to the fact that professionals who
        work with children (i.e., health care and social service professionals, teachers, or school counselors) may
        develop well-founded suspicions about potential child victims of child pornography activities and/or child
        pornography offenses based on their daily interaction with children. 85

        For the purposes of this Regional Study, while some countries (i.e., India) may have laws or regulations that
        require anyone with knowledge of an incident involving child pornography activities and/or child
        pornography offenses to report it to the appropriate authorities, only those countries with laws or
        regulations that specifically require professionals who work with children to report cases involving child
        pornography activities and/or child pornography offenses to law enforcement or another mandated agency
        when they learn of such cases are considered to create mandatory reporting requirements for professionals
        who work with children.

        Furthermore, for the purposes of this Regional Study, countries that have laws or regulations that require
        professionals working with children to report circumstances involving child sexual abuse or child abuse upon
        the discover of such circumstances might also be deemed to establish mandatory reporting requirements
        for professionals working with children if the said countries’ laws or regulations define the term “child
        sexual abuse” or the term “child abuse” to include children’s participation or the use of children in
        pornography. However, if a country (i.e., Singapore) has a law or regulation that requires professionals
        working with children to report child abuse incidents upon the finding of such incidents without defining the
        term “child abuse” to include the use or involvement of a child in pornographic materials, such country shall
        not be considered to have legislation or regulation that requires professionals working with children to
        report child pornography activities or child pornography offenses.

        Among the 17 Asian countries analyzed:
          • 1 country (Republic of Korea) has provisions under domestic law that explicitly requires
              professionals who work with children to report child pornography offenses to a law enforcement
              agency upon learning of the occurrence of such offenses;
          • 3 countries (Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia, and Philippines) have explicit provisions under their
              domestic law or order, which oblige professionals who work with children to report suspected
              incidents involving child abuse or child sexual abuse when they learn of the circumstances in
              addition to defining the terms “child abuse” or “child sexual abuse” to include children’s
              involvement or participation in pornographic or obscene materials under the same law or order; and

           •    13 countries (Cambodia, China, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, India, Indonesia, Japan, Lao
                People’s Democratic Republic, Mongolia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, Timor-Leste, and Vietnam)
                do not have explicit provisions requiring professionals working with children to report cases
                involving activities related to child pornography under their domestic law or regulation.

                Republic of Korea
                 Article 34 (2) of the Act on the Protection of Children and Juveniles from Sexual Abuse requires
                 the head of prescribed institutions, facilities, or organizations or any employee thereof to
                 immediately report a sex offense against a child or juvenile to an investigative agency when
                 he/she becomes aware of the occurrence of such offense in the course of performing his/her
                 duties.

                   The organizations, facilities, and institutions prescribed by Article 34 (2) of the Act on the
                   Protection of Children and Juveniles from Sexual Abuse include, but are not limited to: a) schools
                   defined in Article 2 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act; b) child welfare facilities
                   defined in Article 3, subparagraph 10 of the Child Welfare Act; c) medical institutions defined in
                   Article 3 of the Medical Service Act; and d) youth counseling and welfare centers under Article 29
                   (1) of the Juvenile Welfare Support Act and youth shelters under Article 31, subparagraph 1 of the
                   same Act.

                   Furthermore, the definition of a “sex offense against a child or juvenile” as provided in Article 2,
                   subparagraph 2 of the Act on the Protection of Children and Juveniles from Sexual Abuse includes
                   child or juvenile pornography offenses punishable by Article 11 of this Act. Moreover, the
                   definition of “child or juvenile pornography” as specified by Article 2, subparagraph 5 of the same
                   Act includes child or juvenile pornography in the form of a film, video, game software, or picture,
                   image, etc., displayed on computers or other communications media.

     A.2. Mandatory reporting requirement for Internet Service Providers

     The Plan of Action of the Pact of Rio de Janeiro calls on States to take the necessary legislative measures to
     require Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to report and remove child pornography websites and child sexual
     abuse images from their networks.

     For the purposes of this Regional Study, while some countries may have general reporting law or regulation
     (i.e., anyone with knowledge of any crime must report the crime to the appropriate authorities), only those
     countries that have provisions under their domestic law or regulation that specifically require ISPs to report
     child pornography (including the occurrence of child pornography activities and/or child pornography
     offenses) to law enforcement or another designated agency when they are aware of it are considered to
     establish a mandatory reporting requirement for ISPs.

     There are countries that have provisions under their domestic law or regulation that limit the liability of ISPs,
     as long as they remove child pornography and take measures to prevent the further transmission of such
     content when they learn of its presence on their own networks (i.e., Republic of Korea 86). However, such

86
  The Republic of Korea does not have provisions that require ISPs to report child or juvenile pornography to relevant authorities after learning of they are
aware of suspected child pornography materials it on their networks. However, the Act on the Protection of Children and Juveniles from Sexual Abuse
have provisions that oblige online service providers (whose definition includes ISPs) to remove the discovered child or juvenile pornography under their
own networks once they learn of it as stated below.


                                                                            48
        countries are not deemed to have legislation or regulation that establishes a mandatory reporting
        requirement for ISPs. 87

        Among the 17 Asian countries analyzed:
          • 1 country (Philippines) has legislation that provides explicit provisions requiring ISPs to report child
              pornography offenses and/or child pornography activities to law enforcement agencies when they
              become aware of cases involving commission of such offenses;
          • 1 country (China) has regulatory measures that mandate ISPs to report information with obscene or
              pornographic content to relevant authorities when they become aware of it; and
          • 15 countries (Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, India, 88
              Indonesia, Japan, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Republic of
              Korea, Singapore, Thailand, Timor-Leste, and Vietnam) do not have explicit provisions under their
              domestic law or regulation establishing a mandatory reporting requirement for ISPs when they learn
              of circumstances involving child pornography.

               Philippines
                Section 9 of the Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009 articulates that, “All Internet Service Providers
                (ISPs) shall notify the Philippine National Police (PNP) or the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI)
                within seven (7) days from obtaining facts and circumstances that any form of child pornography is
                being committed using its server or facility.”

B. DATA RETENTION OR DATA PRESERVATION PROVISIONS

Non-content based data includes subscriber information (i.e., data that helps identify the subscriber), as well as
traffic data (i.e., information on the route, time, date, duration, destination, and source of a communication).
Insufficient provision for the retention of non-content based data under domestic law or regulation is a
significant barrier to identifying and locating suspects in ICT-facilitated offenses against children. Additionally,
the inadequate provision for preservation of non-content based data under domestic legislation or regulation
has become a substantial hindrance and obstacle in criminal prosecutions against a potential suspect of offenses
against children committed with the use of ICTs and identified during the investigation.

This Regional Study will examine data retention or data preservation under domestic legislation or regulation
relating to the use of ICTs to commit offenses against children. For the purposes of this Regional Study, the term
“data retention” refers to retaining (i.e., keeping) non-content based data for a set period of time.

Article 17 (1) of the Act on the Protection of Children and Juveniles from Sexual Abuse mandates any online service provider to take measures to a) detect
child or juvenile pornography in the information and communication network managed by himself/herself or b) immediately delete the detected (child or
juvenile) pornography and take technical measures to prevent or block transmission. Any online service provider who fails to comply with either of those
two obligations mentioned in a) and b) shall be punished pursuant to Article 17 (1) of this Act.
Article 17 (1) of the Act on the Protection of Children and Juveniles from Sexual Abuse allows an online service provider to be exempted from the
obligation stipulated in one of the following cases where: a) the online service provider has not been negligent in paying due attention to detect the child
or juvenile pornography in the information and communications network or b) where substantial technical difficulty exists even though he/she has tried to
prevent or block the transmission of the detected child or juvenile pornography.

88
  Indian law does not provide explicit provisions that require Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to report child pornography when they discover it on their
own networks. However, Section 20 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act mandates any personnel of the media, hotel, lodge, hospital,
club, studio, or photographic facilities, upon being aware of any material or object which is sexually exploitative of a child (including pornographic, sexually
related, or making obscene representations of a child or children) through the use of any medium, to provide such information to the Special Juvenile
Police Unit or to the local police, as the case may be. In addition, Section 21 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act punishes anyone who
violates Section 20 of this Act by failing to report a case involving a sexual offense against a child prescribed in the same Act.


                                                                                  49
In addition, for the purposes of this Regional Study, the term “data preservation” refers to preserving the non-
content based data of an identified user for a specific period of time in order to prevent loss or modification of
the data. 89

Data preservation is a common alternative to data retention because data preservation provisions permit law
enforcement officers to require service providers to immediately begin retaining (keeping) data relevant to
criminal investigation proceedings. 90

Among the 17 Asian countries analyzed:
      • 5 countries (China, India, Republic of Korea, Thailand, and Vietnam) have domestic laws, regulations,
          or rules that provide data retention provisions with a specified data retention period;
      • 2 countries (Japan and Philippines) have data preservation provisions under their domestic
          legislation;
      • 2 countries (Brunei Darussalam and Indonesia) have data retention provisions under their domestic
          law, although, 1) the applicability of current data retention provisions to child pornography offenses
          is unclear under the existing laws (Brunei Darussalam); or 2) the rules concerning the specific data
          retention period have yet to be promulgated (Indonesia);
      • 2 countries (Malaysia and Singapore) only have provisions under their domestic laws that specifically
          address personal data retention principles; and
      • 6 countries (Cambodia, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Lao People’s Democratic Republic,
          Mongolia, Myanmar, and Timor-Leste) do not have data retention or data preservation provisions
          under their domestic laws or regulations.

        B.1. Country that has data retention provisions with a specified data retention period

               China

                15 of the Administrative Provisions for Electronic Bulletin Services on the Internet, Internet access
                providers shall record user online time, user account numbers, Internet addresses or domain names,
                and the principal telephone numbers of Internet users. According to Article 14 of the Administrative
                Measures on Internet Information Services and Article 15 of the Administrative Provisions for
                Electronic Bulletin Services on the Internet, such records shall be kept for 60 days and shall be made
                available when relevant Sate authorities make inquiries in accordance with the law.

               India
                Section 79 (2) (c) of the IT Act provides that intermediaries are exempted from liability for third
                party content provided that they observe due diligence while discharging their duties under this Act
                and also observe such other guidelines as the Central Government may prescribe. The Information
                Technology (Guidelines for Cyber Café) Rules were issued in exercise of powers conferred by Section
                79 (2) of the IT Act in order to establish the Government’s standard for what constitutes “due
                diligence” by intermediaries. These Rules contain provisions addressing the duties of cybercafé

             Act pursuant to Articles 2, subparagraph 11 and 15-2 of the Protection of Communications Secrets
             Act, as well as Article 41 (2) of the Enforcement Decree of the Protection of Communications Secrets
             Act. 93

            Thailand
             Pursuant to Section 26 of the Computer Crime Act of Thailand, service providers 94 are required to
             store computer traffic data 95 for at least 90 days from the date on which the data is put into the
             computer system. However, if necessary, a relevant competent official may instruct a service
             provider to store data for a longer period, not to exceed one year, on a special case or temporary
             basis. In addition, according to Section 26 of the Computer Crime Act, service providers must keep
             the necessary information of the service user 96 in order to be able to identify the service user from
             the beginning of the service provision, and such information must be kept for a further period not to
             exceed 90 days after the service agreement has been terminated.

            Vietnam
             Section 3 of the Joint Circular on Management of Internet Agent states that all Internet agents, in
             the course of conducting business, shall fully exercise the rights and obligations to use program
             management software already set up for the agent to store information about users services

                   the termination of the case provided under Section 13 of the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012.

C. REQUIREMENT TO IDENTIFY USERS OF PUBLIC COMPUTERS IN CYBERCAFÉS

The Plan of Action of the Pact of Rio de Janeiro calls on States to encourage and support Internet cafés to
develop and implement, with the meaningful participation of parents, children, and adolescents, voluntary
Codes of Conduct and other corporate social responsibility mechanisms and to develop legal tools for enabling
the adoption of child protection measures in these businesses. Many Internet cafés (also known as “cybercafés”)
afford anonymity, without requiring the identification of their users to log on to computers. To prevent the use
of public computers in cybercafés for criminal purposes utilizing the anonymity offered by public computers in
cybercafés and facilitate the enforcement of legal tools and/or Codes of Conduct for child protection, the
adoption of legislative or regulatory measures that require cybercafés to identify their users shall be needed.

Among the 17 Asian countries analyzed:
  • 4 countries (China, India, Malaysia, and Myanmar) have regulations or rules that explicitly require the
      identification of users of public computers in cybercafés; and
  • 13 countries (Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Indonesia, Japan,
      Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Mongolia, Philippines, Republic of Korea, 99 Singapore, Thailand, 100

98
  Pursuant to Section 12 of the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012, the term “traffic data” refers only to the communication’s origin, destination, route,
time, date, size, duration, or type of underlying service, but not content, nor identities.
99
   In the Republic of Korea, there is no legislation or regulation that requires the identification of users of public computers in cybercafés. However, an
owner or an employee of a cybercafé may demand users to produce valid identification in order to verify their ages if any juveniles under the age of 18
(including students in high school pursuant to Article 2 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act) enter into their business establishments to use the
public computers at night (from 10:00pm to 9:00am) in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Game Industry Promotion Act, the Enforcement
Decree of the Game Industry Promotion Act, and the Juvenile Protection Act.


                                                                           52
           Timor-Leste, and Vietnam 101) do not have explicit provisions under their domestic laws, regulations, or
           rules that require cybercafés to identify their users.

            China
             Pursuant to Article 23 of the Regulations on Administration of Business Premises for Internet Access
             Services, a unit operating business premises for Internet access services 102 shall check and register
             the identity cards or other valid credentials of consumers of Internet access services, and make a
             record of relevant log-on information. According to the same Article, the registered contents and
             copies of the record shall be kept for a period of not less than 60 days.

            India
             Cybercafés shall not allow any user to use its computer resource without the identity of the user
             being established pursuant to Section 4(1) of the Information Technology (Guidelines for Cyber Café)
             Rules. The intending user may establish his identify by producing a document which shall identify
             the user to the satisfaction of the cybercafé. Such document may include any of the following: 1)
             identity card issued by any school or college; 2) photo credit card or debit card issued by a bank or
             post office; 3) passport; 4) voter identity card; 5) permanent account number (PAN) card issued by
             income-tax authority; 6) photo identity card issued by the employer or any government agency; 7)
             driver’s license issued by the appropriate government; or 8) unique identification (UID) number
             issued by the unique identification authority of India (UIDAI).

                A cybercafé must keep a record of the user identification document by storing either a photocopy or
                a scanned copy of the document duly authenticated by the user and an authorized representative of
                the cybercafé. Such record shall be securely maintained for a period of at least one year according
                to Section 4 (2) of the Information Technology (Guidelines for Cyber Café) Rules.

            Malaysia
             According to Section 3 of the Cyber Centre and Cyber Café (Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur) Rules

using Internet services in Vietnam (No. 71/2004/QD-BCA (A11) dated January 29, 2004) has provisions that require Internet agents to keep information on
the identification of service users as stated below.
Article 8 of the Decision promulgating the regulation on ensuring safety and security in activities of managing, providing and using Internet services in
Vietnam stipulates that Internet agents shall keep service use registration books for recording full and detailed information about their customers,
including full names, addresses, serial numbers of identity cards or passports, and the date and time the service was used. Article 1 of this Decision

D. LEGISLATION THAT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES THE USE OF ICTS TO COMMIT CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN

The Plan of Action of the Pact of Rio de Janeiro calls on States to undertake specific and targeted actions to
prevent and stop child pornography and the use of the Internet and new technologies for the grooming of
children for online and offline abuse and for the production and dissemination of child pornography and other
materials.

For the purposes of this Regional Study, provisions under the law that specifically criminalize the following acts
were taken into account: (1) the use of a computer, computer system, ICTs to: a) make (produce), watch,
possess, distribute, disseminate, or sell child pornography; or b) to commit other crimes against children; or (2)
browsing, viewing, accessing, or downloading child pornography.

Among the 17 Asian countries analyzed:
  • 8 countries (Brunei Darussalam, India, Indonesia, Japan, Philippines, Republic of Korea, Singapore, and
      Thailand) have legislation that explicitly addresses the use of ICTs to commit crimes against children;
  • 2 countries (Cambodia and Timor-Leste) have legislation that uses the term such as “electronic form” or
      “any medium of communication” when specifying punishment for acts related to child pornography;
  • 1 country (China) is possibly considered to have a law that addresses the use of ICTs to commit child
      pornography offenses in combination with judicial interpretations; and
  • 6 countries (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Malaysia,
      Mongolia, Myanmar, and Vietnam) do not have legislation that specifically addresses the use of ICTs to
      commit crimes against children.

         Brunei Darussalam
          The Penal Code (amended by the Penal Code Amendment Order 2012) contains provisions
          addressing the use of ICTs to commit crimes against children. Specifically, Section 293B (1) (e) of the
          Penal Code punishes any person who accesses an indecent or obscene photograph or pseudo-
          photograph of a child.

         India
          The principal law that govern crimes against children committed by the use of ICTs in India is the
          Information Technology Act (amended by the Information Technology (Amendment) Act, 2008) (also
          known as “IT Act”).

            Section 67B (b) of the IT Act criminalizes downloading or browsing of material in electronic form
            depicting children in an obscene or indecent or sexually explicit manner.

                                                       54
 Indonesia

  in Indonesia is the Anti-Pornography Law (Law No. 44 of 2008 concerning pornography). Any person
  who downloads pornography that explicitly contains child pornography shall be punished with
  imprisonment for a maximum of four years and/or a fine not exceeding Rp2,000,000,000.00 (two
  billion rupiah) pursuant to Articles 4, 5, and 31 of the Anti-Pornography Law.

 Japan
  The principal law that specifically addresses crimes against children with the use of ICTs in Japan is
  the Child Pornography Prohibiting Act.

   With regard to child pornography offenses, any person who provides electromagnetic records or any
   other record which depicts the pose of a child, which falls under any of the items of Article 2 (3) of
   the Child Pornography Prohibiting Act, in a visible way through electric telecommunication lines
   shall be sentenced to imprisonment with labor for not more than three years, or a fine of not more
   than three million yen pursuant to Article 7 (2) of this Act.

 Philippines
  The principal laws that specifically address crimes against children with the use of ICTs in the
  Philippines are the Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009 and the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012.
  With regard to child pornography offenses, any person who transmits or willfully accesses any form
  of child pornography in violation of Section 4 of the Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009 shall be
  subject to the penalties described in Section 15 of this Act.

 Republic of Korea
  The principal law in the Republic of Korea that deals with crimes against children committed by the
  use of ICTs is the Act on the Protection of Children and Juveniles from Sexual Abuse.

   With respect to online sexual exploitation of children, a person who arranges the purchase of child
   or juvenile sex or a person who provides information that assists in the purchase thereof through an
   information and communications network as a profession, shall be punished by imprisonment for a
   fixed term of at least seven years pursuant to Article 15 (1), subparagraph 2 of the Act on the
   Protection of Children and Juveniles from Sexual Abuse.

 Singapore
  The principal law in Singapore that specifically addresses the use of ICTs to commit crimes against
  children is the Penal Code. Pertaining to online sexual exploitation of children, Section 376D of the
  Penal Code criminalizes advertising child sex tourism online as stated below.

   Section 376D of the Penal Code (Tour outside Singapore for commercial sex with minor under 18)
   punishes any person who publishes information by any means, whether by written, electronic, or
   other form of communication, that intended to promote conduct that would constitute an offense
   under Section 376C of this Code (Commercial sex with minor under 18 outside Singapore), or to
   assist any other to engage in such conduct.




                                              55
         Thailand
          The Child Protection Act contains provisions addressing the use of ICTs to commit crimes against
          children. According to Section 27 of the Child Protection Act, advertising or disseminating any
          information on a child, by means of the media or any other kind of information technology, with the
          intention of causing damage to the mind, reputation, prestige, or any other interests of the child, or
          seeking benefit for oneself or others in an unlawful manner, is prohibited. Furthermore, any person
          who violates Section 27 of this Act shall be liable to a term of imprisonment not exceeding six
          months, or a fine not exceeding 60,000 Baht, or both pursuant to Section 79 of the same Act.

E. AGGRAVATION OF PENALTIES FOR USING ICTS TO COMMIT CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN

Damages resulting from distribution, transmission, or dissemination of information that can cause harm to
children (i.e., information containing child pornography or child sexual exploitation) to unspecified persons
through ICTs can easily be scaled up. In addition, it will be difficult to restore children’s rights once information
harmful to the interests of children circulates on the Internet. Accordingly, the enhancement of the punishment
for using ICTs to commit crimes against children shall be appropriate.

Among the 17 Asian countries analyzed:
  • 2 countries (Indonesia and Philippines) have explicit provisions under their domestic laws that aggravate
      penalties for using ICTs to commit crimes against children; and
  • 15 countries (Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, China, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, India, Japan,
      Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Republic of Korea, Singapore,
      Thailand, Timor-Leste, and Vietnam) do not have provisions under their domestic legislation that
      explicitly enhance punishment for using ICTs to commit crimes against children.

         Indonesia
          Article 27, paragraph (1) of Law No. 11 of 2008 concerning the Electronic Information and
          Transactions (also known as “Electronic Information and Transactions Law”) prohibits any person
          from knowingly and without authority distributing and/or transmitting and/or causing to be
          accessible electronic information and/or electronic records with contents against propriety. Any
          person who violates Article 27, paragraph (1) of the Electronic Information and Transactions Law
          shall be sentenced to a penalty of up to six years of imprisonment and/or a maximum fine of
          Rp1,000,000,000.00 (one billion rupiah) according to Article 45, paragraph (1) of this Law.

            In case of the commission of criminal acts as stipulated in Article 27, paragraph (1) of the Electronic
            Information and Transactions Law relating to propriety or the sexual exploitation of children, such
            person shall be subject to an increase in the sentence by one third of the basic sentence pursuant to
            Article 52, paragraph (1) of this Law.

         Philippines
          Section 6 of the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 (also known as the “Republic Act No. 10175”)
          stipulates that all crimes defined and penalized by the Revised Penal Code, as amended, and special
          laws, if committed by, with, and through the use of information and communications technologies,
          shall be covered by the relevant provisions of this Act, provided that the penalty to be imposed shall
          be one degree higher than that provided for by the Revised Penal Code, as amended, and special
          laws, as the case may be.



                                                         56
                   Furthermore, in respect of child pornography offenses, Section 8 of the Cybercrime Prevention Act
                   of 2012 provides that any person found guilty of the punishable acts enumerated in Section 4 (c) (2)
                   of this Act shall be punished with the penalties as enumerated in the “Anti-Child Pornography Act of
                   2009″ or “Republic Act No. 9775”, provided that the penalty to be imposed shall be one degree
                   higher than that provided for in Republic Act No. 9775, if committed through a computer system.
                   Section 4 (c) (2) of the same Act classifies child pornography offenses as one of the content-related
                   cybercrime offenses.

F. LEGISLATION CRIMINALIZING ADVERTISING CHILD SEX TOURISM ONLINE

Sexual exploitation of children and adolescents in travel and tourism under the Plan of Action of the Pact of Rio
de Janeiro calls on States to prohibit the production and dissemination of material advertising the sexual
exploitation of children in tourism, and to alert travelers to criminal sanctions that will apply in cases of sexual
exploitation of children.

Furthermore, the Plan of Action of the Pact of Rio de Janeiro calls on States to undertake specific and targeted
actions to prevent and stop child pornography and the use of the Internet and new technologies for the
grooming of children for online and offline abuse and for the production and dissemination of child pornography
and other materials.

For the purposes of this Regional Study, the term “child sex tourism” is the sexual exploitation of children by a
person or persons who travel from their home district, home geographical region, or home country in order to
have sexual contact with children. Child sex tourists can be domestic travelers, as well as international
tourists. 103

Among the 17 Asian countries analyzed:
  • 2 countries (Brunei Darussalam and Singapore) have explicit provisions criminalizing advertising child sex
      tourism online under their domestic law;
  • 1 country (Philippines) has legislation that explicitly criminalizes sex tourism; and
  • 14 countries (Cambodia, China, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, India, Indonesia, Japan, Lao
      People’s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Republic of Korea, Thailand, Timor-Leste,
      and Vietnam) do not have legislation that explicitly criminalizes advertising child sex tourism online.

In the case of India, the Code of Conduct for Safe & Honorable Tourism was adopted on July 1, 2010. This is not
a legally binding instrument, but a set of guidelines for the travel and tour sector. The travel and tour sector,
which is under the scope of the application of this guidance, includes: 1) the owners, suppliers, contractors,
employees of hotels, restaurants, lodges, guest houses, tour agents, entertainment establishments, etc.; and 2)
service providers such as event management organizations, entertainment providers, transport operators like
taxis, buses, tour guides, and other services or agencies associated with the tourism industry.

               prevention of school violence via information and communications networks pursuant to paragraph
               (1), the State, the competent local government, or the superintendent of the competent office of
               education may fully or partially subsidize them in relation to any of the following expenses: a)
               expenses incurred by the school or student (including his/her parents) in purchasing or using
               telecommunications facilities and equipment; or b) telecommunications service fees charged to a
               school or student (including his/her parents).

     G.2. Country that is considered to have legislation concerning cyberbullying

           Singapore
            Singapore has legislation regarding cyberbullying, although the terms “cyberbullying” and “bullying”
            are not explicitly used by Singaporean law. The Protection from Harassment Act (Act No. 17 of 2014)
            has provisions criminalizing harassment, unlawful stalking, and related anti-social behaviors, such as
            bullying in work places or cyber-bullying in schools, whether committed in the physical world or
            online.

               Any person who by any means uses any threatening, abusive, or insulting words or behavior or
               makes any threatening, abusive, or insulting communication, which is heard, seen, or otherwise
               perceived by any person likely to be caused harassment, alarm, or distress, shall be guilty of an
               offense of harassment, alarm, or distress pursuant to Section 4 of the Protection from Harassment
               Act. In addition, an illustration to Section 4 of this Act provides an example of cyber-bullying in
               schools by stating that “X and Y are classmates. X posts a vulgar tirade against Y on a website
               accessible to all of their classmates. One of Y’s classmates shows the message on the website to Y,
               and Y is distressed. X is guilty of an offence under this section.”

               Accordingly, it is evident that the Singaporean legislative intent is to cover cyber-bullying in schools
               under Section 4 of the Protection from Harassment Act, although there is no explicit usage of the
               terms “bullying”, “bullying through information and communication technologies”, or “cyber-
               bullying” under this Act. 106

VII. INTERESTING LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES FOR PREVENTING AND COMBATING VIOLENCE AGAINST CHILDREN
     THROUGH INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES

A. REQUIREMENT FOR PHOTO DEVELOPERS, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROFESSIONALS, CREDIT CARD COMPANIES, AND
BANKS TO REPORT CHILD PORNOGRAPHY ACTIVITIES

The legislative measures that require photo developers and information technology (IT) professionals to report
child pornography activities to law enforcement or another mandated agency, when they learn of such
incidents, play important roles in detecting child pornography activities or offenses. While such individuals do
not come into contact with children on a daily basis, they may potentially be exposed to child pornography as
result of their job responsibilities.

Furthermore, the legislative approaches that mandate financial institutions (i.e., credit card companies, banks)
to report activities related to child pornography to a law enforcement officer or another competent government
official, once they become aware of such circumstances, have crucial roles in combating and preventing child
pornography considering that payment services rendered by such organizations or corporations are being used
to proliferate child pornography. 107

               Philippines
                Section 10 of the Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009 states that photo developers, information
                technology professionals, credit card companies, and banks, and any person who has direct
                knowledge of any form of child pornography activities shall have a duty to report any suspected
                child pornography materials or transactions to the proper authorities within seven days from
                discovery thereof. Any willful and intentional violation of this provision shall be subject to the
                penalty provided under Section 15 (l) of this Act.

B. PROHIBITION OF THE PROVISION OF CONTENTS HARMFUL TO A JUVENILE WITH THE USE OF ICTS

Children need to be protected from the harmful influences of the content circulated via the Internet or other
forms of media for two reasons. First, exposure to harmful online content may cause direct harm to the child as
viewer of the material. In addition to this potential direct harm to children, the circulation of harmful content by
the use of the Internet and associated technologies may also cause indirect harm to children because sex
offenders can use the Internet and associated technologies to expose a juvenile to sexually exploitative
materials, which might normalize such juvenile sexual activities. 108

There are two types of legal and regulatory measures that can be taken to reduce the chances of young people
viewing sexually exploitative materials or other types of harmful materials on the Internet. Indirect legal and
regulatory measures to tackle children’s exposure to harmful online content shall include the creation of
liabilities of ISPs or other related parties to control Internet content. As stated earlier (IV. Asian countries –
Statistical Indicators, as well as Similarities of the Legal and Regulatory Framework, B. Similarities of the Legal
and Regulatory Framework, B.2. Internet Content Control), in 13 out of the 17 Asian countries analyzed (Brunei

Republic of Korea, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam), the provisions of their domestic laws and/or regulations
stipulate that it is the role of ISPs, cybercafé owners (or operators), and other relevant actors (i.e., Internet
Content Providers) to control Internet content, including content harmful to children on the Internet (i.e., child
pornography), regardless of whether or not such countries have legislation that specifically addresses the use of
ICTs to commit crimes against children. In addition to the above-mentioned indirect legal and/or regulatory
approach, there are direct legislative responses to online content harmful to juveniles that include the
prohibition of providing materials harmful to them by the use of ICTs.

     China
      Article 31, paragraph 1 of the Law on Prevention of Juvenile Delinquency states that no unit or individual
      may sell or loan to juveniles publications, audio-video products, or electronic publications, which contain
      such content as may induce juveniles to violate laws or commit criminal offenses, and such contents as
      may impair the physical and mental health of juveniles, contents that exaggerate violence, pornography,
      gambling, terror, etc. Article 31, paragraph 2 of this Law further articulates that no unit or individual
      may, “by means of telecommunications, computer network, etc.”, provide such contents and
      information about such contents that may impair the physical and mental health of juveniles as
      prescribed by the preceding paragraph.

        If anyone or any unit provides publications, audio-video products, or electronic publications with
        contents that may impair the physical or mental health of juveniles “by means of telecommunications,
        computer network, etc.” in violation of Article 31 of the Law on Prevention of Juvenile Delinquency, the
        said publications, audio-video products, electronic publications, and his/its illegal gains shall be
        confiscated and he/it shall be fined by the competent government department in accordance with
        Article 53 of this Law.

     Republic of Korea
      The Republic of Korea enacted the Act on Promotion of Information and Communication Network
      Utilization and Information Protection, etc. (enacted by Act No. 6360, January 16, 2001; last amended
      on May 28, 2014; and effective as of November 29, 2014).

        Article 44-7 (1), subparagraph 5 of the Act on Promotion of Information and Communication Network
        Utilization and Information Protection, etc. prohibits providing any “media products harmful to
        juveniles” as defined in the Juvenile Protection Act, for profit and through an information and
        communications network, without confirming the receiver’s age and complying with the relevant
        regulations as defined under the Juvenile Protection Act. If a media product is lewd or obscene to
        arouse a juvenile sexual desire, it can be determined to be a media product harmful to juveniles under
        the Juvenile Protection Act.

C. PROTECTION FOR CHILD INTERNET USERS

A child’s right to access information available on the Internet should be respected in such a way as to ensure the
prevention of the exploitation of child Internet users. There are legislative regimes that aim to protect the rights
of children on the Internet by providing them with safe and secure Internet use through prescribing necessary
measures to be formulated and implemented by the State, local public entities, ISPs, and private sectors.

     Japan
      Japan enacted the Act on Development of an Environment that Provides Safe and Secure Internet Use
      for Young People (enacted by Act No. 79 of 2008 and amended by Act No. 71 of 2009).

                                                        63
Chapter III of the Act on Development of an Environment that Provides Safe and Secure Internet Use for
Young People (Articles 13-16) enumerates the duties of the State and local public entities to promote
education and awareness-raising activities on appropriate Internet use by young people.

In addition, Chapter IV of the Act on Development of an Environment that Provides Safe and Secure
Internet Use for Young People (Articles 17-23) envisages the obligations of ISPs and other service
providers to provide services or software to filter content harmful to young people, etc. to reduce the
chances of young people viewing content harmful to them via the Internet. Content harmful to young
people shall include obscene depictions of sexual conduct or genitals of humans, or any other
information that considerably excites or stimulates sexual desire pursuant to Article 2 (4) (ii) of this Act.

Further, Chapter V of the Act on Development of an Environment that Provides Safe and Secure Internet
Use for Young People (Articles 24-30) addresses the voluntary efforts to be made in the private sector to
promote the dissemination and use of software for filtering content harmful to young people.

VIII. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

A. CONCLUSION

   1. Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have developed rapidly over the last two decades.
   The development of ICTs have enabled both adults and children using the Internet and associated
   technologies to enjoy benefits and opportunities in regard to socialization, education, and entertainment.
   Especially, the development of ICTs has provided children and adolescents using the Internet and associated
   technologies with new spaces to interact and form social relationships with others, such as chat rooms, peer
   to peer (P2P) websites, or social network sites. On the other hand, recent rapid advances in ICTs have
   simultaneously allowed violence to be committed with the use of the Internet and associated technologies,
   including violence against children. Accordingly, children may be vulnerable to ICT-facilitated child abuse
   and exploitation and this child abuse and exploitation are often difficult to detect and to address.

   2. There are international legally binding instruments that are directly or indirectly related to online child
   abuse and exploitation and are used to analyze national legislative and regulatory responses to violence
   against children committed by, with, and through the use of ICTs. These international legally binding tools
   include the: 1) Convention on the Rights of the Child; 2) Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of
   the Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography; 3) Convention concerning the
   prohibition and immediate action for the elimination of the worst forms of child labor, 1999; 4) Convention
   on Cybercrime; and 5) Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual
   Abuse. All 17 analyzed Asian countries are obliged to align their legislative, regulatory, or policy responses to
   violence against children in accordance with the relevant international tools as they have acceded to or
   ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child, one of the above-mentioned international legally binding
   instruments. Furthermore, international non-legally binding instruments pertinent to ICT-facilitated child
   abuse and exploitation include: 6) Economic and Social Council Resolution 2011/33 on Prevention,
   protection and international cooperation against the use of new information technologies to abuse and/or
   exploit children; and 7) Rio de Janeiro Pact to Prevent and Stop Sexual Exploitation of Children and
   Adolescents. These international non-legally binding instruments should also be considered to verify the
   progress made by individual countries’ law, regulation, or policy to comply with relevant international
   standards.

   3. In summary, among the 17 analyzed Asian countries the areas of law related to three major forms of
   online abuse and exploitation of children (a. activities related to child pornography; b. online grooming; and
   c. cyberbullying) still need to be developed in alignment with the international instruments. However, it is
   noted that among the 17 Asian countries analyzed, the legal systems of 5 countries (Brunei Darussalam,
   Japan, Philippines, Republic of Korea, and Singapore) to deal with violence against children through ICTs
   show favorable or moderate alignment with relevant international standards. 4 countries (Brunei
   Darussalam, Japan, Republic of Korea, and Singapore) out of these 5 countries are classified as developed
   countries based on their GNIs per capita per year. The high level of economic development of these 4
   countries is tied to the increased affordability and use of ICTs in those countries. The findings indicated that
   although countries with higher availability and accessibility of ICTs may suffer a greater risk associated with
   ICT-facilitated child abuse and exploitation, it may also lead to such countries adopting or amending legal
   measures to combat and prevent the use of the Internet and associated technologies to commit violence
   against children.

B. RECOMMENDATIONS

The adoption of appropriate laws to address the use of ICTs to commit violence against children shall be
necessary for tackling online child abuse and exploitation.

Based on research and analysis to date (as of January 30, 2015), the following recommendations, in a broad
sense, will be offered to help the targeted group of Asian countries to improve legislative and regulatory
responses to violence against children committed by, with, and through the use of ICTs:

         Provide a definition of child pornography in accordance with Article 2 (c) of the OPSC;
         Enact new law and/or amend existing law to criminalize activities with specific regard to child
          pornography (including possession of child pornography without the intent to distribute), in compliance
          with Article 3 (1) (c) of the OPSC, and ensure the implementation of new and/or amended law;
         Criminalize an act that aids or abets the commission of child pornography offenses, as well as an
          attempt to commit such offenses, in alignment with Article 3 (2) of the OPSC;
         Fully comply with Article 3 (3) of the OPSC by providing appropriate penalties for child pornography
          offenses;
         Take necessary measures to establish extraterritorial jurisdiction over child pornography offenses: 1)
          when the alleged offender is a national of the State; or 2) when the victim is a national of the State, in
          line with Article 4 (2) of the OPSC considering the transnational nature of ICT-facilitated child
          pornography offenses;
         Require ISPs to: 1) report child pornography to law enforcement agencies or other relevant authorities
          upon obtaining knowledge of it on their own networks; and 2) take measures to prevent further
          transmission of the discovered child pornography;
         Criminalize the use of ICTs to commit illicit activities related to child pornography, including
          downloading, viewing, and accessing child pornography;
         Criminalize advertising child sex tourism through the Internet and associated technologies;
         Adopt legislation to criminalize online grooming;
         Introduce legislation regarding cyberbullying; and
         Raise awareness around the issue of sexting and develop legislation to combat and prevent
          sexting. 109, 110, 111

Brunei Darussalam

In Brunei Darussalam, a wide range of children’s rights are protected through adopting domestic legislation and
by joining relevant international treaties including the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the
Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and
Child Pornography (OPSC).

Laws, notifications, and order which protect children’s rights and/or govern violence against children are as
follows:
     • Penal Code (Chapter 22) 112 (amended by the Penal Code Amendment Order 2012 113) (hereafter also
         referred to as “Penal Code”)
     • Broadcasting (Class License) Notification 2001 114
     • Internet Code of Practice Notification 115
     • Unlawful Carnal Knowledge Act (Chapter 29) (enacted in 1984) 116 (hereafter referred to as “Unlawful
         Carnal Knowledge Act”)
     • Children and Young Persons Order, 2006 117 (hereafter referred to as “Children and Young Persons
         Order”)
     • Undesirable Publications Act (Chapter 25) 118 (hereafter referred to as “Undesirable Publications Act”)
     • Trafficking and Smuggling of Persons Order, 2004 119 (hereafter referred to as “Trafficking and Smuggling
         of Persons Order”)

The Syariah Penal Code Order 2013 came into force, along with the existing civil penal code, on May 1, 2014. 120
However, for the purposes of this Regional Study, the civil penal code (also referred to as “Penal Code amended
by the Penal Code Amendment Order 2012”) was used because offenses involving child pornography, sexual
grooming against a child, and advertising child sex tourism online are governed by sections of the civil penal
code.

pornography offenses prescribed in this Code; and 2) the confiscation of proceeds derived from such offenses.

However, Section 7 of the Undesirable Publications Act 136 allows the court to issue an order for the forfeiture of

Protector if he or she believes on reasonable grounds that a child is physically or emotionally injured as a result
of being ill-treated, neglected, abandoned or exposed, or has been “sexually abused”. Section 26 (2) of this
Order further articulates that any child care provider who fails to comply with subsection (1) is guilty of an
offense and liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000, imprisonment for a term not exceeding two
years, or both.

Specifically, Section 2 (3) (c) of the Children and Young Persons Order states that for the purposes of this Order,
a child or young person is “sexually abused” if he has taken part, whether as a participant or an observer, in any
activity which is sexual in nature for the purposes of any pornographic, obscene, or indecent material,
photograph, recording, film, videotape, or performance, or for the purpose of sexual exploitation by any person
for that person’s or another person’s sexual gratification.

However, pursuant to Section 1 (b) of the Internet Code of Practice Notification 2001, all ISPs and ICPs licensed
under the Broadcasting (Class License) Notification 2001 are required to comply with the Code of Practice and
satisfy the Minister responsible for broadcasting matters, that they have taken responsible steps to fulfill this
requirement. Section 1 (b) of the Internet Code of Practice Notification 2001 further articulates that, under the
Broadcasting Act, that the Minister responsible for broadcasting matters has the power to impose sanctions
including fines, on licensees who contravene this Code of Practice.

In addition, Section 2 of the Internet Code of Practice Notification 2001 138 and Paragraph 11 (b) of the Schedule
to the Broadcasting (Class License) Notification 2001 require the ISPs and ICPs to use their best efforts in order
to ensure that no content which offends against good taste or decency is included in any program on the

allowed on the Internet specifically includes pornographic or otherwise obscene content and materials.

Moreover, pursuant to Paragraph 14 of the Schedule to the Broadcasting (Class License) Notification 2001 139,

        (iv) Contents which raise discontent or disaffection amongst the inhabitants of Brunei Darussalam; or
        (v) Contents which promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different classes of the population of Brunei Darussalam.

A licensee shall remove, or prohibit the broadcast of, the whole or any part of a programme included in its service if the Minister informs the licensee that
the broadcast of:

        (b) the programme:
                (i) is against the public interest, public order or national harmony; or


                                                                                 81
if the Minister informs the licensee that the broadcast of: 1) the whole or part of the program is contrary to a

15 – Has telephone or online hotlines to enable the public to report child abuse
The Department of Community Development of the Ministry of Culture, Youth, and Sport in Brunei Darussalam
operates a 24-hour helpline service and subsequently introduced the 141 helpline targeted at handling reports
involving women and children. 141

16 – Creates data retention or data preservation provisions
The Electronic Transactions Act 2001 (Chapter 196) 142 contains data retention provisions as stated below.

Section 9 (1) of the Electronic Transactions Act 2001 143 contains provisions establishing the requirements to be
met in the event that any rule of law requires certain documents, records, or information to be retained in the
form of electronic records.

However, Sections under the Penal Code (amended by Penal Code Amendment Order 2012) that directly pertain
to child pornography offenses do not explicitly call for records or information to be retained. Thus, it is unclear
whether or not data retention provisions under the Electronic Transactions Act 2001 are applicable to child
pornography offenses stipulated in the Penal Code (amended by the Penal Code Amendment Order 2012).

                (ii) offends against good taste or decency.
140
      Paragraph 8 of the Schedule to the Broadcasting (Class License) Notification 2001
        A licensee shall -
         (a) assist the Minister in the investigation into:
                (i) any breach of its license; or
                (ii) any alleged violation of any law committed by the licensee or any other person; and
         (b) produce such information, records, documents, data or other materials as may be required by the Minister for the purpose of the investigation.

In 2014, Brunei Darussalam introduced the “Child Online Protection Framework” to boost children’s online
safety and to combat crimes against children using ICTs. 144

The Bruneian Penal Code was recently amended by the Penal Code Amendment Order 2012 to criminalize
sexual grooming against a child and child pornography by online predators.

The Community Development Department of the Ministry of Culture, Youth, and Sport in Brunei Darussalam is
in charge of the protection of children’s rights. 145 This Ministry works closely with all other relevant government
agencies and non-governmental bodies towards the implementation of the protection of children’s rights.

To ensure the rights of children in Brunei Darussalam, several laws including the Children and Young Persons
Order have been introduced. The Children and Young Persons Order aims to provide protection of children’s
rights, as well as support the rehabilitation of victimized children.

The minimum age of criminal liability is 7 years according to Section 82 of the Penal Code. Further, if a child who
is above 7 and under 12 years of age and of immature understanding to judge the nature and consequences of
his conduct on that occasion commits an act constituting an offense, such child is also exempted from criminal
liability pursuant to Section 83 of the Penal Code.

21 – Has legislation that specifically addresses the use of ICTs to commit crimes against children
The principal law that governs offenses against children committed with the use of ICTs in Brunei Darussalam is
the Penal Code (amended by the Penal Code Amendment Order 2012).

6 – Criminalizes virtual images and sexually exploitative representations of children
Cambodian law does not have explicit provisions that criminalize the production, distribution, possession, and
commercialization of child pornography, including virtual images and sexually exploitative representations of
children that do not necessarily use real children in their production. However, Article 40 of the LSHTSE defines
child pornography as a visible material, such as a photograph or videotape including a material in electronic
form, depicting a minor’s naked figure which excites or stimulates sexual desire.

7 – Addresses the criminal liability of children involved in pornography
Cambodian law does not address the criminal liability of children involved in pornography for their participation
in cases of child victims, as well as child offenders. Although Articles 38 and 39 of the LSHTSE specify
pornography offenses, the legal age for criminal responsibility in Cambodia starts at 18 years of age pursuant to
Article 38 of the Criminal Code.

8 – Establishes criminal liability of legal persons for production or commercialization of child pornography
Article 4 of the LSHTSE 169 establishes the criminal liability of a legal entity or a principal when a representative,

principal who commits it.
An accomplice and instigator shall include, but not be limited to, the form of organizing or directing another to commit any of the felonies or
misdemeanors stipulated in this Law.
When a representative, agent, or employee for a legal entity or a principal commits any offense stipulated in this Law in the scope of its business, or in the
interest of the legal entity or the principal, the legal entity or the principal shall be punished with fine and additional penalties in accordance with the
punishment stipulated in the relevant article.

                                                                             91
Moreover, Article 42 of the Criminal Code provides that in case it is precisely provided for by a law and legal
instrument, the legal entities, to the exclusion of the State, may be declared as being criminally responsible for
the offenses committed, for their interests, by their organs or their representatives. Article 42 of this Code
further articulates that the criminal responsibility of the legal entity does not exclude the criminal responsibility
of the natural person for the same acts.

9 – Recognizes extraterritorial jurisdiction over child pornography offenses when the alleged offender is a
national of the State
Cambodia establishes its extraterritorial jurisdiction over any felonies or misdemeanors if the alleged offender is
a national of Cambodia pursuant to Article 3 of the LSHTSE. As stated above, Article 41 of this Law creates
offenses involving child pornography as defined by Article 40 of the same Law.

Moreover, Article 19 of the Criminal Code allows Cambodian law to be applicable to any felony committed by a
Cambodian citizen outside of its own territory in a criminal case. Article 19 of the Criminal Code further
articulates that Cambodian law is applicable to misdemeanors committed by Cambodian citizens in a foreign
country if the acts are shared to be punishable by the law of such foreign country. In addition, Article 19 of the
Criminal Code states that “These provisions are also applicable even though the accused has obtained
Cambodian nationality subsequently to the acts which had been charged.”

10 – Recognizes extraterritorial jurisdiction over child pornography offenses when the victim is a national of
the State
Cambodia establishes its extraterritorial jurisdiction over child pornography offenses as defined and punishable
by Articles 40 and 41 of the LSHTSE if the victim is its citizen at the time of the commission of the offense
according to Article 3 of the LSHTSE.

Furthermore, Article 20 of Criminal Code provides that in a criminal case, Cambodian law is applicable to any
felony committed outside of its own territory by a Cambodian citizen, or by a foreigner when the victim is of
Cambodian nationality at the time of the offense committed.

11 – Establishes the confiscation of assets used to commit or facilitate child pornography offenses; and

offenses stipulated in this Law. The same Article also allows the confiscation of the proceeds or the properties
earned from or resulted from the offenses in this Law.




170
      Article 48 of the LSHTSE (Additional Penalties)
For the offenses stipulated in this Law, the following additional penalties may be imposed:
              1- the confiscation of any equipment, materials or objects which have served, or been intended to serve, to commit the offense;
              2- the confiscation of any materials which are constituent objects of the offenses;

                                                                                92
As stated above, Article 41 of the LSHTSE makes it an offense to engage in a prescribed activity related to child
pornography as defined in Article 40 of this Law.

13 – Requires professionals working with children to report child pornography activities; and
14 – Requires Internet Service Providers to report child pornography
Cambodian law does not have provisions that require professionals who work with children to report child
pornography activities to relevant authorities when they learn of incidents involving children’s participation in
pornographic materials. In addition, Cambodian law does not have provisions that require Internet Service
Providers (ISPs) to report child pornography when they learn of it on their own networks.

However, according to the 1st and 2nd National Report on the Implementation of the Optional Protocol to the
Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography (2002-
2010) prepared by the Cambodia National Council for Children (CNCC), 171 the Cambodian Government issued
guidelines and measures to suppress and prevent the dissemination of child and women pornography, which
include the following: 1) blocking Internet IP addresses that can transfer obscene images; and 2) creating an
Inter-Ministerial Committee to monitor and suppress all means of transmission of obscene images, the sale or
rent of obscene film or video.

15 – Has telephone or online hotlines to enable the public to report child abuse
Cambodia has telephone hotlines to enable the public to report child abuse.

According to the 1st and 2nd National Report on the Implementation of the Optional Protocol to the Convention
on the Rights of Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography prepared by the
Cambodia National Council for Children (CNCC), 172 the Ministry of Interior (MoI) established the Department of
Anti-Trafficking and Juvenile Protection. This Department has set up a 24-hour hotline for receiving complaints
from victims in order to fulfill a duty to suppress offenses and protect victims of human trafficking and sexual
exploitation.

There are NGOs in Cambodia that have worked indirectly with the Cambodian Government to establish hotline
numbers to protect children (and women). For example, Friends International manages a program called
ChildSafe 173, which provides a 24-hour hotline operating in Phnom Penh with the hotline number 012-311-
112. 174

In addition, Child Helpline Cambodia 175 provides free, 24 hour phone counseling, information, referral, and
follow-up services for children and youth up to 25 years old in Cambodia. If it is known that a child is being
abused or exploited, the public may call the free helpline (1280) or send a text message to 1293.

16 – Creates data retention and data preservation provisions
Cambodian law does not have data retention or data preservation provisions.

17 – Requires the identification of the user of public computers in cybercafés
Cambodia does not have legislation or regulation that requires the identification of users of public computers in
cybercafés.

However, the Cambodian Government (Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, MOPT) issued Circular No.
1815 on Preventive Measures on Certain Illegal Activities in the Businesses of Internet Café Service (dated
November 12, 2012) (also known as “Circular on Preventive Measures related to Internet Café Service”)
(hereafter referred to as “Circular on Preventive Measures related to Internet Café Service”). 176

The Cambodian Government stipulates that one of the purposes of issuing the Circular on Preventive Measures
related to Internet Café Service is to eliminate the use of telecommunication and information technologies by
criminals to commit offenses such as pornography or other immoral acts, which have affected national tradition
and social morality.

Article 3 of the Circular on Preventive Measures related to Internet Café Service prescribes that all Internet cafés
are not allowed to be used by guests to check any pornography websites, which lead to crimes such as rape,
domestic violence, etc. Article 4 of this Circular further articulates that Internet cafés are not allowed to be used
for committing crimes such as illegal drug trafficking, human trafficking, money laundering, inter-border sexual
exploitation, which has a negative effect on the nation’s dignity and prestige. In addition, Article 1 of the same
Circular provides that an Internet café which was opened and planned to open its service near an educational
institution or school must relocate to a distance of 500 meters from the educational institution or school to
avoid disturbing students.

18 – Has a national plan to combat violence against children
The Cambodian Government adopted a National Plan of Action on the Suppression of Human Trafficking,
Smuggling, Labor and Sexual Exploitation (S.T.S.L.S.) (2011-2013) 177 to combat violence against children. It is also
noted that the “National Plan of Action on the Suppression of Human Trafficking, Smuggling, Labor and Sexual
Exploitation (S.T.S.L.S.) (2011-2013)” was recently referred to the National Committee to Counter Trafficking
(N.C.C.T) as a consequence of a review of the strategy and its implementation. 178

19 – Has ratified the CRC and the OPSC
    • Cambodia acceded to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on October 15, 1992. 179

In China, the Constitution of China (adopted on December 4, 1982 and last amended on March 14, 2004) 186
(hereafter referred to as the “Constitution”) has provisions that protect children’s rights. Specifically, Article 49
of the Constitution 187 specifies that maltreatment of children is prohibited.

Laws which protect children’s rights and/or govern violence against children are as follows:
   • Criminal Law (adopted on July 1, 1979 and last amended by the 8th Amendment to the Criminal Law on

Furthermore, Article 2 of the Law on the Protection of Minors stipulates that “minors” as used in this Law refer

such contents as may induce juveniles to violate laws or commit criminal offenses, and such contents as may
impair the physical and mental health of juveniles, contents that exaggerate violence, pornography, gambling,
terror, etc. Article 31, paragraph 2 of this Law further articulates that no unit or individual may, by means of
telecommunications, computer network, etc., provide such contents and information about such contents that
may impair the physical and mental health of juveniles as prescribed by the preceding paragraph.

Anyone or any unit who violates Article 31 of the Law on Prevention of Juvenile Delinquency shall be subject to
fine and confiscation of the illegal gains by the competent government department pursuant to Article 53 of this
Law.

28 – Has legislation regarding cyberbullying
China does not have legislation regarding cyberbullying.

According to a survey conducted by Microsoft in 2012, 70% of Chinese children reported experiencing
cyberbullying. Accordingly, China ranked the first amongst the seven Asia Pacific countries covered by the
survey, including Australia, China, India, Japan, Malaysia, Pakistan, and Singapore. 242

29 – Has legislation concerning sexting
Sexting is possibly criminalized in China as stated below.

Articles 363 and 364 of the Criminal Law, along with the Judicial Interpretation 2004 and Judicial Interpretation
2010, can be used for criminalizing sexting in China. Specifically, Articles 1 and 3 of the Judicial Interpretation
2004 state that those using the Internet or mobile telecommunications terminals to disseminate obscene
electronic information, with or without the aim of profit, shall be punished in accordance with Article 363,
paragraph 1 and Article 364, paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, as the case may be.

However, the Chinese Government only punishes those who spread obscene electronic information or
pornography “in public” and “in serious circumstances”. 243 Thus, sexting between acquaintances using mobile
phones is not generally punished. The term “serious circumstances” refers to sending a large quantity of texts
containing or depicting lewd messages to a large quantity of recipients pursuant to Articles 1 to 5 of the Judicial
Interpretation 2004.

It shall be strictly prohibited for any organization or individual to sell, rent, or disseminate by any other means to minors, books, newspapers, magazines or
audio-visual products of pornography, violence, wanton killing and terror that are pernicious to minors.
241
      Article 51 of Law on Protection of Minors
Whoever sells, rents or disseminates by any other means to minors pornographic books, newspapers, magazines or audio-visual products shall be given
heavier punishment according to law.

Democratic People’s Republic of Korea

The Constitution of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (adopted on December 27, 1972, last amended
and supplemented on April 13, 2012) 244 (hereafter referred to as “Constitution”) contains provisions for the
protection of children’s rights. Specifically, Article 31 of the Constitution articulates that “In the Democratic
People’s Republic of Korea, the minimum working age is 16 years old. The State shall prohibit child labor under
the stipulated working age.”

Furthermore, the laws which protect children’s rights and/or govern violence against children are as follows:
    • Child Rights Protection Act (adopted on December 22, 2010) 245
    • Family Law (adopted on October 24, 1990, last amended and supplemented on December 15, 2009) 246
    • Criminal Law (adopted on March 3, 1950, last amended and supplemented on May 14, 2012) 247
       (hereafter referred to as “Criminal Law 2012”)

Criminal Law 2012 has several provisions which criminalize acts that infringe on the rights of children or acts
committed against children. Article 181 of Criminal Law 2012 specifies that a person who assigns work to a
minor under the working age shall be punished by short-term labor for not more than one year. In addition,
Article 248 of Criminal Law 2012 makes it illegal to encourage a minor under the age of 17 years to commit or
take part in a crime, and thus to become delinquent, and provides for punishment by reform through labor for
not more than three years. In cases where the person commits a grave offense, he or she shall be punishable by
reform through labor for at least three years up to five years.

In addition, the Family Law contains several provisions which protect children’s rights as elaborated below.
Article 6 of the Family Law declares that it is the State’s policy to specifically protect the interests of children and
mothers. Article 37 of the Family Law discusses the duties of family members with the ability to support minors
and incompetents. In the case that there are no family members with the ability to support minors and
incompetents, the State shall support such citizens pursuant to Article 38 of the Family Law. Any citizen who
violates the Family Law shall be punished by administrative or criminal penalties in accordance with the court’s
decisions or rulings based upon Article 54 of the Family Law.

Moreover, Article 4 of the Child Rights Protection Law articulates that, “It is the State’s policy to guarantee
children’s rights and interests on a priority basis.” Moreover, Article 19 of the Child Rights Protection Law forbids
an institution, corporate association, organization, or individual to procure a child for labor, while defining the
child as anyone under 17 years old for the purposes of this Law. Pursuant to Article 62 of the Child Rights
Protection Law, the Law imposes criminal responsibilities or administrative liabilities on any staff member at any

EXTRACTS OF LEGISLATION RELATED TO THE TABLE:

1 – Has legislation specific to child pornography
The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea does not have legislation specific to child pornography. Although
Articles 183 248 and Article 184 of Criminal Law 2012 249 address offenses involving music, dance, drawings,
photographs, books, video recordings, or electronic media that reflect decadent, carnal, or foul contents
(hereafter also referred to as “decadent objects”), there are no provisions that increase penalties against those
who commit such offenses against children under Criminal Law 2012.

Article 183, paragraph 1 of Criminal Law 2012 makes it an offense to, without authorization, import, make,
distribute, or illegally keep decadent objects punishable by short-term labor for not more than one year. When a
person commits a grave offense with respect to offenses stipulated in Article 183, paragraph 1 of Criminal Law
2012, said offender shall be punished with reform through labor for not more than five years pursuant to Article
183, paragraph 2 of Criminal Law 2012.

In addition, Article 184, paragraph 1 of Criminal Law 2012 prescribes that if a person watches or listens to
decadent objects, or if a person performs decent acts by himself or herself, such person shall be subject to
short-term labor for not more than one year. In cases where a person commits a grave offense in regard to
offenses as provided in Article 184, paragraph 1 of Criminal Law 2012, such person shall be liable to reform
through labor for not more than two years according to Article 184, paragraph 2 of Criminal Law 2012.

Article 250 of Criminal Law 2012 stipulates that in cases where many men and women gather and engage in
obscene activities, such people shall be liable to punishment by short-term labor for not more than one year. In
cases where the foregoing act is grave, such person shall be punished by reform through labor for not more than
five years according to Article 250 of Criminal Law 2012.

2 – Has a clear definition of child pornography
The law of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea does not provide a clear definition of child pornography.
Criminal Law 2012 also does not define “decadent objects” punishable by Article 183 of this Law.

However, “decadent objects” as specified in Article 183 of Criminal Law 2012 shall include music, dance,
drawings, photographs, books, video recordings, or electronic media that reflects decadent, carnal, or foul
contents.

248

3 – Considers everyone under 18 as a potential victim of activities related to child pornography
The law of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea does not provide explicit provisions which consider
everyone under 18 years of age as a potential victim of activities related to child pornography, regardless of the
age of sexual consent.

With regard to the definition of a “child”, there are disparities in the national laws of the Democratic People’s
Republic of Korea.

Article 2 of the Child Rights Protection Law defines a “child” as a person under the age of 16 years. However,
Article 248 of Criminal Law 2012, which criminalizes encouraging a minor to commit a crime, indicates that a
“minor” for the purpose of this Article is anyone below 17 years of age.

In the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the age of consent to sexual activity is 15 years for women and
men pursuant to Article 281 of Criminal Law 2012 that reads, “A person who has sexual intercourse with a minor
under the age of fifteen shall be punished by short-term labor for not more than one year. In cases where the
foregoing act is committed multiple times, he or she shall be punished by reform through labor for more than
five years.”

distributes, or illegally keeps music, dance, drawings, photographs, books, video recordings, or “electronic
media” that reflects decadent, carnal, or foul contents.

Furthermore, Article 184 of Criminal Law 2012 makes it an offense to watch or listen to music, dance, drawings,
photographs, books, video recordings, or “electronic media” that reflect decadent, carnal, or foul contents or to
perform decadent acts by himself or herself.

5 – Criminalizes possession of child pornography
The law of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea does not have explicit provisions that criminalize
possession of child pornography, with or without the intent to distribute. However, while not specific to child
pornography, Article 183 of Criminal Law 2012 punishes any person who illegally keeps music, dance, drawings,
photographs, books, video recordings, or electronic media that reflects decadent, carnal, or foul contents.

6 – Criminalizes virtual images and sexually exploitative representations of children
While not specific to child pornography, the law of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea criminalizes illicit
activities involving decadent objects, which may include sexually exploitative representations of persons.
Specifically, Article 183 of Criminal Law 2012 criminalizes activities involving “drawings” that reflect decadent,
carnal, or foul contents.

7 – Addresses the criminal liability of children involved in pornography
The law of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea does not address the criminal liability of children involved
in pornography as long as they are victims and not offenders.

Korea is 14 years of age pursuant to Article 11 of Criminal Law 2012 and Article 48 of the Child Rights Protection

The law of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea does not establish criminal liability of legal persons for
production or commercialization of “decadent objects” as referred to in Criminal Law 2012. However, Article 21
of Criminal Law 2012 stipulates that, “Regarding the mastermind and his followers (or assistants) in a criminal
group (or criminal organization), they shall be punished in accordance with the provisions concerning the crime
aimed to be committed by such criminal group (or criminal organization) and the mastermind shall be punished
more severely.”

9 – Recognizes extraterritorial jurisdiction over child pornography offenses when the alleged offender is a
national of the State
The Democratic People's Republic of Korea establishes its extraterritorial jurisdiction over offenses involving
decadent objects as provided in Articles 183 and 184 of Criminal Law 2012, which might also cover child
pornography offenses, when the alleged offender is its national. Article 8 of Criminal Law 2012 states that, “This

commit offenses against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea or against Korean citizens in another
country.”

such offenses.

However, the law of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea provides for the confiscation of the criminal’s
property, regardless of whether such property is used to commit or facilitate the crimes or constitutes proceeds
derived from such crimes, as one of the types of punishment pursuant to Articles 27 250 and 34 of Criminal Law

child for pornographic purposes. Section 14 of this Act 271 also specifies punishment for using a child for
pornographic purposes. In addition, Section 15 of the same Act also criminalizes storage of any pornographic

                                                                                127

Explanation – For the purposes of this section, the expression “use a child” shall include involving a child through any medium, like print, electronic,
computer or any other technology for penetration, production, offering, transmitting, publishing, facilitating and distribution of the pornographic
materials.


                                                                                  128
        form involving a child” under Section 15 of this Act that punishes any person who stores such material for
        commercial purposes.

        The word “any form of media” mentioned in Section13 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses
        Act includes a program or advertisement telecast by television channels or on the Internet or in any
        electronic or printed form. The Explanation to Section 13 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses
        Act further articulates that the expression “use a child”, for the purposes of this Section, shall include
        involving a child through any medium like print, electronic, computer, or any other technology for
        preparation, production, offering, transmitting, publishing, facilitating, and distribution of the pornographic
        materials for the purposes of this Section.

        (3) Child pornography in electronic form
        Pursuant to Section 67B of the IT Act, “child pornography in any electronic form” shall include any materials
        in any electronic form which (a) depict children engaged in sexually explicit acts or conduct; or (b) depict
        children in an obscene or indecent or sexually explicit manner.

        Moreover, according to Section 2 (1) (r) of the IT Act, the term “electronic form”, with reference to the term
        “information”, means any information generated, sent, received, or stored in media, magnetic, optical,
        computer memory, micro film, computer generated micro fiche, or similar device. Pursuant to Section 2 (1)
        (v) of the IT Act, the term “information” includes data, message, text, images, sound, voice, codes, computer
        programs, software and databases, or micro film or computer-generated microfiche.

3 – Considers everyone under 18 as a potential victim of activities related to child pornography
Indian law considers everyone under 18 years of age as a potential victim of activities related to child
pornography, regardless of the age of sexual consent.

Section 2 (1) (d) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act states that the term “child” means any
person below the age of 18 years.

In addition, the Explanation to Section 67B of the IT Act states that for the purpose of this Section, “children”
refers to persons who have not completed the age of 18 years old.

In India, the age of consent to sexual intercourse is 18 years for women pursuant to Section 375 of the Penal
Code (amended by the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013).

4 – Criminalizes accessing or downloading child pornography images
Section 67B (b) of the IT Act criminalizes browsing and downloading any material in any electronic form which
depicts children in an obscene or indecent or sexually explicit manner.

5 – Criminalizes possession of child pornography
Indian law possibly criminalizes possession of child pornography without the intent to distribute, although the
law uses the term “storage” rather than “possession” of child pornography as elaborated below.

Section 15 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act 277 criminalizes storage of any pornographic
material in any form involving a child for commercial purposes.


277
      Section 15 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act (Punishment for storage of pornographic material involving a child)


                                                                              129
Furthermore, while not specific to child pornography, Indian law also criminalizes “possession” of any obscene
objects for the purpose of hire, sale, distribution, or public exhibition/public circulation, etc. pursuant to Section
292 (2) (a) of the Penal Code which reads: “(a) sells, lets to hire, distributes, publicly exhibits or in any manner
puts into circulation, or for purposes of sale, hire, distribution, public exhibition or circulation, makes, produces
or has in his possession any obscene book, pamphlet, paper, drawing, painting, representation or figure or any
other obscene object whatsoever”.

6 – Criminalizes virtual images and sexually exploitative representations of children
Indian law possibly criminalizes illicit acts related to materials depicting children in sexually explicit act, etc. in
electronic form, including virtual images and sexually exploitative representations of children, which do not
necessarily use real children in their production.

In terms of virtual images of children, Section 67B (b) of the IT Act specifically punishes anyone who creates text
or digital images or collects, browses, downloads, seeks, advertises, promotes, exchanges, or distributes
material in any electronic form depicting children in an obscene or indecent or sexually explicit manner.

Regarding sexually exploitative representations of children, Section 67B of the IT Act applies to sexually
exploitative representations of children including any book, pamphlet, paper, writing, drawing, painting,
“representation”, or figure in electronic form.

7 – Addresses the criminal liability of children involved in pornography
Indian law does not address the criminal liability of children involved in pornography for their participation as
long as they are victims and not the offenders.

In the case of a child offender, Section 82 of the Penal Code states that nothing is an offense which is done by a
child under seven years of age. Section 83 of this Code further articulates that nothing is an offense which is
done by a child above seven years of age and under 12 years, who has not attained sufficient maturity of
understanding to judge of the nature and consequences of his conduct on that occasion.

Section 34 (1) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act 278 stipulates that a child who commits an
offense under this Act shall be dealt with the under the provisions of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of
Children) Act.

8 – Establishes criminal liability of legal persons for production or commercialization of child pornography
The Penal Code establishes the criminal liability of legal persons for production or commercialization of obscene
objects stipulated in this Code, which might also cover activities related to child pornography. Specifically,
Section 11 of the same Code states that the word “person” includes any Company or Association or body of
persons whether incorporated or not.




Any person, who stores, for commercial purposes, any pornographic material in any form involving a child, shall be punished with imprisonment of either
description which may extend to three years, or a fine, or both.
278
  Section 34 (1) of the Protection of Children From Sexual Offenses Act (Procedure in case of commission of offense by child and determination of age by
Special Court)
Where any offense under this Act is committed by a child, such child shall be dealt with under the provisions of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of
Children Act, 2000.


                                                                            130
In addition, regarding offenses involving materials depicting children in a sexually explicit act, etc. in electronic
form, Section 85 of the IT Act 279 has provisions establishing penalties for offenses committed by companies.
According to Section 85 (1) of the IT Act, in the event that a person committing contravention of any of the
provisions of the IT Act or of any rule, direction, or order made thereunder is a company, every person who was
in charge of, and responsible to, the company for the conduct of the company’s business, as well as “the
company” itself, shall be responsible for the contravention and punished. However, any individual shall be
exempted from such liability if he proves that contravention has occurred without his knowledge or that he
exercised all due diligence to prevent such contravention.

In cases where it is proved that contravention has taken place with the consent or connivance of or is
attributable to any neglect on the part of any director, manager, secretary, or other officer of the company such
director, manager, secretary, or other officer shall be held liable for the contravention and punished accordingly
as provided in Section 85 (2) of the IT Act.

9 – Recognizes extraterritorial jurisdiction over child pornography offenses when the alleged offender is a
national of the State
India establishes its extraterritorial jurisdiction over obscenity offenses stipulated in the Penal Code, which can
be applicable to child pornography offenses as well, if the alleged offender is a national of India as elaborated
below.

Section 4 of the Penal Code provides that, “The provisions of this Code apply also to any offense committed by
any citizen of India in any place without and beyond India.” The Explanation to Section 4 of the Penal Code
states that the word "offence" in this Section includes every act committed outside of India, which, if committed
in India, would be punishable under this Code.

In addition, the Supreme Court of India has ruled that Indian citizens who commit crimes while abroad can in
some cases be tried in India by stating that the provisions of the Penal Code have been extended to offenses
committed by any citizen of India in any place within and beyond India by virtue of Section 4 of the Penal Code
thereof. 280



279
      Section 85 of the IT Act (Offenses by companies)
              (1) Where a person committing a contravention of any of the provisions of this Act or of any rule, direction or order made thereunder is a
              company, every person who, at the time the contravention was committed, was in charge of, and was responsible to, the company for the
              conduct of business of the company as well as the company, shall be guilty of the contravention and shall be liable to be proceeded against and
              punished accordingly:
              Provided that nothing contained in this sub-section shall render any such person liable to punishment if he proves that the contravention took
              place without his knowledge or that he exercised all due diligence to prevent such contravention.
              (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), where a contravention of any of the provisions of this Act or of any rule, direction or
              order made thereunder has been committed by a company and it is proved that the contravention has taken place with the consent or
              connivance of, or is attributable to any neglect on the part of, any director, manager, secretary or other officer of the company, such director,
              manager, secretary or other officer shall also be deemed to be guilty of the contravention and shall be liable to be proceeded against and
              punished accordingly.
              Explanation.—For the purposes of this section,—
                         (i) "company" means anybody corporate and includes a firm or other association of individuals; and
                         (ii) "director", in relation to a firm, means a partner in the firm.

Section 4 of the Penal Code states that its provisions also cover offenses committed by any citizen of India in any
place without and beyond India and by any person on any ship or aircraft registered in India wherever it may be.

10 – Recognizes extraterritorial jurisdiction over child pornography offenses when the victim is a national of
the State
The Penal Code does not provide an explicit provision that establishes extraterritorial jurisdiction of the Indian
Courts over obscenity offenses specified in this Code, which might cover child pornography offenses, when the
victim is a national of India.

However, Section 75 (1) of the IT Act states that, “Subject to the provisions of sub-section (2), the provisions of
this Act shall apply also to any offence or contravention committed outside India by any person irrespective of
his nationality.” Section 75 (2) of the IT Act further articulates that, “For the purposes of sub-section (1), this Act
shall apply to an offence or contravention committed outside India by any person if the act or conduct
constituting the offence or contravention involves a computer, computer system or computer network located
in India.”

11 – Establishes the confiscation of assets used to commit or facilitate child pornography offenses
Indian law provides for the confiscation of assets used to commit or facilitate offenses involving materials
depicting children in a sexually explicit act, etc. in electronic form.

Section 76 of the IT Act 281 states that any computer, computer system, floppies, compact disks, tape drives, or
any other accessories related thereto, in respect of which any provision of this Act, rules, orders, or regulations
made thereunder has been or is being contravened, shall be liable to confiscation. However, Section 76 of this
Act further articulates that in cases where it is established to the satisfaction of the court adjudicating the
confiscation that the person in whose possession, power, or control of any such computer, computer system,
floppies, compact disks, tape drives, or any other accessories relating thereto, is found not responsible for the
contravention of the provisions of this Act, rules, orders, or regulations made thereunder, the court may, instead
of making an order for confiscation of such computer, computer system, floppies, compact disks, tape drives, or
any other accessories related thereto, make such other order authorized by this Act against the person
contravening of the provisions of this Act, rules, orders, or regulations made thereunder as it may think fit.

12 – Establishes the confiscation of proceeds derived from child pornography offenses
Indian law does not contain provisions which allow for the confiscation of proceeds derived from child
pornography offenses.




281
      Section 76 of the IT Act (Confiscation)
Any computer, computer system, floppies, compact disks, tape drives or any other accessories related thereto, in respect of which any provision of this
Act, rules, orders or regulations made thereunder has been or is being contravened, shall be liable to confiscation:
Provided that where it is established to the satisfaction of the court adjudicating the confiscation that the person in whose possession, power or control of
any such computer, computer system, floppies, compact disks, tape drives or any other accessories relating thereto is found is not responsible for the

such computer, computer system, floppies, compact disks, tape drives or any other accessories related thereto, make such other order authorised by this
Act against the person contravening of the provisions of this Act, rules, orders or regulations made thereunder as it may think fit.


                                                                            132
13 – Requires professionals working with children to report child pornography activities
Indian law does not have provisions that require professionals who work with children to report child
pornography activities to relevant authorities when they learn of incidents involving the use of a child in
pornographic materials. 282

However, Section 19 (1) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act requires any person (including
the child) who has apprehension that an offense under this Act is likely to be committed or has knowledge that
such an offense has already been committed, to provide such information to the Special Juvenile Police Unit; or
the local police. As stated above, Section 13 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act explicitly
prescribes that activities using children for pornographic purposes shall be an offense. Moreover, Section 14 (1)
of this Act punishes any person who contravenes Section 13 of the same Act.

In addition, according to Section 32 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act (amended by
Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Amendment Act, 2006), 283 any child in need of care and
protection may be produced before the Child Welfare Committee by one of the following persons: (1) childline
or a registered voluntary organization or any other voluntary organization or agency as may be recognized by
the State Government; (2) any social worker or a public spirited citizen; (3) any public servant; (4) any police
officer or special juvenile police unit or designated police officer; or (4) the child himself.

14 – Requires Internet Service Providers to report child pornography
Indian law does not provide explicit provisions that require Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to report child
pornography when they discover it on their own networks. 284

However, Section 20 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act 285 mandates any personnel of the
media, hotel, lodge, hospital, club, studio, or photographic facilities, upon being aware of any material or object

      Section 20 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act (Obligation of media, studio and photographic facilities to report cases)
Any personnel of the media or hotel or lodge or hospital or club or studio or photographic facilities, by whatever name called, irrespective of the number
of persons employed therein, shall, on coming across any material or object which is sexually exploitative of the child (including pornographic, sexually-
related or making obscene representation of a child or children) through the use of any medium, shall provide such information to the Special Juvenile
Police Unit, or to the local police, as the case may be.


                                                                                   133
which is sexually exploitative of a child (including pornographic, sexually related, or making obscene
representations of a child or children) through the use of any medium, to provide such information to the
Special Juvenile Police Unit or to the local police, as the case may be.

Also, Section 21 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act 286 punishes anyone who violates Section
20 of this Act by failing to report a case involving a sexual offense against a child provided under this Act.

Furthermore, although Indian law does not have explicit provisions that require ISPs to report child pornography
when they are aware of it, Section 79 of the IT Act and Information Technology (Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules
address intermediaries’ liabilities for making available third party content as stated below.

Section 79 (1) of the IT Act generally protects intermediaries from being liable for transmitting or hosting third-
party information, data, or communication links made available by them, so long as they exercise due diligence
under Section 79 (2) of the IT Act and observe the Information Technology (Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules.

However, Section 79 (3) of the IT Act provides that an intermediary shall be liable for the acts performed by the
third party if: (a) the intermediary has conspired or abetted or aided or induced the commission of the unlawful
act provided under the IT Act; or (b) the intermediary receives actual knowledge or is notified by the appropriate
Government or its agency that any information, data, or communication link residing in or connected to a
computer resource controlled by the intermediary is being used to commit unlawful acts, but fails to
immediately remove or disable access to the materials in any manner.

In addition, the Information Technology (Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules provides details on intermediaries’
duties with respect to due diligence of intermediaries mentioned in Section 79 (2) of the IT Act as stated below.

Section 3 (4) of Information Technology (Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules requires intermediaries, on whose
computer system the information is stored or hosted or published, upon obtaining knowledge by itself or having
been informed by an affected person in writing or through email and signed with an electronic signature, about
any such information mentioned in Section 3 (2) of these Rules, to: 1) disable such information within 36 hours;
and 2) preserve such information and associated records for at least 90 days for investigation purposes. The
prescribed information shall include information that: 1) is obscene or pornographic; 2) harms minors in any
way; or 3) violates any law for the time being in force according to Section 3 (2) (b), (c), and (e) of the same
Rules.

16 – Creates data retention or data preservation provisions
The Information Technology Act contains two Sections that establish data retention and preservation
requirements for intermediaries, although the Indian legal system currently only provides specific rules on data
retention related to the identification of users of public computers in cybercafés and their history of website
access as stated below.

Section 67C of the IT Act 288 articulates that intermediaries 289 shall preserve and retain such information 290 as
may be specified for such duration and in such manner and format as the Central Government may prescribe.
These Rules under Section 67C of the IT Act have yet to be promulgated by the Indian Government as of January
29, 2015.

Section 79 (2) (c) of the IT Act further provides that intermediaries are exempted from liability for third party
content provided that they observe due diligence while discharging their duties under this Act and also observe
such other guidelines as the Central Government may prescribe. The Information Technology (Guidelines for
Cyber Café) Rules were issued in exercise of powers conferred by Section 79 (2) of the IT Act in order to establish
the Government’s standard for what constitutes “due diligence” by an intermediary. These Rules contain
provisions addressing the duties of cybercafé owners, as one of the intermediaries, to retain data as part of their
duty to observe due diligence under Section 79 (2) of the IT Act as stated below.

Cybercafé owners shall be responsible for storing and maintaining: a) the history of websites accessed using the
computer resources at the cybercafé; and b) logs of proxy servers installed at the cybercafé for each user or for
each access for at least one year pursuant to Section 5 of the Information Technology (Guidelines for Cyber

      Section 67C of the IT Act (Preservation and retention of information by intermediaries)
        (1)   Intermediary shall preserve and retain such information as may be specified for such duration and in such manner and format as the Central
              Government may prescribe.
        (2)   Any intermediary who intentionally or knowingly contravenes the provisions of sub-section (1) shall be punished with an imprisonment for a
              term which may extend to three years and also be liable to fine.
289
    The definition of the term “intermediary” shall include ISPs and cybercafé operators according to Section 2(1)(i) of the Information Technology
(Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules, Section 2(1)(g) of the Information Technology (Guidelines for Cyber Café) Rules, and Section 2(1)(w) of the IT Act.
290
   The definition of the term “information” includes “data” pursuant to Section 2(1)(f) of the Information Technology (Guidelines for Cyber Café) Rules,
Section 2 (1) (h) of the Information Technology (Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules, and Section 2(1)(v) of the IT Act.

20 – Age of criminal liability
In India, criminal responsibly starts at the age of seven years pursuant to Section 82 of the Penal Code. In
addition, Section 83 of this Code stipulates that nothing is an offense which is done by a child older than seven
years of age and under 12 years of age, who has not yet attained sufficient maturity of understanding to judge
the nature and consequences of his conduct on that occasion.

21 – Has legislation that specifically addresses the use of ICTs to commit crimes against children
The principal law governing crimes against children committed by the use of ICTs in India is the Information
Technology Act (amended by the Information Technology (Amendment) Act, 2008) (also known as “IT Act”).

Section 67B (b) of the IT Act criminalizes downloading or browsing of material in electronic form depicting
children in an obscene or indecent or sexually explicit manner.

22 – Criminalizes: 1) child trafficking with the intent of producing pornography; and 2) advertising child sex
tourism online
Indian law does not have provisions that explicitly criminalize child trafficking with the intent of producing
pornography.

However, Section 370 of the Penal Code (last amended by the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013)
criminalizes child trafficking for the purposes of “any form of sexual exploitation” as stated below. Section 370
(1) of the Penal Code makes it an offense to traffic a person for the purpose of exploitation. Furthermore,
Explanation 1 to Section 370 (1) of this Code states that the expression “exploitation” shall include any form of
sexual exploitation. Moreover, Section 370 (4) of the same Code stipulates that where the offense involves the
trafficking of a minor, it shall be punishable with rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than
ten years, but which may extend to imprisonment for life, and shall also be liable to a fine.

In addition, the provisions under the Penal Code which criminalize child trafficking and related crimes are as
follows: (a) procurement of a minor girl below 18 years of age (366A); (b) importation of girls less than 21 years
of age from the state of Jammu and Kashmir to any other state, or from a foreign country to anywhere in India
(Section 366B); and (c) selling or buying of a minor girl below 18 years of age for the purposes of prostitution,
etc. (Sections 372 299 and 373 300) of the Penal Code.

Indian law does not contain provisions that specifically criminalize advertising child sex tourism online. However,
Section 67B (b) of the IT Act criminalizes advertising or promoting materials in any electronic form depicting
children in obscene or indecent or sexually explicit manner.



299
      Section 372 of the Penal Code (Selling minor for purposes of prostitution, etc.)
Whoever sells, lets to hire, or otherwise disposes of any person under the age of eighteen years with intent that such person shall at any age be employed
or used for the purpose of prostitution or illicit intercourse with any person or for any unlawful and immoral purpose, or knowing it to be likely that such
person will at any age be employed or used for any such purpose, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend
to ten years, and shall be liable to fine.
300
      Section 373 of the Penal Code (Buying minor for purposes of prostitution, etc.)
Whoever buys, hires or otherwise obtains possession of any person under the age of eighteen years with intent that such person shall at any age be
employed or used for the purpose of prostitution or illicit intercourse with any person or for any unlawful and immoral purpose, of knowing it to be likely
that such person will at any age be employed or used for any purpose, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may
extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.


                                                                               138
Furthermore, the Code of Conduct for Safe & Honorable Tourism was adopted by the Indian Government,
Ministry of Tourism in 2010. This is not a legally binding instrument, but a guideline of conduct to enable the
Indian travel and tourism industry to aid in the prevention of sex tourism and forms of sexual exploitation,
particularly of women and children.

The Code of Conduct for Safe & Honorable Tourism prohibits Internet usage that promotes or seeks any contacts
for sex tourism or for the search of pornographic material. It is also forbidden to use sexually explicit images or
concepts/images that may compromise the safety of individuals for marketing purposes stipulated in this Code
of Conduct. The same Code of Conduct further articulates that an unambiguous company policy shall be set up
to ensure that marketing and advertising does not support the promotion of sexual exploitation or promotion of
sexually explicit images. 301

23 – Has legislation that criminalizes online grooming as a standalone offense
Although Indian law does not use the explicit term “online grooming”, acts constituting the online grooming of a
child shall be criminalized according to Sections 11 and 12 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses
Act. 302 Any person is deemed to commit sexual harassment upon a child if he, with sexual intent, repeatedly or
constantly follows or watches or contacts a child either directly or through electronic, digital, or any other
means, pursuant to Section 11 (iv) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act. Section 12 of this
Act 303 provides punishment for committing sexual harassment upon a child as specified by Section 11 of the
same Act. 304

In addition, the IT Act contains provisions that possibly address online grooming of a child and related crime as
stated below. Section 67B (c) of the IT Act punishes anyone who induces, cultivates, or entices children into an
online relationship with one or more children for sexually explicit acts.

Section 67B (d) of the IT Act also makes it an offense to facilitate abusing children online. However, the term
“facilitate abusing children online” is neither specified nor explained in the IT Act. The general wording
“facilitate abusing children online” under Section 67B (d) of the IT Act may cover online grooming unless there is

Although Indian law does not provide a definition of “online grooming”, it does address punishable acts which
shall constitute the offense of online grooming of children as stated above.

25 – Considers everyone under 18 as a potential victim of online grooming
Indian law considers everyone under age 18 as a potential victim of online grooming and related activities.

Section 2 (1) (d) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act states that “child” means any person
below the age of 18 years.

In addition, the Explanation to Section 67B of the IT Act states that for the purposes of this Section, the term
“children” refers to persons who have not yet completed 18 years of age.

Indonesian law does not provide explicit provisions criminalizing advertising child sex tourism online.

23, 24, 25, and 26 – Existence of legislation criminalizing online grooming, a clear definition of online
grooming, the age of a potential victim, and related crimes
Indonesian law does not have an explicit provision which criminalizes online grooming. In addition, Indonesian
law does not provide a clear definition of online grooming.

However, Article 7 of the Anti-Pornography Law prohibits every person from funding or facilitating acts involving
pornography, including pornography that explicitly contains child pornography. Those who violate Article 7 of
this Law shall be punishable by imprisonment for a minimum of two years and a maximum of 15 years and/or a

billion five hundred million rupiah) pursuant to Article 33 of the same Law.

In addition, Article 12 of Anti-Pornography Law prohibits any person from inviting, enticing, taking advantage of,
allowing, abusing the power, or coercing children to use pornography products or pornography services. Those
who contravene Article 12 of this Law shall be punished with imprisonment for a minimum of six months and a

and a maximum of Rp3,000,000,000.00 (three billion rupiah) pursuant to Article 38 of the same Law.

Indonesian law does not provide a clear definition of online grooming or sexual grooming.

In addition, even though there are no explicit provisions that consider everyone under the age of 18 as a
potential victim of online grooming in Indonesia, the age of a potential victim of an offense involving facilitating
or other types of soliciting activities related to pornography that explicitly contains child pornography is 18 years
pursuant to Article 1, paragraph 4 of the Anti-Pornography Law.

defined as photographs, recording media containing electromagnetic records (any record which is produced by
electronic, magnetic, or any other means unrecognizable by natural perceptive functions and is used for data-
processing by a computer; the same shall apply hereinafter) or any other medium which depicts the pose of a
child, which falls under any of the following items, in a visible way: (i) any pose of a child engaged in sexual
intercourse or any conduct similar to sexual intercourse; (ii) any pose of a child having his or her genital organs

the viewer’s sexual desire; (iii) any pose of a child wholly or partially naked, which deliberately exposes or
emphasizes the sexual parts (genitals organs, region around the genital organs, buttocks, or chest) and arouses
or stimulates the viewer’s sexual desire.




366
   The term “distribution of child pornography” used in Article 7 of the Child Pornography Prohibiting Act of 1999 shall be deemed to be replaced with a)
provision of child pornography to unspecified persons or a number of persons and other related acts (Article 7 (4) of Child Pornography Prohibiting Act of
2004 and Article 7 (6) of Child Pornography Prohibiting Act of 2014), b) production of child pornography with the purpose of provision to unspecified

3 – Considers everyone under 18 as a potential victim of activities related to child pornography
Japanese law considers every person under the age of 18 years as a potential victim of activities related to child
pornography defined and punishable by Articles 2, 7, and 8 of the Child Pornography Prohibiting Act. Article 2
(1) of this Act defines the term “child” as a person under 18 years old. Article 9 of the same Act prescribes that
lacking knowledge of the child’s age shall not be used as grounds for exemption from punishment unless there is
no negligence.

In Japan, the age of consent to sexual intercourse is 13 years for women pursuant Article 177 of the Penal
Code.369 Furthermore, the age of consent to indecent act is 13 years for women and men according to Article
176 of the Penal Code. 370 However, having sexual intercourse with a child (under 18 years of age) in return for
giving or promising remuneration to the child shall constitute a criminal offense according to Articles 2 (2) and 4
of the Child Pornography Prohibiting Act.

4 – Criminalizes accessing or downloading child pornography images
Japanese law criminalizes downloading child pornography images as stated below. Article 7 (1) of the Child
Pornography Prohibiting Act (last amended in 2014 and effective as of July 15, 2014) criminalizes possession of
child pornography or retention of electromagnetic records or any other records that depict poses of a child for
the purposes of satisfying one’s own sexual curiosity, regardless of the intent to distribute. This paragraph shall
be applicable to a person who, without a doubt, comes to possess the child pornography of his/her own will.

There is a one-year moratorium from the effective date on punishing those who violate Article 7 (1) of the Child
Pornography Prohibiting Act in order to give people in possession or retention of child pornography the time to
dispose of it.

5 – Criminalizes possession of child pornography
Possession of child pornography without the intent to distribute is a crime in Japan as provided below.

Article 3-2 of the Child Pornography Prohibiting Act (last amended in 2014) prohibits the possession of child
pornography and the retention (or storage) of electronic records of child pornography.

Furthermore, Article 7 (1) of the Child Pornography Prohibiting Act makes it an offense to possess child
pornography or to retain electronic records or any other records that depict poses of a child for the purposes of
satisfying one’s own sexual curiosity. Mere possession of child pornography shall be punishable by
imprisonment with work for not more than one year, or a fine of not more than 1 million yen. The application of
this paragraph shall be limited to a person who, without a doubt, comes to possess the child pornography of
his/her own will.


369
      Article 177 of the Penal Code (Rape)
 A person who, through assault or intimidation, forcibly commits a sexual intercourse with a female of not less than 13 years of age commits the crime of
rape and shall be punished by imprisonment with work for a definite term of not less than 3 years. The same shall apply to a person who commits a sexual
intercourse with a female under 13 years of age.
370
      Article 176 of the Penal Code (Forcible Indecency)
A person who, through assault or intimidation, forcibly commits an indecent act upon a male or female of not less than thirteen years of age shall be
punished by imprisonment with work for not less than 6 months but not more than 10 years. The same shall apply to a person who commits an indecent
act upon a male or female under thirteen years of age.




                                                                          160
Although the Amendment of the Child Pornography Prohibiting Act became effective as of July 15, 2014, there is
a one-year moratorium on punishment for possessing child pornography without the intent to distribute in
order to give possessors the time to discard of it.

In addition, possession of child pornography for the purposes of providing it to unspecified persons or a number
of persons, shall be subject to a heavier punishment than that for the simple possession of child pornography as
stipulated in Article 7 (3) and 7 (7) of the Child Pornography Prohibiting Act. 371

6 – Criminalizes virtual images and sexually exploitative representations of children
Japanese law does not criminalize the production, distribution, possession, and commercialization of child
pornography including virtual images and sexually exploitative representations of children that do not
necessarily use real children in their production.

There were concerns about infringement of freedom of expression in case of including cartoons, animations,
and games that involve virtual images and sexually exploitative representations of children into child
pornography provided under the Child Pornography Prohibiting Act. The amendment to revise the Child
Pornography Prohibiting Act (approved by both the Lower and Upper Houses of Parliament of Japan in June
2014 and effective as of July 15, 2014) excluded mention of sexually explicit manga comics, anime videos, and
computer-generated graphics, which was part of a draft amendment bill to revise the Child Pornography
Prohibiting Act. Thus, the current Child Pornography Prohibiting Act regulates child pornographic images
depicting real children. 372

7 – Addresses the criminal liability of children involved in pornography

Code.

8 – Establishes criminal liability of legal persons for production or commercialization of child pornography
Japanese law establishes the criminal liability of legal persons for production or commercialization of child
pornography. Pursuant to Article 11 of the Child Pornography Prohibiting Act, 373 both an individual offender
and a judicial person may be jointly accountable when a representative, a proxy, employee, or any other staff
member of a judicial person has committed any of the child pornography crimes as provided in paragraphs 2 to
8 of Article 7 of this Act.

9 – Recognizes extraterritorial jurisdiction over child pornography offenses when the alleged offender is a
national of the State
Japan establishes its extraterritorial jurisdiction over child pornography offenses prescribed in the Child
Pornography Prohibiting Act when the alleged offender is a national of Japan. Article 10 of the Child

national of Japan.

11 – Establishes the confiscation of assets used to commit or facilitate child pornography offenses; and
12 – Establishes the confiscation of proceeds derived from such offenses

Japanese law does not contain explicit provisions that require professionals who work with children to report
incidents involving children’s participation in pornographic materials to law enforcement agencies or other
relevant authorities when they learn of such incidents.

However, the Child Abuse Prevention Act requires anyone, who is aware of circumstances where a child is
suspected to be abused, to report to the relevant authorities as stated below.

2 (ii) of this Act 383 further articulates that the definition of the term “child abuse” in this Act shall include acts of
engaging in indecency against the child or causing the child to engage in indecency.

14 – Requires Internet Service Providers to report child pornography
Japanese legislation does not require Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to report to law enforcement agencies or
relevant authorities when ISPs discover suspected child pornography on their own networks.

However, pursuant to Article 16-3 of the Child Pornography Prohibiting Act 384, online service providers are
strongly urged to make an effort to cooperate with law enforcement and take measures to prevent the spread
of child pornography online.

15 – Has telephone or online hotlines to enable the public to report child abuse
Japan has a Childline (0120-99-7777), which is a telephone hotline established by the Child Support Center Japan
that provides counseling services for children who have issues related to bullying, abuse, and violence. 385

In addition, the Internet Hotline Center Japan enables Internet users to report illegal content or content harmful
to young people on the Internet. Online illegal or contents harmful to young people include child pornography
or online dating websites that allow adults to solicit children for sexual intercourse via such websites. The Center
analyzes all reports received, and illegal and harmful information is forwarded to the National Police Agency,
and then to the ISPs for deletion. In some cases, legal advisors are asked for a professional determination. 386

16 – Creates data retention or data preservation provisions

judicial police official to ask telecommunication business operators, etc. not to erase the source of
communication, destination, communication date and time, and other communication record for a fixed period

internet, business operators that provide telecommunications services necessary for distribution or inspection of information to unspecified persons
thorough the internet shall endeavor to cooperate with investigative authority, take measures for preventing submission of information pertaining to child
pornography based on the authority of administration of said business operator, and take other measures that contribute to the prevention of the such act
using the internet.

18 – Has a national plan to combat violence against children
Japan has a national policy to combat violence against children with a particular focus on the rights of children
and young people. The “Vision for Children and Young People (2010)” 389, which replaced the “National Youth
Development Policy (2008)” 390, outlines the Act on the Promotion of Development and Support for Children and
Young People (enacted by Act No. 79 of 2008 and amended by Act No. 71 of 2009).

The Vision for Children and Young People (2010) (hereafter referred to as “Youth Policy Vision”) provides
measures against crimes that harm the welfare of children and young people, including child pornography.

The measures described in the Youth Policy Vision state that, “In order to prevent children and young people
from becoming the victims of crime relating to child prostitution and child pornography, rigorous investigations
and appropriate treatment will be conducted, in addition to conducting public announcements and awareness-
raising activities for the society as a whole.” 391

The Youth Policy Vision further articulates that in particular, with regard to measures for eliminating child
pornography, comprehensive measures will be implemented in cooperation with relevant ministries and
agencies, including the promotion of a people’s movement for the elimination of child pornography, the

      a)     Promotion of efforts to cope with “cyberbullying” via off-school websites, etc. by taking effective
             measures for prevention, early detection, and preemptive moves toward resolving cyberbullying
             problems on the Internet;

             filter content harmful to young people and the dissemination of the services and software for filtering
             content harmful to young people; and
      c)     Promotion of measures to control cybercrimes, such as prohibited online dating sites, and child
             pornography cases on the Internet, so as to prevent young people from suffering crime damage via
             the Internet and to strengthen the enforcement systems necessary for that purpose. 394

20 – Age of criminal liability
Under Article 41 of the Penal Code, the minimum age of criminal liability in Japan is 14 years old.

The Juvenile Law adopts special measures with respect to the criminal cases of juveniles. For the criminal cases
of juveniles who are under 20 years old, the Juvenile Law is applied instead of the Criminal Procedure Law. The
Family Court has primary jurisdiction over such cases.

Children under age 14, however, are handled primarily by the child guidance center, as provided by the Child
Welfare Law, when they have committed acts, which, if committed by a person aged 14 or over, would
constitute a crime. These children under 14 years of age fall under the jurisdiction of the family court only when
the governor of the prefecture or the chief of the child guidance center refers them to the family court.

21 – Has legislation that specifically addresses the use of ICTs to commit crimes against children
The principal law that specifically addresses crimes against children with the use of ICTs is the Child Pornography
Prohibiting Act.

With respect to child pornography offenses, any person who provides electromagnetic records or any other
record that depicts the pose of a child, which falls under any of the items of Article 2 (3) of the Child
Pornography Prohibiting Act, in a visible way through electric telecommunication lines, shall be sentenced to
imprisonment with labor for not more than three years, or a fine of not more than three million yen, pursuant to
Article 7 (2) of this Act.

Article 2 (1) of the Act on the Promotion of Preventive Measures for Bullying provides that the term "bullying" as
used in this Act means an act which has a mental or physical influence against a child by children who are in the
same school as the child or in a certain personal relationship with the child (including that which is conducted
through the Internet) that makes the child who is the subject of the act to feel mental or physical pain.

Article 19 of the Act on the Promotion of Preventive Measures for Bullying deals with the promotion of
measures against bullying carried out through the Internet as stated below.

Article 19 (1) of the Act on the Promotion of Preventive Measures for Bullying states that an establisher of a
school and the school are required to conduct the necessary awareness activities for children enrolled in the
school, as well as their custodians (or parents) for the prevention and effective handling of bullying performed
through the Internet, based on the high degree of distribution of information, anonymity of the sender, and
other characteristics of information sent through the Internet. Article 19 (2) of this Act further articulates that
the State and local governments shall endeavor to develop a system that copes with cases related to bullying, as
well as support the efforts of affiliates and other relevant organizations to monitor in order to determine
whether they are involved in bullying children through the Internet. Moreover, Article 19 (3) of the same Act
provides that in cases where bullying is done through the Internet, a bullied child and the child's custodians (or
parents) may, as necessary, request that the Legal Affairs Bureau and District Legal Affairs Bureau cooperate
when the deletion of the information pertaining to bullying, or the disclosure of the Identification Information of
the sender prescribed in Article 4 (1) of the Act of Limitation of Liability for Damages of Specified
Telecommunications Service Providers and the Right to Demand Disclosure of Identification Information of the
Senders is requested.

    2. Organized crimes
The Supreme Court of Japan also ruled “concerning the number of crimes committed by a person who has
provided child pornography to unspecified persons or a number of persons and also possessed child
pornography for the purpose of providing the same to unspecified persons or a number of persons” under the
Act on Punishment of Activities Relating to Child Prostitution and Child Pornography. The defendant in the case
was charged for violation of the Act on Punishment of Activities Relating to Child Prostitution and Child
Pornography, and the Protection of Children, for selling obscene pictures and possessing obscene pictures for
the purpose of sale, and for violation of the Act on Punishment of Organized Crimes and Control of Crime
Proceeds.

Summary of Decision
1. Where a person provides child pornography to unspecified persons or a number of persons, and also
possesses child pornography for the purpose of providing the same to unspecified persons or a number of
persons, the crime of providing child pornography set forth in Article 7, paragraph (4) of the Act on Punishment
of Activities Relating to Child Prostitution and Child Pornography, and the Protection of Children and the crime
of possessing child pornography for the purpose of provision set forth in paragraph (5) of said Article can be
construed to constitute crimes for consolidated punishment.

2. Where a person sells and provides items which fall within both the category of child pornography and the
category of obscene objects under Article 175 of the Penal Code, to unspecified persons or a number of persons,
and also possesses these items for the purpose of selling and providing the same to unspecified persons or a
number of persons, on the grounds that the act of selling obscene objects and the act of providing child
pornography can be construed as a single act constituting multiple crimes, and the same applies to the
relationship between the act of possessing obscene objects for the purpose of sale and the act of possessing
child pornography for the purpose of provision, all of these acts as a whole constitute a single crime, provided
that the act of selling obscene objects and the act of possessing the same for the purpose of sale can be
regarded as collectively constituting a single crime. 402

imports, exports, displays, or sells magazines, photographs, films, videos, VCDs, DVDs, and “other items of child
pornography” shall be punished by imprisonment from one to three years and fined from 2,000,000 Kip to

7 – Addresses the criminal liability of children involved in pornography
Laotian law does not address the criminal liability of children involved in pornography for their participation as
long as they are victims and not offenders. However, Article 48 of the Law on the Protection of Rights and

8 – Establishes criminal liability of legal persons for production or commercialization of child pornography
Laotian law does not establish the criminal liability of legal persons for child pornography offenses prescribed in
the Law on the Protection of Rights and Interests of Children or pornography offenses stipulated in the Penal
Law. Specifically, Article 2 of the Penal Law 411 provides that an individual can only be charged with and punished
for an offence based on intentional or negligent acts deemed dangerous for society as defined in the Penal Law
or in other laws of the Lao People's Democratic Republic that define criminal penalties.

when the alleged offender is its national as stated below.

According to Article 4 of the Penal Law, 412 Lao citizens who commit offenses outside of the territory of the Lao
People's Democratic Republic shall be charged with and punished for such offenses if they are defined as
offenses under the Penal Law of the Lao People's Democratic Republic.

Further, the Penal Law provides a definition of the term “offenses” mentioned in Article 4 of this Law. Article 6
of the same Law 413 states that all acts and abstentions deemed dangerous to the political, economic, or social
system of the Lao People's Democratic Republic, to the property of the State, collectives or individuals, to the
lives, health, integrity, rights or freedom of the people, or to national security or public order as provided in the
Penal Law or in “other laws” of the Lao People's Democratic Republic that define criminal penalties shall be
considered offenses.




         •     Other prohibitions as provided by the laws and regulations.
411
      Article 2 of the Penal Law (Basis of Penal Responsibilities)
An individual can only be charged with and punished for an offence based on intentional or negligent acts deemed dangerous for society as defined in the
Penal Law or in other laws of the Lao People's Democratic Republic that define criminal penalties, and [such individual can be punished] only when a
decision is rendered by a court.
412
      Article 4 of the Penal Law (Application of Penal Law outside the Territory of the Lao People's Democratic Republic)
Lao citizens who commit offenses outside the territory of the Lao People's Democratic Republic shall be charged with and punished for such offenses if
they are defined [as offenses under] the Penal Law of the Lao People's Democratic Republic.

State, collectives or individuals, to the lives, health, integrity, rights or freedom of the people, or to national security or public order as provided in the
Penal Law or in other laws of the Lao People's Democratic Republic that define criminal penalties shall be considered offences.
All acts or abstentions with all the components of offences but resulting in damage under 500,000 Kip shall not be considered offences, except for acts of

                                                                              173
10 – Recognizes extraterritorial jurisdiction over child pornography offenses when the victim is a national of
the State

offenses as provided in Article 86 of the Law on the Protection of Rights and Interests of Children when the
victim is a national of the Lao People's Democratic Republic.

11 – Establishes the confiscation of assets used to commit or facilitate child pornography offenses; and
12 – Establishes the confiscation of proceeds derived from child pornography offenses
Article 34 of the Penal Law provides general provisions that establish confiscation of items connected to the
offense as stated below. According to Article 34 of the Penal Law 414, “confiscation of property and connected
items” refers to confiscation by the State of items that were used in the offense or in preparation for the
offense, or that were obtained from an intentional offense. Items belonging to other individuals used in the
offense shall be confiscated by the State if the owner lending them is not in good faith or if confiscation is
deemed necessary for national security. However, Article 34 of the Penal Law explicitly states that a sentence of
confiscation of property may only be imposed in serious cases as stated in the specific part of this Law or any
other law which applies this Article of this Law.

As stated earlier, child pornography offenses are governed by Article 86 of the Law on the Protection of Rights
and Interests of Children. In addition, pornography offenses are specified in Article 138 of the Penal Law.
However, neither Article 138 of the Penal Law nor Article 86 of the Law on the Protection of Rights and Interests
of Children provide for: 1) the confiscation of assets used to commit or facilitate child pornography offenses or
pornography offenses; and 2) proceeds derived from such offenses.

Accordingly, Laotian law does not provide for: 1) the confiscation of assets used to commit or facilitate child
pornography offenses or pornography offenses; and 2) the confiscation of proceeds derived from such offenses.

13 – Requires professionals working with children to report child pornography activities
Laotian law does not have provisions that require professionals who work with children to report child
pornography activities to relevant authorities when they learn of incidents involving children’s participation in
pornographic materials.

However, any individual or organization that is aware of or observes any situation regarding any child at risk of
needing special protection or any child in need of special protection, must promptly notify or report on that
situation to the Committee on Protection and Assistance to Children or to an investigative agency, if it is a
criminal offense pursuant to Article 38 of the Law on the Protection of Rights and Interests of Children. 415

414
      Article 34 of the Penal Law (Confiscation of Property and [Connected Items])
“Confiscation of property” refers to the confiscation by the State of part or all of an offender’s property without any compensation.
A sentence of confiscation of property may only be imposed in serious cases as stated in the specific part of this Law.
In the event that the confiscation of all of the offender’s property is imposed, exception must be made for property necessary for the livelihood of the
offender and his family according to the list attached to this Law. In the event that partial confiscation of property is imposed, the court must set up a clear
list of the property to be confiscated.
“Confiscation of items [connected to the offense]” refers to [the confiscation] by the State of items that were used in the offense or in the preparation for
the offense, or that were obtained from an intentional offense. Items belonging to other individuals used in the offense shall be confiscated by the State if
the owner lending them is not in good faith or if confiscation is deemed necessary for national security.
Items belonging to the State or collectives shall not be confiscated but shall be returned to the relevant authorities.

According to Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the Law on the Protection of Rights and Interests of Children 416, children in
need of special protection include those who are victims of physical/sexual abuse, prostitution, human
trafficking, and exploitation.

14 – Requires Internet Service Providers to report child pornography
Laotian law does not have provisions that require Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to report suspected child
pornography to law enforcement agencies or other relevant authorities after they become aware of suspected
or actual child pornographic materials on their networks.

However, Article 36 of the Law on Telecommunication (amended No. 09/NA, issuing date: December 21,
2011) 417 prohibits telecommunication service providers from exaggerating or displaying pornography (salacious
content).

15 – Has telephone or online hotlines to enable the public to report child abuse
A new 24-hour telephone hotline has been launched by the Lao National Tourism Administration and the
Tourism Police to help keep children safe from sexual exploitation. The hotline number 192 was launched to
coincide with the opening of the 25th South East Asian (SEA) Games as part of efforts to make the event a safe
experience for children. 418

17 – Requires the identification of users of public computers in cybercafés
Lao People’s Democratic Republic does not have legislation or regulations that require the identification of users
of public computers in cybercafés.



A network system shall be established under the direction of the Committee on Protection and Assistance to Children in order to keep track of situations
happening in the children’s community and the society, and to identify situations that cause children to need special protection.
The main duties of the network are the following:
         •     To monitor children who have been neglected or taken advantage of;
         •     To collect data and statistics relating to children in need of special protection and regularly report to the Committee on Protection and
               Assistance to Children;
         •     To provide counseling and recommendations to children in need of special protection;
         •     To facilitate and collaborate with relevant sectors concerning protection and assistance to children.

In addition, any person or organisation that knows of or observes any situation regarding any child at risk of needing special protection or any child in need
of special protection, must promptly notify or report on that situation to the Committee on Protection and Assistance to Children or to an investigation
agency.
416

Section 292 of the Penal Code 435 criminalizes activities related to obscenity in general, which may be also
applicable to child pornography as stated below.

Section 292 (a) of the Penal Code punishes anyone who sells, lets to hire, distributes, publicly exhibits, or in any
manner puts into circulation obscene books, pamphlets, papers, drawings, paintings, representations or figures,
or any other obscene object (hereafter referred to as “any obscene object”). Section 292 (a) of the Penal Code
also criminalizes the possession and production of any obscene object for the purpose of its sale, distribution, or
putting into public exhibition.

In addition, Section 292 (b) of the Penal Code outlaws the importation, exportation, or conveyance of any
obscene object for the purposes of the sale, distribution or public exhibition, with the knowledge or having
reason to believe that such object will be sold, distributed, or publicly exhibited, or in any manner put into
circulation.

Further, it is forbidden to participate in or receive profit from any business where the offender knows or has
reason to believe that any such obscene objects are produced, kept, imported, exported, conveyed, publicly
exhibited, or put into the circulation under Section 292 (c) of the Penal Code. Moreover, pursuant to Section 292
(d) of the Penal Code, advertising obscene objects is also prohibited.

Moreover, Section 293 of the Penal Code punishes any person who sells, distributes, exhibits, or circulates
obscene objects (as referred to in Section 292 of the Penal Code) to a minor under the age of 20 years.

Furthermore, Section 294 of the Penal Code punishes anyone, to the annoyance of others, who: (a) does any
obscene act in any public place; or (b) sings, recites, or utters any obscene song, ballad, or words in or near any
public place.

2 – Has a clear definition of child pornography
Malaysian law does not provide a clear definition of child pornography. However, the exception to Section 292
of the Penal Code states that this Section does not extend to any obscene materials (objects) (including any

435
      Section 292 of the Penal Code (Sale, etc., of obscene books, etc.)
Whoever—
              (a) sells, lets to hire, distributes, publicly exhibits or in any manner puts into circulation, or for purposes of sale, hire, distribution, public
              exhibition or circulation makes, produces or has in his possession any obscene book, pamphlet, paper, drawing, painting, representation or
              figure or any other obscene object whatsoever;
              (b) imports, exports or conveys any obscene object for any of the purposes aforesaid, or knowing or having reason to believe that such object
              will be sold, let to hire, distributed or publicly exhibited or in any manner put into circulation;
              (c) takes part in or receives profits from any business in the course of which he knows or has reason to believe that any such obscene objects
              are for any of the purposes aforesaid, made, produced, purchased, kept, imported, exported, conveyed, publicly exhibited or in any manner put
              into circulation;
              (d) advertises or makes known by any means whatsoever that any person is engaged or is ready to engage in any act which is an offense under
              this section, or that any such obscene object can be procured from or through any person; or
              (e) offers, or attempts to do any act which is an offense under this section,
              shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or with fine or with both.
Exception—This section does not extend to any book, pamphlet, writing, drawing, or painting kept or used bona fide for religious purposes or any
representation sculptured, engraved, painted or otherwise represented on or in any temple, or on any car used for the conveyance of idols, or kept or
used for any religious purpose.


                                                                                181
book, pamphlet, writing, drawing, or painting) kept or used for bona fide religious purposes or any
representation sculptured, engraved, painted, or otherwise represented on or in any temple, or on any car used
for the conveyance of idols, or kept or used for any religious purpose.

3 – Considers everyone under 18 as a potential victim of activities related to child pornography
Section 2 (1) of the Child Act 2001 states that “child” means a person under the age of 18 years. Further, this Act
criminalizes using a child in any activity that is sexual in nature for the purpose of pornographic, obscene, or
indecent material or sexual exploitation by any person for that person’s or another’s sexual gratification.

In Malaysia, the age of consent to sexual intercourse is 16 years for women pursuant to Section 375 (f) of the
Penal Code. 436

4 – Criminalizes accessing or downloading child pornography images
Malaysian law does not provide explicit provision that criminalizes accessing or downloading child pornography
images.

However, Section 292 of the Penal Code punishes any person who sells, lets to hire, distributes, publicly exhibits,
or “in any manner” puts into circulation any obscene object.

5 – Criminalizes possession of child pornography
Malaysian law does not explicitly criminalize possession of child pornography without the intent to distribute. It
only criminalizes possession of any obscene objects for the purpose of hire, sale, distribution, public
exhibition/public circulation, etc. pursuant to Section 292 (a) of the Penal Code which reads, “(a) sells, lets to
hire, distributes, publicly exhibits or in any manner puts into circulation, or for purposes of sale, hire,
distribution, public exhibition or circulation makes, produces, or has in his possession any obscene book,
pamphlet, paper, drawing, painting, representation, or figure or any other obscene object whatsoever.”

6 – Criminalizes virtual images and sexually exploitative representations of children
While not specific to child pornography, Malaysian law criminalizes illicit activities involving obscene objects
which may include sexually exploitative representations of persons. Specifically, Section 292 of the Penal Code
includes any obscene book, pamphlet, paper, drawing, painting, or “any representation” whatsoever into any
obscene object as referred to in this Section.

7 – Addresses the criminal liability of children involved in pornography
Malaysian law does not address the criminal liability of children involved in pornography as long as they are
victims, and not the offenders.

In case of child offenders, Section 2 of the Child Act 2001 states that in this Act, in relation to criminal
proceedings, “child” means a person who has attained the age of criminal responsibility as prescribed in Section
82 of the Penal Code. The minimum age of criminal responsibility in Malaysia is ten years of age pursuant to
Section 82 of the Penal Code.



436
      Section 375 (f) of the Penal Code (Rape)
A man is said to commit “rape” who, except in the case hereinafter excepted, has sexual intercourse with a woman under circumstances falling under any
of the following descriptions:
(f) with or without her consent, when she is under sixteen(16) years of age.


                                                                               182
8 – Establishes criminal liability of legal persons for production or commercialization of child pornography
Malaysian law establishes the criminal liability of legal persons for production or commercialization of obscene
objects, which might also apply to activities involving child pornography.

Section 2 of the Penal Code states that every “person” shall be liable to punishment under this Code and not
otherwise for every act or omission contrary to the provisions thereof, of which he shall be guilty within
Malaysia. Section 11 of the Penal Code 437 provides that the word “person” includes any company or association
or body of persons, whether incorporated or not.

9 – Recognizes extraterritorial jurisdiction over child pornography offenses when the alleged offender is a
national of the State
Malaysia establishes its extraterritorial jurisdiction over obscenity offenses stipulated in the Penal Code, which
may also encompass child pornography offenses, subject to the provisions of the Extra-Territorial Offenses Act
1976 (Act 163) 438, when the alleged offender is a national of Malaysia.

Section 2 of the Extra-Territorial Offenses Act 1976 439 (Act 163) states that if any offense under any other
written law committed by any citizen or any permanent resident of Malaysia outside of its territory, such
offense shall be deemed to be punishable as an offense under the relevant written laws as if such offense were
done or committed in Malaysia.

10 – Recognizes extraterritorial jurisdiction over child pornography offenses when the victim is a national of
the State
Malaysia does not establish extraterritorial jurisdiction over obscenity offenses as provided in the Penal Code,
which might also cover child pornography offenses, if the victim is a national of Malaysia.




437
      Section 11 of the Penal Code (Person)
The word “person” includes any company or association or body of persons, whether incorporated or not.

439
      Section 2 of the Extra-Territorial Offenses Act 1976 (Extra-territorial effect of offenses committed outside Malaysia)
              (1) (a) Any act contrary to the provisions of any of the written laws specified in the Schedule, being the provisions relating to the creation of,
              and the punishment for, offenses; or
              (b) any offense under any other written law the commission of which is certified by the Attorney General to affect the security of the
              Federation, shall, if such act is done or such offense is committed, as the case may be,—
                         (i) on the high seas on board any ship or on any aircraft registered in Malaysia;
                         (ii) by any citizen or any permanent resident on the high seas on board any ship or on any aircraft;
                         (iii) by any citizen or any permanent resident in any place without and beyond the limits of Malaysia,
              be punishable as an offense under the relevant written law as if such act or offense were done or committed in Malaysia.
(2) For the purpose of this Act, “permanent resident” has the meaning assigned by the Courts of Judicature Act 1964 [Act 91].
(3) The Yang di-Pertuan Agong may by order, amend, or add to, the Schedule.


                                                                               183
11 – Establishes the confiscation of assets used to commit or facilitate child pornography offenses; and
12 – Establishes the confiscation of proceeds derived from child pornography offenses
Malaysian law neither provides for: 1) the confiscation of assets used to commit or facilitate obscenity offenses
as provided in Sections 292 and 293 of the Penal Code, which might also cover child pornography offenses; nor
2) the confiscation of proceeds derived from such offenses.

13 – Requires professionals working with children to report child pornography activities
The Child Act 2001 requires professionals who work with children to report incidents involving child sexual
abuse to relevant authorities when they learn of such incidents. In addition, the Child Act 2001 defines child
sexual abuse to include children’s participation in pornographic materials as stated below.

Sections 27 440 and 29 of the Child Act 2001 441 require either a medical officer or a registered medical
practitioner to immediately inform a Protector upon the belief on reasonable grounds that a child is physically or
emotionally injured as a result of being ill-treated, neglected, abandoned, exposed, or “sexually abused”.

If any medical officer or a registered medical practitioner, who has believed on reasonable grounds that a child
has been physically or emotionally injured, fails to immediately inform the Protector of the suspected situation
surrounding a child in issue, such professional will be subject to penalty as provided in Sections 27 and 29 of
Child Act 2001.

Specifically, Section 17 (2) (c) of the Child Act 2001 states that a child is “sexually abused” if he has taken part,
whether as a participant or an observer, in any activity which is sexual in nature for the purpose of (i) any
pornographic, obscene or indecent material, photograph, recording, film, videotape or performance; or (ii)
sexual exploitation by any person for that person’s or another person’s sexual gratification.

14 – Requires Internet Service Providers to report child pornography
Malaysian law does not have reporting requirements for Internet Service Providers (ISPs) upon finding child
pornography on their networks. However, the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998 (Act 588) 442 addresses
liabilities of content application service providers with respect to obscene, indecent, or offensive information as
stated below.




440
      Section 27 of the Child Act 2001 (Duty of medical officer or medical practitioner)
              (1) If a medical officer or a registered medical practitioner believes on reasonable grounds that a child he is examining or treating is physically
              or emotionally injured as a result of being ill-treated, neglected, abandoned or exposed, or is sexually abused, he shall immediately inform a
              Protector.
              (2) Any medical officer or registered medical practitioner who fails to comply with subsection (1) commits an offense and shall on conviction be
              liable to a fine not exceeding five thousand ringgit or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or to both.
              (3) If the registered medical practitioner referred to in subsection (1) is a medical officer, he may take the child referred to in that subsection
              into temporary custody until such time as the temporary custody of the child is assumed by a Protector or police officer.
441
      Section 29 of the Child Act 2001 (Duty of child care provider)
              (1) If a child care provider believes on reasonable grounds that a child is physically or emotionally injured as a result of being ill-treated,
              neglected, abandoned or exposed, or is sexually abused, he shall immediately inform a Protector.
              (2) Any child care provider who fails to comply with subsection (1) commits an offense and shall on conviction be liable to a fine not exceeding
              five thousand ringgit or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or to both.

Section 211 of the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998 443 prohibits content applications service
providers 444 or other persons using a content applications service from providing content which is indecent,
obscene, or offensive in character with the intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass any person. The
offenders, upon conviction, are liable to a fine not to exceed 50,000 ringgit, or imprisonment for a term not to
exceed one year, or both, pursuant to this Section. Repeated offenders are subject to a further fine of 1,000
ringgit for every day or part of a day during which the offense is continued after conviction, according to the
same Section.

Section 213 (1) of the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998 further articulates that a content code be
prepared by the content forum or the Commission which shall include model procedures for dealing with
offensive or indecent content.

The Communications and Multimedia Content Forum of Malaysia (CMCF) issued the Malaysian Communications
and Multimedia Content Code 445 in exercise of its powers provided under the Communications and Multimedia
Act 1998. This Code, registered by the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC),
provides guidelines and procedures observed by all content application service providers, by virtue of self-
regulation, in respect of offensive or indecent content prohibited under Section 211 of this Act.

The definition of the term “content application service providers” provided under Part 1 of the Malaysian
Communications and Multimedia Content Code explicitly includes persons who provide Internet access services.
In addition, child pornography is expressly included within the category of prohibited obscene content pursuant
to Part 2 of this Code. “Child pornography” as mentioned in Part 2 of this Code includes the depiction of any part
of the body of a minor in what might be reasonably considered a sexual context, and any written material or
visual and/or audio representation that reflects sexual activity, whether explicit or not, with a minor.

Adherence by ISPs to the provisions of the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Content Code is
voluntary, unless ISPs are directed to comply by the Commission pursuant to Section 99 of the Communications
and Multimedia Act 1998 and Part 1 of the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Content Code.

15 – Has telephone or online hotlines to enable the public to report child abuse
Childline Malaysia is a 24-hour hotline service for children under 18 years of age who are in need of protection,

that purpose. Also, a data user has a duty to take all reasonable steps to ensure that all personal data is
destroyed or permanently deleted if it is no longer required for the purpose for which it was to be processed.”

              passport.
(3) In this section and in sections 372A and 372B, “prostitution” means the act of a person offering that person’s body for sexual gratification for hire
whether in money or in kind; and “prostitute” shall be construed accordingly.
460

4 – Criminalizes accessing or downloading child pornography images
Mongolian law does not contain provisions that explicitly criminalize accessing or downloading child
pornography images.

However, Article 123 of the Criminal Code criminalizes the dissemination, preparation, sale, display to the
public, or transfer across the state frontier of written materials, literature, films, videotapes, and “other items
advertising pornography” provided that there is an enhanced punishment provided for the same crimes
committed by use of violence against a minor.

Furthermore, Article 3.1.1 of the Law Combating Pornography and Prostitution defines the term “advertising
pornography” as making explicitly to depict, broadcast, or display the act of sexual intercourse or human
genitals with the intention to incite sexual desire by magazines, books, films, audio, videos, pictures, and/or “by
any other forms”.

5 – Criminalizes possession of child pornography
The Mongolian legal system does not criminalize possession of child pornography or pornography in general
without the intent to distribute.

However, pursuant to Article 5.2 of the Law Combating Pornography and Prostitution, it is forbidden to store
publications, magazines, books, films, videos, pictures, and other items advertising pornography for the purpose
of distribution, etc. A first-time violation of Article 5.2 of this Law shall be subject to a fine and confiscation of
articles advertising pornography as forms of administrative sanctions pursuant to Article 13.2 of this Law. If a
contravention of Article 5.2 of this Law has been repeated within a year, it constitutes a criminal offense
pursuant to Article 13.1 of the same Law.

6 – Criminalizes virtual images and sexually exploitative representations of children
Mongolian law does not criminalize the production, distribution, commercialization, and possession of child
pornography including virtual images and sexually exploitative representations of children which do not
necessarily use children in their production.

7 – Addresses the criminal liability of children involved in pornography
Mongolian law does not address the criminal liability of children involved in pornography for their participation,
so long as they are victims and not offenders.

In cases of child offenders, the minimum age of criminal responsibility in Mongolia is 14 to 16 years, depending
on the seriousness of the crimes committed, pursuant to Article 21 of the Criminal Code.

8 – Establishes criminal liability of legal persons for production or commercialization of child pornography
Mongolian law does not contain provisions establishing criminal liability of legal persons in general, pursuant to
Article 8.1 of the Criminal Code, which states that “physical persons only shall be subject to criminal liability”.

However, Mongolian law has provisions creating administrative liabilities of legal persons for commercialization
of items advertising pornography, which may also govern commercialization of child pornographic materials, in
cases where such acts of legal persons do not constitute criminal offenses as stated below.

With regard to items advertising pornography, Article 5.1 of the Law Combating Pornography and Prostitution
prohibits the advertisement of pornography by press and broadcast media. Business entities and organizations
that breach Article 5.1 of this Law shall be subject to a fine of 100,000 to 150,000 MNT and if such breach is

                                                         196

Article 13.2.3 of this Law.

Pursuant to Article 5.3 of the Law Combating Pornography and Prostitution, it is forbidden to smuggle
magazines, books, pictures, films, videos, or other items advertising pornography. If business entities and
organizations violate Article 5.3 of this Law, such legal bodies shall be subject to a fine of 200,000 to 250,000
MNT pursuant to Article 13.2.5 of this Law.

Furthermore, according to Articles 7.2.3 and 8.1.3 of Law Combating Pornography and Prostitution, it is not
allowed to show or display erotic magazines, books, videos, pictures, films, drama, shows, performances, or
other entertainment to persons under the age of 18. In the case where business entities and organizations
contravene Articles 7 and 8 of this Law, such legal persons shall be subject to a fine of 150,000 to 250,000 MNT
pursuant to Article 13.2.7 of this Law.

9 – Recognizes extraterritorial jurisdiction over child pornography offenses when the alleged offender is a
national of the State
Mongolia establishes its extraterritorial jurisdiction over pornography offenses provided under the Criminal
Code, which may also be applicable to child pornography offenses, if the alleged offender is a national or a
permanent resident of Mongolia.

Article 14 of the Criminal Code 473 allows the application of Mongolian jurisdiction for crimes as specified by this
Code committed outside of its own territory when the offender is a national or a permanent resident of
Mongolia. Pursuant to Article 14.1 of the Criminal Code, if a citizen of Mongolia or a stateless person
permanently residing in Mongolia committed a crime stipulated in this Code abroad, and he/she has not been
sentenced for it, such offender shall be subject to criminal liability. In addition, according to Article 14.4 of the
Criminal Code, foreign nationals and stateless persons who have committed crimes beyond the territory of
Mongolia shall be subject to criminal liability under this Code only if an international agreement to which
Mongolia is a party provides so.

Furthermore, Article 16.1 of the Criminal Code states that culpable acts and omissions subject to criminal
liability specified in the Criminal Code which are socially dangerous shall be recognized as crimes.




473
  Article 14 of Criminal Code (Grounds and Rules of Application of the Criminal Code to the Persons Who Have Committed Crimes Beyond the Territory of
Mongolia)
          14.1. If a citizen of Mongolia or a stateless person permanently residing in Mongolia has committed a crime specified in this Code abroad and
          he/she has not been sentenced for it, he/she shall be subject to criminal liability under this Code.

          Code.

However, Section 2 (a) and (b) of the Child Law 495 states that while the expression “youth” in this Law refers to
anyone over 16 but below 18 years of age, the expression “child” in this Law means anyone under 16 years of
age. In addition, Section 66 (f) of the Child Law enumerates criminal offenses and criminal penalties for using a

Section 82 of the Penal Code and Section 28 of the Child Law. In addition, nothing is an offense which is done by
a child above 7 years of age and under 12 years of age, who has not attained sufficient maturity of

the Penal Code and Section 28 of the Child Law.

committed in the Union of Burma, would be punishable under this Code.

10 – Recognizes extraterritorial jurisdiction over child pornography offenses when the victim is a national of

obscenity offenses stipulated in this Code, which might also encompass child pornography offenses, when the
victim is its national.

11 – Establishes the confiscation of assets used to commit or facilitate child pornography offenses; and

sexual activity or of the sexual parts of a person for primarily sexual purposes.

In addition, Section 33 of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act 501 allows the court to order the confiscation or
disposal, in accordance with the stipulations, of the property involved in the offense, which has been seized as
exhibits. The court may also declare to pay damages to the trafficking victim from the money confiscated or
from the proceeds of the sale of property or from the fine.

13 – Requires professionals working with children to report child pornography activities
Myanmar does not have legislation or regulations that provide explicit provisions requiring professionals who
work with children to report child pornography activities to relevant authorities when they learn of incidents
involving children’s participation in pornographic materials.




500
      Section 4 of the Penal Code (Extension of code to extra-territorial offences)
The provisions of this Code apply also to any offence committed by any citizen of the Union wherever he may be.

representation, whether visual, audio, or written combination thereof, by electronic, mechanical, digital, optical,
magnetic, or any other means, of a child engaged or involved in real or simulated explicit sexual activities.

In addition, pursuant to Section 3 (c) of the Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009, “explicit sexual activity” includes

to genital, oral to genital, anal to genital, or oral to anal, whether between persons of the same or opposite sex;
2) bestiality; 3) masturbation; 4) sadistic or masochistic abuse; 5) lascivious exhibition of genitals, buttocks,

Pornography Act of 2009 stipulates that “child” refers to a person below 18 years of age.

In the Philippines, the age of consent to sexual intercourse is 12 years for females pursuant to Article 335 of the

Philippine law criminalizes the production, distribution, possession, and commercialization of child pornography
including virtual images and sexually exploitative representations of children that do not necessarily use real
children in their production as elaborated below.

Regarding virtual images of children, Section 3 (a) of the Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009 stipulates that the
term “child” in this Act refers to a person below 18 years of age. In addition, Section 3 (a) of the same Act
explicitly prescribes that, for the purpose of this Act, a definition of the term “child” in this Act shall also extend
to: 1) a person regardless of age who is presented, depicted, or portrayed as a child defined herein; and 2)

Pornography Act of 2009 defines the term “child pornography” in this Act as any representation of a child
engaged or involved in real or simulated explicit sexual activities provided that the term “explicit sexual activity”
is defined by Section 3 (c) of the same Act.

7 – Addresses the criminal liability of children involved in pornography
Philippine law does not address the criminal liability of children involved in pornography as long as they are
victims, and not offenders. Sections 18 and 19 of the Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009 address mandatory
services and programs for victims of child pornography.

In the case of child offenders, the minimum age of criminal liability in the Philippines is 15 years pursuant to
Section 6 of the Republic Act No. 9344, as amended by Republic Act No. 10630. Section 6 of the Republic Act No.
9344, as amended by Republic Act No. 10630 further articulates that a child over 15 years of age, but below 18
years of age, shall be exempt from criminal liability and be subjected to an intervention program, unless he/she
has acted with discernment, in which case, such child shall be subjected to the appropriate proceedings in
accordance with this Act.

8 – Establishes criminal liability of legal persons for production or commercialization of child pornography
Section 3 (k) of the Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009 provides that “person” refers to any natural or judicial
entity. Thus, any legal entities that violate Section 4 of the Anti-Child-Pornography Act of 2009 by engaging in
production or commercialization of child pornography shall be subject to criminal penalty as stipulated in
Section 15 of this Act.

In addition, Section 16 (b) of the Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009, which establishes the grounds for imposing
a penalty on a judicial person in the case of commission of child pornography offenses, reads, “If the offender is
a judicial person, the penalty shall be imposed upon the owner, manager, partner, member of the board of
directors and /or any responsible officer who participated in the commission of the crime or shall have
knowingly permitted or failed to prevent its commission.”

the State
The Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009 and the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the Anti-Child
Pornography Act of 2009 do not provide explicit provisions establishing the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the
Philippines over child pornography offenses stipulated in this Act when the alleged offender is a national of the
Philippines or when the victim is a national of the Philippines.

However, Section 22 of the Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009 535 describes the transnational nature of child
pornography offenses. Furthermore, Section 23 of this Act prescribes that the Department of Justice (DOJ), in
consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), shall endeavor to include child pornography among
the extraditable offenses in future treaties. Further, Section 16 (c) of the same Act articulates that if the
offender is a foreigner, he/she shall be immediately deported after the complete service of his/her sentence and
shall be forever barred from entering the country.

In addition, the Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009 and the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the Anti-
Child Pornography Act of 2009 contain provisions addressing territorial jurisdiction over child pornography
offenses prescribed in this Act as stated below. Section 8 of the Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009 and Section
42 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009 state that jurisdiction
over cases for the violation of the Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009 shall be vested in the Family Court, which
has territorial jurisdiction over the place where the offense or any of its essential elements were committed
pursuant to Republic Act No. 8369, otherwise known as the “Family Courts Act of 1997”. Section 42 of the
Implementing Rules and Regulations of the Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009 further articulates that in
provinces or cities where there are no Family Courts, jurisdiction over cases for the violation of the Anti-Child
Pornography Act of 2009 shall be vested with the Regional Trial Court.

instruments used in the commission of the offense.


                                                                             221

24 – Has a clear definition of online grooming
Although there is no clear definition of online grooming, Philippine law provides a clear definition of grooming,
which may extend to offline grooming, as well as online grooming, as discussed below.

Section 3 (h) of the Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009 defines “grooming” as the act of preparing a child or
someone who the offender believes to be a child for sexual activity or a sexual relationship by communicating
any form of child pornography including online enticement or enticement through other means.

In addition, Section 3 (i) of the Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009 defines “luring” as the act of communicating

of facilitating the commission of sexual activity or production of any form of child pornography.

26 – Criminalizes grooming when the offender has the specific intent to have online or offline sexual contact

someone who the offender believes to be a child for sexual activity or a sexual relationship by communicating
any form of child pornography including online enticement or enticement through other means. In addition,
Section 4 (h) of the Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009 prohibits any person from grooming or luring a child. Any

2 – Has a clear definition of child pornography
The Act on the Protection of Children and Juveniles from Sexual Abuse provides a clear definition of child or
juvenile pornography as stated below.



569
      Article 11 of the Act on the Protection of Children and Juveniles from Sexual Abuse (Production, Distribution, etc. of Child or Juvenile Pornography)
        (1) Any person who produces, imports or exports child or juvenile pornography shall be punished by imprisonment for life or for a fixed term of at

                                                                               235
Article 2, subparagraph 5 of the Act on the Protection of Children and Juveniles from Sexual Abuse 570 stipulates
that the term “child or juvenile pornography” in this Act means the depiction of children or juveniles, or persons
or representations that can be perceived evidently as children or juveniles, doing any act defined in
subparagraph 4 (purchasing child or juvenile sex) or engaging in any other sexual act in the form of a film, video,
game software, or picture or image, etc. displayed on computers or other communications media.

According to Article 2, subparagraph 4 of the Act on the Protection of Children and Juveniles from Sexual
Abuse, 571 the term “purchasing child or juvenile sex” in this Act refers to doing any of the following acts to a
child or juvenile or compelling them to do such an act, in return for offering or promising to offer money and
valuables or other property gains, services or convenience to those who arrange the purchase of child or
juvenile sex, or those who actually protect and supervise the child or juvenile, or any other person: (a) sexual
intercourse; (b) pseudo-sexual intercourse using parts of the body, such as the mouth and anus, or implements;
(c) touching or exposing the whole or part of the body, which causes sexual humiliation or repugnance of
ordinary people; (d) masturbation.

In 2014, the Supreme Court of the Republic of Korea ruled that a pornographic film featuring an adult actress
wearing a high school uniform and posing as a teenager does not necessarily fall within the scope of the former
Article 2, subparagraph 5 of the former Act on the Protection of Children and Juveniles from Sexual Abuse (prior
to amendment on December 18, 2012), which defines “child or juvenile pornography” as the depiction of
children or juveniles, or persons or representations that can be perceived as children or juveniles.

The Supreme Court of the Republic of Korea further articulated that in order for the said images to be deemed
“representations that can be perceived as children or juveniles” provided under Article 2, subparagraph 5 of the
former Act on the Protection of Children and Juveniles from Sexual Abuse (prior to amendment on December
18, 2012), the source of an image, the details of its production, as well as the identity and appearance of the
character shall be comprehensively considered. 572

3 – Considers everyone under 18 as a potential victim of activities related to child pornography
Article 2, subparagraph 1 of the Act on the Protection of Children and Juveniles from Sexual Abuse 573 states that
the term “children or juveniles” in this Act means persons under 19 years of age provided that persons for
whom the first day of January of the year in which they reach 19 years of age has arrived shall be excluded. 574

In the Republic of Korea, the age of consent for sexual intercourse or indecent acts is 13 years for females
pursuant to Article 305 of the Criminal Act. 575 However, purchasing child or juvenile sex is a crime according to
Article 13 (1) of the Act on the Protection of Children and Juveniles from Sexual Abuse, provided that such child
or juvenile is under 19 years of age as specified by Article 2, subparagraph 1 of this Act.

4 – Criminalizes accessing or downloading child pornography images
Article 11 (5) of the Act on the Protection of Children and Juveniles from Sexual Abuse criminalizes downloading
child or juvenile pornography images as stated below.

To be criminalized under Article 11 (5) of the Act on the Protection of Children and Juveniles from Sexual Abuse,
Internet users must not only download child or juvenile pornography from a peer-to-peer (P2P) network or
other Internet website with the knowledge that the downloaded item contains child or juvenile pornography,
but also store such item in physical form (i.e., save the item on their computer hard drive) according to the
announcement made by the National Police Agency of the Republic of Korea in 2012. In order to establish
“possession of child or juvenile pornography” prescribed in the Act on the Protection of Children and Juveniles
from Sexual Abuse, the prosecutor must prove that: (1) the alleged offender has the knowledge that the
downloaded item contains child or juvenile pornographic material; and (2) child or juvenile pornographic images
has in his/her actual possession. Simply viewing online through streaming services would not be considered
“possession” for the purpose of the Act. In addition, if the material was stored on the viewer’s computer
without his/her knowledge, this would not be considered possession. 576

5 – Criminalizes possession of child pornography
Article 11 (5) of the Act on the Protection of Children and Juveniles from Sexual Abuse criminalizes possession of
child or juvenile pornography without the intent to distribute if a person has knowledge that the item in his/her
possession is child or juvenile pornography as stipulated in this Act.



573
      Article 2, subparagraph 1 of the Act on the Protection of Children and Juveniles from Sexual Abuse (Definitions)
The terms used in this Act shall be defined as follows:
              1. The term “children or juveniles” means persons under 19 years of age: Provided, That persons for whom the first day of January of the year
              in which they reach 19 years of age has arrived shall be excluded;
574
    This clause requires understanding how age is counted in the Republic of Korea. There are 2 different ways: (1) “full” age (same as here) – on your
birthday, you become a year older. This is usually used for legal or official purposes (This Act is an exception in that sense); (2) Korean age – everyone gets
a year older on the first day of the year (This Act adopts this method. For example, if A is turning “full” 19 on his birthday this year, he would not be
considered “child or juvenile” for the purposes of the Act, even if he has not turned 19 yet).
575
      Article 305 of the Criminal Act (Sexual Intercourse or Indecent Act with Minor)
A person who has sexual intercourse with a female under 13 years of age or commits an indecent act on such a person shall be punished in accordance
with Article 297 (Rape), 298 (Indecent act by compulsion), 301 (Death or Injury Resulting from Rape) and 301-2 (Murder after Rape or Rape resulting in
death)

In addition, Article 11 (2) of the Act on the Protection of Children and Juveniles from Sexual Abuse also imposes
the heightened punishment in cases where a person possesses child or juvenile pornography for the purposes of
the sale, distribution, rental, or other prescribed illegal purposes.

6 – Criminalizes virtual images and sexually exploitative representations of children
The law possibly criminalizes the production, distribution, commercialization, and possession of child
pornography including virtual images and sexually exploitative representations of children that do not
necessarily use real children in their production as stated below.

The term “child or juvenile pornography” means the depiction of children or juveniles, or persons or
representations that can be perceived evidently as children or juveniles, doing any act as defined in Article 2,
subparagraph 4 of the Act on the Protection of Children and Juveniles from Sexual Abuse (purchasing child or
juvenile sex) or engaging in any other sexual act in the form of film, video, game software, or picture or image,
etc. displayed on computers or other communications media pursuant to Article 2, subparagraph 5 of the Act on
the Protection of Children and Juveniles from Sexual Abuse.

7 – Addresses the criminal liability of children involved in pornography
There is no law in the Republic of Korea that addresses the criminal liability of children involved in pornography
if said children are victims of crimes, and not the offenders. Pursuant to Article 2, subparagraph 6 of the Act on
the Protection of Children and Juveniles from Sexual Abuse, a definition of the term “victimized children or
juveniles” in this Act includes children or juveniles who become victims of child or juvenile pornography offenses
provided under Article 11 of the same Act.

In case of child offenders, the minimum age of criminal liability in the Republic of Korea is 14 years pursuant to
Article 9 of the Criminal Act.

8 – Establishes criminal liability of legal persons for production or commercialization of child pornography
The Act on the Protection of Children and Juveniles from Sexual Abuse recognizes the criminal liability of a
corporation for production or commercialization of child or juvenile pornography. Specifically, Article 32 of the
Act on the Protection of Children and Juveniles from Sexual Abuse 577 punishes not only an offender, but also a
corporation, when the representative, an agent, or any other employee of the corporation commits an offense
as provided in Article 11 of this Act (Production, Distribution, etc. of Child or Juvenile Pornography) in
connection with the business of the corporation.

The legal persons could be exonerated from liability if the legal persons prove that they have not neglected to
exercise due diligence and supervision for the relevant duties in order to prevent such an offense.




577
      Article 32 of the Act on the Protection of Children and Juveniles from Sexual Abuse (Joint Penal Provisions)
If the representative of a corporation, or an agent, employee or any other employed person of a corporation or an individual commits an offense
prescribed under any of Articles 11 (3) and (5), 14 (3) and 15 (2) and(3) or Article 31(3) in connection with the business of the corporation or individual, not
only shall such offender be punished accordingly, but the corporation or individual shall also be punished by the fine prescribed in the relevant provisions,
and if such person commits an offense prescribed under any of Articles 11 (1), (2), (4) and (6), 12, 14 (1), (2) and (4) and 15 (1),not only shall such offender
be punished accordingly, but the corporation or individual shall also be punished by a fine not exceeding 50 million won: Provided, That the same shall not
apply where the corporation or individual has not neglected to exercise due diligence and supervision for the relevant duties in order to prevent such
offense.




                                                                               238
9 – Recognizes extraterritorial jurisdiction over child pornography offenses when the alleged offender is a
national of the State; and
10 – Recognizes extraterritorial jurisdiction over child pornography offenses when the victim is a national of
the State
The Republic of Korea establishes its extraterritorial jurisdiction over child or juvenile pornography offenses
prescribed in the Act on the Protection of Children and Juveniles from Sexual Abuse when: 1) the alleged
offender is its national; or 2) a victim is its national subject to Articles 3, 6, and 8 of the Criminal Act. 578

Article 3 of the Criminal Act provides that this Act shall apply to all Korean nationals who commit crimes outside
of the territory of the Republic of Korea. In addition, Article 33 of the Act on the Protection of Children and
Juveniles from Sexual Abuse 579 states that where criminally prosecuting a Korean citizen who commits a sex
offense against a child or juvenile outside of the territory of the Republic of Korea, pursuant to Article 3 of the
Criminal Act, the State shall endeavor to obtain criminal information swiftly from the relevant foreign country
and punish such offender.

Moreover, Article 6 of the Criminal Act stipulates that this Act shall apply to aliens who commit crimes, other
than those specified in the preceding Article, against the Republic of Korea or her nationals outside of the
territory of the Republic of Korea. Article 6 of the Criminal Act further articulates that this shall not apply in
cases where such acts under the Act in effect at the time of the act do not constitute a crime, or the prosecution
thereof or the execution of the punishment therefor is remitted.

Furthermore, pursuant to Article 8 of the Criminal Act, the general provisions of this Act (Articles 1-86) shall also
apply to such crimes as are provided by other Acts and subordinate statutes unless provided otherwise by such
Acts and subordinate statutes.

11 – Establishes the confiscation of assets used to commit or facilitate child pornography offenses; and
12 – Establishes the confiscation of proceeds derived from child pornography offenses
Article 48 of the Criminal Act 580 provides general provisions for: 1) the confiscation of assets used to commit or
facilitate crimes stipulated in this Act and other laws; and 2) the confiscation of proceeds derived from such
crimes. According to Article 8 of the Criminal Act, Part 1, General Provisions under the Criminal Act (Articles 1-
86) shall be applicable to crimes as stipulated in any other laws unless provided otherwise under such other

              1.    A thing which has been used or was sought to be used in the commission of the crime;
              2.    A thing produced or acquired by means of a criminal conduct;

14 – Requires Internet Service Providers to report child pornography
The Act on the Protection of Children and Juveniles from Sexual Abuse does not contain provisions that require
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to report child or juvenile pornography to law enforcement or other relevant
agencies after learning of its presence on their own networks. However, the draft bill to amend the Act on the
Protection of Children and Juveniles from Sexual Abuse of March 2013 contains provisions which create a
mandatory reporting requirement for online service providers upon the discovery of child pornographic
materials on their own networks. The draft amendment has not yet been passed by the Congress as of April 3,
2014.

However, the Act on the Protection of Children and Juveniles from Sexual Abuse has provisions that oblige
online service providers, the definition of which includes ISPs, 582 to remove child or juvenile pornography from
their networks once they learn of its presence as stated below.

Article 17 (1) of the Act on the Protection of Children and Juveniles from Sexual Abuse mandates any online

Ban on Internet Distribution of Obscene Materials Case
2006Hun-Ba109
2009/05/28

In this case, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Korea decided that the contested provision, which
imposes criminal punishment on those who distribute and sell obscene materials over information and
communication networks, does not violate the Constitution for the reason that “obscene” expressions are part
of the freedom of speech and press to be protected by the Constitution, and the rule of clarity and the rule
against excessive restriction cannot be found to be violated. Three Justices, however, agreed to this conclusion,
but based on a different reason. Furthermore, in a 7 to 2 vote, the Court dismissed the complaints of part of the
petitioners who were acquitted during their trials respectively for the reason that the relevance of the contested
provision to the underlying cases could not be ascertained.

Background of the Case
The petitioners were prosecuted and tried for violating Article 65 (1), subparagraph 2 (hereinafter “Instant
Provision”) of the former Act on Promotion of Information and Communications Network Utilization and
Information Protection, etc. (hereinafter, the “former Information and Communications Network Act”) by
distributing and openly displaying obscene materials on Internet portals and mobile communication services.
While their trials were pending, petitioners filed motions before the court to request the constitutional review
of the Instant Provision. As the motions were denied, however, the petitioners respectively filed these
constitutional complaints with the Constitutional Court, arguing that the Instant Provision violates the rule of
clarity and rule against excessive restriction, etc. Meanwhile, some of the petitioners were ruled not guilty of
violating the Instant Provision at their ordinary courts respectively.

Provision at issue
Article 65 (1), subparagraph 2 of the Former Act on Promotion of Information and Communications Network
Utilization and Information Protection, etc. (revised by Act No. 6360 January 16, 2001, but before revised by Act
No. 8289 on January 26, 2007) 608 [Article 74 (1), subparagraph 2 of the current Act on Promotion of Information
and Communication Network Utilization and Information Protection, etc. (last amended on May 28, 2014 and
effective as of November 29, 2014)].

Article 65 (Penal Provisions)
(1) Any person falling under any of the following subparagraphs shall be punished by imprisonment with prison
labor for not more than one year or by a fine not exceeding 10 million won:
    2. A person who has distributed, sold, rented, or openly displayed lascivious (or obscene) codes, letters,
    sounds, visuals, or films through information and communications networks;

Summary of the Decision
In a unanimous vote, Constitutional Court of the Republic of Korea ruled the Instant Provision constitutional,
reasoning that the Instant Provision does not contradict the rule of clarity and prohibition of excessive
restriction. At the same time, in a 6 to 3 vote, the Court also overruled its precedent that an "obscene"
expression in its strict sense is not protected under Article 21 of the Constitution that ensures freedom of
speech and the press (95Hun-Ka16, April 30, 1998) according to the following reasons.

1. Court Opinion
If an “obscene expression” is interpreted to be outside the boundary of freedom of speech protected by the
Constitution, it will not only be impossible to conduct a constitutional review of an obscene expression in
accordance with basic constitutional principles for restriction on freedom of speech, such as the rule of clarity
and ban on censorship, but also be difficult to apply constitutional basic principles for restriction on
fundamental rights, such as statutory restriction and the rule against excessive restriction. As a result, it
becomes also impossible to control every obscene expression through preliminary censorship and, in case of no
such prior censorship, to impose criminal punishment, to ban possession of obscene materials without the
purpose of distribution, or to unlawfully impose disadvantage on obscene publications. In the end, it cannot be
overlooked that obscene expressions are highly likely to be denied even the minimum constitutional protection.

Therefore, it should be interpreted that, obscene expressions are also entitled to the protection of freedom of
speech under Article 21 of the Constitution, except that they can be regulated for the purpose of ensuring
national safety, public law and order or public welfare pursuant to Article 37 (2) Section 2 of the Constitution. As
the obscenity specified in the Provision should thus be protected by Article 21 of the Constitution that
guarantees the freedom of speech and press, the Constitutional Court has come to overrule its former judgment
that obscene expressions are not to be protected as freedom of speech under Article 21 of the Constitution (10-
1 KCCR 327, 340-341, 95Hun-Ka16, April 30, 1998).

The "obscenity" in the Instant Provision may have room for more specificity, but it can be considered to provide,
in its current form, offenders and law enforcement officials with appropriate standards for review or
interpretation and exclude arbitrary interpretation and execution of law as regards which expression is
"obscene." In this sense, "obscenity" in the Instant Provision does not contradict the rule of clarity. Even if
obscene expressions are subject to constitutional protection of freedom of speech and thus imposing heavy
criminal punishment on acts such as distribution of obscene materials and information may somewhat restrict
the said fundamental rights, this restriction is necessary for public welfare. Therefore, the Instant Provision
hardly contradicts the rule against excessive restriction under Article 37 (2) of the Constitution.

2. Concurring Opinion of Three Justices
Determining the inherent boundary of protection for fundamental rights under the law is significant as the first
step of a constitutional review. It is evident that not all of the problematic expressions of every case can be
protected as part of the freedom of speech, so discussion on the scope of freedom of speech to be protected
becomes an essential prerequisite for a constitutional review of freedom of speech.

As Article 31 (4) of the Constitution specifies the constitutional limitation to the freedom of speech; expressions
that exceed the limitation are not protected by the Constitution as part of the freedom of speech. Whether such
obscene expressions are to be recognized as part of freedom of speech is a matter determined by how the
review standard for obscenity as a normative concept is established.

The concept of "obscenity" in the Instant Provision is "obscenity" in the strict sense of the term – indecent and
blunt sexual expression that distorts human dignity or personality, that solely appeals to sexual interest, and
that overall has no literary, artistic, scientific or political values. In this context, such obscene expressions are
sexual expressions similar to or more harmful than "obscenity" not considered by the U.S. Supreme Court to be
part of rights protected under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution or "hardcore pornography" defined
in the German criminal law. Therefore, obscene expressions in their strict sense exceeds the limitation allowed
by Article 21 (4) of the Constitution and therefore are not protected by Article 21 (1) of the Constitution that
ensures freedom of speech.

                                                        250
The concept of “obscenity” in the Instant Provision at least offers an appropriate guideline for offenders and law
enforcement officers, and implication of the term hardly varies with individual preference of the competent
enforcement authority. The Instant Provision, therefore, does not contradict the rule of clarity.

Meanwhile, because “obscenity” in its strict sense is not constitutionally protected as part of the freedom of
speech, there is no need for review of whether the Instant Provision that penalizes distribution of obscene
materials through information and communication networks violates the rule against excessive restriction in
regulating the freedom of speech and press. 609

Singapore

In Singapore, a wide range of children’s rights are protected through adopting domestic legislation and by
joining relevant international treaties including the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). However, the
Singaporean Government has not ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on
the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography (OPSC).

The laws and regulations which protect children’s rights and/or govern violence against children in Singapore are
as follows:
     • Penal Code (Chapter 224)
     • Films Act (Chapter 107)
     • Undesirable Publications Act (Chapter 338)
     • Protection from Harassment Act (Act No. 17 of 2014)
     • Children and Young Persons Act (Chapter 38)
     • Child Care Centres Act (Chapter 37A)

2 – Has a clear definition of child pornography
Singaporean law does not provide a clear definition of child pornography. However, the Films Act, the
Undesirable Publications Act, and the Penal Code collectively provide definitions of “obscene
films/publications/objects”.

(1) Definition of obscenity
There are provisions defining “obscenity” under the Penal Code, the Undesirable Publications Act, and the Films
Act as stated below. According to Section 3 of the Undesirable Publications Act and Section 2 (1) of the Films
Act, a publication or a film is “obscene” if its effect or (where the publication/film comprises two or more
distinct parts or items) the effect of any one of its parts or items is, if taken as a whole, such as to tend to
deprave and corrupt persons who are likely to read, see, or hear the matter contained or embodied in it.

Also, Section 42 of the Penal Code 619 defines the term “obscene”. Additionally, Section 292 (3) of the Penal
Code 620 states that for the purposes of this Section and Section 293, an object shall be deemed not to be
“obscene” if the sale, letting to hire, distribution, exhibition, circulation, import, export, or conveyance of, or any
other dealing in the object is authorized by or under any written law. Also, according to the exception to Section



617
      Section 12 of the Undesirable Publications Act (Offenses involving objectionable publications)
Any person who —
              (a) makes or reproduces, or makes or reproduces for the purposes of sale, supply, exhibition or distribution to any other person;
              (b) imports or has in his possession for the purposes of sale, supply, exhibition or distribution to any other person; or
              (c) sells, offers for sale, supplies, offers to supply, exhibits or distributes to any other person, any objectionable publication (not being a
              prohibited publication) knowing or having reasonable cause to believe the publication to be objectionable
shall be guilty of an offense and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to
both.
618
      Section 7 of the Children and Young Persons Act (Sexual exploitation of child or young person)
Any person who, in public or private —
              (a) commits or abets the commission of or procures or attempts to procure the commission by any person of any obscene or indecent act with
              any child or young person; or
              (b) procures or attempts to procure the commission of any obscene or indecent act by any child or young person,
shall be guilty of an offense and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to
both and, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, to a fine not exceeding $20,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years or to
both.
619
      Section 42 of the Penal Code (Obscene)
The word “obscene”, in relation to anything or matter, means anything or matter the effect of which is, if taken as a whole, such as to tend to deprave and
corrupt persons who are likely, having regard to all relevant circumstances, to read, see or hear the matter contained or embodied in it.
620
      Section 292 (3) of the Penal Code (Sale of obscene books, etc.)
(3) For the purposes of this section and section 293, an object shall be deemed not to be obscene if the sale, letting to hire, distribution, exhibition,
circulation, import, export or conveyance of, or any other dealing in, the object is authorised by or under any written law.


                                                                                256
292 of the Penal Code 621, this Section does not apply to any book, pamphlet, writing, drawing or painting kept or
used for bona fide religious purposes.

(2) Definitions of film, publication, objects
There are provisions defining “film” under the Films Act, “publication” under the Undesirable Publications Act,
and “objects” under the Penal Code, with regard to obscene films, publications, or objects under those three
Laws.
        a) Film

        partly visual moving pictures, and includes any part of a film, and any copy or part of a copy of the whole
        or any part of a film.

              b) Publication
              Section 2 of the Undesirable Publications Act 622 provides the definition of the term “publication (other
              than film)” in this Act which includes any picture or drawing, whether made by computer graphics or
              otherwise howsoever.

              c) Object
              Section 292 (2) of the Penal Code 623 explicitly states that for the purpose of this Section, “object”
              includes data stored on a computer disc, or by other electronic means, that is capable of conversion to
              images, writing, or any other form of representation.




621
      Exception to Section 292 of the Penal Code (Sale of obscene books, etc.)
Exception.—This section does not extend to any book, pamphlet, writing, drawing or painting kept or used bona fide for religious purposes, or any
representation sculptured, engraved, painted or otherwise represented on or in any temple, or on any car used for the conveyance of idols, or kept or
used for any religious purpose.
622
      Extract of the Section 2 of the Undesirable Publications Act (Interpretation)
“publication” means any of the following other than a film:
              (a) any book, magazine or periodical, whether in manuscript or final form;
              (b) any sound recording;
              (c) any picture or drawing, whether made by computer-graphics or otherwise howsoever;
              (d) any photograph, photographic negative, photographic plate or photographic slide; or
              (e) any paper, model, sculpture, tape, disc, article or thing —
                         (i) that has printed or impressed upon it any word, statement, sign or representation; or
                         (ii) on which is recorded or stored for immediate or future retrieval any information that, by the use of any computer or other
                         electronic device, is capable of being reproduced or shown as any picture, photograph, word, statement, sign or representation, and
                         includes a copy of any publication
623
      Section 292 (2) of the Penal Code (Sale of obscene books, etc.)
(2) For the purposes of this section, “object” includes data stored in a computer disc, or by other electronic means, that is capable of conversion to images,
writing or any other form of representation.




                                                                                 257
(3) Meanings of objectionable and prohibiting publications
Sections 2, 4 (1), and 5 (1) of the Undesirable Publications Act also provide definitions of “objectionable” and
“prohibited” pertaining to objectionable or prohibited publications.

              a) Objectionable
              Section 4 (1) of the Undesirable Publications Act states that the publication is objectionable if it
              describes, depicts, expresses, or otherwise deals with matters such as sex, crime, violence, or other
              stipulated thing in a manner that the availability of the publication is likely to harm to the public good. In
              determining whether or not any publication is objectionable, the factors to be considered pertaining to
              child pornography are, among others, as follows: 1) describes, depicts, or otherwise deals with acts of
              torture, the infliction of serious physical harm, sexual conduct or violence or coercion in association with
              sexual conduct; 2) whether the publication exploits the nudity of persons or children or both; 3) whether
              the publication describes, depicts, or otherwise deals with acts of sexual conduct or violence or coercion
              in association with sexual conduct pursuant to Section 4 (2) of the Undesirable Publications Act.

              b) Prohibited
              Section 5 (1) of the Undesirable Publications Act states that “prohibited publication” means any
              publication which is prohibited from the importation, sale, or circulation by the power of the Minister
              because the publication or the extract therefrom would be contrary to the public interest. Section 2 of
              this Act states that the meaning of “publication” shall include any book, magazine, or periodical,
              whether in manuscript or final form; any sound recording; any picture or drawing, whether made by
              computer-graphics or otherwise howsoever; any photograph, photographic negative, photographic
              plate or photographic slide; or any paper, model, sculpture, tape, disc, article or thing (i) that has printed
              or impressed upon it any word, statement, sign or representation; or (ii) on which is recorded or stored
              for immediate or future retrieval any information that, by the use of any computer or other electronic
              device, is capable of being reproduced or shown as any picture, photograph, word, statement, sign or
              representation, and includes a copy of any publication.

3 – Considers everyone under 18 as a potential victim of activities related to child pornography
Singaporean law does not provide explicit provisions that consider everyone under the age of 18 years as a
potential victim of activities related to child pornography. However, Singaporean law generally considers
everyone under the age of 16 years as a child or a young person as stated below.

According to Section 2 (1) of the Films Act and Section 2 (1) of the Children and Young Persons Act (CYPA),
“child” means a person who is below the age of 14 years and “young person” means a person who is 14 years of
age or above, but below the age of 16 years.

In Singapore, the age of consent to sexual intercourse is 14 years for women pursuant to Section 375 (1) of the
Penal Code.624



624
      Section 375 (1) of the Penal Code (Rape)
        (1) Any man who penetrates the vagina of a woman with his penis —
              (a) without her consent; or
              (b) with or without her consent, when she is under 14 years of age,
        shall be guilty of an offence.


                                                                              258
4 – Criminalizes accessing or downloading child pornography images
Singaporean law does not provide explicit provisions that criminalize accessing or downloading child
pornography images.

However, Section 292 (1) (a) of the Penal Code makes it an offense to “transmit by electronic means” or “in any
manner” put into circulation any obscene object.

5 – Criminalizes possession of child pornography
Singaporean law does not provide explicit provision which criminalizes possession of child pornography with or
without the intent to distribute. However, while not specific to child pornography, Section 30 of the Films Act 625
criminalizes possession of obscene films without the intent to distribute, which may also outlaw simple
possession of child pornography.

Moreover, Section 292 (1) (a) of the Penal Code criminalizes possession of any obscene book, pamphlet, paper,
drawing, paper, and representation or figure or any obscene material for the purposes of sale, letting to hire,
distribution, transmission, public exhibition, or circulation.

6 – Criminalizes virtual images and sexually exploitative representations of children
While not specific to child pornography, Singaporean law criminalizes illicit activities involving obscene objects
which may include virtual images and sexually exploitative representations of persons. Specifically, Section 292
(2) of the Penal Code states that “object”, for the purposes of this Section, includes data stored on a computer
disc, or by other electronic means, that is capable of conversion to “images”, writing, or “any other form of
representation”.

7 – Addresses the criminal liability of children involved in pornography
The law does not address the criminal liability of children involved in pornography as long as they are victims,
and not offenders. However, Section 11 (1) (a) of the Child and Young Persons Act (CYPA) states that no child or
young person shall take part in any public entertainment which is of an immoral nature.

In cases of child offenders, Section 82 of the Penal Code specifies that nothing is an offense which is done by a
child under seven years of age. Section 83 of this Code further articulates that nothing is an offense which is
done by a child above seven years of age and under 12 years of age, who has not attained sufficient maturity of
understanding to judge the nature and consequence of his conduct on that occasion.

8 – Establishes criminal liability of legal persons for production or commercialization of child pornography
The Penal Code has provisions that establish criminal liability of legal persons for production or
commercialization of obscene objects, which might also govern activities related to child pornographic items.

625
      Section 30 of the Films Act (Possession of obscene films)
              (1) Any person who has in his possession any obscene film shall be guilty of an offense and shall be liable on conviction to a fine of not less than
              $500 for each such film he had in his possession (but not to exceed in the aggregate $20,000) or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6
              months or to both.
              (2) Any person who has in his possession any obscene film knowing or having reasonable cause to believe the film to be obscene shall be guilty
              of an offense and shall be liable on conviction —
                         (a) to a fine of $1,000 for each such film in his possession (but not to exceed in the aggregate $40,000) or to imprisonment for a term
                         not exceeding 12 months or to both; and
                         (b) in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, to a fine of not less than $2,000 for each such film in his possession (but not to
                         exceed in the aggregate $80,000) or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both.


                                                                               259
Section 11 of the Penal Code states that, “A person in this Code shall include any company or association or
body of persons, which is incorporated or not.” Therefore, when a corporation commits an obscenity offense as
provided in Section 292 of the Penal Code (Sale of obscene books, etc.), the corporation shall be subject to
criminal liability.

Relevantly, pursuant to Section 17 of the Undesirable Publications Act 626, when an offense prescribed in this Act
is committed by a corporation, a partnership, or unincorporated association of persons, a director, manager,
partner, secretary, or other similar officer who has the capacity to act, shall be guilty of such offense unless he
proves: 1) the offense was committed without his/her consent; and 2) he/she exercised all due diligence to
prevent the commission of such offense.

9 – Recognizes extraterritorial jurisdiction over child pornography offenses when the alleged offender is a
national of the State; and
10 – Recognizes extraterritorial jurisdiction over child pornography offenses when the victim is a national of
the State
Singapore does not establish its extraterritorial jurisdiction over obscenity offenses as provided in the provisions
of the Penal Code, the Undesirable Publications Act, and the Films Act, which might also cover child pornography
offenses when the alleged offender is a national of Singapore or when the victim is a national of Singapore.

However, Singaporean law has provisions that establish the extraterritorial jurisdiction of Singapore over an
offense mentioned in Section 376C of the Penal Code (Commercial sex with minor under 18 outside Singapore)
when the alleged offender is a citizen or a permanent resident of Singapore as stated below.

Section 376C (1) of the Penal Code states that, “Any person, being a citizen or a permanent resident of
Singapore, who does, outside Singapore, any act that would, if done in Singapore, constitute an offence under
section 376B (Commercial sex with minor under 18) 627, shall be guilty of an offence.” Furthermore, Section 376C
(2) of the Penal Code provides that, “A person who is guilty of an offence under this section shall be liable to the
same punishment to which he would have been liable had he been convicted of an offence under section 376B”.


626
      Section 17 of the Undesirable Publications Act (Corporate offenders)
Where an offense under this Act has been committed by a body corporate, a partnership or an unincorporated association of persons, any person who at
the time of the commission of the offense was a director, manager, partner, secretary or other similar officer thereof, or was purporting to act in any such
capacity, shall also be guilty of that offense unless he proves that —
              (a) the offense was committed without his consent or connivance; and
              (b) he had exercised all such diligence to prevent the commission of the offense as he ought to have exercised having regard to the nature of
              his functions in that capacity and to all the circumstances.
627
      Section 376B of the Penal Code (Commercial sex with minor under 18)
              (1) Any person who obtains for consideration the sexual services of a person, who is under 18 years of age, shall be punished with
              imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years, or with fine, or with both.
              (2) Any person who communicates with another person for the purpose of obtaining for consideration, the sexual services of a person who is
              under 18 years of age, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with fine, or with both.
              (3) No person shall be guilty of an offense under this section for any sexual services obtained from that person’s spouse.
              (4) In this section, “sexual services” means any sexual services involving —
                         (a) sexual penetration of the vagina or anus, as the case may be, of a person by a part of another person’s body (other than the
                         penis) or by anything else; or
                         (b) penetration of the vagina, anus or mouth, as the case may be, of a person by a man’s penis.


                                                                               260
11 – Establishes the confiscation of assets used to commit or facilitate child pornography offenses; and
12 – Establishes the confiscation of proceeds derived from child pornography offenses
Singaporean law does not explicitly provide for the: 1) confiscation of assets used to commit or facilitate
obscenity offenses, which might also cover child pornography offenses; and 2) confiscation of proceeds derived
from such offenses.

However, Section 9 of the Undesirable Publications Act 628 allows for the forfeiture of any document or any
extract from such document that constitutes “prohibited publications” under this Act.

13 – Requires professionals working with children to report child pornography activities
Singaporean law and regulations do not provide explicit provisions that require professionals working with
children to report incidents involving activities related to child pornography to relevant authorities when they
learn of such incidents. However, Singapore has regulations that establish a mandatory reporting requirement
for professionals who work with children upon findings of suspected child abuse cases, although these
Regulations do not provide a definition of the term “child abuse” to include the use of a child in pornographic
materials as stated below.

Section 21 of the Child Care Centres Regulations states that “The licensee of a child care centre who has
reasonable cause to suspect any case of child abuse shall immediately report it to the Director”. However, there
is no definition of the term “child abuse” provided under Child Care Centres Regulations and Child Care Centres
Act.

14 – Requires Internet Service Providers to report child pornography
Singaporean law does not contain provisions that require Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to report child
pornography to law enforcement or other relevant agencies when it is discovered on their own networks.
However, the Internet Code of Practice 629 and the Broadcasting (Class License) Notification 630 address the duties
of ISPs and Internet Content Providers (ICPs) licensed under the Broadcasting (Class License) Notification with
respect to materials with sexual or obscene content.

Section 2 of the Internet Code of Practice requires all licensed ISPs and ICPs to use their best efforts in order to
ensure that prohibited material is not broadcast via the Internet to users in Singapore.

In addition, Section 4 of the Internet Code of Practice 631 defines “prohibited material” as objectionable material
on the grounds of the public interest, public morality, public order, public security, national harmony, or is
628
      Section 9 of the Undesirable Publications Act (Forfeiture)
A court before which any proceedings are taken under this Act, if satisfied that any document produced in the proceedings is a prohibited publication or
an extract therefrom, shall, whether the alleged offender is convicted or not, order such publication or extract therefrom to be forfeited to the
Commissioner of Police, who shall order it to be destroyed or otherwise disposed of in such manner as he thinks fit.

      Section 4 of the Internet Code of Practice (Prohibited Material)
              (1) Prohibited material is material that is objectionable on the grounds of public interest, public morality, public order, public security, national
              harmony, or is otherwise prohibited by applicable Singaporean laws.
              (2) In considering what is prohibited material, the following factors should be taken into account:-

                                                                                261
otherwise prohibited by applicable Singaporean laws. The factors to be considered include the following: 1)
whether the material promotes sexual violence or sexual activity involving the coercion or non-consent of any
kind; and 2) whether the material depicts a person clearly engaged in explicit sexual activity and other
prescribed factors pursuant to Section 4 of the Internet Code of Practice.

In accordance with Sections 2 and 4 of the Internet Code of Practice, this Code mandates all licensed ISPs and
ICPs to use their best effort so as to make sure that prohibited material is not broadcast via the Internet to their
users in Singapore.

Furthermore, Section 2A (2) of the Schedule to the Broadcasting (Class License) Notification provides that if the
Authority is satisfied that content in a programme on the World Wide Web is undesirable, harmful or obscene,
and the Authority gives to an Internet Access Service Provider written notice that end-users should be prevented
from accessing that content on the Internet, the Internet Access Service Provider shall take all reasonable steps
to modify, or to enable the relevant subscribers to modify, the Internet content filtering arrangements632 to
prevent such end-users from accessing that content.

15 – Has telephone or online hotlines to enable the public to report child abuse
The Singaporean Government has a “Child Protection and Welfare Helpline” (Helpline phone number– 1800-777
0000) that enables the public to report suspected child abuse. Child abuse includes: 1) physical abuse; 2)
neglect; 3) sexual abuse; and 4) emotional and psychological abuse. 633

16 – Creates data retention or data preservation provisions
Section 9 (1) of the Electronic Transactions Act 634 (Chapter 88) contains provisions that address the
requirements to be satisfied in the event that any rule of law requires certain documents, records, or
information to be retained in the form of electronic records.


                         (a) whether the material depicts nudity or genitalia in a manner calculated to titillate;
                         (b) whether the material promotes sexual violence or sexual activity involving coercion or non-consent of any kind;
                         (c) whether the material depicts a person or persons clearly engaged in explicit sexual activity;
                         (d) whether the material depicts a person who is, or appears to be, under 16 years of age in sexual activity, in a sexually provocative
                         manner or in any other offensive manner;
                         (e) whether the material advocates homosexuality or lesbianism, or depicts or promotes incest, paedophilia, bestiality and
                         necrophilia;
                         (f) whether the material depicts detailed or relished acts of extreme violence or cruelty;
                         (g) whether the material glorifies, incites or endorses ethnic, racial or religious hatred, strife or intolerance.
              (3) A further consideration is whether the material has intrinsic medical, scientific, artistic or educational value.
              (4) A licensee who is in doubt as to whether any content would be considered prohibited may refer such content to the Authority for its
              decision.
632
    Pursuant to Section 2A (3) of the Schedule to the Broadcasting (Class License) Notification “Internet content filtering arrangements” means any
arrangement (whether or not involving Internet content filtering software installed at the Internet Access Service Provider’s computer equipment or the
relevant subscriber’s computer equipment) that is likely to provide a reasonably effective means of preventing access by children and other end-users to
such content in any programme on the World Wide Web that is undesirable, harmful or obscene or potentially undesirable, harmful or obscene, and that
was selected by the relevant subscriber.

      Section 9 (1) of the Electronic Transactions Act


                                                                                 262
However, Sections 292 and 293 of the Penal Code that address obscenity offenses, which may also cover child
pornography offenses, do not explicitly call for records or information to be retained. Thus, it is unclear whether
data retention provisions under the Electronic Transactions Act are applicable to such offenses.

In addition, while not specific to the retention of non-content based data including subscriber information (data
that helps identify the subscriber), as well as traffic data (i.e. information on the route, time, date, duration,
destination, and source of a communication), the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 contains provisions for
personal data retention principles as stated below.

Section 25 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 provides for the retention of personal data by mandating an
organization to cease to retain its documents containing personal data or remove the means by which the
personal data can be associated with particular individuals as soon as it is reasonable to assume that: 1) the
purpose for which that personal data was collected is no longer being served by the retention of personal data;
and 2) retention of such personal data is no longer needed for legal or business purposes.

17 – Requires the identification of users of public computers in cybercafés
Singapore does not have legislation or regulations that require the identification of users of public computers in
cybercafés.

18 – Has a national plan to combat violence against children
Singapore has a national plan to combat violence against children as elaborated below.

The “National Standards for the Protection of Children” was issued by the Ministry of Community Development
and Sports in 2002. It outlines the framework for the management of child protection and provides a common
understanding of the roles and responsibilities of different sectors and various constituents under the child
protection system in Singapore. 635

In addition, “Protecting Children in Singapore” was published by the Ministry of Community Development, Youth
and Sports in 2005. 636

19 – Has ratified the CRC and the OPSC
    • Singapore acceded to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on October 5, 1995. 637

Where a rule of law requires any document, record or information to be retained, or provides for certain consequences if it is not, that requirement is
satisfied by retaining the document, record or information in the form of an electronic record if the following conditions are satisfied:
          (a) the information contained therein remains accessible so as to be usable for subsequent reference;
          (b) the electronic record is retained in the format in which it was originally generated, sent or received, or in a format which can be
          demonstrated to represent accurately the information originally generated, sent or received;
          (c) such information, if any, as enables the identification of the origin and destination of an electronic record and the date and time when it was
          sent or received, is retained; and
          (d) any additional requirements relating to the retention of such electronic records specified by the public agency which has supervision over
          the requirement for the retention of such records are complied with.

20 – Age of criminal liability
The minimum age of criminal responsibility in Singapore is seven years of age pursuant to Section 82 of the
Penal Code. If an offender is a child above seven years of age and under 12 years of age who is not mature
enough to judge the nature and consequence of his or her conduct on that occasion, such child is also exempted
from criminal liability according to Section 83 of the Penal Code.

21 – Has legislation that specifically addresses the use of ICTs to commit crimes against children
Singapore has legislation that specifically addresses the use of ICTs to commit crimes against children.

In light of crimes against children committed by the use of ICTs, Section 376D (1) (c) of the Penal Code explicitly
makes it an offense to print, publish, or distribute any information that is intended to promote conduct that
would constitute an offense under Section 376C of this Code (Commercial sex with minor under 18 outside
Singapore), or to assist any other person to engage in such conduct with a penalty stipulated in Section 376D (3)
of this Code. Section 376D (2) of the Penal Code further articulates that the publication of information means
publication of information “by any means, whether by written, electronic, or other form of communication” for
the purposes of Section 376D (1) (c) of this Code.

Cybercrime in general is covered by the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act (Chapter 50A) (revised in 2007).
The objective of the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act is to secure computer material against
unauthorized access or modification, unauthorized use or interception of computer services, unauthorized
disclosure of access code, unauthorized obstruction of the use of the computer and access with intent to
facilitate an offense stipulated under this Act.

22 – Criminalizes: 1) child trafficking with the intent of producing pornography; and 2) advertising child sex
tourism online
Singaporean law does not provide explicit provisions criminalizing child trafficking with the intent of producing
pornography. However, Sections 372 640 and 373 of the Penal Code 641 criminalize trafficking in any person under

(c) of the Penal Code punishes anyone who publishes any information that is intended to promote conduct that
would constitute an offense under Section 376C or assist any other person to engage in such conduct. Further,

“publication of information” refers to publication of information by any means, whether by written or other
form of communication.

A person who is guilty of an offense under Section 376D (1) (c) of the Penal Code shall be punishable by
imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years, or a fine, or both pursuant to Section 376D (3) of this
Code.

23 – Has legislation that criminalizes online grooming as a standalone offense
Singaporean law does not have explicit provisions that criminalize online grooming. However, Section 376E of
the Penal Code 644 criminalizes sexual grooming against a minor under 16 years of age with imprisonment for a
term which may extend to three years, or a fine, or both.

                         (a) makes or organises any travel arrangements for or on behalf of any other person with the intention of facilitating the commission
                         by that other person of an offense under section 376C, whether or not such an offense is actually committed by that other person;
                         (b) transports any other person to a place outside Singapore with the intention of facilitating the commission by that other person of
                         an offense under section 376C, whether or not such an offense is actually committed by that other person; or
                         (c) prints, publishes or distributes any information that is intended to promote conduct that would constitute an offense under

              electronic, or other form of communication.
              (3) A person who is guilty of an offense under this section shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, or

24 – Has a clear definition of online grooming
Although the Singaporean Penal Code does not provide clear definitions of “online grooming” and “sexual
grooming”, it does address punishable conducts that shall constitute sexual grooming offenses.

Pursuant to Section 376E (1) of the Penal Code, if any person of or above the age of 21 years (A) has met or
communicated with another person (B) on two or more occasions, that person shall be guilty of the offense of
sexual grooming provided that the following conditions are met:
        (a) A intentionally meets B or travels with the intention of meeting B; and
        (b) at the time of the acts referred to in paragraph (a)
                 (i) A intends to do anything to or in respect of B, during or after the meeting, which if done will
                 involve the commission by A of a relevant offense as stated below;
                 (ii) B is under 16 years of age; and
                 (iii) A does not reasonably believe that B is of or above the age of 16 years.

Section 376E (2) of the Penal Code prescribes that “relevant offenses” mentioned in Section 376E (1) of this
Code include the following: (a) Sections 354 (Assault or use of criminal force against a person with intent to
outrage modesty); 354A (Outraging modesty in certain circumstances); 375 (Rape); 376 (Sexual assault by
penetration); 376A (Sexual penetration of minor under 16); 376B (Commercial sex with minor under 18); 376C
(Commercial sex with minor outside the Singapore); 376D (Tour outside Singapore for commercial sex with
minor under 18) or 377A (Outrages on decency) of the Penal Code; (b) Section 7 of the Child and Young Persons
Act (Sexual exploitation of child or young person); or (c) Section 140 (1) of the Women’s Charter (Offenses
relating to prostitution).

Section 376E (3) of the Penal Code further articulates that for the purposes of this Section, it is immaterial
whether the two or more previous occasions of A having met or communicated with B referred to in Section
376E (1) of this Code took place in or outside of Singapore.

25 – Considers everyone under 18 as a potential victim of online grooming
The Penal Code does not consider everyone under the age of 18 as a potential victim of sexual grooming.
Pursuant to Section 376E of Penal Code, sexual grooming is illegal when committed by a person of or above the
age of 21 years against another person under the age of 16 years.

                   (a) A intentionally meets B or travels with the intention of meeting B; and
                   (b) at the time of the acts referred to in paragraph (a) —
                              (i) A intends to do anything to or in respect of B, during or after the meeting, which if done will involve the commission by
                              A of a relevant offense;
                              (ii) B is under 16 years of age; and
                              (iii) A does not reasonably believe that B is of or above the age of 16 years.
        (2) In subsection (1), “relevant offense” means an offense under —
                   (a) section 354, 354A, 375, 376, 376A, 376B, 376F, 376G or 377A;
                   (b) section 7 of the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap. 38); or
                   (c) section 140(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353).
        (3) For the purposes of this section, it is immaterial whether the 2 or more previous occasions of A having met or communicated with B referred
        to in subsection (1) took place in or outside Singapore.
        (4) A person who is guilty of an offense under this section shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 3 years, or with
        fine, or with both.


                                                                         266
26 – Criminalizes grooming when the offender has the specific intent to have online or offline sexual contact
with a child, or criminalizes grooming regardless of the intent
Section 376E of the Penal Code criminalizes sexual grooming when an offender whose age is of or above the age
of 21 years (A) has the specific intent of meeting another under the age of 16 years (B) for the commission of
prescribed sexual offenses against such child (B).

Furthermore, the Ministry of Home Affairs clarified that besides two prior communications or meetings, a key
element in this offense as prescribed in Section 376E of the Penal Code is that the offender must possess a
criminal intent at the time of meeting the child or at the time of traveling to meet the child to commit a sexual
offense against her. 645

27 – Criminalizes showing pornography to a child as a standalone offense
Section 293 of the Penal Code 646 makes it illegal to sell, let to hire, distribute, exhibit, and circulate to any person
under the age of 21 years any obscene object referred to in Section 292 of the Penal Code with a penalty of
imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or a fine, or both.

28 – Has legislation regarding cyberbullying
According to a survey conducted by Microsoft in 2012, 58% of Singaporean children reported experiencing
cyberbullying, with Singapore ranking the second highest globally for cyberbullying (also known as online-
bullying), while China was ranked first and India was ranked third. 647

Singapore has legislation regarding cyberbullying, although the terms “cyberbullying” and “bullying” are not
explicitly used by Singaporean law. The Protection from Harassment Act (Act No. 17 of 2014) has provisions
criminalizing harassment, unlawful stalking, and related anti-social behaviors, such as bullying in work places or
cyber-bullying in schools, whether committed in the physical world or online.

Any person who by any means uses any threatening, abusive, or insulting words or behavior or makes any
threatening, abusive, or insulting communication, which is heard, seen, or otherwise perceived by any person
likely to be caused harassment, alarm, or distress, shall be guilty of an offense of harassment, alarm, or distress
pursuant to Section 4 of the Protection from Harassment Act. In addition, an illustration to Section 4 of this Act
provides an example of cyber-bullying in schools by stating that “X and Y are classmates. X posts a vulgar tirade
against Y on a website accessible to all of their classmates. One of Y’s classmates shows the message on the
website to Y, and Y is distressed. X is guilty of an offence under this section.”

Accordingly, it is evident that the Singaporean legislative intent is to cover cyber-bullying in schools under
Section 4 of the Protection from Harassment Act, although there is no explicit usage of the terms “bullying”,
“bullying through information and communication technologies”, or “cyber-bullying” under this Act. 648

      Section 26, 9) of the Child Protection Act
Under the provisions of other laws, regardless of a child’s consent, a person is forbidden to act as follows:
              9) Force, threaten, use, induce, instigate, encourage or allow a child to perform or act in a pornographic manner, regardless of whether the
              intention is to obtain remuneration or anything else;
656
      Section 78 of the Child Protection Act
Any person who violates Section 26 shall be liable to a term of imprisonment not exceeding three months or a fine not exceeding 30,000 Baht, or both.
657
      Section 287 of the Penal Code
Whoever:


                                                                               270
the production, possession, exportation, importation, or circulation of the obscene material for the purpose of
trade or by trade, for public distribution or exhibition with imprisonment not exceeding three years, or a fine not
exceeding six thousand Baht, or both. Section 287 (2) of the Penal Code makes it illegal to carry on trade, take
part, or participate in the trade concerning the obscene material or thing or to distribute or exhibit to the public
or hire out such obscene material or thing with a penalty of imprisonment up to three years and/or a fine.

Moreover, the Computer Crime Act (enacted in 2007) 658 contains provisions that address pornography, which
may also cover child pornography. Section 14 of the Computer Crime Act stipulates that any person who
commits an offense involving import to a computer system of any computer data of a pornographic nature into
a computer system that is publicly accessible shall be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years,
or a fine, or both.

Section 21 of the Computer Crime Act 659 further articulates that if a relevant competent official found that any
computer data contains undesirable sets of instructions, a relevant competent official with the authority to
prohibit the sale or dissemination of such may instruct the person who owns or possesses the computer data to:
1) suspend the use of, destroy or correct the computer data therein; or 2) impose a condition with respect to
the use, possession, or dissemination of the undesirable sets of instructions.

2 – Has a clear definition of child pornography
Thai law does not provide a clear definition of “child pornography” or “obscene materials”. However, Section
287 (1) of the Penal Code considers any document, drawing, print, painting, printed matter, picture, poster,
symbol, photograph, cinematograph film, noise tape, picture tape or any other thing which is obscene as
“obscene materials”.

Because Thailand has a civil law system with common law influences, previous decisions of the Supreme Court of
Thailand, in addition to the relevant Codes and Acts, are considered as stated below. 660



        (1)   For the purpose of trade or by trade, for public distribution or exhibition, makes, produces, possesses, brings or causes to be brought into the
              Kingdom, sends or causes to be sent out of the Kingdom, takes away or causes to be taken away, or circulates by any means whatever, any
              document, drawing, print, painting, printed matter, picture, poster, symbol, photograph, cinematograph film, noise tape, picture tape or any
              other thing which is obscene;
        (2)   Carries on trade, or takes part or participates in the trade concerning the aforesaid obscene material or thing, or distributes or exhibits to the
              public, or hires out such material or thing;
        (3)   In order to assist in the circulation or trading of the aforesaid obscene material or thing, propagates or spreads the news by any means
              whatever that there is a person committing the act which is an offense according to this Section, or propagates or spreads the news that the
              aforesaid obscene material or thing may be obtained from any person or by any means,
shall be punished with imprisonment not exceeding three years or fined not exceeding six thousand Baht, or both.

      Section 21 of the Computer Crime Act
If a relevant competent official found that any computer data contains undesirable sets of instructions, a relevant competent official with the authority to
prohibit the sale or dissemination of such, may instruct the person who owns or possesses the computer data to suspend the use of, destroy or correct the
computer data therein, or to impose a condition with respect to the use, possession or dissemination of the undesirable sets of instructions.
The undesirable sets of instructions under paragraph one shall mean to include sets of instructions that cause computer data, a computer system or other
instruction sets to be damaged, destroyed, corrected, changed, added, interrupted or, fail to perform according to pre-determined instructions or
otherwise as required by a relevant Ministerial Rule, with the exception of sets of instructions aimed at preventing or correcting the foregoing sets of
instructions as required by a Minister and published in the Government Gazette.

In relation to a definition of “obscene materials”, in a previous case (Judgment No. 978/2492 of the Supreme
Court of Thailand), the Supreme Court of Thailand defined “obscene” as “anything that is sexually shameful to
the eyes or offensive which is the direct opposite of artistic expression”. In a more recent case (Judgment No.
6301/2533 of the Supreme Court of Thailand), the Supreme Court provided a more explicitly descriptive
definition of “obscene” for the purposes of the case (that concerned an image of an adult woman) and
described the relevant image as “obscene” on the grounds, inter alia, that “it is intended to incite wanton sexual
desire”. 661

3 – Considers everyone under 18 as a potential victim of activities related to child pornography
Section 4 of the Child Protection Act 662 considers everyone under the age of 18 years as a potential victim of
activities related to child pornography. However, this section does not include minors who have attained
majority through marriage according to Section 20 of the Civil and Commercial Code. 663

In Thailand, the age of consent to indecent acts is 15 years pursuant to Section 279 of the Penal Code. In
addition, Section 283bis of the Penal Code stipulates that taking away a person who is over 15 years of age, but
not yet over 18 years of age, for an indecent act, even with the consent of such person, shall constitute a
compoundable offense.

4 – Criminalizes accessing or downloading child pornography images
The law does not explicitly criminalize accessing or downloading child pornography images.

While not specific to child pornography, Section 287 of the Penal Code punishes anyone who circulates “by any
means” any document, drawing, print, painting, printed matter, picture, poster, symbol, photograph,
cinematograph file, noise tape, picture tape or any other thing which is obscene.

5 – Criminalizes possession of child pornography
Thai law does not criminalize possession of child pornography with or without the intent to distribute. However,
Section 287 of the Penal Code punishes anyone who possesses obscene materials for the purposes of public
distribution or exhibition with imprisonment of not more than three years, or a fine not exceeding 6,000 Baht,
or both.

6 – Criminalizes virtual images and sexually exploitative representation of children
While not specific to child pornography, Thai law criminalizes illicit activities involving obscene materials, which
may include sexually exploitative representations of persons. Specifically, Section 287 of the Penal Code states
that obscene materials shall include: 1) written representations (document, printed matter); 2) visual
representations (“drawing”, print, painting, picture, poster, symbol, photograph); 3) visual and audio
representations (cinematograph file, noise tape, picture tape); or 4) any other thing which is obscene.

7 – Addresses the criminal liability of children involved in pornography
Thai law does not address the criminal liability of children involved in pornography for their participation so long
as the children are victims, and not the offenders.

661
      ALLEN & OVERY, supra note 314, at 141.
662
      Extract of Section 4 of the Child Protection Act
In this Act, “Child” means a person below 18 years of age, but does not include those who have attained majority through marriage.
663
      Section 20 of Civil and Commercial Code
A minor becomes sui juris upon marriage, provided that the marriage is made in accordance with the provisions of Section 14448.


                                                                          272
In the case of child offenders, the minimum age for criminal responsibility in Thailand is 14 years old pursuant to
Sections 73 and 74 of the Penal Code. Section 73 of the Penal Code states that a child who has not yet reached
seven years of age shall not be punished for committing what is provided by the law to be an offense. Section 74
of the Penal Code further articulates that whenever a child is over seven years, but not yet over 14 years of age,
and commits what is provided by the law to be an offense, he shall not be punished, but the Court shall have the
power to render the prescribed opinion.

In addition, Section 75 of the Penal Code stipulates that whenever any person over 14 years, but not yet over 17
years of age, commits any act provided by the law to be an offense, the Court shall proceed according to Section
74 of this Code, if the Court does not deem it expedient to pass judgment inflicting punishment on such person
after considering the sense of responsibility and all other things concerning such person. 664

8 – Establishes criminal liability of legal persons for production or commercialization of child pornography
There are no provisions that establish the criminal liability of legal persons for production or commercialization
of obscene materials in general, which might also cover activities related to child pornographic items under Thai
legislation.

9 – Recognizes extraterritorial jurisdiction over child pornography offenses when the alleged offender is a
national of the State; and
10 – Recognizes extraterritorial jurisdiction over child pornography offenses when the victim is a national of
the State
Thailand establishes its extraterritorial jurisdiction over pornography offenses as stipulated in the Computer
Crime Act, which might also cover child pornography offenses when: 1) the alleged offender is its national; or 2)
the victim is its national under the prescribed circumstance as stated below.

Specifically, Section 17 of the Computer Crime Act 665 recognizes extraterritorial jurisdiction of Thailand over
offenses involving pornography stipulated in this Act when: 1) the offender is a national of Thai and the
Government of the country where the offense has occurred or the injured party is required to be punished; or 2)
the offender is a non-citizen and the Thai Government or Thai person who is an injured party or the injured
party is required to be punished.

In addition, regarding offenses prescribed in the Penal Code, Section 8 of this Code 666 stipulates that “Whoever
commits an offence outside the Kingdom shall be punished in the Kingdom; provided that, and, provided further

              by the injured person; or


                                                                              273
that the offence committed be any of the following namely: (a) The offender be a Thai person, and there be a
request for punishment by the Government of the country where the offence has occurred or by the injured

there be a request for punishment by the injured person”.

11 – Establishes the confiscation of assets used to commit or facilitate child offenses; and
12 – Establishes the confiscation of proceeds derived from child pornography offenses
Sections 32 667 and 33 of the Penal Code 668 provide for the forfeiture of assets used to commit offenses involving
obscene materials as stipulated in this Code, which may also govern child pornography offenses.

Section 18 of the Penal Code 669 includes forfeiture of property as a form of punishment. Moreover, Section 33 of
the Penal Code explicitly allows a court to issue an order for the forfeiture of properties as follows: 1) a property

              (b) The offender be an alien, and the Thai Government or a Thai person be the injured person, and there be a request for punishment by the
              injured person;

2 – Has a clear definition of child pornography
Timorese law possibly provides a definition of child pornography as stated below.

Article 176 (1) of the Penal Code indicates that “child pornography” in this Code refers to any material which

any other means, exhibits the sexual activity or sexual organs of a minor for predominantly sexual purposes.

pornography and related offenses as specified by Articles 155 and 176 of the Penal Code.

4 – Criminalizes accessing or downloading child pornography images
The law does not contain explicit provisions which address accessing or downloading child pornography images.

However, under Article 176 (1) of the Penal Code, child pornography includes any material which uses, exposes,
or represents a minor aged less than 17 years performing real or simulated sexual activity or “by any other
means” exhibits the sexual activity or sexual organs of a minor for predominantly sexual purposes.

In addition, Article 176 (2) of the Penal Code punishes any person who produces, disseminates, imports, exports,
offers, sells or possesses “any medium of communication”, instrument, document, or record involving child
pornography for predominantly sexual purposes or with the aim of dissemination.

uses, exposes, or represents a minor aged less than 17 years performing any sexual activity, whether real or
simulated, or by any other means, exhibits the sexual activity or sexual organs of a minor, shall be punishable
with three to ten years imprisonment.

7 – Addresses the criminal liability of children involved in pornography
Timorese law does not address the criminal liability of children involved in pornography for their participation
both in cases of child victims, as well as child offenders. Article 176 of the Penal Code only deals with child
pornography offenses. However, there are no provisions criminalizing activities related to pornography under
the Penal Code.

the Penal Code, only individuals are held criminally liable for offenses stipulated in this Penal Code and this is
non-transferable. According to Article 12 (2) of the Penal Code, corporate entities are subject to criminal
liabilities only for offenses provided in this Penal Code or in specific legislation and as expressly established in
law.

Article 176 of the Penal Code does not provide explicit provisions which recognize criminal liability of the

pornography offenses provided under the Article 176 of the Penal Code.

national of the State; and

stipulates that those who commit acts violating the provisions in Clause 1 of this Article shall, depending on the
nature and seriousness of their violations, be administratively sanctioned or examined for penal liability.

2 – Has a clear definition of child pornography
Vietnamese law does not provide a clear definition of “child pornography”.

In addition, definitions of “decadent objects” and/or “debauched cultural products” are not provided under the
Penal Code.

3 – Considers everyone under 18 as a potential victim of activities related to child pornography
Vietnamese law does not provide explicit provisions that consider everyone under the age of 18 years as
potential victims of activities related to child pornography.

With regard to the definition of the term “child”, there are disparities in the national laws of Vietnam, especially
between the Civil Code, the Penal Code, and the Law on Child Protection, Care and Education.

Article 18 of the Civil Code prescribes that persons who are not yet 18 years old are minors. However, Article 1
of the Law on Child Protection, Care and Education considers Vietnamese citizens under the age of 16 years as
children.

The Penal Code contains provisions related to the age of a potential victim of sexual offenses against children or
juveniles. Article 111, Clause 4 of the Penal Code states that committing rape against a juvenile aged between 16
and under 18 years of age, the offenders shall be sentenced to between five and ten years of imprisonment.
Furthermore, Article 115, Clause 1 of the Penal Code provides that any adults having sexual intercourse with
children aged from 13 to under 16 years shall be sentenced to between one and five years of imprisonment. In
addition, Article 115, Clause 1 of the Penal Code punishes any adults who have sexual intercourse with children
below age 16.

4 – Criminalizes accessing or downloading child pornography images
Vietnamese law does not criminalize accessing or downloading child pornography images. However, the use of

shall be subject to administrative liabilities pursuant to the Decree No. 55/2001/ND-CP on managing, producing
and using Internet services (dated August 23, 2001) (hereafter referred to as “Decree No. 55/2001/ND-CP”). 726

According to Article 41, Clause 5, Point h of Decree No. 55/2001/ND-CP, a fine ranging from VND 10,000,000 to
20,000,000 will be applied to an administrative violation involving loading onto the Internet or taking advantage
of the Internet to spread pornographic information or images, or other information violating legal regulations on
the contents of information on the Internet, but not to the level of seriousness as to apply criminal penalties.

5 – Criminalizes possession of child pornography
Vietnamese law does not criminalize the possession of child pornography or debauched cultural products with
or without the intent to distribute. However, storing child pornography without the intent to distribute shall be
subject to an administrative sanction as stated below.

Regarding activities involving debauched cultural products, the Penal Code explicitly punishes any person who
stockpiles debauched cultural products for the purposes of dissemination. However, considering that the term
“stockpile” can be defined as acts of accumulating a large stock of (goods or materials), 727 it evokes an image of
a larger quantity of material than the term “possession”. Thus, the term “stockpile” has a different meaning
than the word “possession”.

Concerning conducts related to child pornography, a fine between VND 15,000,000 and 20,000,000, as an
administrative sanction, shall be imposed for storing products, culture, information, media, toys, games, or
gadgets with child pornography pursuant to Article 12, Clause 3, point b of the Decree No. 91/2011/ND-CP.

6 – Criminalizes virtual images and sexually exploitative representations of children
Vietnamese law does not explicitly criminalize the production, distribution, possession, and commercialization of
child pornography including virtual images and sexually exploitative representations of children that do not
necessarily use real children in their production.

7 – Addresses the criminal liability of children involved in pornography
The law does not address the criminal liability of children involved in pornography as long as they are victims,
and not offenders.

In the case of a child offender, the minimum age of criminal responsibility in Vietnam is 14 to 16 years old,
depending on the seriousness of the crime committed, pursuant to Article 12 of the Penal Code.

8 – Establishes criminal liability of legal persons for production or commercialization of child pornography
Vietnamese law does not establish grounds for imposing criminal liability on legal person for committing crimes
provided in the Penal Code. Article 2 of the Penal Code states that, “Only those persons who have committed
crimes defined by the Penal Code shall bear the penal liabilities therefore”. In addition, reports of the
Vietnamese Government presented to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child 728 state that, “The key
principle with respect to legal responsibility in the criminal law of Viet Nam is that of individual responsibility.
Hence, under Viet Nam’s laws, the subjects of offences are individuals. If the legal entity carries out the
actions/acts defined in Art. 3 (1) of the Protocol, the individual belonging to such legal entity who commits the
offence shall bear penal liabilities pursuant to relevant articles stipulated in the Penal Code. ”

    : Yes – Contains provisions under the law that criminalize activities related to child pornography
    (G): Generally Yes – does not have provisions under the law criminalizing conducts specifically regarding child pornography, but has provisions under the law criminalizing conducts
   related to pornography or obscenity in general
   P: Partially Yes – does not have provisions criminalizing acts without the intent to distribute, but has provisions under the law criminalizing acts for the purposes of distribution, etc. in
   relation to child pornography or pornography/obscenity in general
   X: No – Does not contain provisions under the law that enumerate criminal offenses and criminal penalties for activities involving child pornography or obscenity/pornography in general




   747
      For the purposes of discussing this part (Appendix D. Table 4 – Legislative Status that Criminalizes Conducts Related to Child Pornography), if countries have a law that provides explicit provisions criminalizing
   offering or providing child pornography, in addition to having provisions under the same law specifying punishment for making available child pornography, the provisions explicitly addressing offer or provision
   of child pornography shall prevail over other provisions governing acts of making available child pornography.
   748
       Section 293B of the Penal Code (amended by Penal Code Amendment Order 2012) criminalizes taking any indecent/obscene photograph or pseudo-photograph of a child. In addition, Section 292 of the Penal
   Code punishes any person, for purposes of distribution, etc. makes or produces any obscene objects.
