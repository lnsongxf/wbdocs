TANGIER readied its workforce for expanding automobile produc-
tion in its region, facilitating the learning of skills that could apply
to the automotive industry, as well as TO aerospace (Kulenovic and
others 2015).

How they did it
•	   Morocco ensured its nationally targeted sectors had an
     adequate supply of skilled workers. Sector priorities set by the
     Office of Professional Training and Employment Promotion
     (OFPPT) closely adhered to those in Morocco’s Emergence
     plan, which targets key sectors. OFPPT works closely with the
     National Agency for the Promotion of Employment and Skills
     (ANAPEC), and together the two agencies offer an online tool
     for job seekers, an innovative program to commercialize entre-
     preneurial ideas, and customized training programs.
•	   Private industry provides feedback on the specific skills it
     needs through special institutional mechanisms—Organs de
     Gouvernance. These exist at both the national and local level,
     and the feedback is channeled to OFPPT, ANAPEC, and univer-
     sities. ANAPEC conducts studies on sectoral workforce needs
     in which it collaborates with training institutes, universities,
     as well as human resources managers and sectoral professional
     associations.
•	   IFMIA, the Institute for Training in the Automotive Industry
     Trades, is operated by Renault next to its plant and serves to
     fill the talent pipeline in automotive production. IFMIA was
     tasked with training for jobs within Renault as well as for
     components suppliers. It was funded by numerous national
     agencies but operated by Renault, and it taught skills such as
     stamping, welding, riveting, assembly, hydraulics, pneumatics,
     electrics, materials handling, servo systems, mechanics, robot-
     ics, forklift operations, sanding, painting, and logistics.

What they achieved
Maintaining and enhancing the 5,500 direct jobs and 30,000 indi-
rect jobs supported by Renault at its site in Tangier has improved
the city’s position in the automotive sector, helped solidify Renault’s
commitment to its Tangier location, and opened the way to auto
industry growth. A Nissan plant is expected to be built in the area
(a sister plant to the Renault one) and Delphi Automotive and Lear
Automotive already employ 4,900 and 2,500, respectively.

What cities can learn
Tangier’s workforce development programs closely aligned with
its targeted sectors, which is critically important to establishing
local capacity and enhancing the attractiveness of those sectors to
increased foreign and domestic investment. The city made use of
investment attraction strategies to draw several producers after
Renault and provide the skilled workers those producers and local
suppliers need to meet growing production needs.
