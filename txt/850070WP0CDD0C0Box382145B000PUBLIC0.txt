I. Introduction

The World Bank’s goals of reducing extreme poverty and ensuring shared prosperity1 cannot
be achieved without addressing the impacts of climate change. Climate change multiplies the
existing vulnerability of the poor, pushing those living on the margins even closer to the edge.
The World Bank report “Turn Down the Heat: Why a 4°C World Must be Avoided” explored the
developmental impacts of 2°C and 4°C of warming above preindustrial levels and established
that the effects of a 4°C world will not be evenly distributed, nor would the consequences be
simply an extension of those felt at 2°C of warming. The report established that the tropics will
be most affected, affecting poorer countries more and that within wealthier countries, the poor
will be harder hit (World Bank 2012c). Poor people in developing countries bear the brunt of
climate change impacts while contributing very little to its causes. The World Bank recognizes
that climate change is an issue of social justice and is wholly committed to helping those that
will be the hardest hit to adapt while continuing to support aggressive mitigation efforts (Mearns
and Norton, 2010).

Analysis on the “Economics of Adaptation to Climate Change” estimates that the cost of
adapting to 2°C of warming above preindustrial levels by 2050 will be in the range of US$70
to US$100 billion a year (World Bank 2010a). In line with the “polluter pays” principle, develop-
ing countries demand that financing to mitigate and adapt to climate change be provided by
wealthy countries in addition to Overseas Development Assistance. So far, US$2.5 billion has
been mobilized globally for climate change adaptation in addition to existing Overseas Develop-
ment Assistance flows. While the concept of additionality is important, the needs are too urgent
and great to ignore the fact that a lot can and should be done with existing development financ-
ing. It is imperative to integrate resilience-building approaches into development efforts to help
the poor and vulnerable access the financial, technical, and institutional resources necessary to
adapt to climate change.

The World Bank is exploring instruments and strategies to help the poor manage risk more
effectively in order to move out of poverty and build resilience to increasing climate and disas-
ter risk. This paper is part of a larger effort to document, assess, and promote scalable models
and approaches to empower poor communities to manage a climate and disaster risk agenda in
support of their development goals and to identify practical ways of getting climate and disaster
risk financing directly to the ground level where impacts are felt. Social funds, social protection
systems and safety nets, community-driven development (CDD) projects, livelihoods-support,

2 • Climate and Disaster Resilience: The Role for Community-Driven Development




                       and related operational platforms can serve as useful vehicles for promoting community-level
                       resilience to disaster and climate risk.

                       Community-driven development is an approach “… that gives control over planning deci-
                       sions and investment resources to community groups and local governments.” Historically,
                       programs using a CDD approach grew out of situations of crisis (financial shock, conflict, and
                       even natural disasters) and were meant as transitional instruments for service delivery where
                       governments (particularly newly installed administrations) lacked capacity to deliver services
                       (Wong 2012). By optimizing the use of community actors, a CDD approach places less stress
                       on government line agencies and at the same time is able to reach very large numbers of poor
                       people. A CDD approach has traditionally been used by Social Funds, which are government
                       agencies or programs that channel grants to communities for small-scale development projects.
                       Social Funds typically finance a mixture of socioeconomic infrastructure (e.g., building or reha-
                       bilitating schools, water supply systems, and roads), productive investments (e.g., microfinance
                       and income-generating projects), social services (e.g., supporting nutrition campaigns, literacy
                       programs, youth training, and support to the elderly and disabled), or capacity-building programs
                       (e.g., training for civil and local governments) (World Bank 2009).

                       This paper examines the World Bank’s CDD portfolio to assess experience to date and to
                       explore the potential for building the resilience of vulnerable communities to climate and
                       disaster risk through CDD programs. It aims to be useful to both the Climate Change Adapta-
                       tion/Disaster Risk Management practitioner as well as the CDD practitioner. The paper assesses
                       the scale of climate and disaster resilience support provided through CDD projects from 2001–11
                       and characterizes the forms of support provided. For the climate change adaption/disaster
                       risk management (DRM) practitioner, it discusses the characteristics of a CDD approach and
                       how they lend themselves to building local-level climate resilience. For the CDD practitioner,
                       the paper describes the types of activities that support resilience building and explores future
                       directions for CDD to become a more effective vehicle for reducing climate and disaster risk.
                       Throughout the paper, project examples are used to demonstrate key points. While a number of
                       resources are provided for working with communities on climate and disaster risk (see annex 1),
                       this paper is not meant to be a detailed manual for integrating DRM and climate change adaption
                       into CDD operations.


                       Methodology
                       A main component of this study consists of a review the Bank’s CDD project database from
                       fiscal years 2001–11.2 The database is maintained by the CDD Community of Practice Secretariat
                       housed in the Social Development Department. In addition to the full range of operations nor-
                       mally covered by CDD portfolio reviews (social funds, community-based rural development, and

                       2. The CDD database lists the CDD portfolio since fiscal 2000, covering all projects that have used a CDD approach
                       in any component of the project. This includes projects that do not necessarily have CDD as their primary focus
                       but allocate a portion of World Bank funding to be used in a manner consistent with the CDD typology. The data
                       are obtained through an end-of-fiscal year annual review of all project appraisal documents for World Bank-
                       funded lending operations. CDD value-added data is extracted from the project appraisal documents and verified
                       with the task team leader before being included in the database. It is accessible at www.worldbank.org/cdd.
                                                                                                                 I. Introduction • 3




rural livelihoods support operations), the review also covers analytical work, including a recent
review of the overall CDD portfolio; technical assistance; and operations supported by Climate
Investment Funds that utilize a CDD approach, notably the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience
(PPCR).3

Project documents for operations included in the CDD project database were reviewed to
identify activities that support climate and disaster resilience. While it is true that many
investments aimed at improving the general welfare of poor households may contribute to
their resilience to climate and disaster risk, this review takes a more conservative approach to
identify clear and explicit linkages between project activities and outcomes aimed at reducing
risk to climate change and natural hazards. For the purposes of this review, support for “climate
resilience” is defined as actions that seek to reduce sensitivity to or increase adaptive capacity
in the face of extreme weather events (drought, storm surges, cyclone-induced flooding, etc.) or
longer-term climate changes (e.g., changing means of temperature or precipitation). The review
also includes CDD operations related to geological hazards, such as earthquakes, landslides, and
tsunamis because building risk-management capacity for these hazards is assumed to have much
in common with and spillover effects for climate risk management.

Out of 804 CDD projects approved between 2001 and 2011, 161 projects were selected for
the review based on an examination of Project Appraisal Documents, Project Documents, or
Implementation Completion Reports. Criteria for including a project in the portfolio review
were twofold. First, the project needed to allocate 30 percent or more of the overall proj-
ect amount to CDD. Second, as discussed above, the project documentation had to articulate
explicit objectives related to building disaster risk-management capacity and/or increasing adap-
tive capacity to weather-related hazards or longer-term climate trends. A few projects from
the database that allocate less than 30 percent of the total amount to CDD were included as
exceptions because they explicitly aim at building climate resilience through a CDD approach.
Because the study did not review every project-related document, there may be cases where a
project mentions DRM or climate change adaption-related objectives in other documents (e.g.,
Operational Manuals) but were not identified as a climate or disaster-related project.

Project documents for CDD climate and disaster resilience projects were then analyzed to
assess the scale of investment in community-level resilience building and identify any trends
in terms of the type of interventions they support. Project documents and other relevant
studies were reviewed to specifically identify how resilience building was being supported and
to extract lessons related to good practice or challenges that need to be addressed related to
resilience building. Lessons were extracted from Implementation Completion Reports where
available but mainly from learning events organized by the Social Resilience and Climate Change
cluster of the Social Development Department, which brought together World Bank country
office-based task teams via videoconferencing. Two such events were organized (in May and
November 2011), including country teams from Bangladesh, Brazil, Bolivia, Ethiopia, India, Mon-
golia, and Tajikistan, with additional participation from teams in Malawi, Morocco, Tanzania,

Yemen, and Zambia.

                       and the Philippines. The teams shared operational experience to exchange lessons and identify
                       common challenges faced in supporting climate resilience through CDD and livelihoods support
                       operations.

                       As a final caveat, it should be noted that the findings presented here are not based on impact
                       evaluations of CDD projects related to disaster and climate resilience. While available litera-
                       ture on the impact of CDD projects more broadly was drawn on as a resource, this initiative was
                       limited to a desk review of available project documents and the results of the learning events
                       mentioned above. The study did not assess the impact of project activities against resilience-
                       building goals. This is a critical area for further study, as discussed in the final chapter of the
                       report.
    Why Does a CDD
II. 
    Approach Make Sense
    for Building Resilience?

Understanding and Fostering Resilience
In order to understand how a CDD approach can help build resilience, it is first necessary to
define resilience in a useful way and understand how it relates to climate change. While the
concept of resilience is not new, it is experiencing resurgence in the humanitarian and develop-
ment communities as agencies grapple with conceptualizing and measuring the resilience of
communities in the face of climate change. Benson et al. (2012) presents a brief discussion on the
evolution of resilience theory and offers a working definition of social resilience: ”The ability to
withstand, recover from, and reorganize in response to crises so that all members of society
may develop or maintain the ability to thrive.” This definition reflects the growing consensus
among development and humanitarian partners that the definition of resilience needs to go
beyond the definition traditionally used within the disaster risk management community that
frames resilience as the ability to “cope or bounce back” from shocks or extreme events.4

In addition to resisting and recovering from shocks, thriving despite crisis in a changing cli-
mate also requires the ability to reorganize, that is, to generate new ways of operating or
new systemic relationships as necessary. While the starting point to understanding resilience
is a clear understanding of existing levels of socioeconomic vulnerability and risk management
capacity, climate change entails a number of characteristics that require a more dynamic view of
vulnerability and new ways of supporting resilience—they are diverse, long-term, and unpredict-
able. Adapting to these traits is challenging because they require making decisions under high
levels of uncertainty. The 2010 World Development Report: Development and Climate Change,
echoes this by stating, “Climate change adds an additional source of unknowns for decision mak-
ers to manage” and that, “Accepting uncertainty [is] inherent to the climate change problem.”

In this context, it is useful to consider the critical characteristics of resilience and how resil-
ience-building efforts facilitate or promote these characteristics. Martin-Breen and Anderies
(2011) identify three core properties of resilience:

•	   Modularity (networks)
•	   Diversity and redundancy
•	   Responsive, regulatory feedbacks



4. Annex 3 provides a full glossary of key terms used throughout the report.



                                                        5
6 • Climate and Disaster Resilience: The Role for Community-Driven Development




                       While others have developed more detailed, nuanced lists of resilience characteristics (see, for
                       example, Bahadur et al. 2010), these three core properties resonate throughout most compila-
                       tions. Based on this, a few broad categories for action can be identified for resilience building:

                       •	   Support bottom-up approaches that make use of social networks and support autono-
                            mous adaptation based on the lived experience of poor communities
                       •	   Support communities to increase diversity and fallback options (e.g., diversification of liveli-
                            hoods into activities less sensitive to climate-related or other forms of risk, such as through
                            voluntary migration)
                       •	   Enhance social learning and sound governance as a form of regulatory feedback (e.g., build-
                            ing capacity in participatory approaches to scenario-based planning or measures to increase
                            social accountability in the use of public finance for climate change response)
                       •	   Understand the gender dimensions of climate change and empower women as resilience
                            champions.

                       Women are often the designers and builders of community resilience in poor communities.
                       The final area on empowering women is based on evidence regarding the role of women in
                       building resilience. For example, the experiences of grassroots women leading disaster recovery
                       efforts has grown to include their engagement with local, national, and regional authorities to
                       inform the development of policies and programs that support pro-poor, community-driven
                       resilience building (Arnold and Burton 2011). There are also a number of examples where empow-
                       ering women to exercise leadership within their communities contributes to climate resilience,
                       ranging from disaster preparedness efforts in Indonesia and Nicaragua, to better forest gover-
                       nance in India and Nepal, to coping with drought in the Horn of Africa (World Bank 2011b).

                       There is no silver bullet for building the resilience of the poor. It calls for multiple, complemen-
                       tary actions at different geographic and institutional scales. What’s more, assessing the impact
                       of interventions to build social resilience is no easy task, particularly in the context of climate
                       change. In their proposal for an adaptation results framework, Brooks et al. (2011) lay out some of
                       the challenges, including:

                       •	   Addressing the diverse nature of climate change impacts (extreme events, reduced agricul-
                            tural productivity, vulnerability of infrastructure, water stress, loss of biodiversity, etc.) and
                            the fact that there is no single metric for adaptation as there is for mitigation (greenhouse
                            gas emissions)
                       •	   Addressing the very long timeframes associated with climate change impacts, which
                            may take decades to unfold and therefore decades to see if interventions achieved their
                            intended results
                       •	   Dealing with an ever-shifting climate risk baseline
                       •	   Getting beyond adaptation as coping with existing climate variability and “climate proofing”
                            business-as-usual development against incremental changes in existing risks.

Therefore, while the success of adaptation measures will only become apparent over a long time
period, the challenge is to identify activities that are likely to contribute to resilience.

There are a number of characteristics inherent in the CDD approach that promote the core
properties of resilience laid out above. The CDD approach operates on the principles of local
empowerment, participatory governance, demand-responsiveness, administrative autonomy,
greater downward accountability, and enhanced local capacity. CDD projects are known for
delivering cost-effective infrastructure and services that tend to be better maintained due to
the high level of ownership that communities have in the project. By involving people in making
their own development investment decisions, they have the added benefits of building capac-
ity from the bottom up and making decision makers accountable to the people they serve
(Wong 2012). These and other characteristics are explored in greater detail below in terms of
their potential contribution to resilience.


Scaling Up for Increasing Climate and Disaster Risk
The Bank’s 4 Degree report confirms that the adverse effects of a warming climate are “tilted
against many of the world’s poorest regions” (World Bank 2012c). Millions of poor people will
face greater challenges in terms of extreme events, health impacts, food security, livelihood
security, migration, water security, cultural identity, and other risks. Urgent support is needed at
the ground level where impacts are being felt, and national governments need to work at a scale
greater than ever before.

CDD programs have the potential to deliver resilience support at the scale necessary to
address climate change adaptation and increasing disaster risk. CDD has the potential to reach
large numbers of poor people directly and has been implemented in 105 countries. While CDD
projects often start out as small-scale operations that work outside formal government systems,
the second and third generations of these programs often scale up to regional or national levels.
Indonesia, for example, has the largest ongoing CDD program that operates in more than 60,000
villages across the country. The Philippines CDD program has invested about US$118 million in
5,326 community subprojects in the poorest provinces and municipalities covering about 10 mil-
lion rural poor and is expanding up to the national level. In Nigeria, the third phase of National
Fadama Project covers all 37 states of the country, benefitting about 2.2 million households or
about 16 million beneficiaries.


Empowering Communities and Reducing Poverty Builds Resilience
Strengthening community-level resilience requires addressing the underlying causes of vul-
nerability in addition to specific disaster risk management and climate change adaptation
activities. For more than three decades, humanitarian and development practitioners alike have
been emphasizing the need to address the underlying drivers of vulnerability to natural hazards
(e.g., poverty, marginalization, etc.) in order to make progress in reducing the social and economic

 Box 1. Building Institutions of the Poor: India’s National Rural Livelihoods Mission

 The National Rural Livelihoods Mission is scaling up a model that has proven successful in Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, and other drought-
 prone states. The approach begins with empowering poor women through their own self-help groups to progressively build experience
 with savings and microloans. Over time, federations of self-help groups are supported that increase their bargaining power in gaining
 access to a wide variety of goods and support services on behalf of their members. The same institutional platform lends itself very well
 to building climate resilience by mediating access to specialized advice regarding on-farm drought adaptation measures; creating linkages
 with other government programs such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) that provides paid
 labor for eligible households in public works, including building watershed management structures; and facilitating opportunities for fam-
 ily members through labor migration. A GEF project under preparation—the Sustainable Livelihoods and Adaptation to Climate Change
 project—seeks to strengthen the potential of the National Rural Livelihoods Mission and MGNREGA to jointly leverage investments in
 climate and livelihood resilience.


                              costs of disasters.5 While the global climate change debate has swung the pendulum back to
                              an emphasis on the hazard/exposure side of the equation, there is a growing recognition that
                              climate resilience will be mainly built by addressing the underlying, nonclimate-related sources
                              of vulnerability (Ribot 2010). CDD projects can support a range of activities that address both the
                              underlying causes and impacts of disasters.

                              CDD programs can provide communities with a broad platform for empowerment and pov-
                              erty reduction in addition to a diverse range of risk management options. Over the past
                              decade, CDD programs have become a key operational strategy for national governments as
                              well as numerous international aid agencies for the delivery of services and as a way to promote
                              bottom-up development approaches where existing systems are not working. To date, approxi-
                              mately 105 International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and International Devel-
                              opment Association countries have undertaken projects with a CDD approach. Wong (2012)
                              summarizes the evidence of these aspects from 17 rigorous impact evaluations of the World
                              Bank-supported CDD programs. Out of nine projects that reported impacts on the household
                              welfare, seven found positive change. For example in the Nepal Poverty Alleviation Fund, the
                              estimated net program impact for the participants on real per capita consumption growth was
                              19 percent. Where a participatory well-being ranking was used, a larger decline of 24 percentage
                              points in food insecurity for households in disadvantaged castes or ethnic groups was found.
                              Positive findings were also evident in CDD projects in India (Andhra Pradesh) and the Philippines.
                              Finally, improvements in the access to and use of services, especially in health, education, and
                              drinking water, are evident across the CDD programs reviewed. In Senegal, for example, the
                              National Rural Infrastructure Program improved access to clean water and health services by
                              22.4 percent and 24.1 percent, respectively, in the treatment areas as compared to the control
                              areas. The National Rural Livelihoods Mission in India (box 1) provides another good example of a
                              broad-based approach to poverty reduction and community empowerment.

Local Action to Address Local Impacts of Disasters
and Climate Change
The impacts of climate change are local; action to address it must engage those most affected.
Climate science is critical to understanding the potential impacts that communities will be facing
in the near and distant future. Yet while the science is improving every day, it is still relatively
limited at the local level. This need not be a constraint on thinking about how to build resil-
ience. By drawing on the lived experience of communities, much can be learned about both
the impacts of climate change and ways in which autonomous adaptation can be supported.
National governments, development agencies, the private sector, and researchers rarely have a
good understanding of the strategies poor communities are already implementing to adapt to
climate change and increasing disaster risk. The findings of work from Moser et al. (2010) suggest
that delivering resources at the local level to support these strategies can be an effective part of
long-term investment for building climate resilience.

CDD offers the ability to tailor interventions to the local context. By channeling funds directly
to the community level and engaging communities in making the investment decisions, CDD
projects can make use of local knowledge and expertise for a more effective outcome. Saint
Lucia’s Second Disaster Mitigation Project (2009–11) supported the expansion of the Manage-
ment of Slope Stability in Communities (MoSSaiC) program, which helps communities manage
landslide risk. The concept arose in 2004 from discussions with the Government of Saint Lucia
and the local social fund that were implementing a project to improve footpath access in a
low-income urban community. Rainfall-triggered landslides were known to be a major problem
in this and many other communities. However, advice to that point had suggested that little
could be done to stabilize the hillsides. Outside experts believed that improved surface water
management could provide an inexpensive way of improving urban slope stability and con-
ducted house-by-house discussions with community residents to identify the localized causes
of the landside issues and confirm that surface water drainage would improve slope stability.
Residents’ detailed knowledge of highly localized slope features was combined with the local
engineers’ knowledge of landslide processes to develop a community-wide drainage plan that
then engaged local contractors in its construction. Drains were designed to intercept overland
flow of rainfall and capture household water (roof water and grey water) and, at the same time,
reduce landslide hazard (Anderson and Holcombe 2013).


Resilience Cannot be Achieved by Working at
the Community Level Alone
Scaling up and sustaining community-based resilience calls for bridging the gap between the
local, subnational, and national levels, and for understanding the complementary roles of
formal and informal institutions. World Bank research (Agarwal et al. 2011; World Bank 2011a)
has found that strong local institutions (both formal and informal) are essential for the success-
ful implementation of community-based adaptation strategies. However, there is often a gap
in terms of boundary organizations that can effectively link local-level adaptation actions and

 Box 2. Pakistan’s North West Frontier Province On-Farm Water Management Project

 In Pakistan, irrigation and drainage systems faced severe problems, including water scarcity, water-logging and salinity, over-exploitation of
 groundwater, inadequate operation and maintenance, and insufficient cost recovery. There were no effective fora for farmers to raise their
 concerns and excessive intervention of the government in irrigation management did not encourage meaningful participation of farmers
 in the system management. To address the challenge, through the North West Frontier Province On-Farm Water Management Project,
 Farmer Organizations/Federation of Water Users Associations were established and formally contracted with government agencies for
 transferred or joint management of the irrigation systems. The farmer bodies participated in the planning, design, construction, and main-
 tenance of irrigation systems and water resources. Farmers also made financial contributions to the capital cost of investments and regular
 O&M of their irrigation systems. The formal contracts have empowered farmer organizations with clear legal status and roles, which have
 positively affected farmers’ linkages and working relationships with the Irrigation and Drainage Authority. It was found that beneficiary
 participation was more effective in cases where the irrigation management was formally and fully transferred to farmer organizations.


                             national and subnational-level planning, and where they exist, their capacity is usually limited
                             and the support they receive from national and subnational agencies is often inadequate. Com-
                             munities must be connected to higher-level policy, technical assistance and information for
                             effective adaptation and DRM support.

                             The CDD approach can help to promote the objective of working across scales. CDD programs
                             that have been scaled up work to create linkages between decentralized sector ministries, local
                             government, and community-based initiatives within a “local space”—a concept of interme-
                             diate scale above the community and below the regional and national levels. For example, in
                             Benin, the National Community Driven Development Project sought to structurally integrate the
                             CDD approach into the decentralization process, which successfully provided capacity-building
                             opportunities to communities as well as to local governments and sectoral ministries. In Malawi,
                             over the past two decades, the Malawi Social Action Fund evolved from an autonomous (parallel)
                             Social Fund to the Government’s main Local Development Financing mechanism. The focus of
                             the project also shifted from emergency response to general local development and livelihoods.
                             The Niger Pilot Program for Climate Resilience provided recommendations for the Community
                             Action Project for Climate Resilience as well as the Phase II of the Community Action Project
                             to integrate the climate dimension into local council development plans, give more responsibili-
                             ties to community institutions, and envisage the planning/implementation of inter-communal
                             actions to combat climate change (World Bank 2011c).


                             Women’s Empowerment is a Key Ingredient for Resilience
                             Climate change efforts provide an important opportunity to engage women as active agents
                             of resilience building rather than passive recipients of adaptation support. Women are dis-
                             proportionately vulnerable to the impacts of extreme events, and this must be addressed when
                             supporting communities’ ability to adapt. Perhaps more importantly, however, climate change
                             provides an opportunity for positive social transformation on gender equity. The briefing note
                             on Gender and Climate Change: Three Things You Should Know (World Bank 2011b) details the

benefits of empowering women as climate and disaster risk-management champions and docu-
ments the impact that women’s leadership can have on building climate resilience and promot-
ing low-emissions development pathways.

When properly designed, CDD projects can also contribute to women’s empowerment, which,
in turn, builds resilience. Well-designed CDD projects are an effective tool for empowering
women at the local level in developing countries, using measures to promote the capacity build-
ing and participation of women throughout the whole project cycle. For example, in pastoral
communities of Kenya and Ethiopia, livelihood diversification made possible through capacity-
building support to women’s savings and loans groups helped communities better manage the
risks associated with the 2005–08 drought cycle by generating income, preserving assets, and
enhancing food security. In this case, women played an important leadership role, inspired in part
by exchange visits across the Kenyan–Ethiopia border. In India, the National Rural Livelihoods
Mission also has a strong focus on women’s empowerment, working to strengthen women’s
self-help groups and progressively building experience with savings and microloans (see box 1).

III. 
     Investment Thus Far
     of CDD in Resilience?

Between 2001–11, the World Bank’s overall CDD portfolio averaged US$2.27 billion a year in
new lending commitments (figure 1). There were a total of 375 CDD projects undergoing imple-
mentation when this review was conducted. Regionally, most projects are being implemented in
the Africa Region, followed by Latin America and the Caribbean and South Asia. Sectorally, the
bulk of the portfolio is with Agriculture and Rural Development, followed by Social Protection,
Social Development and Urban Development.

Over fiscal 2001–11, 161 CDD projects invested US$12 billion in climate resilience. This portfo-
lio review looked at World Bank-supported CDD projects that were approved over an 11-year
period, from fiscal 2001 through fiscal 2011. The value of the project components (World Bank
funding plus any co-financing) that contribute to building climate and disaster resilience is US$12
billion, more than US$1 billion per year over this period.

                       While US$1 billion annually is a significant investment, the needs are enormously greater. It
                       is important to put these numbers into perspective. International climate law6 stipulates that
                       developed countries provide “new and additional” climate change financing to developing
                       countries. While there is no consensus on how to determine additionality and how the concept
                       applies to developed-country financial pledges, the concept is critical to reaching an interna-
                       tional agreement and making progress to address climate change. As mentioned previously, the
                       World Bank estimates that the cost of adapting to 2°C of warming above preindustrial levels by
                       2050 will be approximately US$100 billion a year (World Bank 2010a), and in the absence of urgent
                       mitigation action, we are likely to reach 4°C of warming by 2100 (World Bank 2012a. To date, only
                       US$2.5 billion has been mobilized globally for climate change adaptation in addition to existing
                       Overseas Development Assistance flows. It is an injustice to make the poor pay for a problem
                       they did not create. It is arguably an even greater injustice, however, if development agencies fail
                       to ensure that existing development support effectively contributes to building the resilience
                       of the poor to climate change.

The CDD “climate/disaster resilience portfolio” can be looked at through different lenses that
offer some insights into the types of interventions, key entry points for supporting resilience,
and supporting efforts along an “adaptation spectrum.” Interventions to support climate and
disaster resilience through CDD include a number of public and private goods both for disaster
response and recovery and for ex ante risk reduction. Projects could include any one or a com-
bination of the following activities (see table 1 for a few examples):

•	   Construction or reconstruction/repair of productive or protective infrastructure
•	   Labor-intensive public works
•	   Building institutions of the poor: social capital and community mobilization
•	   Safety nets/cash transfers for disaster relief/recovery or longer-term resilience
•	   Microfinance services, including savings and credit
•	   Weather insurance
•	   Disaster risk management/early warning and response capacity
•	   Natural resource-based livelihood support
•	   Agriculture-based livelihood support
•	   Livelihood diversification support
•	   Policy support (district, state, or national level)
•	   Capacity development for collective action
•	   Improved access to climate information
•	   Climate resilient planning


CDD Support to Disaster Recovery and Reduction
Perhaps one of the simplest ways to classify CDD resilience projects is according to whether
they support post-disaster recovery and reconstruction or ex ante risk climate and disaster
risk reduction. Looking at the portfolio of 161 projects over the 11-year period, one may expect
to see a trend corresponding to the evolution that has taken place over the past years within the
humanitarian and development communities of shifting from a reactive, post-disaster response
approach to one of proactive, ex ante risk reduction. While no such clear trend emerges across
the entire portfolio, there are a couple of noticeable aspects regarding disaster risk management:

•	   While not in the original design, a number of ongoing CDD programs have provided effec-
     tive disaster response and recovery support. When CDD programs were up and running
     in places where a natural disaster struck, their on-the-ground presence allowed a rapid and
     flexible response to local emergency needs. The use of CDD “infrastructure” (e.g., estab-
     lished village committees and processes for resource flows and implementation) are quite
     adaptable to delivering in emergencies. A review of impact evaluations of 17 CDD programs
     (Wong 2012), noted that while five countries suffered setbacks in implementing their CDD
     programs when a disaster struck, several programs were able to serve as community safety
     nets in response to the emergency (see box 3 for examples).
16 • Climate and Disaster Resilience: The Role for Community-Driven Development




 Box 3. CDD Projects Responding to Disasters

 In Madagascar, the Community Development Fund Project supported communal development plans, subprojects in communities, and ca-
 pacity building of community associations and officials. When cyclones hit the country in 2004, the already-established local participatory
 platform of the project executing unit served as a vehicle for emergency response, including the distribution of nutritional supplements
 and other provisions for pregnant and lactating women and children under five; critical medicines to combat outbreaks of disease, such
 as respiratory infections, pneumonia, and malaria; and the distribution of drinking water, soap, and water treatment kits. More recently,
 several Madagascar social funds have also helped promote climate resilient norms in social and productive infrastructure (e.g., schools and
 health centers).

 When the earthquake and tsunami hit Aceh, Indonesia in 2004, Phase III of the Urban Poverty Project was under preparation and the
 Kecamatan Development Project was ongoing in Aceh. The post-disaster project provided supplemental support to Urban Poverty Project
 III to address the particular needs of recovery. It provided grants for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of community infrastructure in
 the areas identified to be most in need. The project provided effective disaster recovery support and had the added benefit of support-
 ing the psychological recovery process of affected people by empowering them to be the drivers of the reconstruction process of their
 communities.



                              •	   Within a number of long-running CDD programs in hazard-prone countries, there is an
                                   evolution from a reactive to a more proactive risk management approach. In a number
                                   of cases, ongoing CDD programs have become de facto emergency response and recovery
                                   mechanisms. In these programs, there were explicit efforts to integrate disaster risk reduc-
                                   tion into the reconstruction efforts, and in some cases there are initiatives to integrate a
                                   more proactive risk management approach to both natural hazards and longer-term climate
                                   change (see box 4).


 Box 4. Strengthening Resilience in Bangladesh

 When Bangladesh was hit by Cyclone Sidr in 2007 and Cyclone Aila in 2009, the first phase of the Empowerment and Livelihood Project,
 which began in 2003, provided effective recovery support. In 2012, building on this experience, the second phase of the project, locally
 referred to as “Nuton Jibon (New Life),” considered vulnerability to natural hazards in the project design. The project aims to support
 the rural poor to improve their livelihoods, quality of life, and strengthen their resilience to climate variability, natural hazards, and other
 shocks. In addition to poverty and market accessibility, criteria for the selection of subdistricts are also based on criteria related to natural
 hazard exposure. The focus on building institutions of the poor through direct financing to village-level institutions has been maintained
 with an enhanced focus on building preparedness to hazard events and long-term resilience.

 Once a village has adopted the program, it follows a sequence of planning and implementation steps that make up the Village Develop-
 ment Cycle. Communities undertake a participatory planning process to determine local priorities and the best use for their funds. Given
 the core risk reduction and resilience goals of the proposed project, one of the key steps for the communities is participatory vulnerability
 analyses, which result in disaster preparedness plans and investments that enable villages to better anticipate, withstand, and recover from
 shocks and disasters. For example, the locations and design of community centers, rural roads, tube wells, and other works are informed by
 the vulnerability analysis. The analysis and subsequent risk reduction efforts are fully integrated into the Village Development Cycle and,
 collectively, they make up the “Resilience Cycle” named by the project.

 Country     Project (Year)            Description of Approach/Support
 India       Rajasthan Rural           The climate adaptation component supports various adaptation approaches at the household and
             Livelihoods Project       community level in the areas of community water resources management, diversification of farm and
             (2010–16)                 nonfarm livelihoods, and climate risk management tools. It also provides assistance to the state’s policy
                                       framework on climate change adaptation and knowledge development for climate resilience.
 Zambia      Emergency Drought         The project combined an immediate response of public works component with medium- to long-term
             Recovery Project          capacity-building efforts for the country to cope with natural events. It strengthened the government’s
             (2002–05)                 early warning system, drought management arrangements, and a cohesive and responsive longer-term
                                       safety net framework at the central and the district government levels.
 Algeria     Rural Employment          In the Soil Erosion Control component, activities such as reforestation, riverbank management,
             Project (2003–08)         terracing and biological control, flood control infrastructure, and forestry rehabilitation are selected
                                       by a participatory approach. The Agricultural Development component supported activities including
                                       rain-fed and irrigated fruit tree plantations, land clearing, rural roads upgrading and rehabilitation, small
                                       livestock production, beekeeping, and handicraft activities with specific consideration given to women’s
                                       participation.
 Lao PDR     Agricultural              The project increased crop production and farm income of poor small-scale subsistence farmers
             Development Project       through the provision of a secure irrigation system during the dry season, improved water control during
             (2000–08)                 the wet season, better on-farm water management, better farming practices through extension and
                                       on-farm research, and access to improved seeds and production diversification. It also supported social
                                       infrastructure (water supplies, sanitation, and access roads), resulted in both direct social and economic
                                       benefits to all rural households in the project area. Income-generating activities under the Village
                                       Investment for the Poor component specifically targeted poor landless households.



Different Sectors Supported by CDD Projects
Resilience efforts supported through CDD approaches have focused on a number of sectors
over the period reviewed, with Agriculture and Rural Development comprising more than
half of the support. Social Protection is the second largest area of focus, with 12 percent of the
resilience lending. Social protection programs, which are comprised of both social assistance
(e.g., cash transfers, school feeding, targeted food assistance, and subsidies) and social insurance

                         climate resilience is presented in greater detail in other studies, including “Social Protection for

Regardless of the sector, CDD project components focused on disaster and climate resilience
adopt one or more of three key entry points: livelihood support, natural resource manage-
ment, and/or infrastructure. The majority of CDD resilience projects support infrastructure
interventions, followed by livelihood support and natural resource management. A few projects
support two of the areas, and two of the 161 projects reviewed cover all three areas. (Table 2
provides some illustrative examples.) CDD projects are typically designed with villages or a local
administrative grouping as the unit of operations. As the impacts of disasters and climate change
do not limit themselves to administrative boundaries, it may be useful to design CDD programs
with a particular hazard area or risk profile in mind, particularly when there is a focus on natural
resource management activities.


CDD Activities Along an Adaptation Continuum
Another useful way to categorize CDD resilience activities is to situate them along an “adap-
tation continuum.” The idea of an adaptation continuum was first suggested by a team at the
World Resources Institute (McGray et al. 2007) to help clarify the relationship between devel-
opment and adaptation. Development activities that address the underlying causes of human
vulnerability lie at one end of the continuum, and at the opposite end, there are more special-
ized interventions targeting distinct impacts of climate change that fall outside the realm of
“traditional” development. In between the two extremes lies a broad spectrum of interventions
that focus on addressing the underlying causes of vulnerability or on specific climate impacts
to varying degrees (see also Ribot 2010). Figure 5 positions a number of typical instruments sup-
ported by CDD and climate resilience projects along such a continuum.

CDD programs already include poverty reduction goals that address the underlying causes
of vulnerability. In the face of increasing climate and disaster risk, it is important to analyze
whether those development goals can still be achieved in the face of increasing climate and
disaster risk. In addition, it would be beneficial for CDD programs to address both (general)
vulnerability and (climate and disaster) impacts. CDD activities could be included in high-risk
areas that address specific impacts of climate change and natural hazards and that encourage
households and communities to change risk behavior.

IV. H
    Support Resilience
    More Effectively?

It is important to note the limitations of this portfolio review in assessing the experience of
CDD projects related to building resilience to disaster and climate risk. The review was limited
to available data, which included the CDD project database for fiscal 2001–11, and the respec-
tive project documents. For completed projects, Implementation Completion Reports were
included, and broader evaluation reports of CDD programs were also reviewed. This initiative
has also built on the experience shared among project teams working on CDD projects related
to disaster and climate resilience.

Moving forward, it would be beneficial to undertake some specific impact evaluations on the
impact of CDD programs on building resilience at the community level. Based on the review,
however, there are clearly a number of CDD projects and programs that are moving toward a
more proactive, strategic, and holistic approach to building resilience to disasters and climate
change. There are several lessons that emerge and some important challenges to flag if CDD
programs are to reach their full potential as effective platforms for resilience building. The fol-
lowing recommendations are suggested to strengthen CDD’s contribution to resilience building.


Information is Key and Must Blend Climate Science
with Local Knowledge
There is a need to bring the climate science into the planning discussions for CDD projects
in order to avoid maladaptation. Maladaptation refers to actions or investments that do not
take potential climate change impacts into account and may inadvertently increase exposure or
vulnerability to climate risk rather than decrease it. Such investments may provide a short-term
benefit, but in the longer-term could end up doing more harm than good. Examples include agri-
cultural investments that decrease livelihood and food security if the climate becomes unsuit-
able for particular crops, promoting human settlements in an area that will become highly risky
due to climate change, or infrastructure that overlooks climate impacts and ends up having a
shorter life span than expected (OECD 2012).

In many country programs, the impetus for taking action on climate change adaptation is
usually current climate shocks. And for the most part, project documents reviewed for this
paper indicate that CDD projects addressing disaster risk are doing so based on current levels
of climate variability. Taking a more proactive approach to reducing risk before disaster hits is
certainly a positive and worthwhile investment. The Red Cross/Red Crescent Climate Centre

 Box 5. Zambia Strengthening Climate Resilience Project

 The Phase II PPCR project in Zambia, approved in May 2013, provides subgrants to support participatory adaptation at the community,
 ward, and district level. On the planning side, the project engages established nongovernmental organization partners to work with
 targeted community/farmers groups to identify local adaptation priorities and develop climate-resilient plans. In this process, the non-
 governmental organizations will work closely with traditional leaders as well as district-level technical staff to assess community exposure
 and vulnerability to both climate-related disasters and long-term climate trends. The priority activities will consider both short-term and
 long-term measures (i.e., responses to current climate variability as well as how projected changes in climate are likely to interact with
 future population and asset exposure (taking into account demographic changes, location of physical infrastructure, and changes in liveli-
 hoods). The planning process takes into account the different vulnerabilities experienced by people distinguished by income level, gender,
 age, and ethnic group. The facilitators aim to establish “adaptive processes,” whereby community groups could assess their vulnerability at
 regular intervals and integrate lessons learned into the investments supported by the subgrants.


                             (2012) has put forth a list of minimum standards for making local investments in disaster risk
                             management “climate smart.” The minimum standards serve as a practical tool to help communi-
                             ties and local governments integrate changing climate risks into their efforts to reduce risk to
                             extreme events and disasters.

                             For other sectors, practitioners could start with some basic information on future climate
                             scenarios to see how the planned investment will be affected.7 Beyond this, engaging the cli-
                             mate science community in the planning discussions could go further to help avoid maladaptive
                             investments and build awareness on climate change at the local level.

                             Since climate science is limited at the local level, community members must be recognized
                             as equal partners with expertise and experience in building resilience rather than merely as
                             project beneficiaries. Poor communities are dealing with localized, recurrent “everyday” disas-
                             ters that are the result of persisting poverty, environmental degradation, social marginalization,
                             and other factors unrelated to natural hazards or climate change. The strategies that communi-
                             ties use to manage risk are often poorly understood or ignored by governments and develop-
                             ment partners. The design of future CDD programs should develop a better understanding of
                             the “autonomous adaptation” and social innovations that are taking place at the local level on
                             a daily basis so that they can be effectively supported. Tools such as participatory scenario
                             development (World Bank 2011a) can help. It will also be important to provide CDD practitioners
                             and community facilitators with some training on climate change and disaster risk management
                             issues. The PPCR Phase II supported project in Zambia provides a good example.


                             Find the Entry Points
                             In the absence of recurrent extreme events, it may be challenging to identify the key entry
                             points to engage communities in more proactive disaster and climate risk management. As
                             noted above, managing current extreme events is a common and useful entry point to focus
                             communities and local and national governments on the need to manage risk with a more

proactive, ex ante approach. In other cases, the very long time horizons involved in climate
change discussions may seem less relevant to stakeholders, particularly to poor communities
that are likely managing a variety of more pressing, nonclimate-related risks on a day-to-day
basis. However, there are often activities that can deliver important co-benefits in terms of
building resilience to disasters and climate change together with other developmental gains. For
example, public works programs, such as those supported through Ethiopia’s Productive Safety
Net Program, support the dual goals of ensuring livelihoods and food security as well as climate
risk management by providing participants with cash for work focused on activities such as land
terracing, reforestation, and the like. Another example is the Management of Slope Stability in
Communities program in the Caribbean, which, as described earlier, designed a drainage system
for improved surface water management that captured rainfall (roof water and grey water) for
household use, and at the same time reduced landslide risk by diverting the rainwater.

Keeping it simple helps. While many communities are already feeling the impacts of climate
change, they may not understand the climate drivers of the changes they are experiencing.
They may have a general sense that weather patterns are changing without understanding why
or what more is to come. Climate change information can be confusing, and people can be
put off by the science and jargon. The Red Cross/Red Crescent Climate Centre (2007) offers
useful advice on how community facilitators can become comfortable talking about climate
change and how to relate weather events being experienced by communities to climate change.
Overall, the guidance recommends keeping language simple to ensure that planning for climate
change remains rooted in local priorities and understanding. This may not involve discussing
climate change at all, but instead asking questions about observed changes in the weather to
raise awareness and to get people thinking about building resilience.

Other tools, such as spatial planning, may also help communities visualize risk that may be
more difficult to grasp in the short term. For example, by comparing the coast line of 50 years
ago with today’s, communities are able to see how coastal erosion progresses. Or, by simulating
the impacts of climate change, communities can make more informed decisions on whether to
protect a settlement or relocate. In Samoa, for example, an overlay of maps showing how the
coastline had changed due to erosion led the chiefs to ban sand mining, a difficult decision that
may not have been otherwise taken.


Maintain Flexibility in CDD Programs Dealing with
Climate and Disaster Risk
Climate change means making decisions under conditions of uncertainty, which will require
flexible, “learning-by-doing” approaches. Rather than designing an investment for a specific
climate scenario or level of exposure, investments will need to be designed to allow for the
unknowns about climate impacts. CDD programs have demonstrated their flexibility for post-
disaster response in a number of countries. In Indonesia, efforts were rapidly mobilized follow-
ing the disasters in Aceh (2004 tsunami), Yogyakarta, and Central Java (2006 earthquake) and in
Central Java (2010 Mt. Merapi eruption). On the same day, the government declared it safe for
residents to return to their neighborhoods, trained already-established facilitators in the com-
munities to work with beneficiaries to assess needs, prepare community settlement plans, and
24 • Climate and Disaster Resilience: The Role for Community-Driven Development




                       allocate block grants. The key is to have programs in place before the onset of extreme events,
                       with flexible targeting, financing, and implementation arrangements (Jha, Bloch, and Lamond
                       2011). The same flexibility is needed for activities focused on broader resilience building in order
                       to integrate learning along the way and adjust to changing community vulnerabilities.


                       Promote Cross-Disciplinary and Cross-Ministerial Cooperation
                       Increasing climate and disaster risk require interdisciplinary approaches and cooperation
                       across sectors and ministries. A number of the CDD programs reviewed demonstrated the
                       benefits of promoting collaboration between different government programs and policies, both
                       horizontally and vertically. For example, in India National Rural Livelihood Mission, strategic links
                       were made to the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA).
                       Schemes under this act provide 100 days of wage labor per year to eligible poor households. The
                       public works made under MGNREGA include watershed management and landscape restora-
                       tion, thereby helping to build resilience at the landscape level as well as at the household level
                       through short-term wage employment.

                       Despite their achieving a measure of success in fostering cross-sectoral ways of working,
                       many of the projects reviewed illustrated the challenges of collaboration. Sources of funding
                       and new, dedicated sources of climate finance in particular, may offer opportunities to seek new
                       forms of collaboration, but this also runs the risk of driving a wedge between ministries and
                       agencies who face powerful institutional incentives to try to capture such funds and control
                       the agenda in ways that suit their own purposes. This can happen institutionally as well within
                       the World Bank if a specific sector is managing a CDD program and unintentionally limits the
                       choice of resilience building investment options. The Zambia PPCR and the Ethiopia Produc-
                       tive Safety Net Program both provide additional examples of intersectoral and cross-ministerial
                       collaboration.


                       Provide Incentives for Innovation
                       There is a need to provide incentives for innovation in resilience building. Climate resilience
                       is not about finding a silver bullet. Rather, it is usually a question of introducing simple new
                       practices (e.g., sustainable land management technologies such as terracing, water harvesting,
                       and agroforestry) or combining existing practices in new ways. In addition to technology, there
                       may be other forms of innovation related to institutional forms that allows for the adoption or
                       scaling up of new practices. Access to information on the part of potential users is often a major
                       constraint, as are incentives to adopt innovations. Vulnerable communities need greater access
                       to the right information, such as good seasonal forecasts, early warning systems, and knowledge
                       of innovative practices. Information and communication technology can play an important role
                       in providing users with direct access to better climate information. In a number of African coun-
                       tries, for example, local stakeholders are increasingly relying on SMS or Internet distribution lists
                       that provide hazard warnings.

                       There are a few projects that include specific mechanisms to support innovation. China’s
                       Heilongjiang Dairy Project included a climate change mitigation component that supported
                                                                        IV. How Can CDD Support Resilience More Effectively? • 25




research programs to assess climate change through experimental technology. During implemen-
tation, the component increased the number of research topics funded from 6 to 16 because of
its success in identifying innovative technologies for application by farmers. The Zambia PPCR
project is piloting a way to promote innovation by providing community groups and individuals
with grants for climate adaptation activities that meet certain criteria. Recipients of the grants
will be first identified by local poverty assessment groups and then awarded grants based on
their engagement in visible, transformative, or innovative adaptation practices. Grants are also
earmarked for women-headed households in order to promote women as resilience champions.


Explore Risk Financing Options
CDD resilience projects may tap into a broader range of financing instruments than conven-
tional CDD projects in order to manage risk. CDD serves as an effective delivery mechanism
for recovery support down to community level. As discussed earlier, a number CDD programs
became de facto recovery support programs after being hit with a disaster. With this goal in
mind, CDD project design could plan for contingencies by including a Zero Sum Contingent
Component, which is a nonfunded component that can receive reallocations from other com-
ponents in the event of an emergency. Governments could also link a CDD program with a
CAT-DDO (Development Policy Loan with a Differed Draw Down Option), which would help the
government manage fiscal risk and at the same time provide rapid access to funds that can be
channeled to scale up a CDD program for emergency response and recovery.

For households and community groups, CDD programs can go beyond savings and loans to
explore insurance products for risk management. Over the past decade or so, a number of
programs have piloted index insurance products for poor farmers or herders to protect their
livelihoods from disaster shocks. While these products have produced mixed results in terms
of their impact on household welfare, there are some promising models, which indicates the
potential for insurance to complement other mechanisms like safety nets. Examples include
the Index Based Livestock Insurance Project in Mongolia and insurance products linked to the
Productive Safety Net Program in Ethiopia.8


Strengthen Monitoring and Evaluation for CDD and Resilience
An important gap in current knowledge is how to assess, measure, monitor, and evaluate
climate resilience. Metrics for monitoring and evaluating resilience efforts are lacking. Baselines
and counterfactuals are difficult to establish for resilience, and there is no “finish line” due to
the constantly shifting climate risk. Most indicators in current use are adapted from standard
development indicators or develop lists of resilience characteristic based on the traits of com-
munities that seem to thrive despite shocks. A number of development partners are grappling
with the metrics of resilience, mainly focused on establishing leading indicators that may lead to
resilience. CDD programs could provide an important laboratory for studying the indicators and
impacts of resilience-building efforts.

Tell Us?” (World Bank, forthcoming).
26 • Climate and Disaster Resilience: The Role for Community-Driven Development




 Box 6. Building Resilience to Dzud in Mongolia

 The World Bank-supported rural development program in Mongolia has evolved over the last fifteen years to provide a combination of
 instruments, including investment operations, policy support, and analytical support, geared to address three conceptually distinct risk
 layers, all resting on a foundational CDD platform provided by the Sustainable Livelihoods Program.

 The Sustainable Livelihoods Program, an APL now in its third phase, supports activities to reduce losses in Layer I (up to 6 percent mor-
 tality) through pastoral risk management by local herder communities and local authorities including community-based natural resource
 management, land-use, and contingency reserve planning; financing local public and club goods to improve winter preparedness (hay and
 fodder production and fodder storage); demonstrating new technologies to improve resilience; distance learning for herders on pasture
 management and herd management to improve winter preparation; and testing new institutional arrangements for pastoral risk manage-
 ment. In addition, livelihood diversification into less climate-sensitive income-earning activities has been facilitated through access to
 microfinance; short-term employment has been created through community-managed public investments in small-scale infrastructure;
 and public investments in health, education, and transportation have helped access markets and wider employment opportunities.

 Layer II risks are not easily absorbed by herders. Additional tools required for risk transfer include index-based insurance, which would
 allow herders to transfer some risk to the private insurance market (between 6 percent and 30 percent of losses), backed by international
 reinsurance. The Index-Based Livestock Insurance Project has been successfully piloted since 2005 and is currently being scaled up to
 achieve nationwide coverage. Insurance payouts are not based on actual losses at the level of individual households but on aggregate
 losses at the district level exceeding predetermined risk thresholds. Reaching smaller, more vulnerable herders remains a challenge. This
                                                                                        can be tackled by facilitating marketing through herder
                      losses
                                                                                        groups, keeping premium rates low, and linking insurance

                                                                                        Layer III risks are “noninsurable” as losses are too high.

                                                                                        This layer requires direct targeted interventions support-

                               Layer II: Low frequency, medium losses:                  mortality or higher). A combination of approaches may

                               programs. As Wong (2012) points out, while the number of rigorous impact evaluations of CDD
                               projects has increased, the number is miniscule when considering over 400 active CDD programs
                               and 25 years of implementation. Wong’s review identified only 17 World Bank official impact
                               evaluations that had been completed on CDD programs. She further identified the need to
                               focus strategic impact evaluations on the issue of sustainability of CDD programs, which is highly
                               relevant to resilience building.

It would be very useful to undertake a longitudinal study to assess how a community either
recovered from an extreme event or reduced risk to specific hazards using a CDD approach.
This could go beyond evaluating whether a CDD project allowed faster access to recovery
resources in the face of a disaster to assessing CDD activities against indicators related to the
core properties of resilience, as discussed earlier. Examples include: whether social networks
(modularity) improved community cohesion and provided more effective psychosocial recov-
ery of community members, whether community-level investments provided additional coping
mechanisms (diversity and redundancy), or whether communities employed a learning-by-doing
approach and adjusted their risk management strategies over time (regulatory feedbacks).
V.	Conclusions

Many poor communities in developing countries are already feeling the impacts of climate
change. As discussed, the World Bank’s 4 Degree report has confirmed that these impacts will
worsen and that the poor will be hit the hardest. The poor will bear the brunt of climate change
impacts while having contributed very little to its causes. The impacts of climate change mean
greater challenges in terms of extreme events, health impacts, food security, livelihood security,
migration, water security, cultural identity, and other risks for millions of poor people. There is
a true sense of urgency to identify effective tools to help the poor manage increasing risk and
build resilience to what may come.

CDD projects have already made a significant investments over the past decade in helping
communities deal with disaster and climate risk. They have demonstrated their ability to pro-
vide effective and agile responses to disaster emergencies in addition to having positive impacts
on poverty reduction and service delivery. There are several characteristics of the CDD approach
that lend themselves to supporting resilience building, including the ability to link communities
with local and national authorities; flexible approaches that can be tailored to the local context
and to changing needs; and the ability to serve as a general platform for empowerment, address-
ing the underlying causes of vulnerability in addition to specific interventions for disaster and
climate risk management. Perhaps most critically, CDD programs have the ability to reach large
numbers of poor people directly, which allows governments to work at the scale required in the
context of climate change and increasing disaster risk.

This review suggests that there is great potential for a CDD approach to serve as a powerful
tool for building disaster and climate resilience at the local level. If this potential is to be
realized, there are a number of things that CDD practitioners need to keep in mind, including
integrating climate science into program design; identifying appropriate entry points to engage
communities on the topic; and, promoting flexibility, cross-sectoral solutions, and cooperation
as well as innovation specific to the challenges of increasing disaster and climate risk.

Moving forward, it would be useful to develop more detailed guidance for the CDD practi-
tioner on integrating disaster and climate resilience efforts into CDD programs. This could go
beyond the suggestions and resources listed here and build on previous efforts, such as the CDD
toolkit on integrating DRM into CDD programs,9 which does not address climate change.

Disasters through Social Funds and Community-Driven Development Operations” (World Bank 2009). Also see

                       Finally, there is a need for more evidence of impacts on resilience building from past CDD
                       projects. It would be important to undertake specific impact evaluations on the impact of CDD
                       programs on building resilience at the community level. These efforts could provide some impor-
                       tant learning to strengthen understanding of resilience and how to measure it. More importantly,
                       it could guide governments, development partners, and communities to improve the effective-
                       ness of resilience-building efforts.

Climate Change and General Information

World Bank’s Climate Change Knowledge Portal
http://sdwebx.worldbank.org/
The Climate Change Knowledge Portal Beta is a central hub of information, data, and reports
about climate change around the world. Aimed at development practitioners, users can query,
map, compare, chart, and summarize key climate and climate-related information. The Climate
Change Knowledge Portal contains environmental, disaster risk, and socioeconomic datasets as
well as synthesis products, such as the Climate Adaptation Country Profiles, which are built and
packaged for specific user-focused functions like climate change indices for a particular country.
The portal also provides intelligent links to other resources and tools.

This note is written for World Bank task teams and explains how an understanding of the social
dimensions of climate change can enhance the sustainability and quality of World Bank-sup-
ported operations while mitigating potential risks. The note reviews major challenges involved in
addressing the social dimensions of climate change, outlines how social development approaches
can help to solve these challenges, highlights the main social development analytical and opera-
tional tools in relation to the social dimensions of climate change, and provides operational
examples to highlight strategies that focus on the social dimensions of climate change.


Gender and Climate Change: Three Things You Should Know (World Bank 2011b)
http://www-esd.worldbank.org/sdvpubs/index.cfm?Page=Search&DocID=548&sr=1
Women’s empowerment is critical for climate resilience and much can be done to improve the
effectiveness of climate finance and actions on the ground by ensuring that gender relations
are taken into account in design, implementation, and measurement of results. This policy brief
provides an overview of the gender dimensions of climate change and provides examples of the
role that women play in building climate resilience.

                       Participatory scenario development (PSD) is a process that involves the participation of stake-
                       holders to explore the future in a creative and policy-relevant way. PSD is used to identify the
                       effects of alternative responses to emerging challenges, to determine how different groups
                       of stakeholders view the range of possible policy and management options available to them,
                       and to identify the public policies or investment support needed to facilitate effective future
                       actions. PSD approaches help to identify locally relevant pathways of autonomous and planned
                       adaptation in the context of development choices and decisions while informing actors of
                       potential tradeoffs and possible consequences of adaptation actions. The publication provides
                       the theoretical foundations, describes the workshop design and process, and provides a number
                       of cases where PSD has been applied.

                       appropriate responses. The toolkit introduces the concepts and components of community-
                       based disaster risk management and their key relationship to the achievement of the develop-
                       ment and poverty reduction objectives of the World Bank, including those of social funds and
                       CDD operations within this context. The nine modules of the toolkit correspond to key thematic
                       areas of community-based disaster risk management. Each module can be used separately or in
                       combination with others. The toolkit is particularly useful to determine the most effective ways
                       to manage operational challenges in relation to the rapid mobilization and scaling up of emer-
                       gency response operations, but it needs to be updated to integrate climate change concerns.

Glossary of Key Terms
Adaptation: In human systems, the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and
its effects in order to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. In natural systems,
the process of adjustment to actual climate and its effects; human intervention may facilitate
adjustment to expected climate (Field et al. 2012).

Adaptive capacity: The combination of the strengths, attributes, and resources available to an
individual, community, society, or organization that can be used to prepare for and undertake
actions to reduce adverse impacts, moderate harm, or exploit beneficial opportunities (Field et
al. 2012).

Autonomous adaptation: Adaptation that does not constitute a conscious response to climatic
stimuli but is triggered by ecological changes in natural systems and by market or welfare changes
in human systems (i.e., any system in which human organizations play a major role). Often, but
not always, the term is synonymous with “society” or “social system” (e.g., agricultural system,
political system, economic system, etc.). Also referred to as spontaneous adaptation (Field et al.
2012).

Climate change: A change in the state of the climate that can be identified (e.g., by using statisti-
cal tests) by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties and that persists for an
extended period, typically decades or longer. Climate change may be due to natural internal
processes, external forcings, or persistent anthropogenic changes in the composition of the
atmosphere or in land use (Field et al. 2012).

Climate (change) scenario: A plausible and often simplified representation of the future climate
based on an internally consistent set of climatological relationships and assumptions, typically
constructed for explicit use as input to climate change impact models. A “climate change sce-
nario” is the difference between a climate scenario and the current climate (Field et al. 2012).

Climate proofing: A process that makes projects, strategies, policies, and measures resilient to
climate change, including climate variability, by systematically examining programming docu-
ments and projects to identify ways to minimize climate change risks and optimize adaptation
(i.e., climate risk screening) and integrating these ways into programming and projects (i.e., main-
streaming) (Asian Development Bank 2005).

Climate variability: Variations in the mean state and other statistics (such as standard deviations,
the occurrence of extremes, etc.) of the climate at all spatial and temporal scales beyond that of
individual weather events. Variability may be due to natural internal processes within the climate
system (internal variability) or to variations in natural or anthropogenic external forcing (external
variability). (Field et al. 2012).

42 • Climate and Disaster Resilience: The Role for Community-Driven Development




                       Coping: The use of available skills, resources, and opportunities to address, manage, and over-
                       come adverse conditions with the aim of achieving basic functioning in the short to medium
                       term (Field et al. 2012).

                       Disaster: A serious disruption in the functioning of a community or society involving wide-
                       spread human, material, economic, or environmental losses and impacts, which exceeds the
                       ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources. Disaster impacts
                       may include loss of life, injury, disease, and other negative effects on human physical, mental,
                       and social well being, together with damage to property, destruction of assets, loss of services,
                       social and economic disruption, and environmental degradation (UNISDR 2009).

                       Disaster risk: The likelihood over a specified time period of severe alterations in the normal
                       functioning of a community or a society due to hazardous physical events interacting with vul-
                       nerable social conditions, leading to widespread adverse human, material, economic, or environ-
                       mental effects that require an immediate emergency response to satisfy critical human needs
                       and that may require external support for recovery (Field et al. 2012). UNISDR defines disaster risk
                       as potential disaster losses in lives, health status, livelihoods, assets, and services, which could
                       occur in a particular community or society over some specified future time period (UNISDR
                       2009).

                       Disaster risk management: Processes for designing, implementing, and evaluating strategies,
                       policies, and measures to improve the understanding of disaster risk, foster risk reduction and
                       transfer, and promote continuous improvement in disaster preparedness, response, and recovery
                       practices with the explicit purpose of increasing human security, wellbeing, quality of life, and
                       sustainable development (Field et al. 2012).

                       Exposure: The presence of people, livelihoods; environmental services and resources; infrastruc-
                       ture; or economic, social, or cultural assets in places that could be adversely affected (Field et
                       al. 2012).

                       Hazard: The potential occurrence of a natural or human-induced physical event that may cause
                       loss of life, injury, or other health impacts as well as damage and loss to property, infrastructure,
                       livelihoods, service provision, and environmental resources (Parry et al. 2007; Field et al. 2012).
                       Examples of natural hazards are earthquakes, landslides, droughts, floods, storms, and tsunamis,
                       while unnatural hazards include deaths and damages that result from human acts of omission
                       and commission (World Bank 2010b).

                       Maladaptation: Actions or investments that do not take potential climate change impacts into
                       account and may inadvertently increase exposure or vulnerability to climate risk rather than
                       decrease it (authors).

Resilience: In this report, “the ability to withstand, recover from, and reorganize in response to
crises so that all members of society may develop or maintain the ability to thrive” (Benson et
al. 2012). In the IPCC report (Field et al. 2012), it is defined as the ability of a system and its com-
ponent parts to anticipate, absorb, accommodate, or recover from the effects of a hazardous
event in a timely and efficient manner, including through ensuring the preservation, restoration,
or improvement of its essential basic structures and functions.

Social learning: The process by which agents and organizations continuously frame and reframe
the issues at stake and develop enhanced content and relational capabilities to deal with com-
mon problems, which individuals often cannot resolve on their own (Nilsson and Swartling 2009).

Vulnerability: The degree to which a system is susceptible to or unable to cope with the adverse
effects of climate change, including climate variability. Vulnerability is a function of the charac-
ter, magnitude, and rate of climate variation to which a system is exposed, its sensitivity, and its
adaptive capacity (Parry et al. 2007).
