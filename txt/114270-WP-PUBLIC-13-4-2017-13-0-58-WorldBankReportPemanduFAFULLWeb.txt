About KNOWLEDGE & RESEARCH
The World Bank Group’s current partnership with Malaysia is focused on
knowledge-sharing. It is centered on support for Malaysia’s vision to join the
ranks of high income economies by 2020 through inclusive and sustainable
growth, and to share its lessons with developing countries.

In March 2016, the World Bank Group officially launched its Global Knowledge
and Research Hub in Malaysia. The new Hub is the first of its kind, serving both
as a field presence in Malaysia and as a global knowledge and research hub.
It focuses on sharing Malaysia’s people-centered development expertise and
creating new innovative policy research on local, regional and global issues.

Knowledge & Research reports are flagship work emanating from the teams
based in the Malaysia Hub.

The Malaysia Development Experience Series captures key lessons from
Malaysia relevant for emerging economies in Asia, Africa and elsewhere that
are transitioning out of poverty and into shared prosperity.

Why is there a global interest in Delivery Units?                                                16
  Delivering on policy promises is often derailed by implementation challenges                   17
  Delivery Units at the center of government can enhance public sector performance               18
Why is Malaysia’s experience with PEMANDU worth learning from?                                   20
  Malaysia has recently tackled issues that many developing countries face                       21
  Malaysia was an early adopter of performance-oriented reforms in the public sector             21
  PEMANDU is part of a larger performance ecosystem                                              22
  PEMANDU was created with a specific purpose in mind	                                           24
  PEMANDU-driven NTP demonstrates results                                                        27
How does PEMANDU drive performance?                                                              30

  PEMANDU focuses on granular tasks                                                              34

What can be learned from PEMANDU’s challenges?                                                   42
  A complex performance ecosystem creates a heavy reporting burden and coordination challenges   43
  PEMANDU’s size and private sector corporate culture present tradeoffs                          46
  Focus on KPIs is a mixed bag                                                                   48

Driving Performance from the Center: Malaysia’s Experience with PEMANDU                  7
Foreword
When I began my journey in 2009 with the public sector under
the appointment of the Prime Minister, Malaysia was beset with
four problems. Firstly, there had been concerns that Malaysia
was caught in the middle income trap since the 1990s. Secondly,
our fiscal deficit was reported at 6.6 percent. Thirdly, our
Government debt was rising at 12 percent per annum of GDP.
And fourthly, we needed to move the country into high-income
status by 2020.
I agreed to take on the task to start and lead a
team, which we now all know very affectionately as
PEMANDU, because I was given the assurance by                   “To achieve
the Prime Minister in 2009 that the government is
altogether committed in the pursuit of sustainable
                                                                transformation,
and inclusive socioeconomic transformation.                     leaders have to dance
That commitment proved to be catalytic and is                   on the boundaries
firmly established in the National Transformation
Program (NTP), which kicked off in 2010. According
                                                                of expectations;
to the latest available data from the World Bank,               gradually pushing
Malaysia’s GNI per capita as at 2015 was USD10,570,
just 15 percent short of the current high-income                the bubble from
threshold of USD12,475. In comparison, our GNI
per capita was USD8,280 in 2010. There was a gap

of USD12,276. Additionally, we have catalyzed
a 2.2 times growth in the compound annual
growth rate (CAGR) of private investment. While
the previously recorded CAGR was 5.5 percent in
2006-2010, private investment recorded a CAGR
of 12.1 percent between 2011- 2015.

And we have achieved this without further
compromising our fiscal deficit, which in fact has
improved from 6.6 percent of GDP in 2009 to 3.2
percent in 2015. This data clearly show that we

Executive Summary
Many governments have introduced delivery units (DUs) to tackle pressing
implementation challenges, deliver on key political priorities, and better
respond to citizen needs. Despite adopting good policies, governments often
face implementation challenges in delivering outcomes. The outcomes citizens
expect from governments often have a long results chain: from defining policy
priorities to policy formulation, policy implementation, and service delivery
outcomes for citizens. Governments have recognized that enhancing public sector
performance is key to achieving better citizen outcomes. DUs at the center of
government are one type of such a solution. Under the right circumstances, DUs
can help to strengthen the link between a given policy and citizen outcomes. They
can also work to create strong performance incentives, driving the public sector to
produce high-quality outputs in an efficient and accountable manner.

Malaysia introduced the Performance Management and Delivery Unit
(PEMANDU) in 2009. Since its inception, PEMANDU helped design and then
facilitated the implementation of the National Transformation Program (NTP), a
set of high-level strategic priorities of the government broken down into concrete
interventions. NTP has been implemented by ministries, departments, and
agencies (MDAs), while PEMANDU helped track, monitor, and de-bottleneck the
process. PEMANDU became the largest and one of the most prominent DUs in the
world, with many countries looking to learn from its experience.

Malaysia’s experience with PEMANDU is best understood in the context of the
country’s broader development journey and public sector performance culture.
Malaysia’s public sector development, which pre-dates PEMANDU, has created
an enabling environment that set the stage for PEMANDU. Since the country’s
independence in 1957, Malaysia’s public sector focused on solving development
challenges facing the newly-independent country, including providing services
to eradicate poverty and build up infrastructure to enable the diversified growth
of its economy. The focus has been on results from the very beginning. This
performance orientation created elements of a performance culture. As the public
sector developed, it also gave rise to an institutional ecosystem for performance
management. These elements provided the foundations on which PEMANDU
could build.

Executive Summary




What are the key lessons learned for other countries?
Countries looking to learn from PEMANDU will have to carefully weigh the tradeoff between the
cost and replicating the whole structure in its entirety. Among the DUs around the globe, PEMANDU
is the largest in size. This has cost implications: few developing countries are able to afford a large DU. In
addition, not all countries will be able to get exemptions from the civil-service salary structure that allowed
PEMANDU to recruit talented staff from the private sector. Many contextual factors, such as a relatively-
developed institutional ecosystem and performance culture, also contributed to PEMANDU’s ability to
drive performance. On the other hand, the potential benefits of the PEMANDU model are significant.
While PEMANDU’s critics point to the high costs of setting up and operating this model, PEMANDU and
its supporters consider these costs a reasonable investment, given the benefits to the Malaysian economy
from the NTP. A careful consideration of the country context and a cost-benefit analysis will therefore have
to precede any decision to adopt a similar model.

Because of the tradeoffs inherent in its design features, PEMANDU’s experience is instructive both
for its successes and challenges. Finding the right balance is key. The features that played to PEMANDU’s
strengths point to the following lessons and tradeoffs for countries considering establishing a DU:

»» Secure strong backing and involvement of the top leadership
     PEMANDU’s success depends critically on the Prime Minister’s direct involvement in its routines. PEMANDU
     not only tracks progress in implementation, but is actively involved in clearing up bottlenecks between
     MDAs. These incentives work only with the regular involvement of the Prime Minister through routines,
     such as the PSMs and performance reviews. The tradeoff is the potential politicization of the technical
     implementation process, which in turn requires a strong leader of the DU that can manage these issues.

»» Create a focused and granular results platform linked to an overarching national
   results framework
     It is impossible to discuss PEMANDU without discussing the NTP – a results platform that PEMANDU
     helped create and whose implementation it drove. Just like PEMANDU did with the NTP, successful DUs
     generally focus on a limited number of well-defined and operationalized strategic priorities. At the same
     time, the selectivity of such focused platforms may create questions about the attribution of national
     outcomes to the narrow interventions facilitated by the DU. Building in ways to ascertain such contributions
     ex ante can assuage this concern.

»» Combine top-down control with bottom-up voice
     As is typical of most DU approaches, PEMANDU is embedded within a top-down, command-and-control
     system. Yet through the Labs, the process of operationalizing the government’s strategic priorities
     included the voice from the rank-and-file MDA staff who became the eventual implementers of the NTP.
     This process has also built in some responsiveness to line MDAs’ objectives, issues, and challenges.

»» Create institutional interface between the DU and MDAs
     The DU by itself does not implement the policy prerogatives – the MDAs do. The DU’s role as a driver of
     MDAs’ performance is greatly facilitated if there is an institutional interface with MDAs, such as DMOs
     within MDAs, ministry-level DUs, or specialized M&E divisions. Because MDAs are the implementers of
     government’s top priorities, the real action takes place on their turf, not at the Prime Minister’s office.
     The DU strengthens the link through introducing the routine of reporting and regular problem-solving
     meetings where unresolved issues are progressively escalated.

The challenges that PEMANDU has faced, as well as the limitations of its experience, also offer
valuable lessons for other countries. The following are worth highlighting:


»» Balance private and public sector elements in a DU
   Attracting private sector talent into a DU infuses the public sector with innovations and urgency, but comes
   at a cost of being perceived as outsiders and pay differentials creating resentment in the civil-service.
   Finding the right balance of public- and private-sector staff and approaches mitigates the downside risks.


»» Optimize the amount of reporting by MDAs
   Whenever possible, build KPIs around the existing indicators that MDAs already report on. Work across
   the performance ecosystem to create synergies with existing reporting structures, such as existing
   performance-based budgeting or national development plan reporting. The Ministry of International
   Trade and Industry (MITI) has a single Monitoring and Evaluation Division responsible for all reporting.
   This is a good model to learn from and build on.

»» Strengthen impact evaluations
   Build in impact evaluations (IEs) into the program design. IEs can help resolve questions of attribution and
   cost effectiveness through comparing treatment and control groups. This has implications for program
   design, as IEs must be built into programs from the very start. If the programs are developed through a
   Lab or Lab-like process, then Labs should include IE specialists as technical advisors.

Delivering on policy promises is often derailed by
implementation challenges
Delivering citizen outcomes hinges on the implementation capability of the state. While there is no
question that good policies are necessary for achieving development outcomes, there is also increasing
recognition that they are not sufficient: good policies need to be effectively implemented. Enhancing
implementation capability has received much attention from policy makers, the international development
community, and academic research.2 However, there are no ready-made solutions. Different countries around
the world are now exploring innovative ways in which to enhance the quality of policy implementation.

Outcomes that citizens expect from their governments – reduced crime, better healthcare and
education, or quality infrastructure – are at the end of a long results chain. Many actors and systems
must work in unison in order to deliver these outcomes. Politicians will rely on the public sector institutions
to implement their policy vision for better citizen outcomes. Further downstream, it depends on how service
delivery professionals – doctors, teachers, or the police force – respond to the incentives created by new
policies to deliver better outcomes for citizens. There are many potential weak links in this results chain.
There are numerous principal-agent problems, where those responsible for policy implementation bear
the full cost of change but do not receive its benefits. This results in institutional inertia and status quo
bias. As multiple ministries, departments, and agencies are involved in complex service delivery outcomes,
coordination and oversight challenges also abound.

Enhancing public sector performance is key to achieving better citizen outcomes. The public sector
delivers a wide variety of outputs. Some of them are “downstream” as they affect citizens and firms
directly; for example, public services such as health, education, sanitation, infrastructure management, and
regulations. Others are less tangible but equally critical; they occur further “upstream” in the public sector
delivery process: for example, policy formulation and prioritization; coordination across government bodies;
fiscal and institutional sustainability; revenue and expenditure management; accountability and governance
mechanisms. Figure 2 depicts the public sector results chain that includes both types of outputs. Satisfactory
public sector performance means that the links in the results chain are working well, producing high-quality
outputs in an efficient and accountable manner. In contrast, poor public sector performance can be traced
to weak links within the results chain. For example, poor education quality can be caused downstream (e.g.
school management arrangements that weaken accountability) or upstream (e.g. by financing mechanisms
that allow funds to dissipate before they reach schools). Weak links can be either in formal rules and
procedures, or in their lack of enforcement. Governments around the globe are looking for new ways of
fixing these weak links, be it to improve the quality of service delivery to citizens and firms, or to improve
upstream functions of the public sector.




Delivery Units at the center of government can
enhance public sector performance
Many governments have sought to strengthen the link between the center of government and citizen
outcomes in order to address principal-agent problems, create stronger performance incentives, and
improve oversight. DUs have been introduced around the world as one type of such solutions. In the UK,
the Prime Minister’s Delivery Unit (PMDU) was established in 2001 as the first such unit at the Head of State

others. There are also DUs at the subnational and municipal levels in the US, South Africa, and elsewhere.

  BOX 1



                        What is a Delivery Unit?
       A DU is a discrete unit at the center of government with a mandate to use the authority
       of the chief executive to:

             »» Focus on improving citizen outcomes in a limited number of priority areas;
             »» Unblock obstacles when monitoring shows that progress is off-track; and
             »» Build understanding and capability for strengthening the underlying actors and
                systems/processes.

       The DU approach to public sector performance draws on two broad methodologies: (i)
       the leadership and management practices from both private and public sectors, and (ii) an
       understanding of the network of organizations and their relationships that must work together
       to deliver services to citizens, known as “delivery systems.”

       DUs are created at the center of government and are typically close to the chief executive
       (President or Prime Minister). This signals the leadership’s commitment to results and focus on
       performance.

       International experience shows that DUs work best when they: (i) rely on the existing
       organizational performance framework; (ii) drive a limited number of high-profile goals; and (iii)
       receive high-frequency data to monitor progress.

       Different countries adopted different forms of DUs depending on their existing government
       structures. Although their size varies, DUs usually rely on a relatively small and nimble team of
       highly skilled experts. Their focus is to change the culture in the public sector with the end goal
       to deliver quality services faster.

       Given that they are closely tied to a Chief Executive who drives their establishment and provides
       the authorizing environment, DUs may not last beyond a specific administration or term in office
       – they are often semi-permanent structures.

       DUs must rely heavily on the functioning of existing public management systems within MDAs.
       After all, it is the MDAs who deliver, while the DUs enable the center of government manage
       the process.

The answer to this question has two parts: the first

Malaysia has recently tackled issues that many
developing countries face
A South-South exchange is better suited for learning about the process of public sector reform,
rather than disseminating best practices from OECD countries. Many developing countries look to
diversify their economies and move from a primary-sector-driven growth to value-added manufacturing and
developing a services sector. This requires fostering a dynamic public sector that evolves to meet changing
needs and cuts across institutional and organizational silos to achieve development results. Malaysia faced
the same challenges in the recent past, which makes public sector solutions developed in Malaysia better
suited for peer learning for other countries in the global South. At the same time, Malaysia’s current strategic
priorities focus on attaining upper-income-country status, which make its development experience also
worthwhile for other middle-income countries.




Malaysia was an early adopter of performance-
oriented reforms in the public sector
Since attaining independence in 1957, Malaysia has achieved impressive socio-economic results.
During this time, per-capita income grew from USD 240 in 1962 to USD 10,570 in 2014.3 Poverty was all
but eradicated, falling from 50 percent to under one percent. Overall, the country achieved significant
improvement in virtually every measurable development indicator.4 At the same time, the newly-independent
federal state had to build up its public-sector institutions and their implementation capability that would
deliver public services underpinning these impressive results. Creating a public sector performance culture
became a key part of the solution to Malaysia’s development challenges.

Malaysia has recognized from an early stage that effective frontline service delivery depends critically
on a strong public sector governance backbone. Malaysia has a well-articulated and comprehensive vision
for national development supported by a strong planning function. Development planning in Malaysia
first emerged in the 1950s with the preparation of the first five-year development plan (1956 – 1960). The
Economic Planning Unit (EPU) was established within the Prime Minister’s Department in 1961 to undertake a
development planning role, endowed with authority and convening ability to facilitate inter-agency planning
and cross-government monitoring. Strong planning is linked to budgeting for performance. As early as the
1960s, Malaysia moved to introduce results-based budgeting to support the efficient and effective delivery
of public services. Drawing on this experience, the country has positioned itself as a leader in regional
and global public sector governance initiatives. In the Public Expenditure Management Network in Asia
(PEMNA), Malaysia plays a central role in both Budget and Treasury Communities of Practice.

  BOX 2




        Malaysia’s Performance Ecosystem
       The institutional ecosystem that fosters public sector performance is clustered around
       the center of government in Malaysia. This includes the Ministry of Finance as well as the
       Prime Minister’s Department (PMD). PMD contains over 50 agencies; aside from PEMANDU, the
       key ones for performance management are the Economic Planning Unit (EPU), Implementation
       and Coordination Unit (ICU), Malaysian Modernisation and Management Planning Unit (MAMPU),
       Public Service Department (PSD), and the Chief Secretary’s Office. On the service delivery
       efficiency front, a taskforce (PEMUDAH) was established by the Government to tackle business
       environment and red tape issues together with the private sector.

       There are five key national-level performance frameworks that drive performance
       in Malaysia’s public sector. These include: (i) the five-year national development plans
       developed by the EPU; (ii) the NTP driven by PEMANDU; (iii) the Outcome Based Budgeting
       (OBB) framework by MOF; (iv) the project monitoring system (SPP II) managed by the ICU; and
       (v) the Public Sector Transformation Framework by the PSD.

       There are also national frameworks that focus on service delivery and administrative
       improvements. This includes MAMPU’s framework on the Public Sector Conducive Ecosystem
       and PEMANDU’s Public Service Delivery Transformation (PSDT). Some of these frameworks also
       come with their own set of tools for planning, coordination, implementation, and monitoring
       purposes. PEMUDAH also has its own monitoring mechanisms, including an annual report to
       communicate improvements in service delivery and efforts to reduce red tape. To monitor the
       implementation of capital investments, MDAs are also required to provide updates to the ICU
       for all development projects under the Malaysia five-year plan.

       There are some linkages between the PEMANDU tools and these national performance
       frameworks; however, the strength of these linkages varies. For example, PEMANDU’s
       monitoring and reporting runs independently from the monitoring tools used in the OBB, e.g.
       MyResults. Ministries update the OBB indicators separately from the PEMANDU KPIs. Some
       MDAs, such as MITI and MOE (through its own DU, PADU), have made efforts to streamline their
       performance reporting to meet the requirements of the NTP and OBB. In addition, the PSD has
       established KPIs for senior civil servants that are separate from NTP-related KPIs.

       The existence of a performance ecosystem is a precondition for the success of any DU.
       However, a sophisticated system will inevitably create its own challenges of coordination,
       overlap, and duplication. Managing this tradeoff skillfully then also becomes one of the roles
       that the DU must fulfill, by both integrating into the existing planning and reporting structures,
       as well as actively facilitating inter-agency coordination.

     resemble more public service delivery than industrial policy, while others, such as offering incentives for multinational companies to relocate to Kuala Lumpur, can be
     seen as industrial policy.

PEMANDU-driven NTP demonstrates results
Now in its seventh year of implementation, Malaysia has recorded measurable progress towards
the NTP goals. Figure 4 illustrates the dynamics of selected aggregate indicators in some of the key NKRAs
under the GTP. Since the launch of the GTP, preschool enrollment rates have steadily risen, as has the public
transport ridership. Rural infrastructure has been significantly improved. The crime index has fallen significantly
each year since 2010. However, the selectivity of the GTP interventions and a plethora of concurrent initiatives
implemented through the Malaysia 10th and 11th plan inevitably lead to questions of attribution: what part
of these improvements results from the narrow interventions within the NTP driven by PEMANDU, and what
part is the end result of concerted effort of all ongoing initiatives? In the absence of impact evaluations of the
specific projects under the NTP, it is difficult to answer this question.

The NTP Annual Report provides a more granular look at the NTP performance. It lists all KPIs
across NKEAs, NKRAs, and SRIs, reporting to what extent the targets had been achieved. These annual
results undergo a third-party validation by Pricewaterhouse Coopers (PwC) according to the Agreed Upon
Procedures (AUP). While the AUP enhance the accuracy and transparency of reporting, they focus on the
process rather than the impact. Figure 5 summarizes the results: targets are achieved 90 percent or higher
in all areas with the exception of improving mass public transport. The NTP over-performs the majority
of its own targets in most of the key areas, although these KPIs are susceptible to the common critiques
of aggregate indicators. In addition, the results that are directly linked to the NTP interventions are more
focused on outputs and intermediate outcomes, rather than the impact of the Program. In the absence of
impact evaluations, it is difficult to attribute the outcomes to the NTP, but the NTP proponents argue that
the transformational effect of key programs would be only partially captured by impact evaluations.

On balance, the aggregate data show that the country is moving in the right direction. The debate
about the attribution of these results to the NTP or other interventions may be difficult to resolve, but the
improvements for the citizens are measurable. In some areas, it is easier to document the link between
the NTP interventions and results than in others. Box 4 illustrates such connection between the efforts in
education and urban public transport NKRAs with observed results.

      The current public transport system in GKL/ KV is
      at the brink of a significant capacity boost leading
      up to 2020 with many high-impact projects that are
      underway if not already completed. This will help
      alleviate the choking traffic conditions, subsequently
      reducing loss of productivity due to congestion.

How does

PEMANDU’s ability to drive performance stems from its

PEMANDU fulfills multiple well-defined roles
PEMANDU acts as a convener, coordinator, and technical support to MDAs on performance
management, monitoring and reporting. Although these are distinct roles, they are well-defined and
structured in PEMANDU’s “Eight Steps of Transformation” (Figure 6). PEMANDU acts as a convener at Step
1, when multiple cabinet retreats provided strategic direction and alignment at the highest leadership level.
PEMANDU also convenes and coordinates Labs (Step 2) that break down the strategic priorities into concrete
interventions and create ownership among stakeholders. PEMANDU continues in the same role by holding
Open Days (Step 3) and publishing Roadmaps (Step 4), ensuring that the public is aware of the government
plans and holds it accountable for delivery. In Step 5, PEMANDU switches gears and acts as technical support
to MDAs in setting and monitoring KPI targets. If problems and bottlenecks occur in during implementation
(Step 6), PEMANDU becomes a convener and coordinator again, escalating the process through the Steering
Committee and PSMs (see Box 5 for details). In Steps 7 and 8, PEMANDU is again a technocratic agent
overseeing that the reported KPI targets are validated by the third party and compiled into the Annual Report.
Annex 2 describes the eight steps in more detail.

                          De-Bottlenecking:
                        The Escalation Process
      PEMANDU monitors progress towards the NTP KPI targets on a weekly basis. MDAs submit
      information to PEMANDU every week. PEMANDU reviews the information and updates its
      dashboard. If the weekly monitoring uncovers implementation issues, PEMANDU refers them
      to the Technical Working Group, which consists of the staff from the relevant MDAs that are
      involved in implementing the relevant NKRA/NKEA/SRI.

      Implementation issues that cannot be resolved at the Technical Working Group are elevated
      to the Steering Committee. The Committee is typically chaired by one or two ministers,
      and also comprises secretaries-general, directors-general and CEOs from core ministries
      or agencies. The Committee serves as the principal decision-making forum (as opposed to
      the Technical Working Group that serves as the principal working session) and meets on a
      monthly or quarterly basis.

      The issues that remain unresolved at the Steering Committee level are then elevated to the
      Problem-Solving Meeting (PSM), which is held twice a year, chaired by the Prime Minister. The
      PSM is pivotal in resolving difficult, cross-ministerial issues.

      At mid-year and year-end, the Prime Minister also conducts reviews with the respective
      ministers, with the CEO of PEMANDU in attendance, where issues are highlighted for his
      direction and decision. It also provides an avenue for revision of targets, if and when endorsed
      by the PM.

Some of PEMANDU-managed NKRAs and NKEAs (including public transport, petrochemicals, and
agriculture) involve coordination with sub-national governments. PEMANDU’s approach to goalsetting
through Labs resulted in an open, transparent and inclusive process, which tended to generate buy-in at
multiple levels of government, along with the persuasive power that initiatives emanating from the Prime
Minister’s office tend to enjoy. This is augmented by PEMANDU’s status as an independent, technocratic
institution focused upon performance. At the same time, Malaysia’s federal structure adds implementation
complexity to many NTP initiatives. Box 6 illustrates the types of implementation issues that arise, as well as
PEMANDU’s coordinating role.

PEMANDU focuses on granular tasks
Besides selectivity, one of the defining features of the NTP is its granularity. Not only does the NTP
focus on a manageable number of areas, it also unpacks each priority area into concrete interventions (see
Box 7). The metaphor often used by PEMANDU is a perspective from a descending airplane. At 30,000
feet, only a big picture is visible: for example, the NKEA of the revitalization of Greater Kuala Lumpur and
the Klang Valley, including one of its EPPs that strives to transform Klang River into a vibrant and livable
waterfront. Descending to 10,000 feet, the EPP’s components come into view, including river cleaning,
beautification, and development. Further down at 1,000 feet, activities that are needed to achieve each of
those objectives come into view, as well as the indicators that must be monitored. Yet the NTP descends
further: at 100 feet, it defines parties responsible for each activity, timelines, and stakeholders. At three feet,
weekly progress is tracked and problems troubleshot.

PEMANDU supports the MDAs responsible for the NTP implementation in specific activities to achieve
the NTP’s KPIs. Technically, PEMANDU is not the implementer of the NTP – the MDAs receive the budget
for NTP projects and are ultimately accountable for the NTP results. However, PEMANDU’s incentives are
aligned with the MDAs, as 70 percent of PEMANDU’s teams’ performance is assessed based on the KPI
score of their lead implementing MDA. The specificity of the KPIs ensures the accountability for results both
on the MDA and PEMANDU side.




PEMANDU’s institutional setup allows attracting
talent from the private sector
PEMANDU was established in the Prime Minister’s Department as a “Special Purpose Vehicle” (SPV).
As such, it can recruit its own staff who are not civil servants. This allows flexibility in attracting talent from
the private sector, as PEMANDU’s remuneration structure is outside of the civil-service pay scale developed
by the Public Service Department (PSD). While PEMANDU’s culture is markedly influenced by the private
sector, it does not exclusively cull talent from the private sector. PEMANDU has direct hires with experience
from both public and private sectors, as well as staff seconded from the PSD.

PEMANDU has its own Human Resource Management (HRM) unit that oversees hiring and talent
management. The direct hiring process is competitive; the interviews for qualified candidates focus on a
rigorous case study that tests for problem-solving as well as presentation and speaking skills. The civil-service
secondment plays a dual role: it provides Malaysian civil servants with the exposure to the Big Fast Results
(BFR) methodology and PEMANDU’s private-sector influenced culture, and at the same time strengthens the
relationship between PEMANDU and various government units that the secondees represent. Assignment
of roles is based on competencies and expressed areas of interest.

PEMANDU’s organizational structure mirrors the delineation between the domestic and the overseas
agenda: (i) PEMANDU’s Operations segment focus on supporting the domestic agenda through the NTP;
(ii) PEMANDU’s Corporate Services segment, including the Big Fast Results Institute (BFRI), focus on the
overseas agenda and sharing the BFR methodology. PEMANDU’s operating expenditures are financed
from the national budget, while BFRI’s operations are charged on a cost recovery basis to the requesting
governments. Annex 1 discusses the overseas agenda in more detail.9

PEMANDU’s reporting structure reflects its two types of activities. PEMANDU is led by the CEO, Dato
Sri Idris Jala, who is supported by Directors overseeing the various NKRAs, NKEAs, and SRIs. PEMANDU’s
consulting arm, BFRI, is led by the Managing Director and is supported by an ad hoc team based on requests
from interested governments. Consequently, PEMANDU’s staff consists of two types of officers: PEMANDU
officers whose primary focus is NTP work, and BFRI officers dedicated to overseas assignments. However,
the delineation between these two groups is fluid: PEMANDU officers may choose to be considered for

Aside from the NTP, parallel monitoring systems proliferate, which creates an additional reporting
burden on MDAs. Outside PEMANDU’s remit, the key part of the national performance monitoring system
also includes the Outcome-Based Budgeting effort, which has its own set of requirements for reporting
performance linked to annual and medium-term plans. Aside from reporting on the NTP-related KPIs, the
MDAs also report on the indicators related to the implementation of the Malaysia five-year plan to the
EPU. In addition, MDAs provide updates to the Implementation and Coordination Unit (ICU) in the Prime
Minister’s Department that monitors all public investments projects through the SPP II system.

There are a multitude of institutions involved in performance monitoring. The size of the Prime Minister’s
Department, with over 50 different agencies reporting to it, is quite unique. Only a small number of centers
of government worldwide, including the U.S. and Russia, are that large. With a multiplicity of agencies active
at that level, and what appears to be the lack of well-defined coordination mechanisms between them, it is
not surprising that lines and roles often get conflated. Overlap of functions and blurred accountability for
results inevitably ensue from this system. Box 11 illustrates this issue in the transport sector.

                  Which MDA is in charge?
               The case of the transport sector
       The Ministry of Transport is in charge of planning, formulating and implementing
       policies on maritime transport, rail, ports and civil aviation. The Ministry’s Transformation
       Plan, published in June 2015, also lists the development of a holistic, sustainable and
       integrated National Policy on Transport as one of the agency’s strategic initiatives. On the
       other hand, the Land Public Transport Commission (SPAD), an agency under the Prime
       Minister’s Department, is empowered to plan, regulate and enforce all matters related
       to land public transport. To this effect, SPAD has also developed a National Land Public
       Transport Masterplan. Adding to this mix is the Jiwa Murni project, undertaken through
       the National Blue Ocean Strategy (NBOS) initiative, in which a number of agencies came
       together to build roads in the rural areas of Sarawak. These agencies were the Ministry
       of Finance, the Ministry of Defense (specifically the Malaysian Armed Forces and the
       Royal Armed Engineers Regiment), as well as the Sarawak State Government.

Different sets of KPIs blur performance incentives. Aside from the NTP-related KPIs for ministers, the
PSD also sets KPIs for senior officials (Chief Secretary, Secretaries-General, Directors-General, and State
Secretaries). These KPIs are broader than the NTP-related KPIs and include three components: (i) Shared
& Collective Responsibility; (ii) MDA’s Specific Programs; and (iii) Leadership & Core Personality Values.
PEMANDU is invited to provide input into PSD’s KPIs, which also cascade down to respective ministries
and agencies. It is not clear how the NTP-related KPIs are captured in PSD’s KPIs for senior officials, leading
to questions about how various cascading KPIs interact and potentially create conflicting performance
incentives. Even if they do not conflict, at the very minimum their multitude and complexity is bound to
create confusion and blur performance incentives.

Focus on KPIs is a mixed bag
The actual KPIs themselves may have left a mixed legacy that is typical of broader efforts to rely
heavily upon indicators to improve public sector performance. This includes the focus on certain (typically
politically motivated) priorities to the detriment of other important objectives. Another is the danger that
such targets can be “gamed” or manipulated.

The success of KPI-driven performance depends on whether the right indicator has been chosen. If it
doesn’t measure the desired outcome, then focus to meet the target misses the broader point of the reform.
There are some parts of the NTP, particularly the NKEAs, which easily yield themselves to measurement
and quantification. Others – especially the key parts of the GTP such as the NKRAs of fighting crime and
combatting corruption – are notoriously difficult to measure. Those measures that PEMANDU ends up using
are often critiqued as selective. As Elena Lesley writes:


      “According to the 2012 GTP annual report, street crime dropped 40.8% after the launch of the
      transformation program. […] However, many Malaysians felt the police were not transparent about
      how crime statistics were compiled, and they suspected that certain incidents went underreported.
      Detailed crime statistics obtained by the New York Times from the Malaysian government in 2013
      showed mixed results: Although armed robberies and gang robberies had decreased dramatically
      since 2000, the number of homicides had remained relatively unchanged, and rapes had increased.
      […] People do not feel 40% safer, and that’s why there’s a lot of disbelief in these crime statistics.11”

If the reported KPIs clash with citizens’ own experiences, it can undermine the trust in the entire
transformation effort. Such discrepancies fuel skepticism about the metrics employed and successes
reported, and lead to attributing transformation successes to aggressive communications and public
relations campaign. Box 12 documents most recent efforts by PEMANDU to address the fear of crime among
citizens, including the most recent encouraging results.




Lack of impact evaluations creates questions about
attribution
The evaluations that PEMANDU commissions for various programs under NKRAs and NKEAs are
mostly process evaluations, while the impact evaluation culture is less developed. The evaluations
at the vertical team level do examine rigorously whether the implementation of particular programs is
working as intended. However, this is different from designing a program in a way that would allow to
ascertain how it contributes to desired impacts further down the results chain (see Box 13).

Impact evaluations (IEs) seem to be rare among the NTP programs, but without them it is difficult to
resolve questions of attribution. The correct attribution of results to a particular intervention is especially
important for DUs who by their design only focus on a very limited set of priority initiatives, with many
programs under implementation at the same time. PEMANDU’s and NTP’s critics often scoff at crediting

the NTP for Malaysia’s aggregate achievements, as the NTP represents only a narrow set of priorities while
many initiatives under the Malaysia five-year plan are working toward the same goals. Consequently, this
perception undermines the overall trust in the NTP, ascribing its success to a mere public relations campaign.
In this case, the problem of attribution is not between the MDAs and PEMANDU; it is unequivocal that the
MDAs are the implementer and the DU the driver. Rather, the question is whether the overall impact was a
result of a narrow strategic intervention in the NTP, or of a multitude of other programs ongoing in parallel.

Designing the NTP through Labs may have missed the opportunity to build in IEs into the program
design. Labs may be an excellent problem solving platform, ushering consensus building and bringing various
stakeholders together. However, introducing sophisticated forward-looking technical design features that
enable impact evaluations is not the comparative advantage of the Lab method. However, going forward
and applying the Lab method elsewhere, nothing prevents bringing in impact evaluation specialists to the
Labs to address this shortcoming.

At the same time, NTP interventions are meant to be catalytic and not all encompassing. The impact
of the NTP is by design expected to be more than the sum of the impact of its projects. PEMANDU argues
that shifting the emphasis to IEs for the sake of clear attribution may be missing the point of a transformational
exercise. IEs will only be able to show part of the picture. However, they can help build the overall support for
the DU efforts, maintain the MDA buy-in, and also establish the cost efficiency of the priority interventions.

Learning from PEMANDU’s strengths
Features that played to PEMANDU’s strengths point to the following lessons and tradeoffs for
countries considering establishing a DU: (i) top leadership backing; (ii) prioritization and granularity;
(iii) control and voice; and (iv) MDA interface.


Secure strong backing and involvement of the top leadership
PEMANDU’s success critically hinged on its access to the Prime Minister and his direct involvement
in the routines introduced by the unit. PEMANDU not only tracked progress in implementation, but was
actively involved in clearing up bottlenecks between multiple MDAs. These incentives work only with the
regular involvement of the Prime Minister through routines such as the PSMs and performance reviews.
However, such high-level access and hands-on involvement presents its own tradeoffs, including the potential
politicization of the technical implementation process. Managing this tension is critical for a DU’s success,
which requires strong DU leadership. PEMANDU’s CEO Idris Jala brought in the inspirational leadership,
technical skills, as well as the political and business savvy required to maintain the PM’s confidence and to
carve out the financial and administrative space to build an effective unit.

These lessons are consistent with the conclusions in the existing analyses of DUs worldwide. For
example, Bellver et al (2014)12 argue that “unless the most senior members of the government take an
active interest in results and communicate that the government regards the efficient and effective delivery
of public service outcomes as a political priority, there is little chance that they will focus on outcomes and
there will be no platform for a unit to operate.”



Create a prioritized and granular results platform
It is impossible to discuss PEMANDU without discussing the NTP – the results platform that PEMANDU
helped create and which implementation it drove. Just like PEMANDU did with the NTP, successful DUs
generally focus on a limited number of well-defined and operationalized strategic priorities.13 There are
two important lessons from PEMANDU in this respect. First is on prioritization: the NTP contains only a
manageable number of priorities, while broader and far more numerous national objectives are contained
in the national five-year plans. The second lesson is on operationalization: it is not enough to simply define
the high-level priorities – just as crucially, they have to be translated into granular projects with assigned
implementation responsibilities, timelines, and KPIs.

At the same time, PEMANDU’s experience demonstrates that the selectivity of such focused platforms
may create questions about the attribution of national outcomes to the interventions facilitated by
the DU. It may not always be possible to measure the full impact of transformational programs. However,
building in ways to show some of their contributions, wherever possible, can assuage this concern and help
maintain trust among stakeholders.

Chapter 5: What are the key takeaways for other countries?




Combine top-down control with bottom-up voice
Driving performance from the center of government should not mean ignoring the rank-and-file
implementation staff in the MDAs. As is typical of most DU approaches, PEMANDU is embedded within
a top-down, command-and-control system. Yet through the Labs, the process of operationalizing the
government’s strategic priorities included active participation by the rank-and-file MDA staff who became
the eventual implementers of the NTP. This process has also built in responsiveness to line MDAs’ objectives,
issues, and challenges.

This facet of the PEMANDU experience illustrates the importance of thoughtful change management.
Much has been written about the necessity of creating ownership among a wide set of stakeholders as well
as creating the buy-in among the implementers when managing change.14 Similarly, status quo bias due to
the change resistance of middle-management and rank-and-file cadres is well documented, both in private-
and public-sector organizations coping with change.15 PEMANDU’s experience shows that participatory
approaches such as Labs can ease this constraint and help manage change by building ownership of the
transformation program from the start.



Create institutional interface between the DU and MDAs
DUs do not implement the policy prerogatives by themselves – MDAs do. PEMANDU’s role as a driver
of MDAs’ performance was greatly facilitated because there were specialized units within MDAs with which
PEMANDU interacted. This echoes the existing literature on the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems
that also highlights the benefits of dedicated M&E units within MDAs.16 An interesting takeaway from the
PEMANDU experience is that the institutional interface need not be uniform across MDAs. Some established
DMOs, others created their own specialized DUs, yet others integrated the interface with PEMANDU into
their specialized M&E divisions. Tailoring these units to the implementing agencies’ needs and sectoral
specificities facilitated the implementation.

Because MDAs are the implementers of government’s top priorities, the real action takes place on
their turf, not at the Prime Minister’s Department. This is consistent with the lessons from the UK’s
PMDU.17 At the same time, PEMANDU’s role in interfacing with MDAs extends to creating specific routines,
such as regular reporting and trouble-shooting, as well as progressive escalation of unresolved matters to a
series of regular high-level meetings. This creates strong incentives to resolve issues at the lowest possible
level.

Learning from PEMANDU’s limitations
The challenges that PEMANDU has faced, as well as the limitations of its experience, also offer
valuable lessons for other countries. These include: (i) finding balance between the private vs. public
sector elements; (ii) optimization of reporting; and (iii) introducing impact evaluations.


Balance private- and public-sector elements in a DU
Attracting private-sector talent into a DU infuses the public sector with innovations and urgency, but
comes at a cost of being perceived as outsiders. In addition, pay differentials tend to create resentment
in civil-service. Although PEMANDU has had a limited number of secondees from various public-sector
institutions and hired staff with both private- and public-sector backgrounds, its corporate culture and skills
have been strongly skewed toward the private sector. The existing literature finds that that the types of skills
that a successful DU must attract include quantitative, qualitative, as well as “soft” skills, such as negotiation,
creative problem solving, and collaboration.18 Although their natural reservoir appears to be in private-sector
consulting, such skills can arguably be found in both private and public sectors. Finding the right balance of
public- and private-sector staff and approaches can mitigate the downside risks and reduce costs.



Optimize the amount of reporting by MDAs
By requiring regular reporting on KPIs, a DU establishes important routines and promotes data-
based decision-making; at the same time, it creates a reporting burden. This burden is compounded
especially if the MDAs already report on a number of indicators for existing plans and programs. This
issue is omnipresent throughout public-sector performance management. For example, the literature on
performance-oriented reforms in public financial management19 concludes that information is not an end
in itself, but a means to better performance. In order for this information be used in decision making, the
number of performance indicators must be optimized. Similarly, one of the key lessons for the practice of
performance-based budgeting is to “measure key strategic goals, but not everything.”20 Countries with the
most experience with performance budgeting have steadily reduced the number of programs and indicators
over time, reflecting both the administrative burden of reporting and the limited time senior managers have
to monitor performance.

Whenever possible, a DU should build KPIs around the existing indicators that MDAs already report
on. PEMANDU could further work across Malaysia’s performance ecosystem to create synergies with the
existing reporting structures, such as performance-based budgeting (OBB) or national development plan
reporting. Among the MDAs that PEMANDU worked with on the NTP, MITI’s model of a single M&E Division
responsible for all reporting presents a good example to learn from and to build on. Although analyzing
MITI’s experience in depth is beyond the scope of this report, such exercise could uncover existing synergies
among various results frameworks.

Strengthen impact evaluations
Impact evaluations (IEs) can be used to strengthen the public’s trust in the transformational effect
of DU-driven programs. DUs, by definition and design, focus only on a limited number of well-defined
priorities. Since many other programs are implemented at the same time, the critics of the DU approach
tend to question whether observed successes can be attributed to the narrow interventions that DUs drive.
Aside from addressing the questions of attribution, IEs can enhance cost-effectiveness by establishing which
components of the priority program contribute most to its impact and which are unnecessary. For these
reasons, it is important for a DU to be supported by a strong evaluation function.

Far from an academic exercise, IEs are used around the world to refine the existing programs for
maximum impact. IEs are now widely used in a variety of settings: for example, to improve resource
allocation for family planning programs in Indonesia; to refine program design of malnourishment programs
in Colombia; or to improve the cost effectiveness of strategies to increase school attendance in Kenya.21 A
DU can similarly rely on IEs for evidence-based policy making and improved implementation.

A stronger attention to IEs has implications for program design through Labs. For example, to allow
for treatment and control groups to differentiate impact of a particular DU-driven program, IEs must be built
into the design from the very start. If the programs are developed through a Lab or Lab-like process, then
Labs should include IE specialists who can advise on the appropriate IE method and corresponding program
design.

PEMANDU’s Overseas Experience
PEMANDU’s model has generated significant demand for peer learning from governments around
the globe. In responding to this demand, PEMANDU in 2015 adjusted its structure, creating the Big Fast
Results Institute (BFRI), a new subsidiary company under PEMANDU headed by a Managing Director. BFRI
is PEMANDU’s development consulting arm and focuses on delivery overseas. Its source of revenue are
payments from foreign governments on cost-recovery basis. Box A1 provides details on selected consulting
engagements that PEMANDU has overseas. As these summaries show, overseas partners are interested in
some of the processes that PEMANDU introduced, including the stakeholder engagement through the Labs
and the rigorous monitoring and reporting of KPIs. The demand is growing; the latest engagements include
Oman and other Gulf States. Looking past the NTP’s life span, overseas consulting will become the main
focus of PEMANDU’s work.

                       PEMANDU’s
                  Overseas Engagements
      Tanzania
      Tanzania was the first country that formally invited PEMANDU to share its Big Fast
      Results (BFR) experience. In 2011, President Kikwete visited Malaysia and was introduced
      to the delivery Lab methodology as part of the Langkawi International Dialogue Conference
      in sharing Malaysia’s experience. In 2012, the Tanzanian government expressed interest in
      replicating the methodology in Tanzania. The Tanzanian cabinet invited the PEMANDU to give
      a workshop to the approach, and selected six focus areas that are critical in achieving the
      goals of Tanzania’s Development Plan 2025, Long Term Perspective Plan (LTPP), and annual
      development plans.

      The Tanzanian government launched the Big Results Now! (BRN) program in January
      2013, facilitated by the PEMANDU team. The PEMANDU team supported the Tanzanian
      government in conducting delivery Labs in the six NKRAs; agriculture, education, water, energy,
      resource mobilization, and transport. The PEMANDU team also engaged closely with the
      Tanzanian President’s office, the Cabinet, and line ministries in setting up and institutionalizing
      the National Key Results Areas (NKRAs) delivery system. It included establishing necessary
      institutions such as the President’s Delivery Bureau (PDB), Ministerial Delivery Unit (MDU),
      Transformation and Delivery Council (TDC), Inter-Ministerial Technical Committee, and

       Independent Review Panel. These delivery systems focused on solving problems, and the
       accountability process in communication. To support the operation, PEMANDU entered into
       a 4-year Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) agreement with the Government of Tanzania,
       which allowed the PEMANDU staff to work on the ground and provide advice to the Tanzanian
       government staff on the planning and implementation of delivery system.

       The PEMANDU team worked with the Tanzanian government in a different political and
       institutional context. The Tanzanian government had a priority to coordinate multiple donors’
       initiatives with the national development goals, which was very different from the Malaysia
       BFR context. Tanzania’s DU focused on prioritizing these government key priorities, managing
       the donors’ programs and funds and the government funds to these six NKRAs. Despite the
       political changes in Tanzania, the PEMANDU team remained heavily engaged in the country by
       localizing their approach and provided advisory services to the government.

       PEMANDU conducted an operational review for the Tanzania engagements. The objective of
       the operational review was to assess the effectiveness of the BFR to the Tanzanian government;
       more specifically, to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the BFR model in a different
       context to Malaysia, and to address BFR’s value addition to the Tanzanian government. In
       mid-2015, PEMANDU conducted an on-line survey with relevant heads of agencies and staff
       who were not team members of the BFR Tanzania team visited the country, documenting the
       operations and the feedback received. The review note covered PEMANDU’s lessons learned
       and recommendations, and was the first operational review for the BFR engagement.



       South Africa
       The PEMANDU team worked with South Africa and conducted the Labs in specific
       sectors. The PEMANDU team conducted two sets of Labs: (i) Oceans Economy; Oil + Gas,
       Marine Manufacturing, Aquaculture and Governance and (ii) Healthcare. The Government of
       South Africa initiated the implementation, and the PEMANDU team was invited to the annual
       review. To implement the Lab recommendations, the Department of Planning, Monitoring
       and Evaluation under the Presidency of South Africa has set up a similar delivery system to
       PEMANDU. One of the challenges for the PEMANDU team was to conduct Labs in specific
       sectors without having the overall prioritization of the national agenda. This has allowed the
       team to localize their approach, and focus on supporting the Government of South Africa with
       the Lab methodology.



       South Asia
       Since 2013, PEMANDU has engaged with Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, India,
       and Sri Lanka. Approached by the governments of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka,
       PEMANDU has been exploring the potential of collaborations in various areas, including

      conducting Labs, the adoption of BFR methodology, and the assessment of government
      performance management systems.

      PEMANDU has established a strong engagement with the government of India. PEMANDU
      has engaged with India both with the central government and five state governments. In 2014,
      the PEMANDU team conducted a pilot Lab for the water sector in Mumbai, Maharashtra. In
      2015, the PEMANDU team representing the government of Malaysia and the National Institution
      of Transforming India (NITI) Aayog, representing the government of India, and subsequently
      with the government of Andhra Pradesh, entered into an MoU to formalize the collaboration
      between both parties. The MoU focused on cooperation in performance management, project
      delivery and monitoring related to public programs. Other states included Madhya Pradesh,
      Chhattisgarh, Telangana, and Karnataka. In addition, PEMANDU has been assisting the Central
      Government Prime Minister’s Office and the Cabinet with the development of a national
      transformation program.

      The engagement model in India is different from that of Tanzania, with the focus on
      states’ problem solving through the Labs methodology. PEMANDU conducted two Labs to
      improve the quality of the ‘retail’ and ‘education’ sectors, and expect to conduct ‘governance’,
      ‘urban development’, and ‘agriculture and industries’ sector Labs in the near future. The Andhra
      Pradesh Education Lab, for example, focused on improving the quality of education through the
      pre-school, primary, and secondary levels. This involved 92 participants and 26 organizations.
      It also ran the Retail Lab to support the key economic drivers of the state, and involved 13
      government agencies, two NGOs, and 18 private-sector stakeholders.

Eight Steps of Transformation
The “Eight Steps of Transformation” is PEMANDU’s methodology in driving performance
for the NTP. According to PEMANDU, the discipline of implementing the “Eight Steps” is the
critical success factor in ensuring understanding, buy-in, alignment, and implementation
amongst the MDAs and stakeholders.
