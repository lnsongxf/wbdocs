                                         Overview

                                         MAIN FINDINGS

                                          Where entrepreneurs in Kazakhstan establish their
                                            business matters for the regulatory hurdles they
                                            face. Regulatory efficiency varies substantially across
                                            locations in two of the four areas benchmarked—dealing
                                            with construction permits and getting electricity—
                                            because of differences in local interpretations of the law
                                            and in the level of implementation of recent reforms.

                                          Almaty city, which tends to be prompter than other
                                            locations to implement new reforms, has the most
                                            business-friendly regulation. The capital city, Astana,
                                            which is often selected to pilot reforms, brings up the
                                            rear.

                                          Good practices can be found across Kazakhstan in all
                                            four areas of regulation covered. Reform-minded policy
                                            makers can make tangible improvements by replicating
                                            measures already successfully implemented within the
                                            country.

                                          There is still room to streamline business regulation—
                                            and as Kazakhstan seeks to move closer to the
                                            regulatory frontier, it could look beyond its borders to
                                            examples of good practice around the world.

      BOX 1.1 Kazakhstan a top reformer four times in 10 years, according to Doing Business
      Kazakhstani authorities have taken important steps toward making it easier to do business—implementing 36 reforms acknowl-
      edged by Doing Business since 2006. Indeed, Kazakhstan was recognized by the annual Doing Business report as one of the top
      10 reformers four times during that period—a unique achievement. In the period from June 2015 to June 2016 alone, Kazakhstan
      made improvements in 8 of the 11 regulatory areas covered. No other country reformed in more areas benchmarked by Doing
      Business during that period.

      The main area of focus has been business registration, with six reforms recorded by Doing Business (see figure). As a result, start-
      ing a business has become much simpler since 2003, when the process was so complex that 80% of applications were rejected
      because of errors in the documents submitted.a Over the intervening years Kazakhstan simplified the application package for
      registration and eliminated the requirement to separately register the business at the local tax office. It also exempted local small
      and medium-size enterprises from paying registration fees, eliminated the legal requirement for a company seal and reduced
      the time required for electronic registration on the e-government (egov) web portal from one day to one hour. Kazakhstan also
      abolished the notarization requirement for the memorandum of association, company charter and founders’ signatures.b

      The most recent improvements have been achieved under the Kazakhstan 2050 Strategy (announced in December 2012),
      which sets a series of seven economic, social and political objectives, including “comprehensive support of entrepreneurship.”
      With the goal of becoming one of the 30 most developed economies by 2050, Kazakhstan aims to transform itself into a diver-
      sified, knowledge-based economy driven by the private sector. In May 2015 President Nursultan Nazarbayev announced “100
      concrete steps” to overcome the effects of the global crisis and implement the Kazakhstan 2050 Strategy. Of these 100 steps,
      49 are aimed at fostering economic growth and diversification, including through the creation of a favorable investment climate.
      In the area of construction permitting, for example, the goal is to introduce a three-stage process: issuance of an architectural
      planning assignment within 30 days; concurrence with the project design within 20 days; and issuance of the construction
      permit within 10 days.

     Note: Rankings for the four areas measured are based on the distance to frontier (DTF) score, which shows how far a location is from the best performance achieved by any
     economy on each Doing Business indicator. The aggregate ranking is based on the aggregate distance to frontier score for the four areas. The distance to frontier score is
     normalized to range from 0 to 100, with 100 representing the frontier of best practices (the higher the score, the better). For more information, see the chapter “About Doing
     Business and Doing Business in Kazakhstan 2017” and the data notes.

 Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far a location is from the best performance achieved by any economy on each Doing Business indicator. The distance to frontier
 score is normalized to range from 0 to 100, with 100 representing the frontier of best practices (the higher the score, the better). For more information, see the chapter “About

Getting electricity

                                        In Aktobe, Almaty city, Karagandy, Kostanay and South Kazakhstan (Shymkent) the authorization for ground works is issued in
                                        four days or less. Among these locations, Almaty city has the easiest process because it can be completed online. In the other
                                        locations entrepreneurs must visit the relevant public authority in person to apply for and receive the clearance.
                                        Compared with distribution utilities elsewhere in Kazakhstan, the utility in Aktobe is more efficient in issuing the technical

                                        documents. Its greater efficiency can be attributed to better internal coordination.
                                        In Aktobe and Pavlodar there is better coordination between distribution utilities and electricity suppliers. The final step in
                                        getting an electricity connection—the issuing and signing of the supply contract and energizing of the connection—takes
                                        less time in these two locations than in the others.

NOTES

1.	   Data from the World Bank Enterprise
      Surveys and Doing Business complement
      each other as two sides of the same coin.
      They both provide useful information on the
      business environment of an economy, but
      in significantly different ways. The scope of
      Doing Business is narrower than the Enterprise
      Surveys. However, by focusing on actionable
      indicators related to business regulation,
      Doing Business provides a clear roadmap
      for governments to improve. Doing Business
      uses standardized case scenarios while
      the Enterprise Surveys use representative
      samples. For more on the Enterprise Surveys
      and the differences between the Enterprise
      Surveys and Doing Business, see the website at
      http://www.enterprisesurveys.org.

      Business website at http:/  /www.doingbusiness

3.	   For getting credit, indicators are weighted
      proportionally, according to their contribution
      to the total score, with a weight of 60%
      assigned to the strength of legal rights index
      and 40% to the depth of credit information
      index. In this way each point included in these
      indexes has the same value independent of
      the component it belongs to. Indicators for all
      other topics are assigned equal weights.

      Indicators: Why Aggregate, and How to Do
      It” (World Bank, Washington, DC, 2005).
      Principal components and unobserved
      components methods yield a ranking nearly
      identical to that from the simple average
      method because both these methods assign
      roughly equal weights to the topics, since the
      pairwise correlations among indicators do
      not differ much. An alternative to the simple
      average method is to give different weights to
      the topics, depending on which are considered
      of more or less importance in the context of a
      specific economy.

                                            income per capita on average.

                                          Kazakhstan’s start-up process compares well both

   What does starting a business measure?
   Doing Business measures the number of procedures as well as the time, cost and paid-in minimum capital required for a small
   to medium-size limited liability company to start up and formally operate (see figure). To make the data comparable across
   locations, Doing Business uses a standardized limited liability company that is 100% domestically owned, has start-up capital
   equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and employs between 10 and
   50 people within the first month of operations.

       BOX 3.1 Recent regulatory reforms making it easier to start a business in Kazakhstan
       An attorney interviewed in Astana in June 2016 confessed that he had lost business recently. In 2015 he was registering a new com-
       pany every day. A year later he was registering only one a week, despite offering an all-inclusive package with state registration, a
       company seal and the certificate of registration with the statistical agency for only KZT 20,000 (US$60). The reason? Business start-
       up has been streamlined to the point where local entrepreneurs no longer need help with the process. The lawyer is now targeting his
       services almost entirely to foreign investors.

       Indeed, starting a business has become much simpler than it was in 2003, when it took 11 procedures, 32 days and 12.9% of income
       per capita (see figure). The process was so complex that 80% of applications were rejected because of errors in the documents
       submitted.a

       The improvements started in 2009, through a reform simplifying the application package for registration and eliminating the require-
       ment to separately register the business at the local tax office. The minimum capital requirement for small and medium-size enter-
       prises was reduced to KZT 100 (US$0.50) in 2010, then canceled altogether in 2014.b

       On January 1, 2015, the process was further streamlined. Local small and medium-size enterprises are now exempt from paying reg-
       istration fees, the legal requirement for a company seal was eliminated, and the time required for electronic registration on the egov
       web portal dropped from one day to one hour. In addition, the notarization requirement for the memorandum of association, company
       charter and founders’ signatures was abolished.c

       To support the reform efforts, central and regional governments have carried out a vast media campaign. In the South
       Kazakhstan region, for example, the Department of Justice organized nearly 150 workshops and 100 roundtable events between
       the beginning of 2015 and June 2016 to familiarize entrepreneurs with the relevant business regulations. In addition, the city and
       district departments of the Department of Justice used media outlets to reach out to the broader population—giving 13 radio and 21
       television interviews and publishing 78 articles in newspapers. The outreach campaign involved the Government for Citizens state
       corporation and the local chamber of entrepreneurs.d

   BOX 4.1  A simplified process for the expert examination of building projects in Kazakhstan
   Since January 1, 2016, the expert examination of building projects has been done through an online platform (epsd.kz)—a
   single window combining the sanitary, fire and environmental clearances into one comprehensive clearance.a This reform
   saved entrepreneurs 20 days (see figure). The government delegated this service to accredited private firms for technically
   noncomplex buildings and has indicated its commitment to fully privatizing the industry in the medium term, which will
   potentially channel some US$70 million worth of contracts annually to the private sector.b The reform has already created a
   vibrant market for project consulting services, and the resulting competition reduced the cost of the expert examination by
   more than 20%.c Kazakhstan also transferred the responsibility for construction supervision to accredited private experts,
   addressing concerns about burdensome government intervention in the construction process.d


                        The reform of the expert examination reduced the time for the process by 20 days and the cost by almost a quarter

                                         Getting Electricity

                                         MAIN FINDINGS

                                          In 2015 Kazakhstan adopted a series of legislative
                                            amendments aimed at making it faster and easier to get
                                            a new electricity connection. A more recent regulatory
                                            reform, now being implemented, is designed to improve
                                            the reliability of electricity supply.

                                          Getting electricity involves seven to nine procedures,
                                            which take 77.4 days and cost 62.6% of income per
                                            capita on average. Aktobe has the most efficient
                                            process, and Astana the most complex one. Almaty
                                            city receives the highest score on the reliability of
                                            supply and transparency of tariffs index, thanks to
                                            early adoption of an automated system for monitoring
                                            outages and restoring service.

                                          Going forward, Kazakhstan will need to ensure that all
                                            recent legislative amendments are fully implemented
                                            across the country and clearly communicated to
                                            customers. And it could further simplify and speed up
                                            the connection process for entrepreneurs by improving
                                            coordination between the different actors involved and
                                            streamlining approvals and inspections.

        BOX 5.1 Recent regulatory changes are making it easier to get a new electricity connection in Kazakhstan
        In early 2015 Kazakhstan adopted a series of legislative amendments aimed at making it easier to establish new electricity
        connections. Two of them simplify the process by reducing the number of requirements; the other three make the process
        faster by tightening time limits for certain actions by distribution utilities and suppliers (see table). While these regulatory
        changes apply throughout the country, the level of implementation varies across locations. The elimination of the need for an
        inspection of the completed works by the Authority for State Energy Supervision and Control is an exception, as this change
        has been systematically and consistently implemented across the country.

Note: Rankings are based on the average distance to frontier score for the procedures, time and cost associated with getting electricity as well as for the reliability of supply and
transparency of tariffs index. The distance to frontier score is normalized to range from 0 to 100, with 100 representing the frontier of best practices (the higher the score, the better).
For more details, see the chapter “About Doing Business and Doing Business in Kazakhstan 2017.” Astana, Karagandy and South Kazakhstan (Shymkent) are not eligible to receive a
score on the reliability of supply and transparency of tariffs index because they were not collecting data on power outages in 2015. See box 5.2 for more information.

       BOX 5.2 Measuring the reliability of supply and transparency of tariffs—going beyond efficiency
       The reliability of supply and transparency of tariffs index measures the quality of service provided by utilities and suppliers as
       it relates to stability in distribution and clarity of information provided on consumption costs. The scoring is based on six main
       components, for a total of 8 possible points. The first five components relate to power outages: reliability of supply (3 points),
       mechanisms for monitoring outages (1 point), mechanisms for restoring service (1 point), regulatory monitoring (1 point) and
       financial deterrents aimed at limiting outages (1 point). The sixth relates to the transparency of electricity tariffs (1 point).

       All eight locations receive the same score on two components: those on regulatory monitoring (1 point) and the transpar-
       ency of tariffs (1 point). Scores on the overall index vary considerably, however (see table). Almaty city has the highest score,
       and Astana, Karagandy and South Kazakhstan (Shymkent) the lowest. But the difference lies much less in how reliable the
       electricity supply is than in how that reliability is measured. Data linked to the duration and frequency of power outages—as
       measured by the system average interruption duration index (SAIDI) and the system average interruption frequency index
       (SAIFI) or their equivalent—are from 2015. At that time Astana, Karagandy and South Kazakhstan (Shymkent) were not
       computing these data and therefore receive a score of 0 on the overall index, despite earning points for meeting certain other
       criteria.a The picture is changing rapidly, however, as a result of new requirements that all distribution utilities keep the dura-
       tion and frequency of outages below certain thresholds.



        In locations measuring outages in 2015, SAIFI data indicate that customers experienced less than two a year on average

   BOX 5.2 Measuring the reliability of supply and transparency of tariffs—going beyond efficiency (continued)
   As part of a regulatory reform now being implemented to improve the quality of electricity service, Kazakhstan adopted legis-
   lative amendments in April 2016 that require distribution utilities to comply with normative values for power supply reliability
   indicators (such as SAIDI and SAIFI) set by the Ministry of Energy.b Fines are imposed on utilities if the number or duration
   of outages exceeds these values. As a consequence, distribution utilities across the country have put in place monitoring sys-
   tems or are developing them. Ontustik Zharyk Transit, which operates in South Kazakhstan (Shymkent), started monitoring
   power outages in January 2016. Astana-REK recently introduced an automated tool to monitor outages and restore service
   and started to collect data on power outages in September 2016. In parallel, some utilities that were already monitoring out-

   a. Doing Business uses SAIDI and SAIFI to measure the duration and frequency of power outages. SAIDI is the average total duration of outages over the course of a
   year per customer served, while SAIFI is the average number of service interruptions experienced by a customer in a year. An economy is eligible to obtain a score on the
   reliability of supply and transparency of tariffs index if the utility collects SAIDI and SAIFI data and if the SAIDI value is below a threshold of 100 hours and the SAIFI value
   below a threshold of 100 outages. An economy receives a score of 0 on the overall index if it does not compute SAIDI and SAIFI, even if the economy scores points on any
   other component.

                                         MAIN FINDINGS

                                          Over the past decade Kazakhstan has used information
                                            and communication technology to improve government
                                            services and simplify and increase the efficiency of
                                            property registration.

                                          In all eight locations covered by this study, registering
                                            property involves three procedures—which take 3.8
                                            days on average and cost 0.1% of the property value.
                                            This ranks Kazakhstan among the economies with the
                                            most efficient property registration globally. Scores on

                                            potential improvement, however.

                                          Going forward, Kazakhstan will need to focus its efforts
                                            on improving the quality of its land administration
                                            system. As the country with the ninth largest land
                                            mass, its greatest challenge is expanding the system’s
                                            geographic coverage. Other improvements are feasible

   What does registering property measure?
   Doing Business records the full sequence of procedures necessary for a business (the buyer) to purchase a property from another
   business (the seller) and to transfer the property title to the buyer’s name so that the buyer can use the property for expand-
   ing its business, use the property as collateral in taking new loans or, if necessary, sell the property to another business. It also
   measures the time and cost to complete each of these procedures. In addition, Doing Business measures the quality of the land
   administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has five dimensions: reliability of infrastruc-
   ture, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution and equal access to property rights (see figure).

BOX 6.1 A Government for Citizens center is the preferred option for property registration, but electronic
registration is catching up
The Government for Citizens centers offer more than 500 government services, including property registration. The centers can
complete many transactions on-site and also serve as front offices for services provided by other agencies.a For property regis-
tration, for example, the local center receives the registration application, but the Department of Justice carries out the actual
registration.b A courier is dispatched by the Department of Justice twice a day to collect documents from the Government for
Citizens center and return them after processing.

The Government for Citizens center has a time limit of three days to return the hard copy of the registered documents to the
parties. Together, the steps involved in this paper-based registration process take a minimum of one week.

The Government for Citizens centers also offer expedited registrations. The time limit for expedited processing is one day—the
same as for applications initiated through a notary. In locations where the time limits are met, transferring a property—whether
through a notary or through the expedited process at a Government for Citizens center—takes 3.5 days. The state registration
fee for an expedited registration is three times the standard fee, or slightly more than the cost of registration through a notary.c

Data from each Department of Justice on the aggregate number of property registrations show that the majority are done
at Government for Citizens centers (see figure). But the share of notary-initiated electronic registrations is growing. Between
2015 and 2016 this share increased in six of the eight locations—Almaty city, Astana, East Kazakhstan (Oskemen), Karagandy,
Kostanay and South Kazakhstan (Shymkent). In Astana the share of notary-initiated electronic registrations increased by nearly
18 percentage points—twice as much as in Karagandy, with the second biggest increase—while the absolute number of these
registrations grew by more than 50% (from 34,899 to 53,984).


In 2016 the majority of property registrations in Kazakhstan were initiated at a Government for Citizens center…

        Economy characteristics
        Gross national income per capita
        Doing Business in Kazakhstan 2017 reports 2015 income per capita as published in the World Bank’s World Development Indicators
        2016. Income is calculated using the Atlas method (in current U.S. dollars). For cost indicators expressed as a percentage of
        income per capita, 2015 gross national income (GNI) per capita in current U.S. dollars is used as the denominator. Kazakhstan’s
        income per capita for 2015 is US$11,580 (KZT 2,183,859).

        Region and income group
        Doing Business uses the World Bank regional and income group classifications, available at http://data.worldbank.org/about
        /country-and-lending-groups. Regional averages presented in figures and tables in the Doing Business in Kazakhstan 2017 report
        include economies from all income groups (low, lower middle, upper middle and high income), though high-income OECD
        economies are assigned the “regional” classification OECD high income.

        Exchange rate
        The exchange rate used in the Doing Business in Kazakhstan 2017 report is US$1 = 188.6 Tenge (KZT).
