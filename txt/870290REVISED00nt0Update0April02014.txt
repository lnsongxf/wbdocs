                                              Summary

After a policy-engineered slowdown in 2012, which saw GDP growth decline to 4.8 percent, the lowest
since 2008, Bhutan's economy is expected to rebound to 6.5 percent this year, supported by hydropower
construction and higher electricity and food production, following favorable rains.


The tight fiscal stance introduced in 2012 has been maintained to bring spending in line with lower non-
hydro revenues and a slowdown in foreign grant disbursements, but the revenue situation is expected to
improve with the commissioning of cement and electricity projects. This may provide space for an
increase in public sector compensation to offset recent declines that have occurred in the face of an
average 8 percent annual increase in the CPI over the past five years.


Bhutan's external debt, at 85 percent of GDP, remains high, but is likely to fall sharply as assured
hydropower revenues begin to flow from projects for which the external loans were taken. However, its
narrow exports base and the large rupee-reserves mismatch make the country vulnerable to shortfalls in
external earnings and pose a moderate risk. Although gross international reserves rose to US$920.8
million at end-November 2013, only 12 percent was in the Indian Rupee, which is needed for trade
settlement and debt service.


Liquidity in the banking system has eased and measures have been taken to improve the monetary
transmission mechanism, which should improve the monitoring of liquidity conditions. This is important
as negative real loan rates persist, accounting partly for the 30 percent annual increase in nominal credit
over the past decade.


Bhutan's success in reducing absolute poverty is noteworthy, with the poverty rate falling from 23 percent
in 2007 to 12-13 percent in 2012, improving the lot of the poorest segments of the population rather than
merely that of those clustered around the poverty line. A rapid growth of commercial agriculture,
expanding rural infrastructure, and beneficial effects from the construction of massive hydropower
projects has established a sound platform for further poverty reduction. However, continued out-
migration to urban areas and vulnerability of infra-marginal groups, the relative absence of formal social
protection institutions, youth unemployment, and the persistence of malnutrition, anemia and stunting
point to the need for continued effort at tackling non-income poverty. Further, a better framework for
managing Bhutan's cultural assets could improve employment opportunities, especially in rural areas,
among poorer segments of the population.


The macroeconomic projections for 2014 set GDP growth at 7.3 percent, stemming from new projects,
increased tourism receipts, easier credit conditions and the effects of the Economic Stimulus Plan.

                                                    The export price of Chhukha power has been revised
                                                    by 25 paisa per unit in February 2014, retroactively
                                                    to 2013. The new export rate is now fixed at Rs 2.25
                                                    per unit from the existing Rs 2 per unit. The increase
                                                    means that the 336MW Chhukha hydropower project
                                                    will earn additional revenue of Rs 450 million

non-pregnant); in the workplace, the need for a
significant augmentation of the public nutrition
knowledge of the available workforce, along
with the need for better job descriptions with

structure for the government departments, a need
for better inter-sectoral coordination driven by a
high level mandate where                 roles and
accountabilities can be defined and monitored,
and a better nutrition monitoring system that can
be used to decide if programs and personnel are
succeeding or not; and in the system
environment of policies and laws that enable
work to be done that will improve nutrition in
the country, there is a need for much greater

                                                       for society. The Bill proposes a major shift in

 Unclear     mandates       and    lack    of
  institutional coordination. In the absence
  of a clear and enforced governance
  framework for cultural preservation in
  Bhutan, a variety of agencies tend to carry
  out similar work in an uncoordinated
  manner, with differing criteria and no
  standardized methods, leading to fragmented
  outcomes. Critical instruments such as
  permits are missing or deficient, and there
  are no effective mechanisms for the
  integration of heritage conservation into
  living communities through service delivery,
  integrated city and regional planning,
  adaptive reuse of traditional buildings, and
  managed growth of communities that
  steward their culture and landscapes.

In order to realize the positive impacts of the
Bill and mitigate the potential adverse
impacts,       the     PSIA      offers     tailored
recommendations and a package of combined
incentives. At the core of the recommendations
is the importance of engaging key stakeholders,
particularly owners, caretakers, local authorities,
and concerned agencies, in all key steps
envisioned for the identification, inventorying,
designation, and stewardship of properties and
areas to be designated under the Bill as heritage
sites. This is essential to ensure the relevance for
concerned communities and households, and
thus the achievement of the Bill’s objectives and
the sustainability of its associated efforts.

Another central recommendation is the value
of an incentive-based Bill, rather than
traditional   command     and       control
mechanisms, in line with its intention to

  Macroeconomic cycles in Bhutan follow closely developments in the hydropower sector, given the magnitude of
these projects compared to the size of the economy. During construction, hydropower, as many industries that
produce intermediate goods has a major effect on GDP through construction, transport and services, directly and
indirectly through money and spending multiplier effects. What makes hydropower unique in Bhutan is the size of
projects relative to the economy. For instance, the four hydro projects under construction represent no less than a
total investment of 200 percent of GDP (2012), spread over 7 years. 30 percent of construction cost may be
attributed to domestic suppliers, the rest being imported.
2
 RMA monthly bulletin, Feb 2014. Bhutan’s hydropower dams are run of the river schemes with no reservoirs, so
better rainfalls is the main factor impacting generation from year to year.
3
  As of March 2014, the Nu 10.88 billion (US$175 million) project was reported to operate at half capacity, so the
overall impact in 2014 remains to be seen. Full capacity would total Nu 6 billion in total sales, and Nu 4 billion in
revenues after debt repayment.

    Indian National do not require visas and are exempt from the minimum daily tariff of USD 250 per person a day
6
  In February, the Prime Minister announced the “Bhutan-Thailand friendship offer” aimed at attracting residents
from Thailand during the leaner months of June, July and August, as an effort towards lean season promotion as
well as the new flight from Mumbai to start in the fall of 2014. As a part of the offer, Thai nationals and others with
proof of residency in Thailand will not pay the mandatory minimum daily tariff of US$200 per day for the lean
season. Instead, they would be levied the daily royalty of US$65, while tour operators would have to compete and
come up with attractive packages. In addition, the national airline will offer 50 percent discounts on airfare, while
hotels will give up to 50 percent discounts on rates.
7
    From 2013/14 onwards the excise tax retroceded from India to Bhutan will cover one year, instead of two.

  The hydropower development policy of Bhutan consists of eleven new hydropower projects, which would
quintuple Bhutan’s power generation capacity. External financing for non -hydropower sector activities continues to
remain predominantly from multilateral and bilateral donors at concessional terms.

   Bulky debt service payments may have contributed to rupee shortage in that past, hence the need for good
cash/reserves management and projections.
11
     The Constitution requires that foreign exchange reserves should be maintained at 12 months of essential imports.
12
   Five commercial banks dominate the financial system, accounting for nearly 90 percent of total loans in June
2013. The Bank of Bhutan and Bhutan National Bank dominate, holding 82 percent and 76 percent of banking
sector credit respectively as of June 2013. Three new commercial banks, namely Druk PNB, T Bank, and Bhutan
Development Bank commenced operations in 2010. The share of the three new banks in deposits has risen
appreciably from 6 percent since their licensing in 2010 to 18 percent in June 2013, while the share in credit has
risen from 17 percent to 24 percent over the same period.
13
   The RMA has since then directed all nonbank financial institutions to suspend all lending activities by June 1,
2014.
14
     Asset classification and provisioning rules were relaxed in March 2012 to address tight liquidity.
15
  Private-sector deposits account for more than 70 percent of total deposits. The remainder consists of deposits of
government corporations and public corporations. As of June 2013, 53 percent of total deposits were corporate.
16
   Survey method Bhutan Labor Survey follows the ILO definition of unemployment where a person is considered
unemployed when he/she is simultaneously: (i) without work; (ii) available for work; or (iii) seeking for work. A
person is considered to be employed if she/he has performed some paid work in cash or in kind at least one hour
during the reference period (a week). Unemployed are those who, during the period mentioned, (i) have no job, (ii)
are able to work at any time, or (iii) are actively looking for jobs (ILO). Anybody who meets the three conditions at
the same time may be called unemployed. Working a minimum of one hour/week excludes the individual from
classification as a job seeker.

   The Bill is being drafted by the Division for Conservation of Heritage Sites (DCHS), Ministry of Home and
Cultural Affairs; the PSIA was conducted by the World Bank in coordination with the DCHS. This note was
prepared by Stefania Abakerli, World Bank, and summarizes the main findings of the PSIA study. For further

  A sampling baseline survey was undertaken of 56 villages, and 4 sample villages were selected (Drugyel, Korphu,
Rinchengang, and Sakteng) across the country. A rapid appraisal of the 27 remaining traditional houses and their
residents was also carried out in Thimphu.
