  Can Uganda’s Land Support its
        Prosperity Drive?
Uganda Economic Update | Sixth Edition, september 2015 |report no. 99060
What is the Uganda Economic Update?

The Uganda Economic Update (UEU) takes stock of the country’s economic developments to provide up-to-
date information and analysis on the recent economic performance, challenges, and opportunities. Drawing on
global experience, the UEU proposes options for consideration by Government in order to facilitate economic
growth, eliminate extreme poverty and promote shared prosperity. The UEU is published by the World Bank on
a six monthly basis. The sixth UEU had a special focus on ‘Land’ and was published in September 2015.




Why is the Update published every six months?

The UEU is aligned to the Government’s budgetary process, which carries a time frame of 12 months. The
schedule of six monthly updates provides room for providing timely inputs into the budget formulation for the
subsequent year, and to assess progress of implementation of policies and make requisite adjustments where
necessary.
Why is an Update important for Uganda?

The UEU provides a regular platform to discuss and reflect on topical issues that are affecting the
economy. In this respect, the UEU brings together policy makers and key stakeholders to debate
and inform the policy formulation process. The UEU is selective, aiming to focus on current issues
that require attention for policy makers to formulate ideas and take action on growth and inclusive
development.
What is the current State of Uganda’s economy?

The Ugandan economy continued to recover from the low growth recorded since financial year 2010/11,
which was the most resent election year. During the year ending June 2015, the economy grew by 5.0 percent,
compared to 4.5 percent of the previous year. However, growth remained below expectation, and was the
slowest amongst regional peers such as Kenya, Tanzania and Rwanda. Prices had remained stable and the
cost of credit had reduced, thereby providing a much needed boost to private investment and consumption.
The Government had planned to continue to pursue a strategy of addressing the country’s deficient physical
infrastructure, but this had not fully materialized because of implementation challenges.



What are the main challenges for Uganda’s economy?

With planned Government infrastructure investments taking off only slowly, and the exports remaining
weak, the main driver of economic activity in the private sector was the increased credit from the banking
sector. At the same time, the country had suffered from shocks affecting the economy in varied ways, both in
the past and in the near future.

First, the prolonged low international oil prices reduced the country’s oil import bill and had a deflationary
effect on domestic prices, but has been an important factor in the decisions on investments related to
production of oil within the country. Relatedly, foreign direct investment, the bulk of which has come into
this sector, declined during FY 2014/15 and will remain subduded in FY 2015/16.

Second, the shilling has reduced value significantly, reaching a level which is 35
percent lower than what it was in the corresponding period of 2014. This depreciation
is consistent with the low net flows of foreign exchange into the country and hence
could promote competitiveness, but it increased pressures on domestic inflation.

Third, the tightening of monetary policy will minimize inflation and hence ensure
stability, but it will increase the cost of borrowing and hence reduce the rate of
investment by the private sector.

Fourth, at the regional level, the political turmoil in neighboring Burundi, and the civil
conflicts in South Sudan and Democratic Republic of Congo, have major implications
to Uganda’s economy, particularly through lower exports of goods and services, lower
tourism receipts, and lower FDI, if investors consider regional risks to be as important
as country specific risk.

Lastly, as the country prepares for its next presidential and parliamentary elections
in February 2016, both uncertainty and speculation have and will continue to impact
economic variables, a phenomenon that is common in many other parts of the world.
What is the economic outlook for Uganda?
During financial year 2015/16, the Ugandan economy will on balance, continue to grow, the effects of the shocks
notwithstanding. However, the forecasted overall rate of growth for the year of 5.4 percent, will be about a half
a percentage point from what had been anticipated when the Government pronounced its budget strategy in
June 2015. The rate of growth is projected to accelerate to at least six percent per annum into the medium term.
This outlook greatly depends on the success of the Government’s huge investment program, which aims to build
energy dams to increase availability and reduce cost of electricity; build roads to ease connectivity; and constract
the refinery to raise the value of the oil before it is exported out of Uganda.


While addressing these constraints would improve the business climate and encourage more private sector
investment, firms will still have to manage their activities in a quite volatile macroeconomic environment in
the near term on account of uncertainties and speculation related to elections, and an unpredictable external
environment that may have adverse effects on the value of the currency and the market for Uganda’s goods on
international markets.


The sixth UEU argues that above all this, the most critical challenge is to identify policies and actions that can
raise productivity and incomes for agriculture and low income non-agriculture firms, where most of the people
are employed currently; or to facilitate people to shift into those areas where productivity is high and incomes
for workers can rise fast. One critical factor for such a transformation to take place is the manner in which land is
managed in Uganda.
What is the state of land tenure security in Uganda?
Land tenure in Uganda has evolved tremendously over the past                Figure 1: Composition of Four Land Tenure Systems in Uganda

that the true owner can sell that piece of land at fair value; and that
there are effective institutions to resolve land disputes effectively if
and when they occur. This determines whether land tenure is secure.

Unfortunately, in Uganda these elements are still weak, which has led
to unclear ownership of land and a high rate of occurrence of disputes
and conflicts. As a result, only a small proportion of land in Uganda is

transformation and development in Uganda.
What is the cost of tenure insecurity and inefficient markets?
Uganda’s rapidly expanding population is placing increasing pressure on land usage. This has significant
implications for the country’s productivity. If properly managed, an increase in population density can actually
support economic growth, but to make that possible, policies to promote optimal use of land must be in place
in both rural and urban areas, to support the transformation of economic activities. The following are some of
the indicators of costly land management:

•	   Slow transformation of agriculture: Land disputes are estimated to reduce the level of agricultural
     growth in Uganda by between 5 and 11 percentage points. Small farms are not able to achieve high levels
     of productivity, while low productivity large farms co-exist with a number of promising commercialization
     and agro-industry businesses failing to expand due to lack of a system that could facilitate efficient and
     fair sell or rental of land, especially in areas with communal land ownership.

•	   Access to finance constrained by limited land registration: Financial institutions in Uganda typically
     require collateral for over 86.5 percent of the loans. The limited existence of easily transferable legal titles
     leaves the bulk of land as ‘dead capital’ that cannot be demobilized for development nor expand the
     deposit base of financial institutions. This leaves the cost of credit high.

•	   Urban areas not supporting economic development: Urban authorities lack access to the land required
     for the necessary public works and social infrastructure. This, together with the lack of enabling site and
     building standards, has resulted in urban centers that are not developing
     efficiently, with these areas often characterized by horizontal expansion     Urban areas becoming
     rather than more profitable high-rise buildings. For this reason, urban          large slums and not
     centers in Uganda still have low economic density, not allowing them

     to generate growth, jobs and decent housing for their increasing
     populations. If current patterns continue, the process of urbanization

     compensation.                                                                 public works and social
•	   High cost of compensation makes infrastructure development costly:                 infrastructure..
     Authorities are struggling to afford high compensation rates involved in
     the acquisition of land due to highly inflated land prices. This is caused
     by the lack of available alternative investment opportunities and the
     need in many cases to pay compensation not only to registered land
     owners, but also to bona fide occupants.

•	   Mismanagement of land systems promoting corruption: Land
     transactions are often braced with very high transaction costs, mainly
     resulting from corruption.
How should land in Uganda be managed in order to support the
transformation process?

Drawing on global lessons, particularly from countries in Africa that share many of the same characteristics as
Uganda, the sixth UEU recommends four points of action. The first two build on what has already been initiated by
the Government, while the other two are intended to bridge unaddressed gaps.

I.	   Accelerate the process of systematic registration of land including land owned communally, by religious and
      cultural institutions, and by Government. Low cost technologies, as seen in Rwanda, can raise the proportion of
      land registered well beyond the current level of only 20 percent.

II.	 Redesigning the Land Fund to enhance its efficiency and equity in supporting resolution of overlapping rights.

III.	 Strengthening Institutions for Land Administration Management, including for dispute resolution; for
      documentation, information storage and retrieval, and valuation; and for urban authorities finances to allow
      them acquire land and pay for infrastructure development.

IV.	 Reviewing and prioritizing the many existing policy commitments that already exist to identify and close critical
     gaps such as in restrictions on rental markets, disincentives such as taxation for speculative holding of land,
     urban land use, discrimination against women in landownership, and expropriation and compensation to
     promote equity and fairness in land transactions.
