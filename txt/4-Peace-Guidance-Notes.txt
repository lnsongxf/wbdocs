Incorporating a Peace Lens into the NCDDP Program

 U
      nique challenges to social and economic development face conflict-affected
      communities, especially in rural areas. In many ways, conflict threatens stability, the
      rule of law and, ultimately, the community’s ability to attain sustainable development.
 For NCDDP, peace and stability are vital elements to community development. While
 the implementation of the CEAC process may give rise to situations leading to possible
 conflict, it is important to recognize and ensure the participation of already conflict-stricken
 areas in community and development processes.
 This guidance note helps you in implementing the CEAC process in communities affected
 by violent conflicts and other threats and notable changes in demographics. Tools and
 approaches are provided here for work with such communities, especially on social
 preparation and the community development planning stages.
 Behavioral change among members of the community and strong community engagement
 are crucial to the achievement of long-term conflict-resolution.
 Essentially, incorporation of a “Peace Lens” means that KC-NCDDP interventions are
 sensitive to the barriers that can constrain the full participation of communities to the
 Program and efforts are made to ensure that the program provides opportunities for these
 communities or sectors within it to strengthen their capacity to recover from and to the
 extent possible address the roots of violence and conflict in their lives.
 In areas where the NCDDP is operating, lack of and unequal opportunities within
 communities challenge the role and capacity of the LGUs to address conflicts. There, the
 application of the Peace Lens could enhance the existing capacities of the local stakeholders
 to improve their peace-promoting strategies.
 Program success indicators using the Peace Lens approach include:
    1.	 Conflict-affected areas are provided community development activities to aid them
        in progress;
    2.	 Increased number of conflict-resolution structures and mechanisms among
        municipalities and barangays;
    3.	 Decreased number of emerging conflicts among municipalities, barangays, and
        their members; and,
    4.	 Increased access to basic social services in conflict-affected communities.
 To achieve success, CEAC’s detailed processes must take into proper account potential
 conflicts and conflict-prone areas. For instance, the recognition that a municipality is
 affected by armed conflict during the enrollment phase should not necessarily disqualify
 it from participation. This only highlights that incorporating a Peace Lens into the CEAC is
 vital to the enrollment and pre-implementation stage of the Program.

Community Planning Stage

 I
   n this phase, the peace or conflict-related information continue to be analyzed.
   The issues raised serve as starting points in identifying possible subprojects. These
   problems should be illustrated using an ‘Identification and of Priority Problems’ table.
 Further, the introduction of some special activities and affirmative actions are being
 introduced in the planning stage. This phase ensures that peace criteria is reflected in
 the CSW.
 The possible subprojects will be subjected to a selection criteria to determine priority
 ranking which should include its responsiveness to peace/conflict standards. The
 following must be considered in ranking the priorities:
     1.	 Project must address a specific cause of conflict;
     2.	 Project must enhance vertical social capital (e.g., relations of trust) between
         citizens and the LGU;
     3.	 Project must promote social inclusion, participation, transparency, and
         accountability; and,
     4.	 Project must enhance horizontal social capital among members of society.
 It is important that the priority problems are formulated carefully so that their peace
 and conflict dimensions are articulated fully. The prioritization of problems should be
 decided by the PSA team through the application of agreed-upon procedures and
 criteria (see above) to rank priority problems. For instance, areas with severe peace and
 conflict-related problems are likely prioritized since there is a high risk of endangering
 the entire development participation process .
