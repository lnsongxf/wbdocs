PREFACE

T
      he purpose of the Labour Force Survey (LFS) in Kosovo is to provide statistical data on labour
      market indicators and enable comparisons to be drawn with previous years. The methodology and
      definitions applied in the LFS are the same as those used in 2012 and 2013 and are consistent
with Eurostat regulations. The LFS survey includes 600 Enumeration Areas (EA) throughout the territory
of Kosovo where 4,800 households are interviewed.

                                     This Labour Force Survey 2014 report contains data on employment
                                     and unemployment by age, gender, employment status, economic
                                     activities, occupations and other areas of the labour market. At
                                     the end of the section 6 reports on changes of the main indicators
                                     between 2012, 2013 and 2014. Table 6.1 shows that most of the
                                     key labour market indicators have remained similar over the past
                                     three years.

                                     The employment rate rose slightly between 2012 and 2013 but then
                                     fell again to certain extent in 2014. The LFS data show that the
                                     percentage of those employed in part-time jobs decreased from
                                     11.1% in 2013 to 7.7% in 2014. Self-employment (as a percentage of
                                     those employed) has risen slightly in the last two years. Furthermore,
                                     the percentage of the employed in vulnerable jobs (persons who
 Mr. Isa Krasniqi                    are self-employed without employees and those who work unpaid
 Chief Executive Officer of the      in a family business) increased from 23.6% in 2013 to 24.9% in
 Kosovo Agency for Statistics        2014. Manufacturing, trade, education and construction continue
                                     to employ almost half of all employed people.

The unemployment rate fell slightly from 30.9% to 30.0% between 2012 and 2013 but there has been
an increase in 2014 to 35.3%. However between 2013 and 2014 the proportion of discouraged workers
(inactive people who are not looking for a job as they believe that there is no work available) fell from
12.1% to 10.7%. The inactivity rate also fell slightly between the two years. This could suggest people
who were previously inactive have started looking for work (and so would be classified as unemployed).

There was a slight change in the labour force participation rate between 2013 and 2014, increasing
from 40.5% to 41.6%. Female labour force participation and employment increased remained virtually
unchanged between 2013 and 2014. Youth unemployment grew again in 2014, increasing from 55.9%
to 61.0%. There was also an increase in the long-term unemployment rate with the percentage of the
unemployed who had been unemployed for more than 12 months increasing from 68.9% in 2013 to
73.8% in 2014. Youth NEETs (respondents aged 15-24 who are not employed, not in education and not
in training) decreased from 35.3% in 2013 to 30.2% in 2014.

Kosovo Agency of Statistics (KAS) is very grateful to UNDP, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Finland
and the World Bank for the financial and professional support they have provided to the LFS. KAS also
thanks the LFS team for their contribution in implementing this survey.

According to the Law of Official Statistics No.04/L-034 the Kosovo Agency of Statistics is responsible for
producing the official statistics in the Republic of Kosovo and therefore when data are used the source
should be cited.

INTRODUCTION

T
        he Kosovo Agency of Statistics (KAS) began conducting the Labour Force Survey (LFS) in 2001
        and then undertook LFS on an almost annual basis until 2009. In 2011 KAS began planning for the
        updated Labour Force Survey which has several important improvements over previous surveys:

•	    Improved questionnaire (continuing to follow Eurostat guidelines)

•	    New sampling frame (based on the 2011 Census of Kosovo)

•	    Longitudinal sub-sample in which each household is interviewed four times (once every three months)

•	    Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) which enables data output to be generated faster
      than traditional paper and pencil interviews followed by data entry.

The main objectives of LFS are to collect information, mainly on the supply side of the labour market,
i.e., information on those who are working or who are actively looking for work. The LFS collects social
and economic information for use in the following areas:

Macro-economic monitoring: The change in the number of people employed is an indicator of
changes in economic activity. It is necessary to track these changes, specifically the types of jobs and
the industries in which people work.

Human resource development policies: The economy is changing all the time. In order to meet the
needs of the changing economy, people need to be vocationally trained. LFS enables the identification
of areas of training.

Employment policies: For an economy to work at its maximum potential, all those wanting to have
work should have jobs. Some people may wish to have full-time jobs and can only find part-time work.
Knowing how many of these people there are can enable the Government to design policies that
encourage full-employment.

Income support and social programmes: For the majority of people, employment income is their main
means of support. People not only need jobs but also productive jobs in order to receive reasonable
incomes. Government needs to know what levels of income are being earned by different groups of
persons.



     Methodological Note: Estimating the population.

     It can be seen in Figure 1 that the population of Kosovo for the midpoint of July 1 2014 was
     estimated to be 1,811,521. The midpoint was used because LFS survey takes place from Jan 1
     – Dec 31 and annual figures use what the population was estimated to be in the middle of 2014.
     The source for the figures is the Kosovo Population Projection 2011-2061 report published in
     December 2013. In this report, for each year up until 2061, KAS estimate a low, middle and high
     variant dependent on different definitions. For 2012 and 2013 LFS reports it was regarded that the
     middle variant would be the most realistic and sensible version to use. However considering the
     unusually high out migration experienced from around October 2014, this was considered to be
     unrealistically high. Therefore for this report the low variant estimate was used.

     The population estimate does not have an impact on any of the rates (employment,
     unemployment, labour force participation etc.) shown in this report.

                                                                            LABOUR FORCE SURVEY



DEFINITIONS

T
     he working age population includes people 15 to 64 years of age, inclusive. This measure is used
     to give an estimate of the total number of potential workers within an economy.

      The labour force comprises those who are employed and those who are unemployed, according to
the strict definitions given below. Inactive persons are not considered part of the labour force.


1. Employed: People who during the reference week performed some work for wage or salary, or
profit or family gain, in cash or in kind or were temporarily absent from their jobs.

2. Unemployed: People who during the reference week were:

•	 without work, that is, were not in paid employment or self-employment; and

•	 currently available for work, that is, were available for paid employment or self- employment within two
   weeks; and

•	 seeking work, that is, had taken specific steps in the previous four weeks to seek paid employment or
   self-employment.

3. Inactive: People who were neither employed or unemployed during the reference period.

Classification of the population into these three mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories depends
on the application of the activity principle – what a person was actually doing during the reference week
– and a set of priority rules regarding activity that give precedence to employment over unemployment
and to unemployment over economic inactivity. Classification also depends on a clear understanding of
which activities are to be considered as “employment”. It is important to note that employment includes
activities which are paid or unpaid and activities producing goods and services which are either sold in
the market or not.

The labour force participation rate is the proportion of a country’s working-age population that engages
actively in the labour market, either by being employed or unemployed. It is the ratio of the labour force
(employed plus unemployed) to the working-age population, expressed as a percentage.


                        Labour force           (Employed + Unemployed)
                        participation rate                                    X 100
                                                 Working-age population

The inactivity rate is the proportion of a country’s working-age population that is neither employed nor
unemployed. When added together, the inactivity rate and the labour force participation rate sum to 100
per cent.

The employment-to-population ratio, also known as the employment rate, is the proportion of a
country’s working-age population that is employed.


                        Employment-to-           Employed population
                                                                              X 100
                        population ratio        Working-age population

The unemployment rate is the proportion of the labour force that is not employed. It is the labour force
that serves as the base for this indicator, not the working-age population.

Discouraged workers are people without work who are currently available for work but who have
given up looking for work because they believe that they cannot find work. They are included within the
inactive category.

Youth unemployment refers to the unemployment of people aged 15–24 years.

Youth Not in Employment, Education or Training (NEET) is the share of youth (15-24) that are not
employed, not in education and not in training.

Vulnerable employment refers to self-employed persons who do not have employees or unpaid family
workers. The vulnerably employed are less likely to have formal work arrangements and are more likely
to lack decent working conditions.

                                                                             LABOUR FORCE SURVEY



KEY POINTS

F
    igure 1 provides a summary of the labour market status of Kosovo’s population based on the 2014
    Labour Force Survey. Among the more important results of the 2014 LFS, as illustrated in Figure 1
    and elaborated in greater detail in the body of this report, are the following:

•	 Almost two-thirds of Kosovo’s population is of working age (15-64 years). The working age population
   is expected to grow rapidly over the next decade, as Kosovo has one of the youngest populations in
   Europe.

•	 Of those at in working age, 58.4% are not economically active, meaning that they are not employed and
   have not actively sought employment in the past four weeks and/or are not available to start work within
   two weeks.

•	 Of the 41.6% of the population that is economically active, 35.3% (176,743 persons) are unemployed.
   This implies that 64.7% (323,508) of economically active people are employed, yielding an employment-
   to-population ratio (employment rate) of 26.9%.

•	 Of the 58.4% of the working age population that is inactive, 18.2% (128,400 people) did not seek a job
   because they believed that there was no work available. Discouraged workers accounted for 10.7% of
   the working age population, with similar levels for women and men.

•	 There are large gender differences throughout the labour market.

   •	 Approximately one-in-five (21.4%) women of working age are active in the labour market, compared
      to three-fifths (61.8%) of the male working age population.

   •	 Among those in the labour force, unemployment is much higher for women than it is for men (41.6%
      compared to 33.1%).

   •	 The employment rate among working age women is only 12.5%, compared to 41.3% for men.

   •	 Women’s extremely employment low rate stems from the combination of very low labour force
      participation and high unemployment.

   •	 Family responsibilities were the main reason for women’s inactivity in the labour market with 38.8%
      of female respondents giving this reason

   •	 Women were mostly employed in the education and health sectors (almost 40% of employed
      women). Men were mostly employed in the manufacturing, trade and construction sectors
      (employing more than 40% of employed men).

•	 Youth unemployment is very high in Kosovo

   •	 In 2014, youth in Kosovo were almost twice as likely to be unemployed compared to adults. Among
      those aged 15-24 years and in the labour force, 61.0% were unemployed. Unemployment is higher
      among young women (71.7%) than young men (56.2%).

   •	 Almost one third (30.2%) of Kosovo’s 15 to 24 year olds were not in education, employment or
      training. The figure among young women is 34.0%, compared to 26.6% for young men.

•	 The large majority of those who are employed report working full-time.

   •	 In their main job, 91.7% of respondents reported working full-time, with no major gender differences.

   •	 The reasons for working part-time were rather gender differentiated, with women taking more of a
      caring role within the family, thus reducing the hours available for employment.

   •	 The number one reason for men not working full-time was the lack of availability of full-time work.

   •	 Respondents working in the government sector reported working fewer hours than those in the
      private sector. Gender differences were small, especially in the government sector where hours are

                                                                                                            9

        more fixed. Both men and women working in private companies worked longer hours than their
        public sector counterparts.

     •	 24.9% of employed people belonged to the vulnerable employment category. This means that they
        are either employed in their own business (own-account workers) or contributing to a family business
        (paid or unpaid).

     •	 Only 28.4% of those employed had a permanent contract for their main job while 71.6% had
        temporary contracts, with no significant difference between men and women. Those with temporary
        contracts were asked why they had this type of contract and 96.3% of respondents reported that no
        other type of contract was available.

     •	 The net salaries of most employees were between €300 to €400 a month. Very small gender
        differences were noted.

       f the entire working age population, 26.9% were employed (Figure 2). The employment rate was
       higher for men than women: 41.3% of working age men were employed compared to 12.5%
       working age of women. Over a three year period (2012 to 2014) the employment rate has
changed slightly with almost 3% increase from 2012-2013 and a 1.5% decrease from 2013-2014

1.2. EMPLOYMENT BY AGE GROUP AND EDUCATION LEVEL
Across age groups, the employment rate was highest among people aged between 45-54 years old
(38.1%) and lowest among youth (15-24 years old) (9%).

The employment rate of women remained at a fairly steady percentage (around 16%) between the ages
to 25 to 44 years old. Only 4.2% of young women and 13.4% of women aged between 55-64 years old
were employed. For men (Table 1.1) the employment rate was the highest for those aged 35-44 years
(60%), and the lowest for young men (13.4%).

An examination of the highest educational level attained by the employed shows that 40% of them
have completed secondary vocational education, whereas more than a quarter (26.1%) have completed
tertiary education (Table 1.2).

Table 1.3 illustrates that the requirements for getting a job are higher in government positions where over
half of all employees (58.3%) have completed higher education.

16.4% were self-employed without employees and 8.6% were family workers (Table 1.4). The majority
of employed women had the status of an employee. More than one quarter of men were self-employed
compared to 13.6% of women.

1.4. VULNERABLE EMPLOYMENT


I
  n addition to the low employment rate in Kosovo, 24.9% of the employed were working in vulnerable
  jobs. Vulnerable workers are either self-employed people without employees or those who work unpaid
  in a family business. These two groups of workers have a lower likelihood of having formal work
arrangements as compared to wage and salaried workers.

Men are more likely to hold such vulnerable jobs (26.7% of employed men compared to 18.9% of
employed women). In absolute terms 81,900 out of 323,508 employed people belong to the vulnerable
employment category (Table 1.5). Employed people in professional fields are less likely to be vulnerably
employed (Table 1.6) as are those with a higher level of education (Table 1.7).

1.5. CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS
In terms of the type of contract that working respondents had, the majority (84.5%) had an individual
contract while the rest were working without a contract. For youth (15 to 24 years of age) the percentage
working without a contract was 38.5%.

Of those who had an employment contract, only 28.4% had a permanent contract for their main job while
71.6% had temporary contracts. These rates are similar for men and women. Those with temporary
contracts were asked why they had this type of contract and 96.3% of respondents reported that no
other type of contract was available.

When asked whether in their main job they were entitled to the benefits of a social security scheme in
the job, only 9.1% of employees responded affirmatively.



1.6. ECONOMIC ACTIVITY
Manufacturing, trade, education and construction employed almost half of employed in 2014 (Tables 1.8A
& 1.8B). The trade sector employed 14.4%, manufacturing 13.8%, education 11.9% and construction
employed 10.9% of all the employed in Kosovo.

Education and healthcare were the two largest employers of women (employing almost 40% of employed
women). Manufacturing, trade and construction are the most common employment sectors for men
(employing more than 40% of employed men).

had elementary occupations (23.7%), 18.4% worked as service workers and shop and market sales
workers, while 12.3% were professionals. (Table 1.9).

1.8. PATTERNS OF WORK
Only 1.4% of the employed population reported having a second job during the reference week, with no
statistically significant difference between gender.

In their main job, 91.7% of respondents reported working full-time and 8.3% part time. Small gender
differences were noted with women slightly more likely to work part time (10.1% compared to 7.7%).
For those who worked part-time the reasons for this were rather gender differentiated, with women
taking more of a caring role within the family, thus reducing the hours available to work (Table 1.10). The
number one reason for men not working full-time was the lack of availability of full-time work.

Three-fifths of the employed worked between 40-48 hours per week. Over a tenth (13.1%) of employed
people worked 60 or more hours per week. Within a week 15.8% of employed people worked less than
40 hours.

Men tended to work longer hours than women, with 28% of men working more than 48 hours per week

Respondents working in the public sector reported working fewer hours than those in the private sector
(Table 1.12). Gender differences were small, especially in the government sector where hours seem
more fixed (around 38-39 hours a week). Men and women working in private companies worked the
longest hours compared to all types of employment.

1.9. NET MONTHLY SALARY
Respondents who were employees were asked about their net monthly pay from their main job (only 4%
of respondents refused to answer). Most monthly net salaries were situated between €300 and €400
among those who did respond. Very small gender differences were noted, with males having a slight
tendency to receive higher salaries.

three years of the LFS most employees were earning between 300 to 400 euro a month.

The unemployment rate was the highest for people who have no education (64.6% of this group are
unemployed) and lowest for people who had completed tertiary education (18.9%).

Education improved the labour market prospects particularly for men as 70.0% of men with no education
were unemployed compared to 14.7% of those that had completed tertiary education.



2.3. YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT
Based on 2014 LFS, 28.5% of the unemployed in Kosovo were young people (aged 15-24 years), with
an almost eight point difference for males and females.

A significant share of the youth population is unemployed (61.0%) and the unemployment rate of women
is higher (71.7%) compared to men (56.2%).

In 2014, young persons in Kosovo were twice more likely to be unemployed compared to adults with
similar rates for men and women (Table 2.5).

2.4. DURATION OF UNEMPLOYMENT
Unemployed respondents were asked how long they had been unemployed. A large majority (68.9%)
reported that they had been unemployed for more than 12 months. Small gender differences were noted
(71.0% of men and 64.8% of women). Figure 8 shows that the likelihood of being unemployed for over
a year increases with age.

3. LABOUR FORCE PARTICIPATION

I
  n 2014, out of an estimated total population of 1,811,521, the total working age population (aged
  15 to 64) was 1,202,489 people. Of these working age people, 41.6% were participating in the
  labour force (economically active). This means they were either employed or unemployed (i.e., actively
  seeking work and available to work). The remaining 58.4% were economically inactive (Figure 9). The
economically inactive include students, housewives, discouraged workers, and other people who were
not actively looking for work and they are examined in the next chapter.

From Figure 9 it is evident that labour force participation among women was much lower than that of men:
21.4% of females were active compared to 61.8% of men. Figure 10 shows that the labour force participation
rate has increased slightly over time. Between 2013 and 2014 the increase was smaller (only 1.1%).

The labour force participation rate was highest among people aged between 30-34 years (55%) and
lowest amongst people aged 15 to 19 years (Table 3.2). The low participation rate for young people is
not surprising because most of this group is in education.

Among men, those aged 40-44 years have the highest labour force participation rate (84.8%), whereas
for women it is the highest for those between 25 and 29 years. (Table 3.2).

4. INACTIVE PERSONS
4.1. INACTIVITY BY GENDER



A
         lot of attention is given to describing and measuring the employed and unemployed
         populations which together form the Labour Force (or the economically active). However,
         the category “inactive” is equally important. Changes in activity rates are a key part of the
         impact of labour supply on potential output growth. This is due to the large number of
potential workers among this group.

Personal or family responsibilities are the main reason for women’s inactivity in the labour market
(Table 4.1). Overall low participation of women in the labour force in Kosovo may also be linked to
stereotypical gender roles.


4.2. DISCOURAGED JOB-SEEKERS
In 2014 out of the 702,238 inactive population, 128,400 people did not seek a job because they
believed that there was no work available. This category is classified as “discouraged” job seekers and
in Kosovo they accounted for 10.7% of the working age population (Table 4.1). Looking at the working
age population the level of discouragement is higher for women than men (13.1% compared to 8.2%).



4.3. INACTIVE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT IN EMPLOYMENT,
EDUCATION OR TRAINING (NEET)
The youth NEETs includes the young population that are not employed, not in education and not
in training, that is, totally disconnected from the labour market and are also not participating in the
educational system. High shares of this group in the youth population raise concerns about the future
employability of young people as it indicates detachment from the labour market. In addition, a large

number of unoccupied youth in countries with high youth unemployment, such as Kosovo, can put a
downward pressure on employment and earnings, as well as possibly contributing to social problems.

In 2014, 108,200 young people (aged from 15 to 24) in Kosovo were not in education, employment
or training and they represented 30.2% of the young population. The share of NEET women is 34.0%
compared to 26.6% of NEET men (Figure 11).

5. COUNTRY COMPARISONS

L
        abour market statistics of 2014 show that Kosovo still remains in the worst labour market situation
        in comparison to the Western Balkan countries.

        The labour force participation rate in Kosovo is 41.6% while the participation rate in Western
        Balkan countries ranges between 42.6% and 61.5% (Table 5.1).

Data for Labour Force Participation Rate for Kosovo and Albania is 15 to 64 year olds for other countries it is aged 15 and above.


Part of these differences is due to the fact that Kosovo has such a young population and many of
these young people are still in education (and therefore classified as inactive). A concern is that
over time the potential for the inactive population in Kosovo to grow remains high as each year
approximately 36,000 young people will enter the working age population (i.e., 14 year olds will
become 15 year olds) while only approximately 10,000 will leave the working age population (i.e., 64
year olds becoming 65 year olds).

In Kosovo only 26.9% of the working age population is employed compared to a 50.5% in Albania (Table
5.1). This is a stark difference and requires further explanation (see box below).

  Methodological Note: Differences in definition of employment between Kosovo and Albania LFS.
  As Kosovo and Albania are neighbours it is not unusual to notice the large disparity of the employment rate between the two
  countries. In general the definition used to classify respondents as employed in the same in both countries, but there is one
  important difference (shown in purple below).
  Employed are considered all the persons who have worked even for one hour with a respective salary or profit during the
  reference week. As employed are considered also all persons who were receiving a salary or wage while they were in training
  during their work.
  Employed are also considered persons temporarily not at work during the reference week for some reasons: (1) maternity
  leave, illness, injury or temporary disability and expect to return to work, education / training directly related to the actual
  work; (2) salaried employees absent from work for some reasons other than the above that (a) lack of the duration is three
  months or less, and the person is not a seasonal worker or (b) the person takes 50% or more salary; (3) the self-employed
  who intend to return to the business / farm / or professional practice; (4) workers not being paid who expect to return to work
  in three months or less. People who work on their small farm, who do not sell their products, but produce only for
  self-consumption, are considered as employed.
  It is shown in Table 6.3 below that in Kosovo a further definition is added that self consumption on small farms is only
  considered as employed if it is considered to be an important source of consumption for the household. As many
  respondents declare that is it not an important source this probably explains some of the large difference in employment rate.



Currently Kosovo has the highest unemployment rate in the region, followed by Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Table 6.1 shows that the employment rate rose in 2013 and then returned to 2012 levels in 2014 (the
2012 and 2014 confidence intervals overlap, see Table 6.2). This means that employment is growing
at about the same rate as the increase in the working-age population. However, the proportion of the
working-age population that is economically active (the Labour Force Participation rate) has increased in
2013 and 2014 (although not statistically significantly in 2014).

The unemployment rate was steady in 2013, and then increased in 2014 because even though the number of
employed was keeping pace with the growth in the working-age population, it was not keeping pace with the
more rapid growth in the economically active population.

The conclusion is that from 2012 to 2014 employment grew fast enough to match the growth in the
working-age population, but not as fast as the more rapid growth rate of the economically active
population.

The LFS data indicate that the percentage of those employed in part-time jobs decreased from 11.1%
in 2013 to 7.7% in 2014. Self-employment (as a percentage of those employed) has risen slightly in the
last two years. Furthermore, the percentage of the employed in vulnerable jobs (persons who are self-
employed without employees and those who work unpaid in a family business) increased from 23.6%
in 2013 to 24.9% in 2014. This can be seen in Table 6.3 showing that the percentage of respondents
aged 15 and above who stated in the last seven days that they had been working in their own (non
agricultural business) rose from 9.5% in 2013 to 11.2% in 2014.

In terms of the sectors in which people are employed, in general, this has not changed greatly over time.
However, the data shows that the percentage of the population working in the agricultural sector has
fallen (4.6% in 2012, 5.9% in 2013 to only 2.6% in 2014). Looking at Table 6.3 again we can see that the
total for respondents giving an answer related to agricultural activity (codes 4, 5a plus 5b) has remained
very similar (34.8% in 2012, 34.7% in 2013 and 33.0% in 2014).

It is important to note that when respondents answer code 5B, that they do some agricultural activity
but it is not an important contribution , this is not counted as employed. In 2014 69% of this group were
categorized as inactive and 31% as unemployed. An important contribution is a subjective term and
could depend on overall household income. Other sources of data put the agricultural sector in Kosovo
as much higher. This is very likely due to the fact that the type of respondents answering 5B would
be counted as being in the agricultural sector for this source. However for the Labour Force Survey
these respondents are not classified as employed and do not appear in Tables 1.8a and 1.8b outlining

employment sectors.

The unemployment rate fell only slightly, from 30.9% to 30.0% between 2012 and 2013 but there has
been quite a large increase in 2014 (35.3%). As the confidence intervals do not overlap (Table 6.4) this
suggests this is a real increase in unemployment.

Initially it appears the increase in the unemployment rate can only be a negative trend, but if we examine
the proportion of discouraged workers (inactive people who are not looking for a job as they believe that
there is no work available) between 2013 & 2014 this fell from 12.1% in 2013 to 10.7% in 2014.

There was a slight change in the labour force participation rate between 2013 and 2014, increasing from
40.5% to 41.6%.

Female labour force participation and employment remained virtually unchanged between 2013 and
2014. Youth unemployment grew again in 2014, increasing from 55.9% to 61.0%. There was also
an increase in the long-term unemployment rate: the percentage of the unemployed who had been
unemployed for more than 12 months increased from 68.9% in 2013 to 73.8% in 2014.

In terms of Age Dependency, the figure for Kosovo in 2010 was also 52% so there has been virtually
no change over the last few years. Kosovo’s age dependency is higher than its’ neighbours (46% for
both Albania and Bosnia & Herzegovina, 41% for FYROM and 44% for Serbia) reflecting Kosovo’s young
population.

Another common ratio used, particularly in Eurostat publications, is the effective economic old age
dependency ratio . This is an important indicator to assess the potential impact of ageing on social
expenditure related to employment (pensions etc.). This indicator is calculated as the ratio between the
65+ population (all classified as inactive) and total employment. For this ratio Eurostat set the age range
for the employed from 20 to 74 years. The effective economic old age dependency ratio is projected to
rise significantly from 41.5% in 2013 to 64.5% in 2060 in the EU28. In Kosovo for 2014 the ratio was
46.7%.

The total economic dependency ratio is calculated as the ratio between the total inactive population
(15+) and employment (aged 20-74). It gives a measure of the average number of individuals aged 15
and above that each employed «supports». It was 120% in the EU28 in 2013, while in 2014 in Kosovo
the ratio is 266%. The highest ratio in the EU28 in 2013 was Greece (180%).

ANNEX 1: SAMPLE DESIGN AND
CALCULATION OF WEIGHTS
1. INTRODUCTION
The procedures used for calculating the quarterly and annual weights for the 2014 Kosovo LFS
are similar to those used for the 2013 LFS, but with some minor changes. The total number of
sample EAs was 600 each quarter; the panel of sample households in one replicate of 150 sample
EAs was rotated each quarter. For the 2013 and 2014 LFS a sample of 600 EAs was selected with
probability proportional to size (PPS) within each stratum, where the measure of size was based on
the number of households in the EA from the 2011 Kosovo Census frame. A sample of 8 households
was selected for the LFS in each sample EA, for a total original sample size of 4,800 households
each quarter. Since a few sample EAs were not enumerated some quarters and the non-interview
households are not replaced, the final effective sample size each quarter depends on the total
number of sample households with completed interviews.

The weighting procedures for the 2014 Kosovo LFS depend on the sample design, the number of
sample EAs covered each quarter, and the number of sample households with completed interviews
in each sample EA that appear in the final LFS data file. The sample design is summarized in the next
section. The basic LFS weighting procedures involved first calculating the weights for each quarter of
2014 based on the probabilities of selection and the distribution of the completed household interviews
by sample EA each quarter, so that the quarterly data were nationally-representative. Then the basic
quarterly weights were adjusted at the national level based on the projected total population for mid-
2014. Finally the weights for the annual LFS combined data from all four quarters were calculated by
dividing the quarterly weights by 4.


2. SUMMARY OF SAMPLE DESIGN FOR THE 2014 KOSOVO LFS
A stratified two-stage sample design was used for the 2014 Kosovo LFS. The sampling frame was based
on the data and cartography from the 2011 Kosovo Census. For the purposes of the census enumeration,
Kosovo was subdivided into enumeration areas (EAs), which are relatively small operational segments
defined for the census enumeration. A total of 4,626 EAs were defined for Kosovo, and these were
used as the primary sampling units (PSUs) selected at the first sampling stage for the LFS. The overall
average number of households per EA in the sampling frame was 67; the average size of the urban EAs
(103 households) was almost twice that for the rural EAs (53 households). One census enumerator was
responsible for enumerating the households and population in each EA. KAS used the 2011 Census data
to compile a sampling frame of EAs that was used for selecting the LFS sample.

Kosovo is divided geographically into seven regions, specified in Table A1. KAS uses these seven
regions for stratifying the sampling frame and for reporting the results from their household surveys.
Each region is divided into municipalities, which are further subdivided into towns or localities. The EAs
were defined within the smallest administrative units. Each EA was classified as urban or rural, and this
classification was used for defining sampling strata within each region.

At the time of the 2011 Census, KAS was not able to conduct the census enumeration in three
municipalities in the North (Leposaviq, Zubin Potok and Zveçam) as well as part of the municipality of
Mitrovicë, which have a high concentration of Serbian population. For this reason the final results from
the 2011 Kosovo Census exclude the households and population in those areas. However, KAS had
previously defined EAs for those areas, and these EAs had been listed in 2008 (in the case of a master
sample of 1,000 EAs for the national household surveys) or in 2009 (for the remaining EAs). Therefore
KAS was able to use the previous information for the EAs excluded in the 2011 Census, to complement
the frame for the rest of Kosovo with census information. A total of 257 EAs in the Northern municipalities
are in the frame with information from the 2008/09 listing. These EAs are integrated with the EAs for the
rest of Kosovo with information from the 2011 Census, for a total of 4,626 EAs in the combined frame.

                                                                                                        33

It can be seen in Table A1 that the percentage of households varies by region, from 9.8% for Peja to
28.1% for Pristina. About 43.8% of the households are classified as urban.

For the Kosovo LFS, cut-off sampling was used to eliminate EAs with less than 10 households from the
sampling frame. One result of this approach is that it will produce slightly biased survey results given
that the households in the excluded areas are not represented in the survey data. A total of 160 rural
EAs were excluded from the frame in this case. These excluded EAs cover a very small percentage of
the total population, so the corresponding bias should also be very small.

In order to update the second stage sampling frame for selecting the sample households in each sample
EA for the 2014 LFS, KAS conducted a new listing of households in the 600 sample EAs at the end of
2013. As described later in the section on Weighting Procedures, the number of listed households was
also used in the calculation of the weights. This was an improvement over the 2013 LFS methodology,
which used the list of households from the 2011 Census for the sample EAs to select the households.
The previous lack of a new listing resulted in a corresponding small bias since new housing units were
not represented. In the case of a sample household that moved, if there was a new household living in
the same dwelling unit, it would be interviewed for the LFS.

The sampling frame of EAs was first divided into explicit strata based on the urban and rural areas in
each region. The sampling frame included information on ethnicity of the population in each EA, which
was also used for stratification. If all the households in an EA belonged to one ethnic group, the EA was
assigned to that ethnic stratum; there was also a category for mixed ethnicity. In the case of a region
with Serbian EAs in the urban or rural strata, these EAs were included in a separate stratum in which the
sample EAs were selected independently. Since the sample allocation was proportional to the number
of households, some of these small strata had only one EA selected. For the purposes of the weighting
procedures and the calculation of sampling errors, the stratification will be limited to the region, urban
and rural level.

A total of 600 sample EAs were selected for the 2014 Kosovo quarterly LFS, allocated to the strata
approximately in proportion to the number of households. Within each sample EA 8 sample households
were selected at the second stage, for a total original sample size of 4,800 households each quarter.
Table A2 shows the allocation of the LFS sample EAs and households by region, urban and rural stratum.
Given the proportional sample allocation, the smallest region of Peja has a sample of 58 EAs and 464
households. The nonresponse rate will further reduce the effective sample size, so it is important to
monitor the sampling errors for the estimates of key indicators by region in order to determine whether
the level of precision is sufficient for the smaller regions.

At the first sampling stage the EAs in each stratum were selected systematically with probability
proportional to size (PPS), where the measure of size was based on the total number of households
in each EA from the sampling frame. The number of EAs selected in each stratum was based on the
sample allocation presented in Table A2. At the second sampling stage 8 households were selected
systematically with equal probability within each sample EA, from the updated listing of households.


3. SAMPLE ROTATION SCHEME
The 2014 Kosovo LFS is designed as a continuous household survey, with data collection throughout
each week of the year. The sample rotation scheme is based on Eurostat guidelines. For the fieldwork
and data analysis the year is divided into four quarters of 13 weeks each. The national sample of 600
EAs is divided into four nationally-representative replicates of 150 EAs each, which are used in the
sample rotation scheme. The panel of 1,200 sample households in each replicate is interviewed for four
consecutive quarters, and then replaced by a new panel of sample households. The panel households
in the other three replicates are kept in the sample for the next quarter, which ensures that there is a
75% overlap in the sample from one quarter to the next. This will improve the level of precision for the
estimates of trends (differences) in the unemployment rate and other labor force characteristics from one
quarter to the next. This rotation scheme continued from the 2013 LFS, but since it takes a full year for
the rotation scheme to be implemented, some of panels of sample households for the 2014 LFS were
interviewed less than four times.



4. GENERAL METHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATING THE 2014
KOSOVO LFS WEIGHTS
In order for the sample estimates from the 2014 Kosovo LFS to be representative of the population, it
is necessary to multiply the data by a sampling weight. The basic weight for each sample household
is equal to the inverse of its probability of selection (calculated by multiplying the probabilities at each
sampling stage). A household weight is attached to each sample household record in the data files.

The probabilities of selection are based on the stratified two-stage sample design. At the first stage a
sample of EAs was selected with PPS within each stratum (region, urban/rural), and at the second stage
a sample of 8 households was selected in each sample EA from the new listing. Based on this sample
design, the probabilities of selection for the households in each sample EA can be expressed as follows:



where:

 hi = 	 probability of selection for the sample households in the i-th sample EA in stratum (region,
		      urban/rural) h


                                                                                                              35
RESULTS OF THE KOSOVO 2014
LABOUR FORCE SURVEY                                                                             JUNE 2015




nh = 	    number of sample EAs selected in stratum h for the LFS

Mhi = 	 total number of households in the sampling frame for the i-th sample EA in stratum h

Mh = 	 total number of households in the sampling frame for stratum h (that is, the cumulated measure
		     of size for the stratum)

mhi = 	 8 = number of sample households selected in the i-th sample EA in stratum h

M hi =	 total number of households in the updated listing for the i-th sample EA in stratum h

The basic sampling weight is calculated as the inverse of this probability of selection. Based on the
previous expression for the probability, the weight can be calculated as follows:



where:

Whi = 	 basic weight for the sample households in the i-th sample EA in stratum h

Since the number of households listed in the sample EA ( M hi) is generally different from the corresponding
number of households in the EA from the frame ( M hi), the weights will vary by EA within a stratum.

It is important to adjust the basic weights for the sample households to take into account the nonresponse
of households in each sample EA. Since the weights are calculated at the level of the sample EA, it is
advantageous to adjust the weights at this level. The final weight ( W hi) for the sample households in the
i-th sample EA in stratum h can be expressed as follows:



where:

m’ hi =	 number of sample households with completed interviews in the i-th sample EA in stratum h



5. CALCULATION OF LFS WEIGHTS FOR EACH QUARTER OF 2014
The basic quarterly weights are calculated using the formula for the weight specified in the previous
section. However, the weights each quarter will vary based on the final number of sample EAs enumerated
and the number of sample households with completed interviews in each sample EA. Following the
adjustment of the quarterly weights to take into account any EAs that are not enumerated and any
sample households that cannot be interviewed, the LFS quarterly weight can be expressed as follows:

The value of n qh depends on the actual distribution of the enumerated EAs in the data file for each
quarter. The number of enumerated sample EAs varied slightly by quarter. Tables A3 to A6 show the
distribution of the enumerated sample EAs and the number of households with completed interviews
by region, urban and rural stratum, in the Kosovo LFS data for each quarter of 2014.

The formula for the quarterly weights specified above was used for calculating a separate set of basic
weights for each quarter.



6. ADJUSTMENT OF 2014 LFS QUARTERLY WEIGHTS BASED ON
POPULATION PROJECTIONS
The weighted estimate of the total household-based population of Kosovo using the original weights for
each quarter will vary slightly by quarter due to sampling error. Although the new listing of households in
the sample EAs should reflect part of the growth of the households and population in Kosovo following
the 2011 Census, the weighted estimates of total population are affected by the quality of the listing as
well as the sampling error.

Therefore it was decided to adjust the 2014 Kosovo LFS weights for each quarter using the projected
total population of Kosovo for the middle of 2014 (July 1) based on demographic techniques. This will
also make the weighted estimate of the total population using the annual weights consistent with the
projected total population. For the 2013 LFS a similar adjustment of the weights was made using the
medium variant of the projected total population. In the case of the 2014 LFS, there was concern
that the medium variant of the projected total population did not reflect the increase in the rate of out-
migration, so it was decided to use the lower variant of the projected total population. The lower variant
of the projected total population of Kosovo for the mid-point of the 2014 LFS data collection period (1
July 2014) is 1,811,521. Just before going to Press KAS released revised population numbers for 2014
and the revised number was 1,804,944. As this is lower than the low variant previously published it was
justified to use this variant.

The adjustment factor for the 2014 LFS weights each quarter was calculated as follows:




where:

A LFS2014q =	   weight adjustment factor applied to the preliminary 2014 LFS weights for quarter q

P 2014 =		      lower variant of the projected total population of Kosovo for the mid-point of 2014 		
    		          based on demographic estimation techniques, equal to 1,811,521

                                		       adjusted for nonresponse

P qhij =		      number of persons in the j-th sample household in the i-th sample EA of stratum h in 	
     		         the 2014 LFS data for quarter q

The final 2014 LFS weights for each quarter were calculated by multiplying the basic weight adjusted for
nonresponse by this population adjustment factor, as follows:



where:

W qhi =	 final adjusted quarterly weight for the sample households in the i-th sample EA in 			
   	     stratum h for quarter q

Table A7 shows that the average population weight adjustment factor is 1.1472, indicating that the
preliminary weights underestimated the total population by about 15 percent, assuming that the lower
variant population projection is correct. Adjusting the weights based on the national-level projections,
the constant weight adjustment factor each quarter will not affect the estimates of any relative quarterly
indicators such as the unemployment rate and the labor force participation rate.



7. CALCULATION OF 2014 LFS WEIGHTS FOR ANNUAL COMBINED
DATA FOR ALL FOUR QUARTERS

The data from different quarters are combined in order to increase the level of precision for the annual
indicators and to represent seasonality in the labor force and employment characteristics over a
12-month reference period. The Kosovo LFS data for all four quarters of 2014 were combined for the
analysis of the annual data, so weights were calculated for this combined data file. In this case we first
calculated the quarterly weights based on the sample EAs and households with completed interviews in
the LFS data for each quarter, as specified in the previous section. Since the weights for each quarter
expand the data to the national level, it is necessary to divide these weights by 4 in order to obtain the
annual weights for the combined data file for all four quarters. Therefore the annual LFS weights can be
expressed as follows:



where:

WAqhi = 	 annual weight for the sample households in the i-th sample EA in stratum h for quarter q in the 	
   	      combined data file for the four quarters of 2014

W   qhi
          =	 final quarterly weight (including population adjustment factor) for the sample households in the 	
    	        i-th sample EA in stratum h for quarter q

This weighting procedure for the annual LFS estimates has the effect of averaging the results from all of the quarters
being combined. Since the weights for each quarter were adjusted based on the projected total population for
mid-2014, the annual weights will automatically be consistent with this total population at the national level.

                                                                                                                   39

8. REVIEW OF WEIGHTED DISTRIBUTION OF POPULATION BY
REGION, URBAN AND RURAL STRATA

The weighted distribution of the total number of households and population by region, urban and rural
strata based on the annual 2014 LFS weights depends on the distribution of the 2011 Kosovo Census
frame and the updated listing in sample EAs, as well as the variability in the average number of persons
per household by region from the survey data. Table A8 shows the distribution of the weighted total
number of households and population by region, urban and rural strata, using the final annual weights
for the 2014 Kosovo LFS.

It can be seen in Table A8 that the weighted total population at the national level (1,811,521) is the same
as the lower variant of the projected total population of Kosovo for mid-2014 used for the adjustment
of the weights. The weighted percent of urban households at the national level is 40.0%, compared to
43.8% urban households in the 2011 Census frame. This difference is mostly due to the updated listing
of households in the sample EAs. The weighted percent of urban population at the national level is
36.4%. One reason for the different percentage of urban households and population is that the average
household size is 5.12 persons for urban households and 5.95 for rural households.
