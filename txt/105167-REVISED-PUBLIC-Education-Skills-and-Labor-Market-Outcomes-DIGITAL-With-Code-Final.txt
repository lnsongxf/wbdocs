    Introduction
    In recent years, skills development has become a priority among developed
    and developing countries alike. Having a skilled workforce has been recognized
    as paramount to boosting competitiveness in an increasingly global and
    interdependent economic environment, fostering innovation and business
    creation and increasing productivity. Since individuals with the right skills and
    knowledge are more likely to find employment, skills development can also have
    positive effects in reducing unemployment, raising incomes, and improving
    standards of living.
    The World Bank Group, in its quest to end extreme poverty and promote shared
    prosperity, has joined efforts with countries and multilateral development
    partners to ensure that individuals have access to quality education and training
    opportunities and that employers can find the skills they need to operate. Several
    means have been used toward this end, including funding operations, convening
    policy dialogue, providing technical assistance, and conducting research and
    analysis.
    The Skills Towards Employability and Productivity (STEP) Skills Measurement
    Program is part of the World Bank’s portfolio of analytical products on skills.
    The STEP program consists of two survey instruments that collect information
    on the supply and demand for skills in urban areas: a household survey and
    an employer survey. Because it provides a set of core questionnaires and
    implementation materials, the STEP program not only offers information that
    can be used for country-level policy analysis but also builds comparable country
    databases on skills. STEP has been implemented in waves, the first surveys
    being implemented in seven countries in 2012 (Bolivia, Colombia, Ghana, Lao
    PDR, Ukraine, Vietnam, and the Yunnan Province in China), and the second in
    five countries in 2013 (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kenya, and Macedonia
    FYR). The data presented in this publication correspond to these countries.
                                                                                        9




A third wave is currently under implementation in Serbia, Kosovo, Libya, and the
Philippines.
Information gathered by the STEP program makes possible a multitude of
approaches to analysis. This publication, the first in a series, looks at the
STEP household survey data through the lenses of educational attainment. It
illustrates the similarities and differences among groups that have completed
different education levels on a wide range of issues and outcomes. The second
in the series will focus on gender.
This publication is organized as follows. Section 1 analyzes the trajectory of skills
acquisition: participation in early childhood education programs, educational
attainment by gender, and participation in training and apprenticeship
programs. Section 2 explores background conditions associated with educational
attainment, including the socioeconomic status of survey respondents at age
15, the educational attainment of their parents, their households’ asset levels,
their health (as expressed by the presence of chronic illness), and their overall
satisfaction with life. Sections 3 to 5 look at skill levels as reported by survey
respondents. Section 3 covers cognitive skills: writing, numeracy, and reading
(which is also evaluated through a direct reading assessment). Section 4
covers job-relevant skills, which are task-specific and which respondents
possess or use on the job; and Section 5 covers socio-emotional skills, using
established metrics to measure personality and behavior. Finally, Section 6
covers the status of survey respondents in the labor market: whether they are
employed, unemployed, or inactive. For the employed, this section also includes
information on respondents’ opinions regarding the usefulness of their studies
in their current job as well as information about those who own a business.

     Each section opens with a brief explanation of relevant concepts and
     methodological details (gathered from the survey itself and the STEP
     methodology note available at the World Bank’s STEP website under the title
     “STEP Skills Measurement Surveys: Innovative Tools for Assessing Skills.”). It
     includes a set of figures that zoom in on the relevant characteristics for two age
     groups: All adults, which comprises individuals between ages 15 and 64, and
     Youth, which comprises ages 15 to 24. Each sub-section includes one figure that
     allows for a quick cross-country comparison, and a set of figures that present
     data by education level for each of the 12 countries that have completed the
     STEP Household Survey. All figures have passed a minimum threshold in terms
     of number of observations, and all are based on weighted data that represent
     the features of the population in urban areas. For those interested in exploring
     the data further, this publication is accompanied by: (1) an annex with select
     data, and (2) two datasets with approximately 50 variables segmented by both
     educational attainment and reading proficiency. These datasets are available at:

     skills-labor-market-outcomes-results-large-scale-adult-skills-surveys-urban-
     areas-12-countries
     This publication is an effort to present unique and diverse data about people with
     different educational levels that can be used by those interested in education
     and skills development analysis and policy making. More importantly, it is an
     invitation to use the rich datasets collected by STEP and available at the World
     Bank Group’s STEP Skills Measurement website:

     This section presents information on the trajectory of skills acquisition among
     survey respondents. It includes data on whether respondents participated in
     any form of early childhood education, their educational attainment in general
     and by gender, and their participation in training and apprenticeship programs.
     This information is gathered from Module 2 (“Education”) of the STEP Household
     Survey. When reading the figures and data, it is important to consider the
     following:
      •	 Participation in early childhood education: This category refers to survey
         respondents’ participation in some form of organized educational activity
         before entering primary school. The figures below show respondents’
         answers to the question: “Before age 7, did you attend a… [kindergarten,
         creche, daycare, nursery school, Montessori]?” This is the first question in
         Module 2, and its wording was tailored to the levels and names used in each
         country.
      •	 Educational attainment: In order to measure educational attainment
         as accurately as possible, the survey was separately adapted to fit the
         education system of each country. Answers to question 8 in Module 2 --
         “What is the highest grade of formal education that you have completed?”
         -- are mapped onto the International Standard Classification of Education
         1997 (ISCED 1997) for the purpose of enabling international comparisons.
         Based on this classification, the data presented here are grouped under
         four categories: (1) Primary education or less (ISCED 0 and 1); (2) Lower
         secondary education (ISCED 2); (3) Upper secondary education (ISCED
         3); and (4) Tertiary education (ISCED 4 to 6). Please note that, similar to
         the figures for all adults, figures for youth show only the highest grade
         completed, irrespective of whether the individual is currently enrolled in a
         formal education program or not.
      •	 Participation in training: The data on educational level provide an indication
         of the knowledge and skills of individuals, but they do not recognize the life-
         long nature of the skills acquisition process. To gain a better understanding
                                                                                      15




  of each country’s human capital, the STEP survey includes information
  on respondents’ diplomas, non-formal qualifications, and participation in
  training activities. The figures in this section focus on training and show
  respondents’ answers to question 36 in Module 2: “In the past 12 months,
  have you participated in any training courses, such as work-related training
  or private skills training, that lasted at least 5 days/30 hours (not part of the
  formal educational system)?”
•	 Participation in apprenticeships: Since on-the-job training activities
   are an important component of an individual’s skills-acquisition history,
   this section includes information on whether respondents participated
   in apprenticeships. More specifically, the figures in this section illustrate
   respondents’ answers to question 38 in Module 2: “Have you ever completed
   an apprenticeship -- that is, training for a trade in a work setting under the
   guidance of someone who is experienced in this kind of work?” (Further
   information about the nature of apprenticeships, including definitions of
   uncertified/informal and certified/formal, is available at the World Bank’s
   STEP website.)

     The process of skills acquisition is inevitably influenced by the economic and
     social context of individuals. This section explores some background conditions
     that could have an impact on the educational attainment of respondents. These
     include the educational attainment of their parents, their own socioeconomic
     status when they were school-age, and whether their status was affected by
     any negative shock. This section also presents the current characteristics of
     respondents associated with educational attainment, such as their health, their
     households’ asset index, and their overall satisfaction with their lives. Following
     are some details about the information that each of these variables presents:
      •	 Educational attainment of parents: It is well known that the educational
         attainment of parents is correlated not only with their children’s educational
         attainment but also with their children’s participation in the labor force. In
         Module 7 (“Language and Family”), the STEP household survey asks two
         questions in this regard: (1) “What is the highest education level your
         mother obtained?” (question 15), and (2) “What is the highest education
         level your father obtained?” (question 18). As in the previous section, here
         the information is grouped under four categories using the classification of
         ISCED (1997): (1) Primary education or less (ISCED 0 and 1), (2) Lower
         secondary education (ISCED 2), (3) Upper secondary education (ISCED 3),
         and (4) Tertiary education (ISCED 4 to 6).
      •	 Socioeconomic status at age 15: The STEP household survey asks
         respondents to “Imagine a 10-step stairs where on the bottom, the FIRST
         step, stand the poorest people, and on the highest step, the TENTH, stand
         the richest. On which step do you think your family was when you were 15
         years old?” (question 24 of Module 7 – “Language and Family”). The figures
         in this section present the answers to this question classified in three
         groups: low (levels 1 to 3), medium (levels 4 to 6), and high (levels 7 to 10).
      •	 Household shocks: In question 25 of Module 7 (“Language and Family”),
         respondents are asked whether, before they reached age 15, their
         household’s financial situation had been significantly worsened by shocks
                                                                                     35




  such as the death, illness, or serious accident of a household member; a family
  breakup/separation/divorce; alcohol or drug problems; loss of employment,
  bankruptcy or loss of a family business; loss of crops, fire/drought/flood or
  other natural catastrophe; violence/theft; forced displacement; or others.
  Although the data allow specifying the type of shock faced by the household,
  the figures in this section show the data grouped by the number of shocks
  selected by the respondent.
•	 Chronic illness: Physical condition affects an individual’s ability to learn
   and work. The STEP household survey devotes the entirety of Module 3
   (“Health”) to gather indicators on this topic, including height, weight, health
   status, and health insurance coverage. The figures in this section show
   respondents’ answers to question 5 in this module: “Do you suffer from a
   chronic illness? (for example, diabetes, asthma, cancer, heart disease, high
   blood pressure, hepatitis)?” Further data on this topic can be found at the
   World Bank’s STEP website.
•	 Household Asset Index: In Module 1 (“Household Level Information”), the
   STEP household survey collects information on dwelling characteristics and
   household assets in order to construct an asset index to be used as a proxy
   for wealth. The asset index was created on a country-by-country basis to
   reflect the underlying measures of welfare more accurately. Generated
   using factor analysis over a set of indicator variables for the different types
   of non-income related assets and dwelling characteristics, it allows the
   grouping of households into three levels: low, medium, and high. (For more
   details on the construction of the Household Asset Index, consult the STEP
   methodology note available at the World Bank’s STEP website.)
•	 Overall satisfaction with life: The first question in Module 3 (“Health”) in
   the STEP household survey asks respondents to identify their general level
   of satisfaction with their lives at present, using a scale from 1 to 10, where
   1 corresponds with “completely dissatisfied” and 10 with “completely
   satisfied.”

     The STEP household survey gathers unique data on cognitive skills, defined as
     the “ability to understand complex ideas, to adapt effectively to the environment,
     to learn from experience, to engage in various forms of reasoning, to overcome
     obstacles by taking thought.”1 The STEP household survey provides an indirect
     measurement of the use of reading, writing, and numeracy skills in daily life and
     at work. It also provides a direct measurement of reading proficiency.

     Indirect Measurement
     In Module 5 (“Work Skills”), Part A (“Self-reported Literacy/Numeracy”), the
     STEP household survey asks respondents to report on their use of those
     cognitive skills, in and out of their jobs, that consist of reading, writing, or using
     mathematics. For each skill, a score ranging from 0 to 3 is computed to reflect the
     intensity or complexity of use as illustrated in the tables below. The aggregation
     process and reliability testing are described in the STEP Methodology Note
     (available at the World Bank’s STEP website).

Direct Measurement
In addition to self-reported data, this section includes the results of a direct
literacy assessment designed by the Educational Testing Services (ETS). This
assessment has three parts:
 •	 Basic Reading Assessment, Section A, which evaluates foundational
    reading skills, including word meaning, sentence processing and passage
    comprehension.
 •	 Basic Reading Assessment, Section B, which consists of a core literacy
    assessment with eight items that sorts the least literate from those with
    higher reading skill levels. Respondents with three or more correct responses
    are regarded as having met a minimum reading literacy threshold.
 •	 Extended Reading Assessment, using exercise booklets, which is only
    administered to respondents who have passed the Basic Reading
    Assessment (Sections A and B). This assessment evaluates reading
    proficiency in more depth using a variety of materials, focusing on non-
    school-based items encountered in daily life. It involves tasks that require
    respondents to access and identify information, to integrate and interpret
    information, and to evaluate information by assessing the relevance,
    credibility, or appropriateness of the material.
The figure below outlines the structure of this direct literacy assessment:
58




     Figures in this section show the results of the Extended Reading Assessment
     (that is, the results from the exercise booklets), which was conducted in eight
     of the 12 countries where the survey was implemented and finalized. Results
     from the STEP literacy assessment are presented in a proficiency scale ranging
     from 0 to 500, with tasks at the lower end of the scale being easier than those
     at the higher end. These results, centered on the reading skills of adults in
     the developing world, are comparable with those of adults in OECD countries,
     because the assessment used as its basis the Program for the International
     Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIACC), the International Adult Literacy
     Survey, and the Adult Literacy and Life Skills Survey. The scale is divided into six
     levels of proficiency that explain literacy knowledge and skills as follows:
      Literacy Level 0                                                                                  0 to 175
     The tasks require the respondent to read brief texts on familiar topics to locate a single piece of specific
     information. Only basic vocabulary knowledge is required, and the reader is not required to understand
     the structure of sentences or paragraphs or make use of other text features. There is seldom any com-
     peting information in the text and the requested information is identical in form to information in the
     question or directive. While the texts can be continuous, the information can be located as if the text were
     non-continuous. Tasks below Level 1 do not make use of any features specific to digital texts.

      Literacy Level 1                                                                               176 to 225
     Most tasks require the respondent to read relatively short digital or print continuous, non-continuous or
     mixed texts to locate a single piece of information which is identical to or synonymous with the informa-
     tion given in the question. Some tasks may require the respondent to enter personal information into a
     document, in the case of some non-continuous texts. Little, if any, competing information is present.
     Some tasks may require simple cycling through more than one piece of information. Knowledge and skill
     in recognizing basic vocabulary, evaluating the meaning of sentences, and reading of paragraph text is
     expected.

      Literacy Level 2                                                                               226 to 275
     The complexity of text increases. Texts (digital or printed) may comprise continuous, non-continuous or
     mixed types. Tasks in this level require respondents to make matches between the text and information,
     and may require paraphrase or low-level inferences. Some competing pieces of information may be pres-
     ent. Some tasks require the respondent to (i) cycle through or integrate two or more pieces of informa-
     tion based on criteria, (ii) compare and contrast or reason about information requested in the question,
     or (iii) navigate within digital texts to access and identify information from various parts of a document.
                                                                                                                                  59




Literacy Level 3                                                                                                  276 to 325
Texts are often dense or lengthy, including continuous, non-continuous, mixed or multiple pages. Un-
derstanding text and rhetorical structures becomes more central to successfully completing tasks,
especially in navigation of complex digital texts. Tasks require the respondent to identify, interpret or
evaluate one or more pieces of information and often require varying levels of inference. Many require
the respondent construct meaning across larger chunks of text or perform multistep operations in order
to formulate responses. Often tasks also demand that the respondent disregard irrelevant text content
to answer accurately. Competing information is often present, but it is not more prominent than the
correct information.

Literacy Level 4                                                                                                  326 to 375
Tasks at this level often require respondents to perform multiple-step operations to integrate, interpret,
or synthesize information from complex or lengthy continuous, non-continuous, mixed, or multiple type
texts. Complex inferences and application of background knowledge may be needed to perform success-
fully. Many tasks require identifying and understanding one or more specific, non-central ideas in the
text in order to interpret or evaluate subtle evidence claims or persuasive discourse relationships. Con-
ditional information is frequently present in tasks at this level and must be taken into consideration by
the respondent. Competing information is present and sometimes seemingly as prominent as correct
information.

Literacy Level 5                                                                                                  376 to 500
At this level, tasks may require the respondent to search for and integrate information across multi-
ple, dense texts; construct syntheses of similar and contrasting ideas or points of view; or evaluate ev-
idence-based arguments. Application and evaluation of logical and conceptual models of ideas may be
required to accomplish tasks. Evaluating reliability of evidentiary sources and selecting key information
is frequently a key requirement. Tasks often require respondents to be aware of subtle, rhetorical cues
and to make high-level inferences or use specialized background knowledge.

     Job-relevant skills are task-related and build on a combination of cognitive and
     socio-emotional skills. In Module 5 (“Work Skills”), Part B (“Skills at Work”), the
     STEP household survey asks respondents about their use of such skills on the
     job, including, among others, thinking and learning, computer use, supervision,
     contact with clients, and lifting heavy items.
     For each skill, a score ranging from 0 to 3 is computed. When a respondent
     reports not using a given skill, the score is set at 0. For respondents who do use
     a given skill, intensity or complexity of use is defined (1 for low, 2 for medium,
     and 3 for high). The STEP Methodology Note provides more information on the
     selection of this particular set of skills and on the way they are assessed in
     the STEP household survey. Below are some examples of skills and associated
     scales:

     Thinking and learning - Average of two items:
      Item 1. “Some tasks are pretty easy and can be done right away or after getting a little help
      from others. Other tasks require more thinking to figure out how they should be done. As part
      of this work, how often do you have to undertake tasks that require at least 30 minutes of
      thinking?”
                                                                                   Intensity of Use                               Level

      Item 2. “How often does (did) this work involve learning new things?”
      Rarely                                                                       Does not use                                   0

 kilos]? Yes/No
 Item 2. Using any number from 1 to 10 where 1 is not at all physically demanding (such as sitting at a
 desk answering a telephone) and 10 is extremely physically demanding (such as carrying heavy loads,
 construction worker, etc), what number would you use to rate how physically demanding your work is?

      One of the unique and valuable features of the STEP household survey is its
      inclusion of a series of questions to measure socio-emotional skills. This is done
      in Module 6 (“Personality, Behavior and Preferences”). These skills, also referred
      to as soft or non-cognitive skills, relate to traits covering multiple domains—
      social, emotional, personality, behavioral, and attitudinal among them. The
      survey builds on the “Big Five” personality traits: openness, conscientiousness,
      extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism (or its opposite, emotional
      stability). Measures of grit, which has been shown to have an impact in life
      outcomes, and of hostile attribution bias are also included, as well as questions
      pertaining to how individuals make important decisions. Information on socio-
      emotional skills is gathered through the 24 questions shown in the table below:
      The responses to these questions are scored. For positively scored items, a
      score of 4 signifies “almost always,” 3 signifies “most of the time,” 2 signifies
      “some of the time,” and 1 signifies “almost never.” For negatively scored items
      (mainly in “Emotional Stability” and “Hostility Bias”) the scoring is the inverse:
      a score of 4 is assigned for “almost never” and a score of 1 for “almost always”.
      The scores assigned to each question are averages to reach a single score for
      each of the eight factors. Figures in this section show the average score of
      all respondents in each country for each factor, as well as average scores by
      educational attainment.

      Without a doubt, the benefits of education and training fall far beyond the
      ability of an individual to join the world of work. This publication has presented
      information on diverse aspects that can be affected by –-or have an impact
      on—the educational level of individuals, such as their satisfaction with life, their
      health, and their use of cognitive skills, among many others. It is also true that
      the knowledge and skills that individuals gather throughout their education and
      training experiences have an important effect in their ability to find employment,
      create their own firms, and increase their incomes. This final section explores the
      labor market performance of survey respondents: whether they are employed,
      unemployed, or inactive. For those who report having worked at least one hour
      in the week prior to the survey, this section also includes information on their
      opinions regarding the usefulness of their studies for the exercise of their main
      occupation as well as information about those who own a business. Below are
      some details to guide the reading of figures and data in this section:
       •	 Employment status: The STEP household survey devotes Module 4
          (“Employment”), to look at the employment information of respondents. It
          begins by identifying those who are currently employed, that is, those who,
          during the seven days prior to the survey, have worked for at least an hour…
          … for wage or salary in cash or in kind for someone who is not a member of
          their household
          … on a farm owned or rented by themselves or a member of their household
          cultivating crops, caring for livestock, or in farm maintenance tasks
          … for profit or family gain, in cash or in kind, on their own account, in their
          business or a business that belongs to someone in their household.
          Those who have not worked during the seven days prior to the survey
          but have a long-term job from which they are temporarily absent are also
          considered employed.
                                                                                                                                      145




  •	 Type of employment: Using the above description of employed respondents,
     as well as direct questions regarding their type of employment, the survey
     also allows for the classification of this group into four categories: unpaid
     family worker, wage worker, self-employed, and employer.
  •	 Type of occupation: The STEP household survey inquires about respondents’
     main occupations in Module 4 (“Employment”), Part C (“Main Job in Past
     Week”). Each answer is assigned a code and later grouped using ILO’s
     International Standard Classification of Occupations. For a quick reference,
     each category comprises:
 Military personnel                                  Commissioned, non-commissioned, and other officer

      •	 Inactive: The figures below show the proportion of working-age adults who
         stated that they were not looking for a job or trying to start a business during
         the four weeks prior to the survey. This information is gathered through
         several subsequent questions in Module 4 (“Employment”), Part A (“Labor
         Force Participation”). The figures in this section also show the proportion
         of those who are currently inactive and not participating in education or
         training activities, which provides a glimpse of the NEET phenomenon in
         the countries where the survey has been completed. There can be several
         underlying reasons for respondents’ decision not to participate in the labor
         market, and this module explores them. Some examples that the STEP
         household survey gathers data on include the proportion of respondents
         who are inactive because of health conditions, unwillingness to work, and
         negative perceptions of the labor market (see data available at the World
         Bank’s STEP website).
      •	 Individuals’ perception of own qualifications: The figures in this section
         illustrate respondents’ perception of the relevance of their education and
         qualifications, regardless of their type of employment (employer, self-
         employed, wage worker, or unpaid family worker). More specifically, the
         figures show the answers to the following questions from Module 5 (“Work
         Skills”), Part B (“Skills at Work”): “How useful were your studies during your
         formal education for this work?” (question 23, referring to the respondent’s
         main occupation) and “What minimum level of formal education do you
         think would be required before someone would be able to carry out this
         work?” (question 24, which matches the answer with the highest grade of
         formal education completed by the respondent)
      •	 Self-employed: Module 4 (“Employment”), Part C (“Main Job in Past Week”)
         of the STEP household survey gathers a range of data on self-employed
         individuals which, as shown in the figures below, includes information
         on their status, reflected in the proportion of them who work with paid
         employees – question 8, the size of their enterprises (in terms of the number
                                                                              147




of employees – also question 8), and their perceived success (expressed in
their stated intention to expand their businesses – question 10). (Further
information on, for example, the net profits, the constraints to expansion,
or the work history of entrepreneurs / business owners, can be found at the
World Bank’s STEP website.)

      Appendix 1 – Country Sample Sizes
      The following table shows the sample sizes for each country where the STEP
      Skills Measurement household survey has been completed as of 2015, in total
      and separated by gender. The data for Bolivia, Colombia, Ghana, Lao PDR, Ukraine,
      Vietnam, and the Yunnan Province (China) in China were gathered in 2013; the
      data for Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kenya and Macedonia FYR were gathered
      in 2014. All data used to build the figures in this publication were weighted to
      represent the features of the population in urban areas.

      Appendix 2 – Population Size, Growth Rate and Age Distribution
      The STEP Skills Measurement initiative uses core questionnaires, applies
      standard implementation materials and protocols, and takes deliberate
      measures to ensure that data are comparable across countries. However, each
      country’s unique conditions must be taken into consideration when looking at
      the figures in this publication. As the data are presented for two age groups,
      in order to facilitate figure reading and interpretation below is a table with
      population data from the United Nations’ Population Division.
