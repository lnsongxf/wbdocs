     FOREWORD
     Access to clean, modern energy is a cornerstone of growth and human development, leading to better education and health, more jobs and safer
     communities. Knowing these benefits makes it all the more urgent to accelerate our efforts to reach the 1.1 billion people who still live without
     electricity and the 3 billion without access to clean cooking. We need more than $1 trillion in annual investments by 2030 to reach those goals.

     Clearly we cannot get there alone.

     Development organizations, governments and the private sector each have a crucial role to play in this endeavor. It is in each country’s hands to
     provide the right set of policies and regulations to attract private investments in the energy sector. But what supporting policy frameworks are
     needed to ensure there is sufficient financing for sustainable energy and that investors’ concerns are kept in check and their returns are adequate?
     And where can investors find comprehensive/in-depth information about policies and regulations that create the right investment climate for
     sustainable energy?

     RISE sets out to provide just that. It is a global scorecard with an exhaustive set of indicators that rank national policy and regulatory frameworks for
     sustainable energy. It offers a critical, objective overview of what is happening in 111 countries, allowing policymakers and investors to benchmark
     progress across countries through its databases that provide access to a treasure trove of primary policy and regulatory information at the national
     level.

     The good news is that many countries are already committed to the sustainable energy agenda and have put in place the fundamental measures
     needed to reach those goals. These range from plans that chart the path to universal electricity access, to laws that enable scaling up energy
     efficiency and renewable energy. Still, much more is needed to translate these commitments into robust policy frameworks, particularly in lower
     income countries.

     The data in RISE highlights the strong progress and broad uptake in advancing renewables policy across many countries, but also notes that critical
     areas—such as grid integration—need strengthening. RISE puts a spotlight on the untapped opportunities for energy efficiency and suggests an
     important role for utilities in meeting efficiency as well as access objectives.

     By regularly taking stock of where we are through its two-yearly updates, RISE also helps leaders to stay on track for a clean energy transition that
     offers growth and job-rich development.

     It is our hope that leaders will use and learn from the data in this report and focus their efforts on where action is needed most to extend affordable,
     reliable, sustainable and modern energy to people who need it most. With greater action and determination, we can go further and faster towards a
     better world—for all.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The Regulatory Indicators for Sustainable Energy (RISE) project is a collaboration between the Global Energy and Extractives Practice and the
Development Economics Global Indicators Group of the World Bank Group. It benefited from the support and guidance of Senior Director
Riccardo Puliti and (former) Directors Anita Marangoly George and Charles Feinstein (Energy & Extractives) and Director Augusto Lopez-Claros
(Development Economics).

RISE was managed by a core team led by Sudeshna Ghosh Banerjee and comprising Alejandro Moreno, Jonathan Sinton, Tanya Primiani, and
Joonkyung Seong. Specifically, the work was coordinated by the following staff and consultants:

Energy access: Sudeshna Ghosh Banerjee, Juliette Besnard, with support from Doug Barnes.

Energy efficiency: Jonathan Sinton, Daron Bedrosyan, with support from Therese Murphy and Lisa Ryan.

Renewable energy: Alejandro Moreno, Yao Zhao, with support from Adam Brown.

Cross-cutting data (carbon pricing and utility performance): Joonkyung Seong, Mallory LeeWong, Samantha Witte, with support from
Taylor Sloane.

Administrative procedures: Tanya Primiani, Jayashree Srinivasan, Julia Heckmann, and John Rennie.

The core team also received valuable support from Fernando Anaya, Andres Baquero, Slavena Georgieva, and Melissa Taylor at various
stages of the project.

The team would especially like to acknowledge the advice and leadership of Vivien Foster, Rohit Khanna, Gevorg Sargsyan, Wendy Hughes,
and Melissa Johns. The team is grateful for the constructive feedback provided by the peer reviewers Pierre Audinet, Malcolm Cosgrove-
Davies, Marianne Fay, Adrian Gonzalez, Ashok Sarkar, Rita Ramalho, and Stratos Tavoulareas. Many World Bank colleagues and external
partners provided formal and informal guidance throughout its development. The full list of internal and external advisors is in appendix 5.
The team would also like to express its gratitude to the staff of World Bank’s Energy and Extractives practice, which contributed to validating

Box 1.1 Calculating indicator scores: three examples
For most RISE indicators, a country’s score is the simple average of the score of each component subindicator, and the score of each
subindicator is the average of its component questions.

Example 1: Energy access, Indicator 1: Malawi. Malawi has an officially approved electrification plan, last updated in 2013, that
specifies a time frame for electrification. The plan is not publicly available. Malawi scores 80 on this indicator, in the green zone,
calculated as follows:

 Subindicator 2. Public availability of electrification plan                                                                      0

 Indicator score = 80                                                                                                             400/500 = 80%

Other indicators include subindicators with multiple questions, or the same question asked across multiple sectors: for example, RISE
investigates whether there are energy efficiency requirements and incentives for utilities in generation (Gen.), T&D, and demand-side
management (DSM), and assesses the presence of seven different possible mechanisms to help them recover costs. In some cases—
like subindicator 19 below—the score for each question is the average for each sector and question; in others, like subindicator 20, a
certain threshold number of mechanisms must be in place to receive a full score (in this case, three); fewer than three mechanisms
receive a partial score, while no mechanisms results in a score of 0.

Example 2: Energy efficiency, Indicator 7: Kenya. Kenya has set a requirement for the national distribution company, Kenya Power,
to reduce technical losses and carry out DSM activities, with progress tracked by the Energy Regulatory Commission. Some of
the program’s costs are passed through to customers’ electricity bills. Kenya scores 58 on this indicator, in the yellow zone,
calculated as follows:

        Box 1.1 Calculating indicator scores: three examples (continued)
        Other indicators include questions that only apply in specific cases. For example, certain attributes of renewable energy policies are only
        relevant to some types of policies: regulations that modify tariff levels over time to account for technology cost reductions only make
        sense if tariffs are set by mandate in the first place; and provisions to discourage unrealistically low bids are only relevant if competitive
        bidding exists. In these cases, attributes only relevant to policies not present in a country are recorded as not applicable and do not affect
        the score. For attributes that may apply to multiple incentives or programs, a country receives a yes if it is a feature of any of them.

        Example 3: Renewable energy, Indicator 4: Uganda: Uganda has a feed-in tariff program for renewable energy projects under 20 MW, and
        has held competitive tenders for solar power. Project developers are required to meet specific timelines and the tariff is denominated in U.S.
        dollars. The level of the feed-in tariff is adjusted over time, and auctions include pre-qualification requirements. The cost of the program is not,
        however, passed on to the consumer in the retail tariffs. Uganda scores 67 on this indicator, in the green zone, calculated as follows:

Box 1.2 Retail price of electricity
Retail price of electricity is an important driver of investment in each type of sustainable energy, while not part of the RISE score.
The level of the retail price relates differently to each of the RISE pillars. While higher electricity prices incentivize customers to
seek energy efficiency measures, lower prices with cross-subsidization allow for better expansion of services into new areas. By
contrast, renewable energy investors will look toward wholesale or contract prices granted by offtakers, rather than retail prices.
Given the complexity of the relationship between retail electricity prices and investments in energy access, renewable energy,
and energy efficiency, this indicator is presented separately for information purposes.

Methodology
Calculating the average level of retail prices is based on total revenue from sales of electricity and amount of electricity sold from
the selected utility, which is the utility offering power distribution and retail services to the largest amount of customers in the
largest business city metropolitan area.

The average retail electricity tariff across all customer classes is calculated as:
    revenue from sales of electricity to end-users (US$)
    amount of electricity consumed by end-users (kWh)

The retail electricity tariff for residential, commercial and industrial customer classes is calculated as:
  revenue from sales of electricity to end-users within given customer class (US$)
  amount of electricity consumed by end-users within given customer class (kWh)


The actual average retail price can be determined regardless of the structure of tariff schedules or different consumption profile
by customer. But this methodology may not be able to capture sales tax and other levies if they are accounted separately from
revenue. In a liberalized market where utilities can offer different prices, this estimate from the selected utility may not represent
the entire market.

        Box 1.3 Definitions of rate structures
        Electricity rate structure

        Flat fee: Flat rate to gain access to electricity, independent of the amount of electricity consumed. The fee may vary by customer type,
        such as sector or size.

        Constant (uniform) block rate: Single rate per kWh consumed, regardless of amount consumed.

        Declining block rate: Progressively lower rates per kWh as consumption increases above thresholds or blocks, such as 1–250 kWh,
        250–500 kWh.

        Increasing block rate: Progressively higher rate per kWh as consumption rises above thresholds or blocks. May be used to incentivize
        conservation by customers.

        Demand charges (large customers)

        Demand charge: Billed as a fixed rate per kilowatt of peak demand during a billing cycle, regardless of when the peak demand occurred.

        Reactive power charge: In addition to net consumption, loads (like electric motors) in AC power circuits require reactive power (kVAr),
        which is absorbed and returned. Reactive power is higher for customers with a higher power factor, typically from less efficient motors
        and transformers. Charges are levied as for demand charges, but per kVAr, the unit of measurement of reactive power.

        Time-of-use tariffs

        Real-time pricing: Tariff linked to the hourly market price for electricity. Customers are made aware of hourly prices on either a
        day-ahead or hour-ahead basis, providing the incentive to reduce consumption at the most expensive times.

        Critical peak pricing: Customers are given advance notice that they will pay higher prices during days when wholesale prices are the
        highest or when the power grid is severely stressed, typically up to 15 days per year during the season(s) of the system peak.

        Variable peak pricing: Similar to critical peak pricing, with the exception that the window of critical peak hours is not fixed. The specific
        hours of the event are provided to participants at the same time that they are notified of the upcoming critical peak event (typically one
        day in advance).

        Seasonal rates

        These vary by time of year but not by time of day. This provides a greater incentive for load shifting according to seasonal consumption
        patterns.

        Peak-time rebates: Peak-time rebates are rates that vary according to the time of day, or rebates that typically are offered as an alternative
        to critical peak pricing. Rather than charging a higher rate during critical peak events, participants are paid for load reductions.

     Alongside mandatory (and occasionally
     voluntary) standards, energy labels are
     complementary tools that ensure market
     players have appropriate information for
     decision-making. Requiring energy labels
     has proven to have substantial behavioral
     effects with respect to manufacturing and
     purchasing energy-intensive products. This
     indicator measures whether energy labels
     are applied to each key product category
     and whether these labels are mandatory or
     voluntary. Mandatory labeling systems are
     the most effective means of incentivizing
     market suppliers to meet energy efficiency
     standards. Similar to the energy perfor-
     mance standards indicator, the original
     source of the labeling system—external or
     domestic—is tracked but not scored.

Box 1.4 Fossil fuel subsidy for power generation
Subsidies for fossil fuels can undermine the competitiveness of renewables. If the primary fuel source of the country is subsidized,
it artificially lowers the cost of service for both the utilities and consumers. This can make any clean energy investment in either
renewable energy or energy efficiency less competitive, and can make it harder to mobilize finance.

Fossil fuel subsidies are prevalent, estimated at about US$600 billion annually and concentrated in a handful of countries. Particularly
problematic, and all too common, are universal price subsidies that distort market signals, drain government budgets, encourage
wasteful energy consumption, disproportionately benefit the better off. These subsidies encourage firms to overproduce and




                                                                                                                                                        METHODOLOGY
consumers to use more fossil fuels, with heavy environmental implications.

In the RISE pilot, it was attempted to present countries that provide subsidy to fossil fuel consumed for electricity production by
indicating the proportion of electricity that is generated by subsidized fossil fuel regardless of the magnitude of subsidy provided. In the
RISE global rollout, data was collected to estimate the scale of fossil fuel subsidy for the power sector, i.e., electricity generation.

Methodology
The equation below shows that the difference between the adjusted reference unit price and the local price paid is multiplied by
the total units of the fuel consumed locally to obtain the price gap:
   Price gap = (adjusted reference unit price – local unit price) x (units consumed).

The price gap value does not reflect all subsidies for power generation. It measures only economic input subsidies provided
to lower the price of fossil fuels used for power generation. A positive price gap value represents the situation where the local
fuel price is less than the traded price on competitive international markets. This gap is seen as an economic loss that would
otherwise not have occurred in an efficiently operating market. It can be caused by some forms of government intervention, such
as a budget or off-budget subsidy, cross-subsidy, price ceiling, or export or import restriction. However, the price gap approach
would be unlikely to capture other forms of government intervention such as tax credit, direct revenue support, below-market
provision of loans, loan guarantees, or grants for energy-related activities.

   Box 1.5 Affordability of renewable energy
   One important attribute of any renewable energy incentive or support scheme that RISE does not score is the price or level the
   incentive is set. While price may play a larger role than any other attribute in determining if an incentive attracts investment and meets
   its objectives, the appropriate price of a given incentive depends on individual characteristics of a country and the specific objectives
   of the incentive itself. Even for the same technology in the same country, an incentive targeted on smaller projects may need to be set
   higher than one focused on larger projects that enjoy greater economies of scale.

   While setting incentives higher may attract more investment, policymakers must pay attention to long-term budget implications. If
   incentives are too expensive, they may represent poor use of resources and—critical to investors—may not be sustainable over the
   projected lifetime of the policy or program. When this happens, incentives can be reversed retrospectively, denying projects future
   subsidies that previously had been guaranteed.

   The RISE pilot attempted to account for the downside of excessively high incentive levels by calculating the subsidy implied by each
   incentive (the difference between the price received by renewable energy generators and the wholesale price of conventional fossil
   fuels) and comparing it with the country’s per capita income. In the RISE global rollout, reliable data could not be collected to estimate
   a subsidy level in all countries, but it was deemed important to display incentive levels where possible to compare them with a
   relevant benchmark.

   Thus RISE has compared the prices of each feed-in tariffa and the winning bids of each competitive tender with the levelized cost of
   energy (LCOE) for that technology in the country, as estimated by the IRENA. The results for wind and solar projects are displayed in
   the box figure in box 4.4 of chapter 4; all incentive prices are available on the RISE website (rise.worldbank.org). The comparison is for
   informational purposes only, as prices that fall outside the LCOE range are not necessarily too high or too low. In particular, the IRENA
   LCOE estimates are based on costs reported by actual projects in the same geographic region; however, as certain regions have very
   few projects, they should be interpreted as estimates only. For more information on the IRENA cost calculation program,
   see www.irena.org.

   a When feed-in tariff levels differ by project size, RISE uses the level offered to the largest plants.

        Box 2.1 Long-term supporting policies boost electrification: South Africa
        Through robust electrification planning and dedicated supporting mechanisms, South Africa’s electrification rate has risen from 34 percent in
        1994 to 76 percent in 2014. Since 2002, electrification has been carried out through the Integrated National Electrification Programme.

        The government approved the New Household Electrification Strategy in 2013, with the aim of supplying electricity to all households
        by 2025. Through policy guidelines, the Department of Energy provides directives on implementation for certain customer groups,
        including isolated regions, informal settlements, schools and clinics, and farm dwellings, prioritizing grid electrification, which accounts
        for 90 percent of new connections every year, and the rest via off-grid technologies.

        Challenges include rising connection costs as projects go deeper into rural areas, lack of technical skills in municipalities, underuse of
        funds, and minigrid concessionaires’ struggles to find a sustainable business model.

       Box 2.2 Successful minigrid development in the Philippines
       Geographic realities often check the expansion of centralized grids in archipelagic countries. The Philippines has one of the largest
       populations of islanders in the world, and since many households and small businesses are unlikely to be connected to the main grid
       soon, policymakers strongly support off-grid solutions. The country now has about 375 MW of installed capacity in diesel minigrids.
       The main operator is the National Power Cooperation through the Small Power Utility Group, which operates 279 MW of this capacity
       in 221 areas.

       To develop minigrids, the government has built a robust legal framework. A serie of resolutions from the energy regulatory commission
       (notably Resolution No. 15, series of 2013, adopting small grid guidelines) specifies standards for operations and describes the planning
       and operational responsibility for users. The government also established two institutions that issue certificates for minigrid installers: the
       department of energy for the certificate of endorsement and the energy regulatory commission for the certificate of compliance.

       To scale up minigrid development, policymakers adjusted regulations to require distribution utilities and electricity cooperatives to
       outsource power generation to private companies and community initiatives. A competitive bidding process was set up to assign
       15-year concessions. Subsidies also were introduced to cover the difference between generation costs and end-user tariffs.

       Thus far, this minigrid development program has been considered successful, primarily due to technology neutrality that gives more
       generation options for developers, widespread communication programs targeting end-users, and a well-developed financial market.

       Box 2.3 A legal framework as a necessary step to effectively develop minigrids: Tanzania
       Tanzania’s rural electrification investment prospectus estimates that about half the rural population could be served more cost-
       effectively by minigrids and off-grid options than by the centralized grid. Minigrids could provide electricity access to 9.1 million people.
       To realize this potential, the government, supported by stakeholders, has developed an enabling environment cited as an example for
       minigrid development.

       The construction of the minigrid regulatory framework started with the National Energy Policy and the Energy and Water Utilities
       Regulatory Authority Act in 2003, the Rural Energy Act in 2005, and the Electricity Act in 2008. A key feature of all is the role of the
       small power producer, “an entity generating electricity using renewable energy, fossil fuels, a cogeneration technology, or some hybrid
       system combining fuel sources … and either sells the generated power at wholesale to a distribution network operator or sells at retail
       directly to end customers or some combination of the two. A small producer may have an installed capacity greater than 10 MW but
       may only export power outside of its premises not exceeding 10 MW.”a The framework specifies the necessary permits, clearances,
       and procedures for application, standards for interconnections, and a standardized tariff methodology based on utility avoided costs.
       The establishment of Tanzania’s Rural Energy Agency in 2001 has enabled the performance of isolated and connected minigrids to be
       monitored, and funding support mechanisms to be offered for lowering initial connection costs and for financing feasibility studies and
       environmental assessments.

       In practice, despite this comprehensive enabling environment, minigrids primarily are used by faith-based and other nonprofit
       organizations. On the commercial side, only five small power producers are in operation, though a dozen are in preparation. Barriers
       still limit minigrid development (including high interest rates loans from commercial banks, and lack of clarity about ownership of
       land and water rights for these producers). Access to finance for both debt and equity capital remains critical, as minigrid developers
       must demonstrate commercial viability of their system. Human capital and technical capacity are scarce. Market data is virtually
       nonexistent.

        Box 2.4 Initiatives and mechanisms to support the development of stand-alone systems in Pakistan
        The potential for stand-alone system development in Pakistan is tremendous: 35 percent of the population is not connected to the grid,
        and grid-connected areas are struggling with power cuts and supply shortages.

        Under the Roshan Pakistan Program and Parliamentarian Schemes for Rural Electrification, 8,000 villages will be electrified, mainly
        through solar home systems powered by solar PV modules. Other similar initiatives, handled by the Alternative Energy Development
        Board, include the development of off-grid solar applications such as solar street lighting and commercial lighting.

        To support market expansion, stand-alone systems are exempted from import duties, including batteries integrated with solar
        electrification systems, solar air conditioning systems, solar water heaters, and PV modules.

        On the end-user side, some programs subsidize the purchase of these solutions. The provincial government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,
        for example, will pay 90 percent of the cost of the solar equipment with the rest shouldered by households. Banking and microfinance
        institutions provide financing support for operators and consumers.

        Standards and certification programs have not been officially approved in Pakistan. However, to prevent distribution of poor-quality
        off-grid lighting products, Pakistan joined the Lighting Asia program in 2015, which arranges product testing and quality verification for
        interested manufacturers.

  Box 2.5 Lighting Global quality assurance framework: Quality standard for off-grid lighting products
  Quality assurance helps market actors make informed purchasing, investment, and regulatory decisions and ensures that the systems
  delivered to end-users operate effectively and as advertised. Following this approach, Lighting Global is the World Bank Group’s
  initiative supporting commercial development of markets for affordable, quality-assured, off-grid lighting.

  A major dimension is quality assurance of pico-PV products and stand-alone home systems kits. Incorporated into an IEC technical
  specification in 2013, the Lighting Global framework consists of three components: definition of test methods and quality standards;
  testing and verification through independent laboratories; and communication of test results to stakeholders. The test methods assess
  the performance of off-grid products, and the quality standards define requirements for truth in advertising, durability, quality, lumen
  maintenance, battery, performance information, and warranty terms. If test results of a product verify that it meets the minimum qual-
  ity standards, the product is listed on the Lighting Global website and the manufacturer becomes eligible for business support services
  from Lighting Global and associated programs in Africa and Asia.

  In Sub-Saharan Africa, sales of products that have met the program’s minimum quality standards have exceeded 6 million units
  since pilot projects were introduced in 2007. Approved in 2012, the International Development Association’s Electricity Network
  Reinforcement and Expansion Project in Ethiopia is an example of boosting the off-grid lighting market. The project entails a US$20
  million credit line (as a financial intermediary loan) administered by the Development Bank of Ethiopia. Since 2013, the project’s credit

        Box 2.6 Lifeline tariffs: Cross-subsidies make subsistence electricity consumption affordable
        Refining the design of increasing block tariffs, lifeline (or social) tariffs are targeted subsidies that improve the affordability of
        basic electricity needs. Any block above that should be charged at a commercial rate. The definition of a lifeline customer is
        critical, and varies widely depending on countries’ incomes (box table).

        This instrument has limits, however. Cross-subsidies can create distortions and deteriorate the utility’s financial performance.
        Moreover, as seen in countries with high energy subsidies, quantity-based consumption subsidies do not target low-income
        consumers well, since such households do not necessarily have access to the service or are not metered. Thus the reduction
        of cross subsidies, or tariff rationalization, has been the main driver of tariff reforms, with subsidies limited to promoting basic
        consumption and making service access easier. Lifeline tariffs do not systematically mean affordable connection fees, even if
        high connection fees discriminate against low-income households.                                                          (continued)

        Box 3.1 Utility energy efficiency obligations in the EU Energy Efficiency Directive
        EU member states are required to adopt utility energy efficiency obligation (EEO) programs, under which utilities attempt to reach
        an agreed savings target in end-use sectors. The current target aims for yearly savings of 1.5 percent of annual energy sales to final
        consumers. The directive also calls for measurement, independent verification of results, and penalties for noncompliance.

        Countries may be exempted from certain directives if they commit to implementing measures that demonstrate equivalent or better
        savings. Instead of EEOs, member states may establish alternative energy efficiency obligations or voluntary agreements that achieve
        the Directive’s energy savings targets in end-use sectors. Each member state submits the projected savings and milestones according
        to the European Commission’s standard methodology. Austria, the Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden do
        not include any utility energy efficiency initiatives to meet their savings targets, instead focusing on how to achieve savings in end-use
        sectors through policy.a

         Box 3.2 Electricity tariff levels
         Alongside the energy efficiency indicators surveyed by RISE, the levels of retail electricity tariffs paid by consumers are fundamental
         drivers of efficiency behavior. While RISE has collected data on tariffs and retail electricity sales by customer class in each country
         surveyed, prices are surprisingly hard to measure and compare consistently in simple terms. Average retail prices can be difficult to
         characterize, even for one customer class in one jurisdiction, let alone across different customer classes and jurisdictions (including
         national). The incentive value of identical electricity tariff levels in two countries may differ significantly owing to diverse factors, such
         as different per capita incomes, dissimilar levels of underlying demand (for example, due to climatic, geographic, and cultural factors),
         diverse expectations about future price levels, and different costs of other household consumption items or factors of production.

         Prices arise in different economic systems, and depart to varying degrees from ideal practice (long-run marginal cost pricing). In some
         countries, direct or indirect subsidies are important (if not particularly efficient) elements of socioeconomic policy. Even if all electricity
         tariffs were cost-reflective, the underlying unique cost structures in each country would result in different prices, so there is no basis for
         normalizing to an ideal uniform level across countries.

         The RISE team will continue to work to find ways to measure aspects of electricity tariffs that bear on adoption of energy efficiency

         Box 3.3 The factors in Vietnam’s success
         Vietnam scores the highest in the energy efficiency pillar among all developing countries. Its policy progress was driven largely by
         surging economic growth since the 1990s. The Ministry of Energy, the public utility Vietnam Electricity, and large consumers
         collaborated to implement sound incentives for load shedding in response to anticipated supply-demand gaps.

         Vietnam experienced demand growth at over 20 percent per year throughout the 1990s, and 15 percent growth on average in the
         2000s. Vietnam Electricity worked with large industrial and commercial enterprises to introduce a time-of-use tariff to incentivize
         peak load reduction. The utility first introduced a time-of-use tariff in 1998, complementing this with the purchase and installation
         of time-of-use meters for all customers with loads over 50 kVA or consumption in excess of 5,000 kWh per month. With each
         successive five-year plan over the subsequent 15 years, this program was extended to commercial, services, and agricultural
         (irrigation) consumers. The average peak load reduction from this program has been estimated at 70 MW every five years. This
         program has been a success at targeting large consumers—one of the most important end-use focus areas for energy efficiency
         planning.

  Box 3.4 Sweden’s energy-intensive industries program
  Energy efficiency can be effectively implemented through market actors with the right incentives in place. In Sweden, the 2005 Energy
  Efficiency Act has focused on general instruments to create a market for energy efficiency investment rather than mandating actions,
  as many countries have found to be effective (figure 3.18). The program for improving energy efficiency in energy-intensive industries
  (PFE) has proven a good example of a market-oriented energy efficiency policy approach.

  The PFE is a voluntary program for industrial companies that exceed either of these thresholds:

  è	 Energy product expenditures equivalent to at least 3 percent of its production value; or

  è	 Total energy and carbon dioxide tax for the company amounts to at least 0.5 percent of its added value.

  Companies can be exempted from the EU energy tax (an additional tax on industrial process-related electricity consumption) if
  they demonstrate investments in an energy management system. The intent is that companies should improve their electricity use
  efficiency without being subject to taxes that could hurt their international competitiveness. The energy efficiency improvement
  measures taken as a result of the PFE are expected to give the same effect as that of the EU energy tax.

  The PFE is in its third and final five-year plan of participation. Since its inception in 2004, the average payback period on investment for
  each participating company has been under three years, and the PFE has resulted in estimated electricity savings of 1.45 terawatt hours
  (TWh) annually.

  Despite these impressive energy savings, the success of this program lies in its sustainability. Participating companies continue to
  invest in maintaining their energy management systems even after their five-year participation plan ends. Although the PFE is being
  discontinued due to a decision by the European Commission that the present structure breaches EU state subsidy rules, participating

  Box 4.1 Draft laws and regulations
  RISE considers only laws and regulations that have been passed and are in force. Many RISE countries have laws in draft form that
  will alter the landscape for renewable energy development. In India, the proposed Renewable Energy Act under consideration would
  mandate additional activities measured by RISE, including more detailed resource data collection and renewable energy obligation. In
  Morocco, a drafted bill amending and supplementing existing Law 13-09 on renewable energy would allow renewable energy
  generators to sell power directly to high-voltage customers. And in Kenya, the draft energy bill before parliament would reform the
  entire electricity sector and lead to fully competitive markets. In some cases, regulations rather than laws are in draft form: in Zambia,
  draft rules outlining the country’s new renewable energy feed-in tariff program (REFIT), along with a draft generation license and PPA,
  have gone through three stakeholders’ validation workshops and have been disseminated to the private sector to encourage proposals.

  In some countries, draft policies and laws can be under consideration for many years without adoption, sending investors mixed
  signals and creating uncertainty. For example, a renewable energy policy was drafted in 2010 in Eritrea but never passed; Afghanistan
  has been updating its national renewable energy policy every year without full adoption; even the law in Kenya noted above has been
  before parliament since 2008, in one form or another. In Somalia, the country’s first electricity act was drafted in April 2013, but
  remains under discussion by members of parliament.

  While the laws noted here do not count toward this year’s scores, future editions of RISE will capture them as they are enacted, and
  as RISE progresses it will track changes in countries’ legal frameworks. The following are some of the draft laws and regulations under

  Box 4.2 Priority dispatch
  RISE scoring does not distinguish between the 53 countries offering guaranteed take-or-pay provisions and those prioritizing dispatch
  of renewables through other means (such as marginal cost dispatching or curtailment procedures).

  In countries with take-or-pay contracts, the offtaker guarantees to pay for all the electricity that a renewable energy plant can deliver.
  But such contracts can impose a burden on the offtaker or government, particularly for large plants or when renewables reach a large
  portion of the market. For this reason, RISE looks at other ways that the dispatch of renewables can be prioritized even if not fully
  guaranteed.

  For example, some countries follow an economic merit dispatch rule directly linking the dispatch to the marginal or variable (operating)
  cost. Renewable energy fuel typically is low cost or free, so in these cases it usually is dispatched first. In Chile, for instance, the power
  economic dispatch center regulates dispatch into the grid according to the lowest cost and the hourly demand. Similarly, Denmark,
  Finland, and Sweden are integrated into the Nordic electricity wholesale market, which bases dispatch on the principle of marginal
  pricing and supply and demand. Mexico uses a different approach: its renewable energy generators receive a preferential rate for
  power transmission of $0.14 pesos/kWh against $0.30–$0.40 pesos for electricity generated by conventional fuels. Japan uses a
  prioritized curtailment order under which geothermal and hydropower are not subject to any curtailment, and solar and wind are the
  last resources to be curtailed. All these are considered a form of prioritized dispatch for renewables.

  In Australia, all intermittent generation previously was automatically classified as nonscheduled, and thus all intermittent generation
  effectively had dispatch priority over scheduled generation. With the increase of intermittent renewable generation, in 2010 the
  country started implementing semi-dispatch arrangements where intermittent generation is required to participate in central dispatch
  and must comply with dispatch instructions to control output below a dispatch cap, defined as the generating unit’s maximum
  generation limit.

  Box 4.3 Curtailment policies in China
  China has invested more in renewable energy than any other country in the world. Over 2010–15, investment (including solar, wind,
  geothermal, small hydro, and biomass) reached US$377 billion (Bloomberg New Energy Finance), more than the next two countries
  combined, the United States and Germany. But while China’s RISE renewable energy score is quite high—and highest among middle-
  income countries in East Asia—many countries across the world score higher. What explains this discrepancy?

  In part the discrepancy is due to endowments beyond what energy policy can control. China has the second-largest economy in the
  world, with dramatically expanding power demand that creates opportunities for new generation. A large and skilled labor force and
  supply chain allows cost-effective wind turbines or solar plants to be built locally. The government also has taken steps to mobilize
  private investment across the economy.

  Some elements of the policy framework might, if strengthened, lead to even greater utilization of the country’s renewable energy
  resources. Many renewable energy projects have seen lower revenues than expected because of widespread generation curtailment.
  As China does not transparently integrate renewable energy into its generation and transmission planning, the network infrastructure
  is not always adequate to offtake power from renewable energy projects. Thermal power plants enjoy guaranteed utilization hours,
  leading to curtailment of renewables, in particular wind power. And because utilities are not required to provide compensation for any
  form of curtailment, or where the required offtake infrastructure is not built, the risk falls entirely on the project developers. While this
  is not enough to limit all investment, it can lead to greater uncertainty and fewer financially viable projects.

       Box 4.4 Renewable energy prices
       The most important attribute determining whether a renewable energy incentive scheme attracts investment is the level of support it
       provides and the resulting effect on a project’s revenues or costs. Incentive prices or support levels are not calculated as part of RISE
       scores since the appropriate level differs widely among countries based on a range of technical and political considerations, from the
       quality of natural resources to the cost of capital. There is no data establishing what an appropriate price range would be for many
       RISE countries. However, it inarguably is a best practice to ensure prices are high enough that the targeted projects or capacity are
       developed, and low enough to be an efficient use of resources.

       Given the importance of this to developers and policymakers, RISE compared feed-in tariff prices and winning bids from recent
       auctions and tenders for wind and solar power with the projected LCOE for the relevant technology in the region, as calculated by
       IRENA (box figure). Some feed-in tariffs are noticeably higher than the expected cost range: for example, guaranteed prices for solar
       PV projects in the Dominican Republic exceed US$0.50 per kWh, far above the upper bound of the LCOE range of US$0.22 per kWh.
       Comparatively, recent solar PV tenders in the United Arab Emirates have seen winning bids below US$0.06 per kWh, the lowest solar
       power costs in the world (and, as of early 2016, bid prices dropped below US$0.03).

       Jordan entertained bids of just over US$0.06 per kWh for the second round of its 200 MW solar tender directed at independent power
       producers in May, 2015. However, the proposed prices are so low that some have questioned if enough revenue will be provided for the
       projects to be built. The bidding process in Jordan did not include any mechanisms—such as bid bonds or mandated project develop-
       ment milestones—to discourage unrealistically low bids (reflected in Jordan’s score for Indicator 4). While the proposed projects may
       represent important advances in the cost efficiency of solar power, it is too early to determine if the resulting margins will be enough to
       carry the projects to fruition.

   Box 4.4 Renewable energy prices (continued)
   Conversely, higher prices will not always attract more investment than lower prices if other risks remain unaddressed. For example,
   until recently Nigeria’s feed-in tariff for solar power offered US$0.56 per kWh, one of the highest prices in the world, second among all
   RISE countries save the Dominican Republic. Yet, with the program in place (since 2008), no PPAs have been signed. Yes, the tariff is
   high, but the program offers little predictability: the prices are in naira, and the program includes no incentives for offtakers to con-
   nect renewable generators to the grid and dispatch their power. In 2015, the Nigerian government took steps to reform the program,
   passing the National Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Policy. It prioritizes competitive bidding for projects over 30 MW, fixes
   the duration of the PPA term at 20 years, denominates the feed-in tariff in dollars, and sets caps on project size and technology types.
   Though rates are lower under the new program, more certainty is provided for investors and government finances alike. Through the
   new regulations, Nigeria hopes to add 1GW of renewable energy capacity by the end of 2018, and another 1GW by 2020.

         Box 5.1 Examples of cumbersome procedures
         In the Democratic Republic of Congo, an urban-area customer first submits an application for connection to the distribution utility,
         SNEL, and receives a notice of connection indicating that she or he is now a potential candidate for connection. Next, the customer
         applies to SNEL for a favorable acceptance notice indicating that the utility accepts the customer for a grid connection. On receiving
         this notice, the customer then submits both documents to the utility and requests a quote. On receiving the quote, the customer
         makes payment and awaits SNEL staff to complete connection to the grid.




                                                                                                                                                                                                    ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES
         In Mozambique, before submitting an application for connection—urban or rural—to the utility, a customer must obtain a clearance
         from the local district administration confirming that he or she lives in the neighborhood where the connection is sought. To obtain this
         district level clearance, the customer must obtain declarations from the heads of 10 households living in the neighborhood along with a
         declaration from the head of the neighborhood.

         In Sri Lanka, a customer first obtains a certification of land ownership or residence from the divisional secretary. The customer also must
         get an installation test report certifying the quality of internal wiring from a chartered engineer registered with the utility. The customer
         then has to take the usual steps of application submission, site visit, payment, entering into a supply contract, and finally, connection.

         In some countries, the process is made more unwieldy by customers’ interactions with third-party agencies for safety inspections.
         In Niger’s urban areas, for instance, a customer first submits an application for connection to the distribution utility, NIGELEC, and
         then waits around two weeks for a technician to conduct a site survey. Next, the customer waits another two and a half weeks for
         the technician to prepare a quote. On receipt of the quote, the customer must request an internal wiring inspection from Sécurité des
         Installations Électriques Intérieures du Niger, a government agency. Once that agency’s inspector provides a certificate of compliance,
         the customer submits that certificate along with payment to NIGELEC, which then carries out the necessary grid-connection work.

         Box 5.2 Challenges in Myanmar’s unelectrified rural areas
         Myanmar’s urban customers can get a new connection in just over a month, but their rural counterparts in unelectrified communities
         are not as fortunate: they may need to wait for over a year and a half and pay US$568 (44 times per capita income).

         To bring electricity to their rural community, village leaders first must establish a village electricity committee (VEC), develop an
         electrification plan, submit it for approval to the township office of the Electricity Supply Enterprise (ESE)—the electricity distribution
         utility serving Myanmar’s rural areas—and pay the connection fee. The village monk frequently forms the 12-person VEC, which then
         persuades households to take part in the electrification. Collecting a list of participating households can take upward of one year. The
         VEC also works to secure loans to help finance the operation.

         The committee submits its collective application for electricity to the ESE township office, which reviews and endorses the application.
         The application is then endorsed by the ESE regional office, and finally is approved by the national-level Ministry of Electric Power.

         After final approval from the ministry, VEC subcontracts the electrical work, receives certification from the ministry, and gets
         connected to the grid. The electrical work and final connection usually take six months.




         Box 5.3 Details on the urban-rural discrepancy for obtaining a connection in Bangladesh
         In Bangladesh’s urban areas, customers can get a new connection in less than a month. The process begins with the submission of
         an application to the distribution utility, Dhaka Power Distribution Company Ltd, along with supporting paperwork. The supporting
         paperwork includes a copy of land ownership and a building drawing approved by the City Development Authority; information on the
         demand load; details of the building construction company; and a notarized copy issued by the city corporation with the property’s
         holding number. The utility then prepares a demand report that includes the approved load demand in kW and voltage level as well as
         a quote for the connection. The customer then makes the necessary payment, purchases a meter from the utility, and obtains final
         grid connection.

         A customer living in an unelectrified rural community, however, must wait nearly six months before getting an electrical connection.
         The customer begins the process by becoming a member of a local rural electricity society—Palli Bidyut Samity—and making the
         payment for connection fees and the cost of poles and materials. The construction of the electricity network in the whole village is
         done according to the master plan of the rural electricity board.

         Box 5.4 Regulation for minigrids exists but is not implemented in Pakistan
         Because Pakistan only recently passed its regulation on minigrids (September 2015), the role of the Aga Khan Rural Support Program
         (AKRSP) is reviewed here.

         AKRSP has developed 200 minigrids in Pakistan, and was not required to interact with any government entity. No permits were
         required. These grids typically are donor-funded projects and are matched with contributions from the local communities. In a few
         cases, the government’s Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund has invested. The steps required to establish a minigrid:

         1:	AKRSP writes a concept note for a minigrid on the basic potential and need in a community, village, or town. The note is written
             primarily for a donor.
         2:	 If there is donor interest or willingness, AKRSP conducts a prefeasibility study and develops a proposal for donors.
         3a:	AKRSP conducts a participatory rural appraisal.
         3b:	A formal request in the form of a letter of intent or commitment is written by or for the community.
         4:	 A detailed feasibility study, including detailed design and cost estimates, is submitted.
         5:	AKRSP signs an agreement with the community, the terms of which define the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders
             in the partnership.
         6:	 Construction work begins.
         7:	 Testing and commissioning are conducted.
         8:	 The minigrid is handed over to the community.

     Box 5.5 Minigrid regulatory requirements can vary depending on size
     Regulatory requirements for minigrids can vary within countries depending on the size of the project. For example, in Tanzania and
     Kenya, licenses are required only for projects that exceed 1 MW. Smaller projects can register their businesses, a process that does not
     require the approval of the regulator, rather than apply for a license. Having this option ensures that smaller operators are not deterred
     by regulatory compliance. Registration is important because it facilitates grid extensions by providing the regulator and other govern-
     ment agencies with information on the enterprise and the services it provides. Other countries that require only registration for projects
     under a certain capacity include Cameroon (5 MW), Rwanda (50 KW), and Zimbabwe (100 KW).

     In some cases, however, minigrid developers may seek a license even if doing so is not required. An optional provisional license secures
     a site from competition for a limited period of time and communicates the legitimacy of the planned minigrid project to lenders or
     other key stakeholders.

        requires the monitoring of a range of
        requirements to determine whether all of
        the program’s rules are being met. Two primary mechanisms for monitoring are entry conditions and market surveillance.

        Verification involves testing the accuracy of energy performance claims made by the manufacturer and confirms whether a product
        meets program rules. The specifics of verification testing vary by the design of the MV&E regime. If entry conditions do not require
        certification, or require self-certification without testing, verification testing is the main method for checking performance. If products
        are required to undergo verification and certification before entering the program, the rigor of the certification process—not testing—is
        the focus of verification for authorities.b There are three main forms of verification testing: screening, full procedure verification, and
        third-party certification. These methods can be done before or after a product enters the market, depending on the MV&E regime.

        Once a product is on the market, it can be subject to off-the-shelf testing, also known as spot testing. The process differs among
        jurisdictions, but typically the enforcement agency selects a refrigerator, buys it on the market, and tests it in a lab. If it passes, there is
        no follow-up with the manufacturer and they are unaware that the test has taken place. If it fails, the regulator—which may be required
        to submit documentation of the testing for a registry—will notify the manufacturer and may apply a fine.

         Box 5.7 U.S. EPA Energy Star labeling program
         Energy Star is a voluntary labeling program created to identify and promote energy efficient products. This national voluntary program
         administered by the U.S. EPA sets energy performance specifications for more than 70 product categories, including refrigerators.
         These products must adhere to Energy Star specifications in order to bear its label. The EPA maintains a registration system for
         certified products.

         The EPA also entered into agreements with eight governments or entities to promote Energy Star–qualified products in their markets.
         These countries and economies—Australia; Canada; the EU; Japan; New Zealand; Switzerland; Taiwan, China; and the European Free
         Trade Association (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland)—have partnership agreements with the EPA designed to unify
         voluntary energy efficiency labeling programs. The agreements provide a single set of energy efficiency specifications in several major
         global markets.

Box 5.8 Market surveillance in the EU
As a common market, the EU presents a unique case for the enforcement of refrigerator energy efficiency standards. There are two
pieces of energy efficiency legislation for refrigerators: Ecodesign MEPS and energy labeling. Ecodesign provides consistent EU-wide
rules for improving the environmental performance of products, and is overseen by the European Commission.

Ecodesign requires self-testing and self-declaration by the manufacturer before it places a product on the market.a Since there is no
registration or certification requirement, manufacturers can self-declare that their product meets ecodesign standards by placing the
CE markb on them.

Ecodesign requires EU member states to establish an MSA that must conduct market surveillance, request relevant testing information
from manufacturers, and enforce penalties. Ecodesign also establishes standardized verification test procedures. However, market
surveillance activities are sovereign to MSAs at the national level and are not performed consistently across countries.c RISE surveyed
15 EU countries, all of which are under Ecodesign.d

Challenges to stronger compliance programs in the EU include weak penalties that fail to provide deterrence; insufficient financial
resources; insufficiently staffed programs (for the entire EU there are just 80 full-time staff members working on energy labeling
compliance); and inadequate testing infrastructure.e

Box 5.9 Japan’s Top Runner Program
Japan’s unique Top Runner program enforces the country’s energy efficiency standards. Top Runner is not an MEPS program. Instead, it
requires manufacturers to meet a target set by the fleet average. Manufacturers simply test their refrigerators in-house and then label
it with the ratio of energy efficiency scoring against the top performing refrigerator in the Top Runner program. This means that if the
weighted average of energy efficiencies for all refrigerators on the market collectively meet the target established by Top Runner, every
manufacturer is deemed to have met the standards. A manufacturer can sell a refrigerator that does not meet the target percentage
established by Top Runner if the weighted average, which includes the minimum product and all other refrigerators in the category,
clears the target. The Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) essentially lets the market lead the way on energy efficiency,
and the certification process for refrigerators is treated as voluntary. This clearly is different from the use of MEPS, which require all

products in the market to clear a certain target.a

In practice the program works because of the competitive refrigerator market in Japan. Consumers in Japan place value on an
appliance’s energy efficiency, and the five main manufacturers in Japan place more than 80 new refrigerator products on the market
each year. Third-party certification testing, which takes around a month, would add significant delay to the arrival of new products
and would not meet market expectations. The competition and fast product cycle also help ensure that the products meet and
further the standards.b

There are forms of market surveillance, however. The Japanese Electrical Manufacturer’s Association, of which all five manufacturers
are members, voluntarily purchases refrigerators placed on the market each year and contracts with the Japan Quality Assurance
Organization to test the products. Test results are submitted to METI. Submission is voluntary and not mandated; the manufacturers
do not submit any data to any government organization.c

                      five years, and in some cases, even 10. The International Energy Agency reported that the policy change led to a reduction in the
                      average duration for a procedure to 8–10 months in some cases, although the Hellenic Wind Industry Association notes that many
                      areas for improvement remain.a

                      The data RISE collected for Greece is on projects that were brought to financial close around the time of the reforms of 2010 and
                      related to the financial crisis. It is difficult to obtain more recent data because only a few projects have been developed since.

         Box 5.11 Pioneering solar power in Chad
         The government is keen to develop its abundant solar resources. It has set up the Renewable Energy Agency of Chad and tasked it with
         mobilizing investment for renewables.

         Various large solar projects are under development, and RISE gathered information on the procedural steps for two projects in the
         range of 40–60 MW. However, as they have not been constructed, they are excluded from the comparison with other countries. So
         far, these projects have completed four procedures, including signing a memorandum of understanding with the Ministry of Energy,
         submitting a feasibility study to the Ministry and the local utility, conducting an EIA, and signing a PPA. Completing these procedures
         took the developers 541 days on average.



         Box 5.12 Streamlining the permitting process in India
         The use of one-stop shops to expedite licensing is common among India’s states; they are modeled on the Commission of Industries
         under the new industrial policy. The two portals in the Indian states RISE surveyed—the New and Renewable Energy Development
         Corporation of Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra Energy Development Agency—are similar in conception. The developer submits
         documents for various permits (such as environmental, land, transmission, and project clearances) to the portal and the documents
         are distributed to the relevant agencies, which in theory have 21–30 days to issue approval (durations run longer than this, as RISE data
         indicate, possibly because further information was requested from the developer). Andhra Pradesh uses an online system for project
         registration and managing records, but Maharashtra does not. Andhra Pradesh also reports shorter durations for issuing clearances.

   Box 5.13 Definitions of procedure types
   è	 Interconnection approval. All authorizations required to physically connect a generator to the distribution or transmission grid.
      This includes approvals of technical feasibility studies (such as power system studies, load flow analysis), obtaining technical
      conditions for connection from the grid operator, and final permission to interconnect.

   è	 Environmental permit. Authorizations required under environmental law. This includes the approval of EIAs and can be granted
      at municipal, regional, or national level.

   è	 PPAs. Agreements between the project developer and the offtaker (usually a utility) to purchase the produced electricity for a
      specified number of years.

   è	 Authorization from ministries or public agencies. All administrative approvals not listed separately that need to be obtained at
      the national level. This includes expressions of interest and memorandums of understanding.

   è	 Generation license. Authorization to produce electricity. Energy concessions also are included in this category.

   è	 Renewable energy incentive scheme or subsidy. Applications and approvals necessary to receive the most important support
      schemes for renewable energy, such as feed-in tariffs and green certificates.

   è	 Authorization from local entities or municipalities. All other administrative approvals that need to be obtained at the municipal
      or regional level.

   è	 Testing and commissioning. Verification that the generator complies with the technical standards and operational requirements
      set out by the grid operator.

   è	Feasibility study. Assessment of the viability of the proposed project, taking into account legal, economic, technological,
     scheduling, and other factors. While completing a feasibility study is a common aspect of project development, submission for
     approval at local or national level is what RISE records. It is required in only a few economies. This often is equivalent to a general
     project approval.

   è	 Competitive bidding. Application to participate in public tenders, auctions, or other forms of public procurement of energy (not
      applicable in all countries).

             percent of non-OECD projects were approved in the same time period that the bottom 25 percent of OECD projects were approved
             (box figure). A driving factor is the requirement in many OECD countries for a public consultation, which can be lengthy, as seen in
             Denmark. It is also possible that EIA procedures are more rigorous in OECD countries.

               Box 5.15 Renewable energy incentives and subsidies
               Procedures for renewable energy incentives and subsidies range from registering for feed-in tariffs (Austria, Finland, Japan, Malaysia,
               and Ukraine), net metering (the Philippines), and price premiums (Denmark and the Netherlands), to qualifying for obtaining tradable
               green certificates (Belgium and Romania), to obtaining special financing terms (Australia). In Russia a project must be registered as a
               renewable energy installation to take part in the capacity-based renewable energy support scheme.

               Gaining access to the local incentive program usually is not associated with steep costs, and can be as easy as completing an online
               feed-in tariff application and paying the application fee within seven days in Malaysia or obtaining Austria’s eco-electricity plan decree
               approval to qualify for feed-in tariff support within 10 days. In other countries, this procedure creates long waiting times. In Japan,
               obtaining the feed-in tariff certification from the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry takes on average 62 days.

               To receive the price premium in Denmark, a wind energy project has to register with two different programs under the Promotion of
               Renewable Energy Act. First, a loss of value program compensates citizens for reduced property value due to a wind energy project in
               their vicinity (4.5 km or less from the nearest turbine). Second, project developers have to offer 20 percent of a project’s shares to local
               residents. The offers must be made available for a minimum of eight weeks and must take place before grid connection of the project.
               If any shares are left, they must be offered for sale to residents of the municipality where the turbine is located (or with a coastline
               closest to the turbine). This approval is necessary to receive price premiums, but cannot stop a project. Both these programs increase
               local buy-in for renewable energy solutions and help cut project delays stemming from local opposition.

Many countries share the vision of a secure energy future for all people. For
most countries, realizing this vision requires huge investment in sustainable
energy and a solid enabling environment of policies, regulations, and
institutions. The regulatory indicators for sustainable energy (RISE) is a tool
to help countries get to where they want to be. The suite of indicators
capture the policy and regulatory landscape in energy access, renewable
energy, and energy efficiency and provide a global reference point for
policymakers. RISE highlights good practices across countries, supports
peer learning, and fosters enabling environment for sustainable energy.
