I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:

       Assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in Pakistan
        perceive the Bank;

       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Pakistan regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Pakistan;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank in Pakistan;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank ’s effectiveness and results, knowledge
               and research, and communication and information sharing in Pakistan; and
            Perceptions of the World Bank’s future role in Pakistan.

       Use data to help inform the Pakistan country team’s strategy.



II. Methodology
In May thru July 2012, 1,000 stakeholders of the World Bank in Pakistan were invited to provide
their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country survey.
Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of the President or Prime Minister;
the office of a Minister; the office of a Parliamentarian; employees of a ministry, ministerial
department, or implementation agency; consultants/contractors working on World Bank-
supported projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of a
project; local government officials or staff; bilateral agencies; multilateral agencies; private
sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks; NGOs; community-
based organizations (CBOs); the media; independent government institutions; trade unions; faith-
based groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; and the judiciary branch. A total of 512
stakeholders participated in the country survey (51%).
Respondents received questionnaires via courier, post, or email and returned it accordingly, or
completed questionnaires with a representative of the fielding agency. Respondents were asked
about: general issues facing Pakistan, their overall attitudes toward the Bank; the World Bank’s
effectiveness and results; the Bank’s knowledge; working with the World Bank; the Bank’s
future role in Pakistan, and the Bank’s communication and information sharing in Pakistan:

Every country that engages in the Country Survey must include specific indicator questions that
will be aggregated for the Bank’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions are identified
throughout the survey report.

A. General Issues facing Pakistan: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Pakistan is
   headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important
   development priorities, and which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty and
   generating economic growth in Pakistan.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with the World Bank, the Bank’s effectiveness in Pakistan, Bank staff preparedness, the
   extent to which the Bank should seek to influence the global development agenda, their
   agreement with various statements regarding the Bank’s work, and the extent to which the
   Bank is an effective development partner. Respondents were also asked to indicate the
   sectoral areas on which it would be most productive for the Bank to focus its resources, the
   Bank’s greatest values and greatest weaknesses in its work, the most and least effective
   instruments in helping to reduce poverty in Pakistan, with which groups the Bank should
   work more, and to what reasons respondents attributed failed or slow reform efforts.
C. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which
   the Bank’s work helps achieve sustainable development results in Pakistan, the extent to
   which the Bank meets Pakistan’s need for knowledge services and financial instruments, and
   the Bank’s level of effectiveness across thirty-six development areas, such as anti-corruption
   and economic growth.
D. The World Bank’s Knowledge: Respondents were asked to indicate how frequently they
   consult Bank knowledge/research, the areas on which the Bank should focus its research
   efforts, and to rate the effectiveness and quality of the Bank’s knowledge/research, including
   how significant of a contribution it makes to development results, its technical quality, the
   Bank’s effectiveness at providing linkage to non-Bank expertise, and the extent to which
   Pakistan received value for money from fee-for-service products/services.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
   a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as the World Bank ’s
   “Safeguard Policy” requirements being reasonable and the Bank disbursing funds promptly.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank in Pakistan: Respondents were asked to rate how
   significant a role the Bank should play in Pakistan’s development in the near future and to
   indicate what the Bank should do to make itself of greater value in Pakistan.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate where they
   get information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the Bank, their access to the Internet, and their usage and evaluation of the
   Bank’s website. Respondents were asked about their awareness of the Bank’s Access to
   Information policy, past information requests from the Bank, and their level of agreement
   that they use more data from the World Bank as a result of the Bank’s Open Data policy .
   Respondents were also asked their level of agreement that they know how to find information
   from the Bank and that the Bank is responsive to information requests.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their exposure
   to the Bank in Pakistan, and their geographic location.

In addition, when possible, responses from respondents completing this year’s country survey
were compared to responses from the 351 respondents (44% response rate) who completed the
country survey in FY 2005. Notations and/or charts are included when these comparisons were
possible. It should be noted that half of the respondents in FY ’05 were from local and national
government (who tend to be more positive than those outside government in Country Surveys
globally), which may explain some of the change in views of the World Bank.

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
       For further analyses, the small number of respondents from the office of a Minister were
        combined with those from the office of the President/Prime Minister, consultants working
        on Bank-supported projects were combined with respondents from PMUs, respondents
        from CBOs were combined with those from NGOs, respondents from multilateral
        agencies were combined with those from bilateral agencies, and the few respondents
        from the office of a Parliamentarian, faith-based groups, and the judiciary branch were
        included in the “Other” category.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)

Geographic Location

       The vast majority of respondents indicated that they were located in Provinces (i.e.,
        Sindh, Khyber, Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan, Punjab). Because of the small number of
        respondents from Regions and Territories (i.e., Azad Jammu and Kashmir, AJK, Gilgit-
        Baltistan, GB, Federally Administered Tribal Areas, FATA), comparisons between
        geographic locations were not possible.

Collaboration with and Exposure to the World Bank

       Differences in responses to the indicator questions, based on levels of collaboration and
        exposure to the World Bank in Pakistan, can be found in the Appendix (page 81). Please
        note that where these two factors appear to have a significant relationship with overall
        views of the Bank, it is highlighted in yellow in that table.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)

Familiarity with the World Bank

       Across all respondents, familiarity with the Bank received a mean rating of 6.0, this was
        significantly lower than the mean rating received in the FY ’05 country survey (6.4).
             Respondents across all stakeholder groups had statistically similar levels of
              familiarity with the Bank.
             It should be noted that respondents’ ratings of familiarity with the Bank were
              significantly, moderately correlated with their perceptions of the Bank’s overall
              effectiveness in Pakistan, the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable
              development results, and the Bank’s relevance to Pakistan’s development.

IV. General Issues facing Pakistan

Headed in the Right Direction

       A majority of respondents across most stakeholder groups indicated that Pakistan was
        headed in the wrong direction, except respondents from the office of the President/Prime
        Minister/Minister who were equally likely to indicate that Pakistan was headed in the
        right direction, wrong direction, and not sure.
             This was a significantly different perspective compared to respondents in the FY
              ’05 country survey in which nearly three-quarters of respondents indicated that
              Pakistan was headed in the right direction.

IV. General Issues facing Pakistan (continued)
Development Priority

       Respondents across most stakeholder groups indicated that education was the most
        important development priority in Pakistan, except respondents from the office of the
        President/Prime Minister/Minister who were more likely to indicate economic growth
        and respondents from trade unions who were more likely to indicate energy.
             Over half of all respondents in the FY ’05 country survey indicated that reducing
              poverty was the most important development priority for Pakistan.

V. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank (continued)

The World Bank’s Overall Effectiveness (Indicator Question)

       Across all respondents, ratings of the World Bank’s overall effectiveness in Pakistan
        received a mean rating of 5.6; this was statistically similar to the mean overall
        effectiveness rating received in the FY ’05 country survey (5.6) .
             Respondents from trade unions gave the highest ratings for the Bank’s overall
              effectiveness in Pakistan whereas respondents from independent government
              institutions and the media gave significantly lower ratings.

V. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank (continued)

Greatest Weakness

       Respondents in the FY ’05 country survey also indicated that the Bank’s greatest
        weakness was imposing technocratic solutions without regard to political realities.
             Respondents from local government indicated that the Bank may not be practical
              and respondents from private foundations indicated that World Bank processes
              are too slow and complex.

V. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank (continued)

Attributing Slow or Failed Reform Efforts

       In addition, respondents from the office of the President/Prime Minister/Minister and
        bilateral or multilateral agencies indicated that reforms are not well thought out in light of
        country challenges, respondents from local government indicated that the World Bank
        works too slowly and that there is a lack of/inadequate levels of capacity in Government,
        and respondents from the financial sector/private banks indicated that there is a lack
        of/inadequate levels of capacity in Government.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness

Specific Areas of Effectiveness (continued)

       There were significant stakeholder group differences in ratings of the Bank’s
        effectiveness across nine of these thirty-six areas of development. For the most part,
        consultants on Bank projects/PMUs and respondents from bilateral/multilateral agencies,
        private foundations, and the financial sector/private banks tended to have the highest
        ratings for the Bank’s effectiveness in these areas whereas respondents from independent
        government institutions tended to have significantly lower ratings for the Bank’s
        effectiveness. Those areas with significant stakeholder group differences were:
                 Anti-corruption;
                 Transport;
                 Crime and violence;
                 Law and justice;
                 Basic infrastructure;
                 Poverty reduction;
                 Energy;
                 Rural development; and
                 Social protection.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve sustainable development results in Pakistan, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty-six specific areas
of effectiveness.
Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve sustainable
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable
development results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of
effectiveness in one specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s
overall effectiveness or perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable
development results.
       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Pakistan. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             The Bank’s effectiveness at natural resource management;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at economic growth;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at food security; and
             The Bank’s effectiveness at agricultural development.
             Of note, the areas determined to be key drivers of the Bank’s overall effectiveness
              in the FY ’05 country survey were:
                o The Bank’s effectiveness in helping to reduce poverty;
                o The Bank’s effectiveness in helping to accelerate economic growth;
                o The Bank’s effectiveness in encouraging greater transparency and
                    government effectiveness; and
                o The Bank’s effectiveness in supporting reform and development in
                    Pakistan’s provinces.

       Achieving Sustainable Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest
        Pearson Product-Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to
        perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable development results in
        Pakistan, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of
        perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable de velopment results. The
        areas determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             The Bank’s effectiveness at governance and
             The Bank’s effectiveness at food security.

VII. World Bank Knowledge and Instruments

Knowledge: Frequency of Use

The World Bank is interested in gauging the views of clients and partners who are either involved in
development in Pakistan or who observe activities related to social and economic development. The following
survey is meant to give the World Bank’s team that works in Pakistan, greater insight into how the Bank’s work
is perceived. This is one tool the World Bank uses to assess the views of its critical stakeholders. With this
understanding, the World Bank hopes to develop more effective strategies, outreach and programs that support
development in Pakistan. The World Bank commissioned an independent firm to oversee the logistics of this
effort in Pakistan. This ensures anonymity and confidentiality. We hope you’ll be candid. To complete the
survey, please circle/check the response that most accurately reflects your opinion. If you prefer not to answer
a question, please leave it blank.


PLEASE NOTE: IN SOME CASES THE SURVEY WILL ASK FOR A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF
