                                           Executive Summary
India’s land system will face enormous strains in the near future: As India continues to urbanize and
move towards a less agricultural- and more industry-based economy, land demands will continue to grow.
Its urban population is expected to increase by more than 200 million by 2030, requiring 4–8 million
hectares of land for residential use alone. Demands for infrastructure and industry could add a similar
amount, summing to total land demand of 5–10 percent of the land area currently used for agriculture. If
not handled well, such massive land use change may increase vulnerability and food insecurity, rent-
seeking, environmental problems, social dislocation, inequality, and conflict. But it also provides an
opportunity to address the underlying structural issues, propelling India into the league of middle-income
countries and laying the ground for significantly advancing shared prosperity and reduced poverty.
A legacy of discrimination and neglect creates enormous challenges: Although land featured prominently
in policy debates throughout India’s history, the focus has been on addressing specific gaps, often in an ad
hoc manner, than on dealing with systemic issues and cutting across traditional institutional boundaries.
This eroded the quality of records and institutions’ ability to unambiguously define land rights, protect
rights of tribals, women, and smallholders more in general, and the scope for market forces to respond to
price signals transfer land to its most productive use. Instead, it created a complex edifice of regulations
that are not always fully consistent with each other and that are fiendishly difficult to enforce, especially in
a situation where the underlying land information is weak or outdated. It is thus not surprising that land
access features prominently in concerns raised by the private sector.
Benefits from improving land governance are large and can be broadly shared: Many stakeholders
erroneously assume that land policy is a zero-sum game, that is, any gain for one group will cause equal
losses to another. While true in some cases, this does not apply in many cases: Clear and authoritative
recognition of land rights can increase investment, sustainable land use, and welfare by women, tribals, or
informal occupants who previously lacked such rights and reduce conflict. Reducing transaction costs of
market-based land transfers can support reallocation of factors in ways that reduce rural under-employment
and structural transformation while accounting for land owners’ preferences. Restrictions of land transfers
or use can be enforced, thus reducing conflict risk, only if all of them are on record. Better protection and
management of public land—or more transparent mechanisms to transfer them if appropriate—allow the
public rather than a select group of individuals to benefit from a key public asset. New technology
furthermore provides options to use land governance challenges as an opportunity.
This synthesis report presents results from land governance self-assessments by six states: The fact that
land is a state subject implies that actions to improve land governance need to be initiated at state level. To
identify opportunities, six states implemented the Land Governance Assessment Framework (LGAF), a
tool that allow comparing the status of their land governance against international good practice along a set
of dimensions in a very participatory process. Results are summarized in state reports that were validated
publicly and discussed with policy makers in each state. This national report complements these and draws
out common areas.
A number of issues emerged consistently across states: Authoritative land records—including up-to-date
textual information and spatial identification of boundaries—are either completely missing or poorly
maintained. In urban areas, unclear institutional responsibilities create difficulties for planning, supply of
serviced land, and tax collection impede development of land and financial markets, encourage
encroachment on public land, and contribute to disputes that reduce investment, and take long to resolve.
High stamp duties compound this by encouraging spurious valuations and driving transactions into
informality, undermining the ability to properly price land. Lack of a public land inventory and diffuse
management responsibilities encourage encroachment and undermine effective use of this asset, something
that is exacerbated by non-competitive processes to make land available to investors and failure to disclose
or monitor contractual provisions. Finally, weak land records encourage use of land acquisition rather than
direct negotiation to access land by private investors to ‘cleanse’ the title.

States have the mandate and main responsibility to address this: State reports provided recommendations
for action in a number of areas. These include:
      Move towards conclusive title for rural land through transaction-based updating of records by (i)
       synchronizing records and registration and making registration contingent on production of a map
       using the example of the pre-mutation sketch in Karnataka; (ii) ensuring automatic updating
       (mutation) of records if transferred; (iii) recording all land-related encumbrances and charges by
       public or private entities; and (iv) lowering stamp duty, ideally in ways that offset associated
       revenue losses through other charges for example, land taxes to reduce the scope for price
       misreporting.
      Establish an integrated urban cadastre using low-cost image-based, systematic, and participatory
       methods with private sector participation in implementation and cost recovery in line with demand
       and ability to pay that can be used beyond the land sector for (i) effective planning of urban land
       use and expansion; (ii) land taxation to facilitate public investment that increases land values; (iii)
       identification and management of public land and prevention of unauthorized encroachment; and
       (iv) regular and reliable reporting of land and real estate price indices to aid private sector decision
       making.
      Draw on advances in IT to establish interoperable land data to be shared by all land institutions that
       can provide a basis for regular reporting on key land indicators, internal management systems, and
       a gradual move towards a more performance-based approach to improving land governance.
      Use existing records, in combination with other data, to identify rural areas where land values and
       transaction levels warrant complete resurvey. Design participatory methods for systematic image-
       based survey and adjudication, develop business models to implement these with full or partial cost
       recovery by the private sector, and rigorously evaluate their impact before scaling up.
      Create and publicize a spatially referenced inventory of public land and, in the process, evolve a
       policy to avoid future encroachment on public land. Establish standards to decide when and for
       what purpose public land can be transferred to private interest. Rely on competitive transparent
       mechanisms for such transfers, ensure that land users and the public share benefits, and put in place
       mechanisms to monitor and enforce compliance with contractual obligations as needed.
      Recognize, record, and map at appropriate scale hitherto unsurveyed individual and communal land
       and resolve ambiguity about responsibility for it between forest and revenue departments. Link this
       to a campaign of awareness-raising and support to recognition of communal claims in a way that
       makes use of the potential of recent legislations such as the Forest Rights Act (FRA) and explore
       options for imagery-based monitoring of the impact of doing so on land use.
      Adjust the institutional framework for land tenure and management to ensure land information is
       comprehensive, of high quality, and readily available to interested parties at low cost. Explore the
       scope for a dedicated agency to administer rural and urban land rights, in financially sustainable
       ways, including by making non-confidential land data available. Remove entry barriers to survey
       and valuation professions and let local bodies manage certain types of land in line with the 73rd &
       74th Amendments and the Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act (PESA).
      Improve poor people’s access to land y recognizing tenancy and measures to improve lease market
       functioning. Account for limited enforcement capacity and bureaucrats’ incentives when drafting
       legislation and regulations aiming to (i) restrict certain types of land transfers; (ii) regularize
       unauthorized occupation; and (iii) restore possession of granted land to the original grantees.
      Pursue options to increase women’s land ownership by disseminating the Hindu Succession Act
       Amendment (HSAA), registering assigned or granted lands in females’ names and exploring use
       of incentives for private parties who put females’ names on land records. Link this to consistent

                                                      2
        monitoring and impact assessment to identify effective approaches to increase female land
        ownership, flag potentially adverse effects, and ensure consistent implementation across states.
       Put in place an IT-based case management system for land disputes in the courts and use this, as
        well as a clear typology of land dispute cases, to monitor case load and identify gaps in policy that,
        if addressed, could reduce disputes most expeditiously. Consider time limits on cases and
        complementing formal courts with advisory, conciliatory, and adjudicatory institutions as well as
        creation of awareness and capacity at local level to help prevent and resolve land disputes.
There is ample state experience to draw from to improve practice: While this seems an ambitious agenda,
initiatives exist in many states to deal with aspects of this agenda, and if reviewed and shared systematically,
these could provide important guidance for going to scale. Individual states implemented improved
mapping, synchronized spatial and textual records, ensured automatic mutation, required proof of the
seller’s identity, land ownership, and consistency with existing records before registering a transaction, and
linked land records to the courts and banks to prevent fraud. Town planning schemes and other innovative
avenues for planning have been applied in some states to allow urban expansion without a need for
conflictive processes of land acquisition. A greater emphasis on benefit-sharing entry barriers for private
surveyors and valuers were lowered, standards harmonized, and enforcement capacity strengthened. Certain
states have also computerized courts and public land management to allow tracking of disputes and greater
transparency. But lessons of these innovative measures were often not learned and shared and many were
ad hoc and not well justified and sequenced. Often they were not systematically monitored or documented
in a way that would have allowed to clearly assess impact, thus limiting the scope for drawing lessons and
disseminating innovations.
The national level has an important role to support the land agenda: Emphasizing states’ responsibility
does not make the center superfluous but creates different responsibilities, consistent with recent moves
towards greater devolution of spending. These include (i) monitoring states’ performance in a way that
builds on “Doing Business” using administrative data, analyzing results to identify promising innovations
and establishing procedures for states to use these data to manage workflows and exercise oversight at
various levels; (ii) increase visibility of land, overcome institutional fragmentation to improve rural and
urban land ownership data, and identify ways to make such data available to interested parties in the public
and private sector without infringing on confidentiality; and (iii) making central support more output-based
and focusing it on testing innovative approaches for well-defined issues and in a rigorous manner to ensure
wider replicability.
Monitoring state performance: Having a clear set of outcome indicators can help focus and direct state
efforts and, by creating competition, not only help to quantify challenges and prioritize areas for
intervention but also promote evidence-based sharing of good practice and cross-state dialogue to identify
cost-effective and scalable approaches. It can thus avoid promising innovations that could be shared across
states go unnoticed or even be abandoned. Discussions with the LGAF Technical Advisory Group and state
coordinators resulted in agreement on a set of five indicators to be used in this respect:
       Land area mapped with ownership rights unambiguously recorded: Lack of cadastral maps and
        associated ownership records emerged as a key issue in all types of lands, particularly urban ones.
        Quantifying the magnitudes involved will require sharing of data across departments that can then
        be linked to land use (based on imagery) and other attributes to design and prioritize intervention.
       Number of land area covered by textual and spatial records: This indicator emphasizes the extent
        to which maps exist and are in sync with textual records, and is obtained easily if records are
        computerized. It can be improved by systematic resurvey or by making mutation contingent a pre-
        mutation sketch. Data used to construct it can help decide what is most appropriate.
       Registered versus mutated transactions: High levels of pending mutations, possibly due to high
        stamp duties or a perception of registration having limited value, undermine the sustainability and

                                                       3
        currency of the system and increase the risk of fraudulent transactions. Improving the indicator is
        easy in a computerized system by establishing an online link between records and registry.
       Coverage with tax maps and land tax collection efficiency: Given low collection of own revenue
        by LGUs, expanding coverage with tax maps, possibly linked to ownership records in a well-
        designed process, can be a self-financing and governance-improving way of establishing a multi-
        purpose cadastre. Information on this indicator can also help explore revenue-neutral options to
        reduce stamp duties, which may encourage informal transactions or underreporting of sales values.
       Pending disputes of different types: Beyond providing a tool for courts to manage case flow and
        measure performance, this indicator is important to assess incidence and economic impact of
        disputes, identify priority areas where laws and regulations are to be clarified, and measure the
        impact of doing so. Information can be obtained with little additional effort.
Create an enabling environment that transcends institutional fragmentation: A high level technical group
to help increase the visibility of land by publicizing positive examples and reform efforts, including by
regular dissemination of the above land indicators, can help to overcome the notion of land as a conflictive
zero-sum issue. Efforts are also needed to bring together relevant institutions (Department of Land
Resources, Ministry of Environment and Forests, Ministry of Tribal Affairs, and Ministry of Urban
Development), provide technical leadership and continuity on cross-cutting and systemic issues, set
performance targets, and identify ways to increase implementation capacity and reputation of all concerned
institutions, including possibly through conduct of LGAF in other states. Finally, the center can play a key
role in the establishment of interoperable data standards and filling of legal gaps where it has a mandate
(for example the Registration Act or the legal structure for e-governance).
Allocate public resources based on performance and social benefit: States’ responsibility and specificity
notwithstanding, a set of generic issues seems common to many states, including (i) creation of land records
in previously unsurveyed rural areas in ways that recognize individual and communal patterns of occupation
and use; (ii) inventorying, demarcating, and clarifying management responsibility for public land; (iii)
updating and spatially referencing rural records in contexts where these have either not been well
maintained or are severely out of date; (iii) drawing on existing records of land use to create spatial and
textual land records in non-slum urban areas and issue ownership documents; (iv) participatory planning,
mapping, and tenure upgrading in informal settlements; and (v) ensuring access to land for the poor in rural
and urban areas. If there is interest from states, use of central funds to carefully design, implement, and
rigorously evaluate a set of pilots for each of these, building on existing state initiatives and good practice
identified in LGAF, would be one of the most promising avenues to quickly generate a robust basis of
knowledge to then be scaled up. This will generate the change needed and markedly improve indicators,
while laying the basis to move towards a system of conclusive land records.
There are a number of immediate next steps: The Government’s commitment to, jointly with partners,
identify and implement measures to improve the business environment and its review of central schemes
provide an opportunity for immediate action in three respects: First, get a national lead agency to design,
pilot, and review land governance monitoring indicators that would allow documenting the way in which
states follow up on LGAF recommendations to improve land governance at state level, while at the same
time feeding into and helping to promote the “Doing Business” reform agenda in interested states. Second,
undertake measures, including possible formation of a steering committee to publicize land indicators, to
overcome institutional fragmentation, highlight positive examples, and enhance technical capacity and
reputation of the land sector. Finally, identification of opportunities to pilot new approaches to the issues
highlighted above in a way that builds on LGAF assessment and fosters collaboration across states and with
rigorous evaluation of impact so as to be able to draw wider lessons for subsequent upscaling.

1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
Land issues have played a critical role in India’s history: Access to land is critical for investment and
growth, equity, poor people’s dignity, women’s empowerment, and equality of opportunity. In colonial
times, land played a major role in generating tax revenue, often reinforcing highly unequal power structures.
In post-independence period, reform policies to overcome such colonial legacies have been adopted. With
the exception of abolishing intermediaries, actual implementation fell far short of expectations due to failure
to account for the underlying political economy, none or inconsistent monitoring, and neglect of basic land
administration.
Urbanization and industrialization will put unprecedented new strains on India’s land system: While
India is still a predominantly rural-based society, rapid changes are envisaged for the future. Urban
population is expected to increase by more than 200 million by 2030, requiring about 8 million hectares of
additional land for residential use alone. Demands for infrastructure and rapid expansion of industry could
easily double this, summing to a total of about 10 percent of the land area (152 million. hectares) currently
used for agricultural production. Unless it is accomplished in ways that significantly increase productivity
of land use in agriculture to cope with increased food demand and account for the economic, social, and
environmental value of the lands potentially affected, such massive land use change may lead to food
insecurity, rent-seeking, environmental problems, social dislocation, inequality, and conflict. All of these
can seriously undermine the potential for shared prosperity and reduced poverty.
India’s land institutions have a poor record of addressing these issues: Although land has been prominent
in policy debates throughout India’s history, focus has been more on addressing specific gaps, often in an
ad hoc manner, than on dealing with systemic issues and cutting across traditional institutional boundaries.
This eroded the capacity of institutions to respond, and in particular, for market forces to respond to price
signals transfer land to its most productive use but also created a complex edifice of regulations that are not
always fully consistent with each other and that are fiendishly difficult to enforce, especially in a situation
where the underlying land information is weak or outdated. Addressing this is thus essential for India to
rise to emerging challenges, increase effectiveness of land use, and boost investment, job creation,
agricultural productivity, inclusive urbanization, infrastructure investment, and climate resilience and
disaster preparedness. As land is a state subject, the scope for central initiatives to do so remains limited.
At the same time, having responsibility at state level offers enormous scope for innovation, but making
such innovation useful for other states and scaling it up nationally will require analysis and mechanisms to
share good practices across states.
To analyze land issues in a participatory way, six states applied the LGAF self-assessment: Recognizing
that the technical complexity, cross-cutting nature, and political sensitivity of land issues required a special
type of engagement, six states decided to request support to implement the LGAF, a tool developed by the
World Bank together with partners. Department of Land Records Resources (DoLR) strongly supported
this process and formation of a Technical Advisory Group (TAG) of eminent experts at national level,
noting the potential for cross-learning and identifying good practices and challenges for national policy. In
each participating state, a comprehensive state-level LGAF report was produced, validated in a public
workshop and discussed with policy makers to agree on next steps. This national summary report aims to
identify common issues that have emerged across several states and, by drawing out implications for policy
at national level, progress monitoring, and sharing of experience, point towards next steps (including
possible conduct of LGAF in other states) that could build on what has been achieved in this process.
Results point towards some common challenges: A number of issues came up consistently across states:
Authoritative land records—including up-to-date textual information and spatial identification of
boundaries—are either completely missing or poorly maintained. In urban areas, unclear institutional
responsibilities cause losses to society by making planning and tax collection difficult, impeding
development of land and financial markets, encouraging encroachment on public land, and contributing to
disputes that reduce investment and take a long time to resolve. High stamp duties compound this by driving


                                                       5
transactions into informality or by encouraging spurious valuations, undermining everybody’s ability to
properly price land and possibly opening scope for corruption. Restrictions on land leasing that may have
been justified a long time ago make it difficult for the poor to access land and use it in line with its potential.
And public sector capacity to properly perform the regulatory and administrative functions required to
identify ownership of land and market-mediated transfers to its best use has been seriously eroded over
time: Revenue departments in most states collect little or no revenue and spend most of their time on issues
that have nothing to do with land administration and management.
The process also uncovered considerable levels of innovation: Numerous states aimed to address these
gaps by improving mapping, synchronizing spatial with textual records, ensuring automatic mutation by
requiring proof of ownership and consistency with records before registering a transaction, and linking land
records to the courts and banks to prevent fraud. Town planning schemes have successfully been applied
to allow urban expansion without the need for highly conflicting processes of land acquisition. Courts and
public land management have been computerized to allow tracking of disputes and greater transparency.
But lessons from such reform efforts were often not learned even within the states that adopted them as
measures as these were not well sequenced, justified, or documented in a way that would have allowed a
clear demonstration of their impact. This limited the scope for drawing lessons and disseminating them to
other states. One of the insights from the LGAF process is that even “advanced” states can learn much from
institutional arrangements adopted or reforms undertaken in lagging ones; and taking different reform
efforts together can provide many of the elements needed to make progress on land governance in India.
States will have a major role to play to address common challenges: The state reports point towards several
common areas for action on a number of issues that, in one way or another, emerged as problematic in all
states, such as :
       Move towards conclusive title for rural land through transaction-based updating of records by (i)
        synchronizing records and registration and making registration contingent on production of a map
        following the example of the pre-mutation sketch in Karnataka; (ii) ensuring automatic updating
        (mutation) of records in case of transfer; (iii) recording all land-related encumbrances and charges
        by public or private entities; and (iv) reducing stamp duty to reduce scope for informality and
        misreporting of prices, ideally in a way that offsets associated revenue losses through other charges,
        for example, land taxes.
       Use low-cost image-based, systematic, and participatory methods with private sector participation
        and cost recovery in line with demand and ability to pay to establish an integrated urban cadastre
        that can be used beyond the land sector as a basis for (i) effective planning of urban land use and
        expansion; (ii) land taxation to facilitate public investment that in turn increases land values; (iii)
        identification and management of public land, including prevention of unauthorized encroachment;
        and (iv) regular and reliable reporting of land and real estate price indices to aid private sector
        decision making.
       Use existing records in combination with other data to identify rural areas where the level of land
        values and land market transactions warrant a complete resurvey. Build on experience with
        systematic, participatory models for image-based surveys to adjudicate land and rigorously
        evaluate these to develop business models and to implement these in collaboration with the private
        sector on a full or partial cost recovery basis.
       Create and publicize a spatially referenced inventory of public land and, in doing so, evolve a clear
        policy to address encroachment on public land. Establish clear standards to decide in what cases or
        for what purposes public land can be transferred to private interest. In case of a transfer, rely on
        competitive and transparent mechanisms, ensure that local land users and the public at large share
        the benefits, and put in place mechanisms to monitor and enforce compliance with contractual
        obligations as needed.


                                                        6
       Recognize, record, and map at appropriate scale hitherto unsurveyed individual and communal land
        and resolve ambiguity about responsibility for assigning rights to such land between forest and
        revenue departments. Link this to a campaign of awareness-raising and support to recognition of
        communal claims in a way that makes use of the potential of recent legislations such as the FRA
        and explore options for imagery-based monitoring of the impact of doing so on land use.
       Adjust the institutional framework for land tenure and management to ensure land information is
        comprehensive, of high quality, and readily available to interested parties at low cost. Explore the
        advantages from a dedicated agency to administer rural and urban land rights, linked to models that
        would allow such an agency to be sustainable financially. Link this with greater decentralization of
        responsibility for management of certain types of land to local bodies in line with the Constitution’s
        73rd & 74th Amendments and the PESA.
       Improve the poor people’s access to land by recognizing tenancy and taking measures to improve
        functioning of land lease markets. Explicitly account for limited capacity for enforcement and
        potential adverse incentives when drafting legislation and regulations that aim to (i) restrict certain
        types of land transfers; (ii) regularize unauthorized occupation; and (iii) restore possession of
        granted land to the original grantees.
       Decisively pursue options to increase women’s land ownership, in particular by raising awareness
        on the HSAA, registering assigned or granted lands in females’ names and exploring the use of
        incentives for private parties who put females’ names on land records . Link this to consistent
        monitoring and impact assessment to identify effective approaches to increase female land
        ownership, flag potentially adverse effects, and ensure consistent implementation across states.
       Put in place an IT-based case management system for land disputes and use this, together with a
        clear typology of land dispute cases, to monitor case load and identify gaps in policy that may need
        to be addressed to reduce disputes in the most expeditious manner. Consider time limits on cases
        and complementing formal courts with advisory, conciliatory, and adjudicatory institutions as well
        as creation of awareness and capacity at the local level to help prevent and resolve land disputes.
Though limited, the role of central Government is pivotal: This does not mean that the central Government
will be irrelevant—quite to the contrary it can perform a number of essential functions:
       Overcome institutional fragmentation and accord land the priority it deserves. If land is indeed an
        increasingly binding constraint, it should to be dealt with in an evidence-driven way by bringing
        together the institutions (Department of Land Resources, Ministry of Environment and Forests,
        Ministry of Tribal Affairs, and Ministry of Urban Development) involved at central and state levels
        to provide technical leadership and continuity on cross-cutting and systemic issues. If a body of
        this nature is placed sufficiently high in the hierarchy and accompanied by proper publicity, this
        could also help arrest (and ideally reverse) the decline of the Revenue Department’s reputation,
        bring it to the cutting edge of technology, and encourage foster institutional and technological
        innovation at state level.
       Build capacity to move from a reactive to a proactive mode of engagement that is firmly grounded
        in evidence rather than ideology and prejudice. The potential to overcome institutional
        fragmentation and address system-wide issues will allow interventions in the land sector to be less
        ad hoc and more proactive to improve functioning of the overall system and use evidence to test
        the extent to which desired outputs are delivered and outcomes achieved. This can help not only
        identify gaps, but also find ways in which these can be closed and high priority areas to do so can
        be prioritized, design a more differentiated set of interventions and to prioritize and sequence their
        implementation so as to most effectively improve land governance in the medium term.

          Allocate public resources in return for demonstrated impact: Although India has spent considerable
           resources on improving land records, the effectiveness of resource use was often low. A stronger
           focus on monitoring and comparison across states can not only increase the efficiency of resource
           use but also describe and disseminate good practice across states, promote innovation and sharing
           of experience across states, thus supporting rapid upscaling of proven practices.

2. THE LGAF METHODOLOGY AND ITS APPLICATION TO INDIA
LGAF is a tool for self-assessment of land governance: To comprehensively assess the status of land
governance in their states as compared to global good practice, a number of states—Andhra Pradesh (AP),
Bihar (BI), Jharkhand (JK), Karnataka (KA), Odisha (OD), West Bengal (WB)—requested, in 2013,
support to conducting a self-assessment using LGAF in their state, by way of the Department of Land
Resources, Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India. The LGAF is a tool developed and
spearheaded by the World Bank to help countries assess and rank their land governance status against global
good practice using a common framework in a highly participatory process. DoLR fully endorsed this effort
as a way of fostering experience sharing and dialogue across states1.
It follows a participatory, yet technically rigorous process: The LGAF process is based on comparing the
situation in a country or state to global good practice along a large number of dimensions, each of which
are ranked on a 4-level scale (A to D) by panels of key experts and stakeholders based on their own
experience that is informed by a summary of existing information in the relevant area made available to
them by ‘expert investigators’. Five main topic areas are covered, namely (i) recognition of existing rights;
(ii) land use planning, management, and taxation; (iii) public land management, (iv) public provision of
land information; (v) dispute resolution and conflict management. Key steps of the procedure as detailed in
the manual and illustrated on the LGAF website involve expert investigations to synthesize background,
multi-stakeholder panel sessions to assign ratings in light of this, and public validation and policy
workshops to draw out conclusions. The objective is (i) to have implementation to be country-driven,
objective, based on existing evidence rather than new research; (ii) to arrive at a consensus on priority areas
for action by key stakeholders including gaps in existing evidence; areas for regulatory or institutional
change, piloting of new approaches, and interventions to significantly improve land governance; and (iii)
to identify criteria to assess the effectiveness of these measures.
LGAF helped stimulate broad-based dialogue on land in some 40 countries: With the goal of identifying
good practice and reach consensus on priority areas for reform and for the testing, evaluation, and roll-out
of new approaches to address key gaps, a set of monitoring indicators for land, the LGAF has thus far been
applied in some 40 countries.2 In many cases this helped put land higher up on a country’s agenda and
create a broad-based consensus on key reforms that can form the basis for continued multi-stakeholder
dialogue based on progress monitoring at national or sub-national level. It has also given rise to monitoring
efforts and programs to improve land governance supported by a number of partners.
A number of changes were made to adapt LGAF to the Indian situation: In India, as land is a state subject,
application of the LGAF had to be at state level. A set of well-established institutions was chosen to
coordinate the process in each state (writing of background reports, conduct panel assessments, discuss
results in a state level validation workshop, and have follow-up discussions with policy makers), under the

in undertaking a land governance assessment by way of the Department of Land Resources, Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India.
In each of the participating states, the function of State-level Coordination (SC) is performed by a well-reputed local institution, which selected a
team of local experts to implement the assessment under guidance of state coordinator.

guidance of a national Secretariat.3 To adjust the LGAF to the Indian context, a few modifications to the
original framework were made: First, a TAG of eminent Indian experts was established to ensure
consistency and methodological soundness of dimension ratings across states, and feed results into ongoing
policy processes and dialogues.4 Second, dimensions were adjusted to India’s context and distributed over
nine panels.5 Third, to promote joint understanding and sharing of experience across states, a series of
workshops was held.6

3. ANALYSIS OF RECOMMENDATIONS BY PANEL
The main outcome from the LGAF exercise are documented in six state reports which, in some cases for
the first time, provide a comprehensive evidence-based assessment of land issues that draws on involvement
by many social groups who have to deal with the consequences of weak land governance on a regular basis.
Results from this assessment are synthesized in aggregate ratings (see Annex 2) as well as policy matrices
for each state (see Annex 1).

3.1 LAND RIGHTS RECOGNITION
3.1.1      Diagnosis
Very progressive laws often fail to have much impact in practice: Although India has a legal framework
that aims to provide high levels of tenure security and to promote equity in land access, implementation of
laws has often been fraught with problems and often faced resistance. But a critical evidence-based review
of the extent to which, under often significantly changed external conditions, laws still serve their intended
purpose has not been conducted. This would be much-needed as some laws appear to no longer achieve
their desired goals and may even give rise to consequences that are contrary to the original spirit of the law.
For example, political resistance to far-reaching land reforms and a desire to prevent tenants from acquiring
long-term rights may have led to large-scale eviction of tenants at the time when reforms were promulgated
(Appu 1997) and a long-term decline in the supply of land to rental markets that may have reduced the
ability of poor land-scarce households to access land. Although land reforms undertaken after independence
were very successful (Banerjee et al. 2002; Deininger et al. 2008; Ghatak and Roy 2007), more recent
measures aiming to redistribute land through imposition of ceilings, restrictions on tenancy, or rent control
have often been less effective, partly because subdivision had already decreased farm sizes significantly
and function of markets improved over time with broader economic growth. Similarly restrictions on sub-
leasing by land reform beneficiaries that may have been justified in the immediate aftermath of reforms
may in the long term have constrained investment and efficiency of land use (Deininger et al. 2013).
Land use restrictions may generate uncertainty or be ignored: In many states, the right to own, transfer,
or convert agricultural land to non-agricultural uses is subject to restrictions, including (i) the need for self-
cultivation so that anybody who does not cultivate land personally is not entitled to hold agricultural land;
(ii) a requirement to be an agriculturist or an agricultural worker by profession; (iii) a maximum non-

workshop in Bhubaneswar (June 2014), and national dissemination workshop in Delhi (Sept. 2014).

agricultural income; (iv) and a ceiling on the amount of land owned. Transfer of land by allottees and tribals
is restricted, at least for an initial period of time. Failure to record relevant information makes it very
difficult to enforce such provisions, implying that they are often widely ignored in practice.
The transformative potential of progressive gender legislation is not fully utilized: The 2005 HSAA marks
a sea change with enormous potential to change social attitudes in a way that will improve welfare of
females (Deininger et al. 2013a) and their offspring (Deininger 2014). To effectively implement it and
prevent backlash (Rosenblum 2013), the extent to which women’s rights are recorded needs to be monitored
(Landesa 2013). Also, schemes giving land preferentially to females or encourage their registration (for
example in Odisha or AP), should be evaluated to allow drawing generalizable conclusions.
Low quality and inconclusive nature of records undermine investment and effective land use: Although
land records in India have a long tradition, legal provisions that give existing records only presumptive
value, lack of maintenance, and institutional overlaps undermined their usefulness (Wadhwa 1989). There
are also significant gaps in existence or currency of spatial records: No cadastral ownership record exists
in urban areas, rural records exclude ‘marginal’ areas, and mandated rural resurveys have often not been
carried out for generations. In line with the view that a move towards conclusive title is essential (Wadhwa
2002), DoLR has in 2011 prepared a Land Titling Bill to not only establish conclusive records but also
create a new Titling Authority. But without improving the quality of the underlying information, a legal
change will have little impact on the ground.
3.1.2   Recommendations
Review and reduce tenancy restrictions: Extent and severity of market imperfections that originally
prompted introduction of tenancy restrictions have been much reduced. In a growing economy with many
non-farm employment opportunities, this does not eliminate tenancy but rather drives it underground and,
in the process, undermines tenants’ long-term security and their ability to access credit and inputs as well
as all parties’ incentive to make productive land-related investments. The fact that not all those who would
otherwise participate in land markets are able to do so reduces the ability to reap the benefits from land
market operation in terms of improved land use. Ending the total ban on tenancy would thus be desirable
and documenting the impacts of doing so in pioneer states will provide much needed evidence to inform
policy and document risks for others. The overwhelming response to the issuance of licensed cultivator
cards in AP highlights the magnitude of tenancy and the potential benefits from regularizing it.
Review restrictions on agricultural land transfer, use, and ownership: Restrictions on the right to alienate
the land granted to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (SC/STs) need to be carefully reviewed to assess
the extent to which the underlying objective of preventing myopic and potentially welfare-reducing
transfers is achieved in a way that does not preclude economic diversification. In addition to making sure
that relevant restrictions are recorded (so as to forestall illegal transactions), limiting land transfers to the
community or requiring to obtain community consent for transfers may be effective in high risk situations
where land is a safety net (Andolfatto 2002) and has high cultural value.
Ensure automatic mutation as a precondition for a move towards conclusive title: Through emphasis on
record computerization, the Government of India created a necessary precondition that can allow states to
move towards conclusive title through back office linkage. If manual records are abandoned, an automatic
link between registry and records established, and the registrar is required to check not only parties’ identity
but also pre-exiting records to ensure the seller actually owns the land and any restrictions on land use are
known to all parties, the quality of existing records can at least be maintained and further deterioration
prevented. Karnataka has moved further by also requiring a pre-mutation sketch in cases if boundaries are
changed. If consistently implemented and linked to a proper base map, this would allow moving towards
conclusive title through sporadic updating, a method used in Scotland to move from a system of deeds
recording to title registration (Scottish Law Commission, 2010).



                                                       10
Systematically monitor HSAA implementation: Evidence on the extent to which HSAA provisions are
complied with is a precondition for designing measures that can help make implementation of this law more
effective. As any case of land transfer in the course of succession will involve administrative processes,
such information can be generated at minimum cost if relevant forms are designed to incorporate gender
information. The resulting data will be of use not only for assessing the impact of inheritance reform but
also to gauge if gender-positive laws such as the mandate to register assigned land received through
Government transfer schemes or through implementation of the FRA jointly or in females’ name only. If
combined with household surveys, this will also allow an assessment of the impact of such measure on
females’ social and economic empowerment and associated household-level outcomes.

3.2 COMMUNAL AND FOREST LAND
3.2.1   Diagnosis
Unsettled legal status of vast forest areas negatively affects forest dwellers’ livelihoods: Forest policies
since British days often denied formal land rights to tribal people who had been living in forests for a long
time, thus increasing their insecurity. In some LGAF states, this remains an issue as large tracts of forest
land are still unsettled: For example, in AP, settlement is still pending in 986 blocks with an area of 12,345
km2 (out of a total forest area of 62,100 km2). Similarly, in Odisha, when zamindari estates were abolished,
vast forest lands were vested in Government and notified as ‘deemed reserve forest’ without survey and
settlement. A large share of these forests remains inadequately demarcated or unsurveyed, undermining
forest dwellers’ rights and creating ambiguity in terms of management responsibility. Again, the size of
area affected is enormous: A total of 1,369 forest blocks with an area of 8,847 km2 exist as Proposed
Reserved Forest pending final notification although the Forest Department treats it as deemed reserve forest.
Resources and responsibilities of local JFM institutions remain unclear: Until March 2006, Joint Forest
Management (JFM) committees have been formed in more than 100,000 villages covering some 22 million
hectares of forests. Associated village level institutions such as VFMPCs or VEDCs may exist on paper but
are inactive, partly due to a large number of vacancies (around 50 percent) of forest administrative posts at
village level. A 2001 policy mandating that 90 percent of the forest produce should go to Village Forest
Committees is widely ignored and in the absence of an own source of revenue, JFM institutions remain
dependent on outside resources and unsustainable.
Opportunities for recognition of user rights by FRA are not fully utilized: The FRA provides an
opportunity to gain recognition of land occupied before December 2005 upon submission of a claim through
the Gram Sabha that is then filtered up through committees at block and district levels and monitored at
state level. By October 31, 2014, 3.87 million claims had been filed and 3.2 million disposed of with 1.498
million titles on 2.5 million hectares of land distributed. The example of Maharashtra (MA), where local
training and effective institutional collaboration allowed to use satellite imagery to check claims (Goswami
2014), illustrates the potential of putting this into practice. Yet, progress remains variable across states, with
AP, MA, and Madhya Pradesh (MP) accounting for the bulk of land distributed. Moreover, while the FRA
allows recognition of Community Forest Rights (CFR), the majority of the rights recognized under FRA
thus far remain at individual level—in five states (Chhattisgarh, MA, OD, Rajasthan, and WB) for which
data is available, land awarded under CFR is less than 6 percent of the total.
Recognition of common lands outside of forests remains weak: Many types of common lands are
recognized locally but not recorded with either the Revenue or Forest Department. Availability of these
CPRs to villagers declined substantially over the years, following expansion of state control and
privatization. Resources are often also encroached upon although such encroachment is not monitored and
sometimes even regularized after the event, often resulting in a de-facto open access situation. Permanent
pastures are most affected as they lack protection under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The same
is true for public lands in habitation areas (gram thana), an issue that requires urgent action.

Rural land use planning remains in its infancy: Justified restrictions on rural land use and conversion are
weakly enforced and mechanisms to monitor compliance, including conditions imposed on land conversion
and other rules and regulations are lacking. One reason contributing to this is absence of a Rural Land Use
Board. Identification and legal categorization of common lands remain unclear and ambiguity in the
allocation of management responsibility and procedures encourage encroachments. Rural land use planning
is virtually absent, leading to ad hoc diversion of common land for housing and commercial purposes.
3.2.2     Recommendations
Recognize existing rights to non-surveyed lands: There is an urgent need for reclassifying, identifying and
surveying all non-forest and forest common pool and property resources including different types of
commons. The boundary disputes between forest department, revenue department, and local stakeholders
should be resolved and conversion of forest villages into revenue villages (FRA Sec 31h) be expedited.
Recognizing long-standing communal rights, even if not formalized, prevents individualization and is very
cost-effective: Mexico’s ejido reforms or demarcation of ancestral claims in the Philippines can provide a
model (Deininger 2014). These have been shown to have very desirable outcomes in terms of productivity
and structural transformation (de Janvry et al. 2012; Valsecchi 2014).
Clarify responsibilities for non-surveyed forest land: It is recommended that the Proposed Reserved
Forests are to be settled as Reserve Forest or Protected Forest at once and that the rights allocation around
CFR under FRA is expedited through a robust participatory, community-led mapping process. Conversion
of forest villages into revenue villages will be a priority. Institutional responsibilities should be clarified
and JFM committees made coterminous with Gram Sabhas (GSs) so as to be streamlined under provisions
of the 73rd amendment as well as the FRA. To protect, conserve and manage the CFR area and associated
resource uses, the GS should constitute a Community Forest Management Committee.
Fast-track and monitor FRA implementation, especially with respect to common land: Cases of large
scale rejection or modification of claims under FRA should be referred back to District Level Committees
(DLCs) for reconsideration or rectification7. All state governments should recognize the GS at the
individual settlement (hamlet or revenue village) level as in PESA, to enable more effective processing of
the FRA. It would also be important to assess impact of FRA implementation, including award of pattas to
women as mandated by the FRA, on vegetation cover and socio-economic well-being.
Improve recognition and strengthen local control over communal land: The progress of identifying CFRs
should be pursued in a campaign mode and community forest rights vested in the GS rather than with JFM
committees. Presuming that all villages have some CFRs, the burden of proof should be with the DLC in
case no CFRs are recognized. Awareness about the means of formalizing group rights over common land
under the Forest Rights Act, 2006 needs to be created as official reports suggest that a large number of
tribes eligible to seek land rights under the Act have not submitted their claims. This also means devolving
authority to local bodies. This may be combined with assistance to formulation of a Rural Land Use Policy
that can be monitored in a standardized and public manner with satellite imagery.
3.3 URBAN LAND
3.3.1     Diagnosis
Dissonance between land administration and planning constrain non-agricultural land supply: With 31
percent, India’s share of urban population is still low compared to other countries such as Indonesia
(45percent) or Mexico and Brazil (78percent and 87percent). In most states, settlement areas (gram thanas)
are delineated as a single plot rather than being surveyed in revenue records and regulations require that a
survey be undertaken once population rises above 2,000. This rarely happens in practice. Moreover, even
where city surveys had been conducted at some point in the past, they are largely obsolete and cover only

7 . The effectiveness and success of GPS-supported participatory mapping process piloted in MP, MA, and Gujarat need to be studied and adapted
to ensure lesser rejections and to avoid future conflicts.

                                                                     12
small part of the currently urbanized area—for example in Hyderabad, the city survey was last updated in
the 1960s. The Revenue Department alone will thus be ill-equipped to handle the expected increase of urban
population from 377 million now to 600 million by 2030.
Lack of a cadastral base-map increases cost of planning: Planning institutions are more forward-looking
with Urban Development Areas extending well beyond the area covered by city survey areas to include
agricultural land, gram thanas, and municipalities still outside the city. But institutional overlaps and
separation of responsibility between planning and development make even minimal structural planning (for
example, for arterial infrastructure) difficult. But, without a common base map, planning is difficult to
conduct and near-impossible to enforce. Thus urban expansion in many cities is mostly unplanned, actions
against violators remain sporadic and regularization of unauthorized occupation at irregular intervals
provides perverse incentives. It results in high cost of ex-post service provision and often inadequate
infrastructure.
Non-enforceable planning and building standards are an added source of informality: Strict norms and
standards that are unattainable for urban dwellers force most of them into informality, creating a thriving
market for ‘exceptions’ that undermines good governance. In Bihar it is estimated that about 60 percent
people are living in houses without obtaining a completion certificate; about 70 to 80 percent of those living
in houses and apartments have no occupancy certificate and around 55 percent of multi-storied buildings
face vigilance cases for violation of Floor Area Ratio.
Inconclusive ownership records reduce land supply and investment potential: No cadastre or base map
exists for urban land and most urban land maps have not been updated since the 1920s. Town surveys,
where they exist, were undertaken long time ago and for a very limited area (covering only 30 of 130 cities
in the former AP, with an age of some 50 years). Tax registers (khatas) are thus widely used as evidence of
tenure and fraudulent, duplicate and overlapping urban land documents lead to conflicts and litigation in
private land and grabbing of public land. This uncertainly freezes out many plots from development, thereby
reducing the supply response.
Policies for low-cost housing are inconsistent and often ad hoc: States have a multitude of schemes in
place to relieve the shortage of housing. But the fact that informality in Indian cities is increasing even as
household incomes have seen a steady rise over the past 20 years suggests that income is not the only factor
and that regulatory constraints and bottlenecks in land supply may put land out of the reach of the urban
poor, in addition to a lack of infrastructure. The National Slum Policy mandates states to allocate clear land
ownership or long term lease to slum dwellers wherever possible and the Government has identified slums
but does not have the data to guide more detailed development.
Innovative policies to improve slums have been developed but tenure is not often recognized: Granting
of tenure rights is constrained by legal disputes but many Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) informally recognize
occupation by providing civic amenities. States such as KA and WB have been devising various schemes
for upgrading to enable slum dwellers to acquire leases or (restricted) ownership rights through monetary
contributions, though the number of beneficiaries has often been limited. Implementation of these could be
improved and made more transparent, for example, by using biometric identification and by recognizing
full ownership rather than only occupancy. And of course, more forward-looking policies to increase supply
of affordable land will be required to address the broader issues.
3.3.2   Recommendations
Establish a complete cadastral map in urban areas: In the absence of a cadastral map for any of India’s
urban areas and city surveys often completely outdated and available only for very limited areas, ULBs use
a patchwork of maps that may include contradictory information for planning, taxation, and registration. In
most cities this implies a need for a complete resurvey to establish the basis for a functioning land records
system that identifies all types of land, which can then be used as a base map by all departments. The Urban
Property Ownership Records Project in four cities of Karnataka shows that creation of accurate data on

                                                      13
spatial and textual ownership through a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) is viable. It can reach coverage
and provide high quality services quickly and affordably if the Revenue Department adjudicates claims in
a timely manner and ULBs as well as the public are aware and recognize associated benefits.
Establish agreed urban boundaries as a basis for collaboration among all institutions: Lack of a statutory
definition of urban areas creates institutional overlap between Revenue Department and Urban
Development Authority (UDA) that negatively affects quality of service delivery. It makes consistent
planning difficult and encourages informal conversion from agricultural to non-agricultural land use in
contravention of existing plans. Once such an urban boundary has been agreed to by UDAs and ULBs, it
can be used to assign responsibilities, streamline processes, and establish a common data to document and
manage public urban land assets.
Simplify and streamline regulations to supply housing & services in urban peripheries: Analysis suggests
that even in cases where land for redevelopment within the city or for new construction at the periphery is
available to accommodate expected urban growth and expansion, outdated standards, lack of planning and
absence of options for benefit sharing (for example, town planning schemes) or models to acquire rights of
way for arterial infrastructure, together with overlapping responsibilities among different public authorities,
may make it difficult to tap into this potential and increase incentives for informal conversion and
development. As such development then often has to be regularized at high cost, addressing these issues
upfront in a concerted effort will be essential to remove bottlenecks and provide serviced land at the urban
periphery more effectively and at lower cost.
Improve identification and management of public land in urban areas: A study of Ahmedabad shows
that a reliable inventory of public land can be built rather quickly based on publicly available data (Ballaney
et al. 2013). This helped to identify a high share of vacant or underutilized public land, suggesting that,
rather than having cities acquire new lands in an often controversial process, it may be possible to identify
public land that is not effectively used and generate significant benefits by either changing regulations to
allow its more effective use or monetizing it. This requires a decision on whether it should remain public,
set aside for weaker sections, or can be auctioned off to generate revenues that could then help to establish
infrastructure. In fact, many states have already initiated drives to identify public land in urban areas.
Guidance to ensure these are methodologically rigorous and on ways to utilize their results will be crucial.
Explore, document, and disseminate innovative means of land-based financing: Large extents of un- or
underused urban land point towards considerable dormant potential to unlock land value by (i) capturing
potential land values increments from public infrastructure construction through use of impact fees,
conversion, betterment, and development charges; (ii) pricing of Floor Space Index (FSI) above a certain
limit, within overall planning guidelines; and (iii) transparent and accountable mechanisms to transfer
public land and in doing so generate funds for infrastructure investment with attention to the needs of the
poor and the marginalized. This is consistent with the key recommendations made in 2011 by the High
Powered Commission on Indian Urban Infrastructure and Services. It will require a complete inventory of
land assets at city level and a clear and transparent decision-making process.
Replace ad hoc regularizations with a coordinated low-cost housing policy: Providing low-cost housing
close to worksite (including rentals) and helping to improve existing informal settlements is an important
issue for social inclusion that is of particular relevance for poor migrants. ULBs often try to address this
through periodic regularization of unauthorized occupation of public land by the poor. As this may create
perverse incentives and addresses only a very small part of the needs, it should be reviewed and a policy
should be evolved based on the need to protect public land and livelihoods (small commercial activities)
and residential needs of the poor, including a more comprehensive view at the urban land supply, the role
of building standards, and the potential of targeted subsidies that can be generated by auctioning off high
value urban land. As much peri-urban land is currently under litigation, it should be linked to a broader,
expeditious, and predictable mechanism to clear up competing existing claims to land that provides an
alternative to formal litigation to allow quick unfreezing of land (see below under conflict resolution).


                                                      14
Provide basic data on land prices and land use regularly: Availability of regular information on prices for
real estate and land as well as the frequency of transactions is an important basis for decisions by private
(for example, banks, insurance companies) and public sectors (planning, tax rates, etc.). In most Indian
cities, such information is currently not available and making it publicly available could help identify
anomalies and market imperfections, improve the basis for investment decisions, and help improve revenue
generation in a way that would make everybody better off.

3.4 PUBLIC LAND MANAGEMENT AND LAND ACQUISITION
3.4.1   Diagnosis
Inconclusive land records contributed to frequent use of land acquisition: The fact that land acquisition
by the state is one of the few mechanisms to obtain ‘clean’ title has, before the coming in force of the 2013
Land Acquisition Act, contributed to this instrument being used even in cases that are not strictly for public
purpose or to address holdout or other types of strategic behavior. This has led to this instrument being used
even in situations that would, in a situation with clear records, have been more easily and more appropriately
handled through direct negotiations between the parties involved.
Acquisition of land for public investment stymied by weak records: Urbanization and economic
development imply a need to construct public infrastructure and provide services. The unsatisfactory nature
of earlier mechanisms to acquire land has given rise to the 2013 Land Acquisition Act which by itself has
been a focus of considerable debate. But, irrespective of the mechanism used, lack of proper records often
makes it virtually impossible to accurately value land, something that has, in a highly publicized case, given
rise to resistance by those affected (Ghatak et al. 2013), contributing to a long-drawn-out process and
eventually the failure of the project. Proper records are also indispensable for more consensual and less
conflicting mechanisms of land assembly such as town planning schemes that have worked very well in
Gujarat (Ballaney) and are often considered a good practice.
Lack of an inventory makes effective management of public land difficult: In the majority of states, public
lands were mapped but not demarcated on the ground, and in most cases maps are no longer in line with
reality. This implies that there is no database for public lands both in urban and rural areas or the extent to
which these have been transferred to private interests. The example of Ahmedabad above demonstrates the
benefits from such an inventory for urban areas which makes proper management of this asset, including
its protection against encroachment. Similarly, in rural areas of Odisha and Jammu and Kashmir (JK), vast
areas are on the record as government land and under the ownership of either Revenue or Forest Department
even though they have been occupied and cultivated for a long time.
Management authority for public land is often unclear: Multiple government agencies are involved in
management and in the allocation of public lands for different purposes, but with limited coordination.
Panchayats’ awareness of their responsibilities under the Constitution (73rd Amendment Act) and PESA
1996, is often weak and human, and financial resources for public land management are inadequate.
Encroachment is considerable: If the public sector fails to actively manage public land, encroachment,
often by powerful interests, becomes an issue. In virtually all states this has become an important issue in
the public debate that has created considerable controversy. In Karnataka, a 2011 committee found large-
scale encroachment on public land especially in the periphery of cities, and estimated that 10 percent of
total public land was encroached, while lack of demarcation and the perception of an implicit promise of
regularization of perceived well-connected individuals resulted in continued rapid loss of a public land.
3.4.2   Recommendations
Harmonize databases to obtain a comprehensive inventory of public land: One important weakness of
India’s land system is that public land is implicitly treated as a residual rather than an important asset that
provides important benefits and thus needs to be managed properly. This is exacerbated by the fact that in
most states, (for example in AP), even the three departments in charge of maintaining land records, that is,

                                                      15
survey, revenue, and registration function in a stand-alone mode and lack a shared computerized database.
Harmonizing information between them is a matter of priority that can then be used to identify and protect
public land both on the ground and in existing maps, and to initiate proceedings to clarify rights in situations
where these are disputed. Having a plan for proper land use can also help obtain an estimate of the amount
of public land that could be available for transfer to private parties through auction or set aside for current
or future public uses. It is also critical to assess the extent of encroachment and develop strategies to deal
with it, possibly through special procedures in relevant courts.
Clarify institutional responsibility to address encroachment and manage public land at local level:
Making public land management and allocation more transparent and participatory requires reforms to
prevent encroachment, issue records to legitimate allottees, and where possible, restore Government lands
that were fraudulently occupied. The Karnataka Land Grabbing (Prohibition) Act, 2011, provides an
interesting model, including greater devolution of responsibility to local bodies including GSs that can be
drawn upon by other states to deal with this important issue.
Replace adversarial schemes of land acquisition with greater emphasis on benefit sharing: There are
many models including the TPS successfully implemented in Gujarat that can provide alternatives to land
acquisition to acquire land for development of infrastructure and industry. As the 2013 Land Acquisition
Act makes land acquisition by the state much harder, such models may become more attractive. An
interesting model to address this and more actively promote benefit sharing is the BI state government’s
effort to act as an intermediary between farmers and investors. Farmers willing to sell are asked to submit
details to the District Magistrate who, once it is verified that the land on offer is free of disputes, informs
the Bihar Industrial Area Development Authority (BIADA) who advertises such lands (including the price
asked by farmers) on its website. This provides investors with price information who would then have a
reference pool of chunks of land to acquire for their ventures. Implementation of this model has, however
been affected by a lack of undisputed land availability that can, in part, be attributed to the weak nature of
land records in the state.

3.5 PUBLIC LAND DISPOSAL
3.5.1      Diagnosis
Various institutions exist to make land available to investors: Most states prioritize industrialization and,
to promote it, aim to attract investment that can provide skills and employment. As land acquisition is often
a major stumbling block, industrial area development boards or corporations are often in charge of acquiring
and transferring land to private industrial use.8 In fact, some states have an explicit policy for the state
government to establish “Land Banks” either by earmarking Government land or by acquiring private land
for setting up industries. Before the coming in force of the 2013 Land Acquisition Act, large tracts of
acquired land were used for private purposes.
Terms of transfer vary widely and are rarely disclosed publicly: Without systematic disclosure regarding
concessions given or on benefit-sharing agreement, details of land transfers are revealed only if questions
arise in the assembly, during audit, or in response to court directives. Third-party monitoring of investors’
compliance with safeguards and mechanisms to ensure adherence are virtually non-existent. Public lease
fees are often only collected when leases are due to be renewed. There are cases of very limited value
capture by government with investors making substantial profits out of the transaction. Land is leased at
concessional rates, well below market values and only little land is auctioned. Evidence from other states
suggests that only part of public land has actually been transferred to the destined use.
Monitoring of compliance with safeguards and lease conditions is often weak: The establishment of
industry and infrastructure like airports, ports, roads and railways, industrial hubs etc., have resulted in the

8
  In addition, the revenue department may directly acquire land for some private or public purposes such as setting up of educational institutions
etc., while Urban Development Authorities and Housing Boards acquire lands and transfer them to private individuals as housing sites.

                                                                        16
alienation of large tracts of Government land. Policy stipulating requirements, which such allotment of
public land for commercial purposes should meet (for example, employment generation and skills
development) exists and relevant parameters are part of the investment plan, but standards for the amount
of land required by different projects are lacking, and monitoring and enforcement are weak partly due to
weak capacity and overlapping responsibilities.
3.5.2      Recommendations
Transfer land at market prices or through competitive auction: International experience shows that
auctioning of public land that is not needed through lease or sale can generate very large revenues that can
be ploughed back into infrastructure development. Most states are legally able to auction government land
with proper oversight and this principle is now increasingly adopted. Proper reporting of outcomes can do
much to increase transparency of land deals as well as any other subsidies state governments think a specific
industry may merit.
Systematically disclose lease conditions and conduct third-party monitoring: While up-front attention to
the conditions under which public land is transferred is warranted, realization of the desired benefits will
depend on the extent to which contractual conditions are actually implemented. To make this happen,
disclosure of contractual conditions has to be complemented with independent third-party monitoring and
easy availability of remedies in case performance deviates from agreed parameters.
Provide adequate legal and technical support to public officials dealing with land: States reported many
cases where lack of information or the ability to get dedicated and specialized legal support led public
officials, who were faced with frivolous lawsuits, to take decisions that failed to maximize overall public
interest, including giving away public land without any legal basis or acquisition of land for specific projects
well in excess of the requirements. Creation of an ombudsman who could be approached in cases like these
could avoid such situations and thus have very positive impact.

3.6 LAND RECORDS AND CADASTRE
3.6.1      Diagnosis
Textual records are often of low quality and limited coverage: The extent and nature of land record
computerization (for example, use of a centralized database and security features), the links between records
and registration or other public institutions, the coverage of public in addition to private land, and the link
of textual to spatial records vary widely across states. In Bihar and Jharkhand computerization remains
incomplete and even where it has officially been ‘completed’, data may not be machine-readable or of low
quality, thus reducing the benefits from high public investment in computerization.9
Land records are of presumptive rather than conclusive value: The Registration Act does not require the
Sub-Registrar to verify ownership details of the land. Without an automatic link between registry and
records and with other institutions such courts, Government departments, and banks that would ensure a
basic examination of title before registration, the act of registering adds little value, and fraudulent or
duplicate documents abound opening the door for fraudulent transfers and litigation.
Spatial records are virtually non-existent in urban and often outdated in rural areas: As most states
failed to conduct periodic resurveys (every 30 years) introduced in colonial times to update spatial records,
these records, especially in peri-urban and urban areas, are seriously out of date and inconsistent with textual
records.10 This, together with the fact that registration of a transaction does not result automatically in
updating of related records, makes it difficult to check registry completeness and systematically identify

9
  Mere scanning of physical files into a PDF format that is not machine-readable does not increase the scope for cross-referencing. In AP, it is
estimated that, due to failure to verify or update records before or while digitizing them, some 30 percent of textual records are incorrect.
10 The situation may be better in rural areas; in a sample of rural records from Odisha, 72 percent of digital textual records could be identified on

the map, while the rest had no spatial correspondence and a much smaller share (4 percent) of spatial records did not have a corresponding entry in
the register.

                                                                         17
gaps and may also lead to a proliferation of boundary disputes. In most states, efforts at computerization
excluded communal and public land, making it difficult to protect such land against encroachment and
creating a danger of creating records that unwittingly regularize it. In 2013, pendency for individual survey
is 23 percent in AP. In Bihar, records are not updated and capacity for maintenance is weak. While most
states recognize the need to update spatial records and numerous pilots have been launched, few of these
are designed in a way that would allow drawing lessons for upscaling and even fewer have actually been
completed and results carefully evaluated.
High fees and inconclusive nature of records reduce incentives for registering transfers: Although
Central Government initiatives to reduce stamp duties had some success, the fees to be paid upon transfer
of property remain among the highest globally, well above the target of 5 percent set at the national level.
In rural areas, this leads to widespread informality (estimated at about 30 percent), with some state
governments aiming to address through periodic drives and incentive schemes to “regularize” such “plain
paper” transactions. High cost of service provision as a result of failure to update regulations to allow use
of modern technology alongside traditional methods (that is, chain and cross tab for surveying) or to allow
private sector entry to compete with public sector monopoly reduces incentives for registration.
Systematic village level reconciliation has fallen into disuse: The annual reconciliation of village records
(jamabandi), verified and approved by a senior officer at district level, implied that in many cases maps
and records at local level were relatively well kept so that a failure to update records at a higher level did
not jeopardize the quality of the system, at least in rural areas. However, this practice has now been
abandoned in most states, creating serious risks for the integrity of information throughout the system.
3.6.2   Recommendations
Adopt a long-term vision for digitization of textual records: Digitization is more than just scanning of
physical files. The usability of land information depends on whether the data is accurate, machine readable
to allow cross-referencing to other databases, available to interested parties with proper security features,
regularly updated, and in a format that can be accessed by others at low cost. State-specific audits could
chart out the way towards realizing the full benefits from computerization of textual records.
Ensure all relevant encumbrances are on the record and checked before registration: While the Record
of Rights (ROR) contains many details on cultivation that may have been critical to assess land revenue,
but are irrelevant in terms of rights (though considerable effort may still be expended to keep these updated),
information on key encumbrances such as bank loans may be missing or not be updated automatically.
Ensuring that such information is included in the record is critical. The example of KA where Bhoomi links
to banks’ and cooperative institutions’ records and efforts to link to the courts are underway shows this is
possible and has inspired other states to follow suit. An equally important issue is to make such records
available to Sub Registrar Offices on an automatic basis to allow checking the legitimacy of transactions
before they are registered, something that requires online links with relevant databases (sub-registrar and
land records, banks, courts, UIDs, and company registries where available) to eventually allow a transition
towards an interoperable up-to-date system of conclusive data.
Explore alternative institutional options: While spatial records in most states are ill-maintained, the case
of WB suggests that having a dedicated institution in charge of land administration can result in much
higher quality of spatial records. In fact, WB is one of the few states where digitization of records and maps
is almost complete and spatial as well as textual information is available. If ways to ensure records are
updated to ensure sustainability are added, this could become a model to be studied and possibly replicated
by other states.
Test guidelines for low-cost rural survey: Bringing spatial records up-to-date after long neglect will require
some time and effort. The size of the task makes cost-effective image-based techniques that draw on
existing data, as much as possible, mandatory. Index maps based on geo-referenced village maps can be a
viable interim solution to prioritize resurvey efforts in some states. In recognition of the need for low-cost,

                                                      18
“fit for purpose” approaches to complement traditional survey methods, some states passed innovative laws
(for example, the Bihar Land Settlement Act 2012) or developed procedures (for example, Bhu Barati in
AP) to guide efforts in this area. Adaptation to local contexts in different settings is still required to define
effective workflows, assess capacity needs, decide where Government is needed, and what elements can be
left to the private sector, and explore models of service delivery and cost recovery. Experience shows that
even with high-precision surveys, administrative procedures to address discrepancies between textual
records and ground realities can be a bottleneck and alternatives that rely on existing map products or aerial
photography or satellite imagery may be possible and much cheaper than current approaches.11 If
accompanied by careful impact assessment, this can provide the basis for rapid upscaling in a key area.
Develop a realistic plan to create spatial records in settled areas: While incremental updating of spatial
records based on index maps can be an option, the almost complete lack of useable maps in urban areas is
likely to require a different approach. High property values also increase benefits from doing so. Different
experiences, including Bhu Barati in AP and award of Property Cards in Karnataka under the Urban
Property Ownership Records (UPOR) provide some lessons: First, in most urban settings an image-based
approach that draws on different sources of existing evidence (for example, tax maps) and includes a
requirement for maintenance, can be implemented quickly and cheaply by the private sector if costs can be
recovered from subsequent transactions. Second, predictable and timely performance of adjudication
functions that cannot be outsourced to private parties is critical. Third, regulations and practical ways to
resolve discrepancies between recorded and measured areas should be in place and understood by the
population. Fourth, unless incentive-compatible mechanisms for updating exist from the start, the transition
towards a conclusive record may be difficult. Finally, the failure to provide ownership records for rural
habitation lands (gram thanas) is no longer justified and options to issue such records, possibly with
decentralization of management responsibility, by local bodies need to be carefully considered.
Ensure spatial records are updated: The effort required to systematically re-establish spatial records can
be justified only if mechanisms to keep such records up-to-date are in place. The case of Karnataka
illustrates that the automatic back-office link between records and registry to check accuracy of textual data
on land owners’ details before allowing a transaction to be registered can, in principle, be extended to spatial
records. This is done by requiring a “pre-mutation sketch” as a precondition for registering any transaction
that involves a modification of parcel boundaries. As regulations require that all parcels within an existing
survey number or subdivision be surveyed before any one of them can be transacted, it creates the basis for
automatic transaction-based updating of spatial records. Combining this with support to private surveyors
to respond to higher demand for surveys at a reasonable price, this measure, which was introduced 2008,
has by now resulted in an estimated 75 percent of parcels being mapped.12 Plans to use it as a basis for an
upgraded land information system to cover all aspects of land governance exist. Thus, even if complete
resurvey to update spatial records is out of reach, transaction-based methods can support a move towards
conclusive title, similar to the experience in countries such as the United Kingdom.
Reduce cost of service delivery and put land administration on a sound financial footing: While states
generate very large revenues from stamp duties, the land administration institutions that should provide the
data to underpin this system are either starved of funds or supported in ways unrelated to performance.
Streamlining procedures and making services more accessible can significantly reduce transaction costs.
Karnataka is one of the few states where the land registry, though not autonomous financially, has generated
large revenues that are used for continued experimentation and development of the system. Careful study
of the financial aspects of land administration is a high priority in two respects, namely (i) the optimum
level of stamp duties to be assessed upon transferring a property and the trade-offs between transfer fees
and land taxes; and (ii) financing models for land administration institutions that are performance-based

   Given India’s restrictive aviation regulations, some states have been experimenting with UAVs to acq uire imagery and discussion of regulatory
issues raised in this context will be required.

   The system is embedded in a software, which automatically assigns surveys, sends notifications, and monitors pendency.

                                                                       19
rather than driven by bureaucratic incentives. This may include revival of the jamabandi as a low-cost and
very robust village-based mechanism of updating records to ensure their continued relevance.

3.7 LAND VALUATION AND TAXATION
3.7.1   Diagnosis
The revenue potential of urban land is underutilized: Performance in terms of revenue generation and
expenditure management is at the core of cities’ competitiveness (Ahluwalia 2014). Although they incur
costs for set-up and administration, property taxes are difficult to avoid, link property values to local service
provision, fall on middle and upper income groups, and increase accountability. But inefficiencies in the
tax system due to a narrow and constrained tax base with many ad hoc exemptions, a high rate of
delinquency, inability to capture market values, and obsolete tax structures hamper the ability of ULBs to
harness the underlying potential. In more than half of the 36 municipal corporations studied, property tax
contributed less than 20 percent of municipal revenue. With better coverage and collection, property tax
yield could be almost quadrupled, to up to 0.8 percent of GDP from currently 0.15–0.2 percent (Mathur et
al. 2009).
Lack of a system to identify all properties is a key factor: ULBs have no system to make a formal count of
all properties in their jurisdiction, severely limiting their ability to obtain an accurate estimate of the
property tax potential. For instance, in Delhi in 2009, only 0.96 million out of an estimated 2.53 million
properties were on the tax register and a recent study estimates that, across major cities, 44 percent of
properties do not pay any tax as they are either not on the tax roll or exempted, often in a highly discretionary
fashion. This results in enormous divergence of tax yields across ULBs; a study of India’s 36 largest cities
found per capita annual property tax revenue range from Rs 1,334 in Mumbai to Rs 25 in Patna. On an
average, only close to one third of the tax potential was actually collected (Mathur et al. 2009).
Land valuations in general and those used for taxes specifically are well below market values: While it
would be possible to approximate market values, current valuations are estimated to be less than third of
market values. As property owners may have strong presence on local bodies, giving ULBs full authority
over rate-setting may result in unrealistically low values or indexing them to inflation. In addition to
regularly updating the register, a centralized valuation board and the setting of guidance values that are
routinely revised can help overcome this.
Weak land records make valuation for public land acquisition more difficult: Missing, inaccurate, and
outdated records also make it more difficult to properly value land in cases of land acquisition. This can not
only delay the inception of investments but may also make it difficult to provide just compensation and
multiply the number of cases that go to appeal as has been demonstrated for the case of land acquisition in
Singur (Ghatak et al. 2013).
3.7.2   Recommendations
Systematically update the tax register with a view towards eventual synchronization: Global experience
suggests that better tax administration is an essential first step towards increasing property tax yields that
will be a precondition for possibly more far-reaching subsequent reforms (Kelly 2013). Addressing gaps in
the tax base through a GIS-based register as a way to increase collection rates to 85 percent has been a
priority recommendation by Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM). Some notable
successes include Bangalore and Ahmedabad. As a result, the latter now has the highest number of assessed
properties per population (Bandyopadhyay 2014). This has not only allowed an increase to property tax
revenue by shifting to an area value-based system (for constructed buildings) but also close the gap in the
tax base that resulted from the fact that vacant land often was not taxed. In the case of Bangalore, it also
provides a basis for planned systematic establishment of an urban cadastre and property records adapting
the model developed under UPOR, highlighting the complementarities between both systems.


                                                       20
Increase consistency of valuations: It is good practice to lay down rules for valuation and updating to
adjust for inflation. To deal with updating, guidance values or circle rates can be set at regular intervals
while giving ULBs some autonomy for adjustments within a band and developing collection strategies. An
independent parcel specific valuation that follows clear standards will further remove discretion and has
much to be recommended, though demanding in terms of data.13
Assess potential benefits from reform more systematically: Use of tax registers existing in several cities
will not only allow simulating the potential impacts of changes in the tax regime such as changes in the tax
base or the rate structure, but also elimination of exemptions. Beyond educating ULBs on the trade-offs
and implications of policy decisions, this could also help to assess the extent to which they are able to
achieve targets set by themselves and to manage this issue more actively and illustrate the associated trade-
offs to the actors involved.

3.8 LAND DISPUTES
3.8.1      Diagnosis
Weak land records contribute to private disputes in many ways: Issues discussed earlier, including the
fact that not all encumbrances are on the record, records and registration are not synchronized, and spatial
records are out of date, create scope for property fraud and contribute to high levels of land disputes among
private parties. While more rigorous analysis based on better court data to substantiate this claim would be
desirable, circumstantial evidence of a strong correlation between the quality of land records and the
incidence of disputes supports this, suggesting that improving land administration is one of the best ways
to reduce disputes’ state.


The number of pending land disputes is high and greatly reduces efficiency of land use: Weak land
records also contribute to private disputes in many ways. While lack of a common classification in most
states makes it separation of land-related from other disputes difficult, 2010 figures from Bihar suggest that
land disputes constituted almost 80 percent of the civil case load (or 20,866 cases), where some 70 percent
of criminal cases had their origin in land disputes. Dispute levels are generally low in rural or well-
established urban areas but high in peri-urban settings due to rapid land use change and land value
appreciation. As pending court cases reduce investment and undermine the efficiency of land use, social
and economic impacts are often pronounced: Court data from Odisha suggest that more than 20 percent of
land-related court cases had been pending longer than five years. Also, while weaker sections may be much
less able to bring a formal claim, cases relating to forcible dispossession of tribals, allottees, or settlers on
public land account for a high proportion of (long pending) cases in many states.
Efforts to improve access and quality of land-related dispute resolution had some success: Formal rural
courts (Gram Nyayalayas) at the panchayat level are empowered to adjudicate on disputes related to rights
to purchase a property, use of common pasturage, use of irrigation facilities, wells and water channels, and
disputes regarding possession of village and farm houses. Assignment of law graduates to panchayats in
some cases is reported to have been effective in improving the quality and speed of rulings at this level.
3.8.2      Recommendations
Computerize courts to better categorize and monitor case load: Computerizing courts provides an
excellent tool to document the categories of disputes in real time and to use this information to identify the
most problematic types that can then be targeted by policy. Despite individual cases of good experience in
some states, a more rigorous categorization of land-related cases would allow to exploit the potential
13An independent valuation by professionals will further help to remove discretion and have the valuation process follow clear standards. West
Bengal undertakes a systematic field-based exercise by the State Valuation Board to consistently list and value properties for tax purposes and
ensure a standardized system across municipalities: This is a good example where a state-level valuation board sets guidelines that can then be
implemented by ULBs.

                                                                       21
inherent in such a measure much better while helping to more quickly identify challenges, respond to needs,
and manage performance.
Establish tribunals to settle case backlog: Given the slow pace and high cost of judicial processes,
establishment of special tribunals to dispose of land disputes quickly can be advisable. The 2009 Bihar
Land Dispute Resolution (BLDR) Act, which is omnibus, and sets clear time frames for disposal and
procedure shows that providing a uniform procedure and forum can go a long way towards effective and
speedy resolution of such backlog. It makes the Deputy Collector Land Reforms (DCLR) as the first Court
and the Divisional Commissioner as appellate authority. By March 2013, 29,649 cases had been filed under
the Act and 20,296 cases disposed of. More than 90 percent of the cases are resolved within one year,
compared to the civil courts where 90 percent of land related disputes take two years or more to get resolved.
Lessons are incorporated into the design of the Bihar Land Tribunal that has been established in 2013.
Improve access to justice and encourage settlement out of court: Beyond the regular system of civil
litigation, the 1987 Legal Services Authorities Act mandates states to clear backlogs in the courts through
lok adalats, that is, courts set up specifically for speedy disposal of cases whose jurisdiction is limited to
cases where parties agree to this forum or if referred to by a court. Judgments by this court are in the form
of an agreement deemed to be a decree of a civil court with no appeals allowed.

3.9 INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
3.9.1   Diagnosis
Overlapping responsibilities among departments result in confusion and gaps: In most states,
responsibility for land is shared by at least four departments plus some independent bodies: Forest land is
managed by the forest department, public and private agricultural land as well as common lands are under
the Revenue Department, urban land is with ULBs, and land for rural housing sites is with rural local bodies.
In addition, land use planning is with the Town and Country Planning Department under the Urban
Development Department, while land for industrial use is often acquired by Industrial Development Boards.
As the above evidence suggests, the fact that all of these institutions use different maps creates overlap and
increases transaction costs as well as the likelihood of conflicts that have to be resolved at high cost.
Absence of systematic sharing of land data within wings of the same department and across departments
makes the transition towards a conclusive ownership record near-impossible.
Land records maintenance is no longer a high priority: From a near-exclusive focus on land records, the
general administrative duties with which the Revenue Department is charged in almost all states have taken
away time and resources from land administration up to a point where it has become a residual activity.
This has seriously eroded the Revenue Department’s capacity to embrace new technologies so that, instead
of being seen at the forefront of technology, it became a backwater. In most states, Revenue Departments
have become a “punishment posting”, undermining the ability to attract talent and resulting in a downwards
spiral that is exacerbated by the inability to establish clear performance standards and quality controls on
record maintenance. The fact that performance is much better in WB where a dedicated department is in
charge of all land records suggests that this is not unavoidable.
Confluence of executive and judicial powers in Revenue Department may create conflict of interest: The
Revenue Department has not only far-reaching powers to administer land records but is also acquiring land
and resolve disputes at taluk level where, as the most senior official, the tahsildar is the first instance to
help resolve dispute. In addition to exploring whether this leads to overload, there is also need to examine
whether the combination of executive and judicial functions runs counter to separation of powers and
creates conflict of interest.
Existing land use plans are often outdated or ineffective: Land use policies at state level often do not exist
and land use plans for many Indian cities have been elaborated long time ago and are no longer up-to-date.
Without an ability to draw on good base maps that are shared between different institutions, and in the

                                                      22
absence of a serious public consultation process, planning is often a costly and long-drawn-out process that
has minimum impact on the ground as resulting plans may be difficult to implement.
3.9.2   Recommendations
Make different departments share a common base map: Having an integrated computerized database for
the different departments charged with maintaining land records can be very effective not only to identify
and visualize gaps as well as overlaps as a precondition for resolving these but also to serve as a basis for
monitoring land use and conversion, identify priority gaps for clarifying land rights, and improve land use
planning. Examples, such as the “one nation one map” policy in the Philippines demonstrate that with high
level support, modern technology, and the potential to overlay with imagery as well as other data layers
including socio-economic ones will make it possible to achieve such integration quickly and use it as a tool
to much better target policies. In the Indian context, the fact that digitized and geo-referenced village and,
in some cases, even parcel maps are available for most states will provide an easy way to perform basic
audit of data quality and consistency check that can help to prioritize areas for intervention. The case of
Bangalore also shows the benefits of this.
Explore options for formation of a single land administration agency: In most states, the scope for
effective land administration is undermined by lack of appreciation for the importance of keeping records
up-to-date and administrative overload within the Revenue Department that led to a serious erosion of
technical capacity. As general administrative duties consume most of the limited resources of the present
day Revenue Departments, land management responsibilities can be vested with a separate land
administration department following the West Bengal Model where a single agency exists, which is one of
the reasons for much better maintenance of land records there than in other states. This department should
be responsible for administration of all types of non-forest lands, both rural and urban, with review and
streamlining of procedures as needed. Once this has been accomplished, a single land code to cover all
relevant aspects of land administration could be contemplated, drawing on insights from relevant Bills and
pilot efforts, in particular those elaborated under Bhu Bharati, as needed.
Assess different financing models for land record maintenance: Revenue Department’s staff in most
states are overburdened with other more urgent tasks; functions are dispersed among departments
(especially between rural and urban), and resources generated go to the general budget, reducing the
incentive and scope for high quality service delivery. While potential for cost recovery is higher in urban
than in rural areas, the vast undisbursed balances under NLRMP clearly highlight that the binding constraint
in India is not the availability of financial resources. In fact, Karnataka established a well-functioning rural
system based largely on revenues from user charges for issuance of RORs. Success of semi-autonomous
land registries with some degree of financial autonomy globally suggests that this should include careful
study of options for financing and partnership with the private sector. This is reinforced by the good
performance of an integrated department in WB and the impact even a very limited scope to charge user
fees had on the ability to innovate in KA.
Draw out links between land tenure and land use more systematically: Realistic planning in a way that
can meaningfully guide implementation is difficult if maps are outdated or lack sufficient detail. Moreover,
many examples from several states highlight that, unless tenure is clarified, actors may not have the
incentives to manage land resources in a way that is sustainable in the long term, rather than just engaging
in short term “soil mining”. The information used to clarify land tenure should be used as a basis for land
use planning. On the other hand, effective land use planning will also require some clarity on land tenure,
and addressing institutional fragmentation and dispersal of landuse related functions across many
Departments (Forest, Tribal, Rural and Urban Development, ULBs).
Explore options for devolving responsibility for land to local government: Although they already play an
important role in terms of conflict resolution and land management in many states, local governments can
take on responsibility for planning land use and administering land rights in particular with respect to public
lands including habitation sites, and selection of beneficiaries for awards of homestead land and house sites.

                                                       23
In scheduled areas, this can be complemented by the GSs effectively taking on the responsibilities given to
them under PESA. There is also vast unutilized scope to devolve management of public land in rural areas
to Gram Panchayats.
Build capacity and enforce performance standards at all levels: The effect on institutional performance
and ability to respond to new demands due to a neglect in maintaining staff numbers, quality, incentives,
while adding administrative tasks is acknowledged in several states that have started recruiting and capacity
building efforts, like for example, in Bihar. Recognition that neglect of basic procedures such as the
jamabandi can undermine the entire land administration system prompted states such as AP to launch large-
scale recruitment drives for village accountants and surveyors and village-level awareness raising.
Combining this with training, use of low-cost technology to maintain textual and spatial records, clear
standards that allow measurement and rewards for good performance, and possibly revival of some of the
processes that have fallen into disuse, can help to ensure better record maintenance and updating.

4    MONITORING PERFORMANCE AND MAINTAINING MOMENTUM
Successful conduct of the LGAF in six states demonstrated the viability of an evidence-based dialogue on
land to promote sharing of experience across states. Moreover, within states, the process brought together
stakeholders with very different views who often had failed to communicate with each other earlier. It
allowed to agree on priority areas for reform. Given that India is very rich in information and the integration
of textual with spatial information (including identification of actual land use based on easily available
satellite imagery) can create powerful new insights, routine generation of data on key indicators based on
administrative data that is already available in the system or that can be generated at low cost to allow
monitoring of progress on land governance on a regular basis could help to measure progress along a
number of key dimensions. Doing so can provide a basis to systematically discover and identify good
practice that can then be documented and disseminated across states (including those who did not participate
in LGAF), manage change, and gradually move towards a more performance-based approach to improving
land governance in India. Specifically,
             It could help to depoliticize the debate by focusing on objective outcomes rather than ideological
              notions, creating an opportunity to not only measure the effectiveness of state governments in terms
              of following up with reform but also assessing its impact as a basis for identification of good
              practice which DoLR can then promote for nation-wide adoption.
             It could focus state efforts on synchronizing information across different sources and ensuring a
              basic level of consistency between them. Together with the ability of disaggregating data from
              administrative sources to the level of blocks, sub-registry offices, or even revenue circles, this will
              also enhance Revenue Departments’ ability to manage internal processes and reward good
              performance.
             By focusing on a limited number of high-level outcomes agreed among relevant stakeholders, it
              could catalyze momentum for policy change, similar to what has been achieved by the World
              Bank’s “Doing Business”14, by creating competition across states.15
To capitalize on these possibilities in a way that builds on what is already practiced in some states, a set of
indicators were discussed and are explained below where, for each indicator, we briefly discuss policy
relevance and justification as well as sub-indicators and extensions that might be of policy relevance but
would require more in-depth policy study.
Land area of different types of land mapped with ownership rights unambiguously recorded
14Potential synergies exist with the GoI initiative to improve the ease of doing business in India at Union and state level as proposed areas for
reform also include some land indicators, such as access to land, the quality and security of land and property records in urban areas, property
transfer process, construction permitting processes, and potentially the efficiency and transparency of court proceedings.
15
   The indicators proposed below could provide an ideal basis for highly policy relevant sub-national indicators on property registration in India
as one example among others where the LGAF process created momentum for sustained land governance monitoring at sub-national level.

                                                                        24
Lack of a cadastral maps and associated ownership records emerged as a key issue in all states for urban as
well as habitation, common, forest, and agricultural lands. Mapping and clarification of the ownership status
of public land is an urgent precondition to prevent encroachment and provide the basis for effective
management of this asset. In fact, inventories of public land have already been initiated by many states.
Examples also demonstrate that rapid improvement of this indicator is possible using modern image-based
technologies (aerial photography or satellite imagery) in ways where the private sector takes on major
responsibilities. Improving on this indicator would also require coordination with other departments, such
as ULBs or the Forest Department, to integrate spatial and textual records they maintain which can provide
the basis for a discussion on how to eliminate overlaps and to identify areas for which no ownership rights
are recorded and which may become candidates for priority attention. This indicator can be quickly
improved upon by mapping public and forest land, securing community rights, or by finding algorithms to
integrate existing spatial data (for example, tax maps) with land ownership data or developing avenues that
would allow using them to establish such records at low cost.
Two groups of sub-indicators may be of interest: First, readily available satellite imagery can be used for
auto-classification of land use to pinpoint location and provide an estimate of the overall magnitude of
different types of discrepancies, for example, (i) “forest” land under agricultural, industrial, or urban
residential use; (ii) “agricultural” land under non-agricultural use of different types; (iii) public or common
land that has been encroached upon. Making such information available can help concerned institutions to
plan remedial action and allow stakeholders to advocate for improvement in specific areas. It may also be
useful to explore the extent to which other map products, in particular tax maps, could not only document
occupancy but possibly also serve as a basis for ownership records in specific settings. Of course,
information on land use can be overlaid with other geographic features to identify disaster-prone areas and
identify means to mitigate risk and planning for resilience.
Second, imagery for earlier dates, possibly together with administrative records, can be used to locate and
quantify different types of (authorized or unauthorized) land use change. Combining this with data from
other sources (household or employment surveys or census data, poverty maps, remotely sensed data that
can proxy for economic activity) will allow analysis of the extent to which such land use change was
conducive or detrimental to overall socio-economic development.
Number of textual versus spatial records
This indicator, which should be routinely available if records are computerized, emphasizes the extent to
which maps exist and are in sync with textual records. Scoring on the indicator can be improved either in a
sporadic way by requiring a pre-mutation sketch or systematically through resurvey of areas. The
underlying data (most likely only for revenue lands; see also indicator 3) can be used to generate index
maps and assess coverage of the system by group of land owners (for example, women or SC/STs).
Disaggregating for different domains (rural, urban, public land, or administrative units, possibly overlaid
with indicators of economic potential or poverty) will allow prioritizing areas where initiatives for
improvement should focus.
Discrepancies between sanctioned and actual land use can provide a first indication of records being out of
date and the systematic lack of updating of spatial records. In agricultural areas where textual records are
usually of good quality, comparison of area covered (and the gender of individuals referenced) between
textual and (scanned / vectorized) spatial records can be very relevant for policy with large discrepancies
implying that systematic rather than sporadic efforts at resurvey being more appropriate.
Registered versus mutated transactions
High levels of pending mutations and the associated disconnect between registration and mutation,
undermine good governance and can give rise to fraudulent transactions. Monitoring this indicator will be
useful also to provide evidence on the extent to which certain groups are able to acquire and retain formal



                                                      25
land ownership, something that is particularly important to monitor the impact of government programs
aiming to increase the level of land ownership by women and other disadvantaged groups.
In an ideal situation all transactions would be registered and mutated to keep spatial and textual records up-
to-date. High transaction costs of registering, in particular stamp duties, may push transactions into
informality. Even for registered transactions, few states put in place a system of automatic mutation. With
a computerized system, doing so is not difficult, creating scope to make rapid progress on this indicator.
Categorizing transactions or parties involved (adding geo-referenced parcel information as needed) can
enhance the usefulness of the indicator by obtaining information on recorded prices to not only report real
estate price indicators over time but also to quantify the extent of under-reporting (that is, the gap between
real and reported prices) and, by comparing over time, to assess the extent to which institutions are able to
access land before or after the 2013 Land Acquisition Act having come into force. States have long used
information on levels of pendency and time elapsed between registration and mutation for specific
transactions as a management tool or combined it with SMS notification services and automatic ways of
obtaining client feedback. Changes in this indicator over time provide an immediate measure of the
effectiveness of policies aimed to increase land ownership by specific groups, most prominently the HSAA,
and to take corrective measures when required.
Tax collection and mapping
Own revenue by local governments in India is quite limited, making them highly dependent on transfers.
Data on assessed versus collected amounts of land tax across cities and between India and other countries
can help quantify the extent to which the current tax potential is realized. This could then serve as basis for
further analysis to draw out the fiscal implications of better coverage with tax maps or different rate
structures, something that is of great interest from a financial perspective. In India, this will also be relevant
to explore revenue-neutral options to reduce extraordinarily high levels of stamp duty that are believed to
encourage informal transactions or under-reporting of sales values without encouraging efficient land use.
Level of pending disputes
The LGAF in virtually all states provided anecdotal evidence on the pervasive nature of land disputes. It
highlighted that, with some additional effort in categorizing disputes and building on ongoing efforts to
computerize the courts that deal with them, it will be possible to obtain better information not only on the
nature of disputes but also on effective solutions for their early resolution. In addition to providing a tool
for courts to manage case flow and measure performance, this will be important in three respects, namely
to (i) help identify priority areas for capacity building and clarification of laws and regulations; (ii) draw
out the economic consequences of disputes and their incidence across different social groups; and (iii)
assess the effectiveness of legal changes and interventions to increase awareness and build capacity on the
incidence and disposal of disputes.

5   PRIORITIES FOR A NATIONAL AGENDA
Although the fact that land is a state subject implies that most of the action is required at state level, the
center has an important role in terms of (i) fostering innovation, (ii) setting standards (including clarification
of national laws where needed) and building capacity; and (iii) tracking performance in a way that can
easily identify good practice in individual states, reward it, and support its adoption by other states.
5.1 Monitoring and establishing feedback loops
The LGAF has created significant interest and willingness to follow up and monitor in participating states.
This offers an opportunity to establish a system that, while allowing for more details in individual states as
needed, uses a consistent set of common indicators as discussed above. These indicators should (i) focus
on high level outcomes that can then be disaggregated (and form sub-indicators as needed); (ii) be
comprehensive to cover most aspects of land governance; (iii) allow for disaggregation to lower
administrative units so as to double up as a management tool; (iv) be comparable across states to facilitate
learning and even help create peer learning; and (v) be actionable. Such indicators, if implemented
consistently, could not only go a long way towards making central Government programs such as NLRMP
more performance based but would also help to build capacity at the state level.
While states can decide on their own indicators to supplement a set of national ones (as many did), central
support to a limited set of indicators is critical to provide methodological guidance to ensure a consistent
and comparable set of data and to use resulting evidence for comparing performance across states and help
set national priorities in terms of innovation and capacity building. Publicity could then be created through
workshops at state level that would feed into a regular national event (for example, an annual ‘LGAF
forum’).
To take this forward, it is suggested to have a national lead agency to (i) develop a methodology for
assessing these indicators; (ii) pilot its application in coordination with leading institutions in selected
LGAF states as well as Unions and states expressing interest in reform and associated performance
monitoring as part of the ease of “Doing Business” initiative; (iii) use data generated in this way to develop
a format for regular reporting; and (iv) elaborate concrete examples to illustrate how these data can be used
to provide new and relevant insights on some of the policy issues that have surfaced in the LGAF discussion.
5.2 Overcoming institutional fragmentation
Legal issues include (i) providing an enabling legal environment for transparent and open e-governance;
(ii) identifying key elements of legislation that can help facilitate the transition towards a system of
conclusive title; and (iii) reviewing efforts at harmonization of land laws to distill relevant lessons and
identify priority pieces of legislation to be revised.
On the institutional side, it will be important to explore ways to integrate existing land institutions in a way
that transcends traditional boundaries (including that between rural and urban) and that could make them
autonomous financially subject to fee structures being in line with basic equity objectives.
Finally, central Government can play a key role in helping to implement cost-effective solutions by (i)
making available imagery and base maps to establish a common spatial data infrastructure; (ii) providing
platforms that can link different types of records and allow automatic updating; and (iii) encouraging
solutions that create incentives for maintenance and updating of records rather than one-off resurveys.
5.3 Reviewing criteria for allocating public resources
While India has seen numerous “pilots” in the area of land, most of them were large in scope (focusing on
a district and neglecting the enormous heterogeneity found within such a large unit) with a narrow focus on
survey rather than integrated record management or improved land use. Often, these pilots lacked clear
criteria to assess success or failure, time frames, and strategies to scale up. Partly as a result, few were

completed or analyzed with a view to providing broader lessons. To remedy this it will be important to
develop solutions to typical situations around land governance (see below) in ways that allow for rigorous
evaluation and make the resulting evidence public so as to allow quick learning and replication across states
and upscaling of successful approaches.
“Typical” issues to be covered in this context include (i) the creation of land records in previously
unsurveyed rural areas in ways that recognize individual and communal patterns of occupation and use; (ii)
inventorying, demarcating, and clarifying management responsibility for public land; (iii) updating and
spatially referencing rural records in contexts where these have either not been well maintained or are
severely out of date; (iii) drawing on existing records of land use to create spatial and textual land records
in non-slum urban areas and issue ownership documents; (iv) participatory planning, mapping, and tenure
upgrading in informal settlements; and (v) ensuring access to land for the poor in rural and urban areas.
While there will be differences in the relative importance of each of these topics and not all will require
piloting in every state, it will be desirable to have pilots on each topic in more than just one state to allow
adaptation to local specificities, facilitate experience sharing, and create capacity.
While the initiative for such pilots would have to come from individual states, the fact that well-designed
and implemented pilots will have positive impact on other states can justify central funding. To achieve
this, it will be important that such efforts be selected on a competitive basis and subject to satisfying
minimum criteria with respect to (i) a clear results framework, theory of change, and quantitative targets
for success and failure; (ii) rigorous, independent, and multi-stakeholder monitoring of the extent to which
targets are achieved; and (iii) a strategy to disseminate and scale-up approaches that have been verified and
proved to be successful.
