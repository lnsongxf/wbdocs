                                                   FOREWORD

I t is my pleasure to present the fifteenth edition of the World Bank’s Kenya Economic Update, at a critical juncture for Kenya
  as it transitions from the completion of the Second Medium Term Plan (MTP-II, 2013-2017) to MTP-III (2018-2022), which
is currently under preparation. The report has four main messages.


First, Kenya’s economic growth continued to outperform its peers in 2016. In contrast to the slump in economic growth in
Sub-Saharan Africa to 1.5 percent (a three decade low), growth in Kenya accelerated for the third consecutive year reaching
5.8 percent. Kenya’s robust growth performance was supported by lower oil prices, favorable agriculture output in the first
half of 2016, a tourism sector rebound, strong inward remittances, a relatively stable macroeconomic environment and
improvements in the steady easing of certain supply-side constraints due to earlier public investments.


Secondly, due to emerging headwinds, economic activity in Kenya will encounter some speed bumps in the near to
medium term which will likely impact MTP-II implementation and should inform the scope of the MTP-III. These headwinds
include, the ongoing drought, depressed private sector credit growth, the rise in oil prices, and fiscal pressures. However,
the completion of phase one of Standard Gauge Railway and a projected strengthening of the global economy is expected
to provide some tailwind. The net effect of these changes in the economic landscape will likely cause near term growth to
moderate to 5.5 percent in 2017 before picking up to 6.1 percent by 2019 as headwinds (e.g. drought) subside.


Third, sustaining Kenya’s robust growth will require safeguarding its hard earned macroeconomic stability by continuing to
implement prudent fiscal and monetary policies. The consolidation of the fiscal stance in line with the Medium Term Fiscal
Framework should help anchor macroeconomic stability and create the fiscal space for a public investment drive supportive
of the medium term plans. Further, given the systemic importance of the banking sector, addressing the unintended
consequences of the interest rate caps should help strengthen financial intermediation in the Kenyan economy.


Finally, while Kenya’s growth has been robust, there are latent opportunities to accelerate growth to levels necessary to
achieve Vision 2030. This report identifies some of these growth and job-creation opportunities as well as the need to
address a critical social need by supporting the development of the housing market for lower income households in
Kenya. On the demand side, a key constraint to housing is finance. The report addresses policy measures that can be taken
to alleviate the housing finance problem, including those that have worked well in other middle income countries.


The World Bank remains committed to working with key Kenyan stakeholders to identify potential policy and structural
issues that will enhance economic growth and keep Kenya on the path to upper middle income status in accordance
with the aspirations of Vision 2030. The semi-annual Kenya Economic Update offers a forum to discuss these development
trends. We hope that you too will join us in debating topical policy issues that can contribute to fostering growth, shared

BOXES
Box B.1: Is Kenya loosing competitiveness in the East African market?

     1.	 Kenya’s merchandise trade performance has been dismal in recent years, in particular its exports to the East African
     Community. Kenya’s merchandise exports contracted by an estimated 23.3 percent in 2016. In part, this reflects weakness in
     global trade. In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, global trade has been subdued on account of weak demand and
     structural factors (Matoo et al, 2015). Nonetheless, the contraction in Kenya’s exports is not only due to weakness among its high-
     income trading partners. Worryingly, Kenya’s exports to the EAC saw a significant decline in 2016, a region where growth has
     remained relatively resilient. Of further concern is that longer term trends show that Kenya’s exports to the EAC have been on a
     decline for the past several years: export growth in value terms was some 29.5 percent in 2007 but has since contracted to a low
     of -8.9 percent in 2013. The decline in Kenya’s exports to the region in recent years has occurred despite overall growth in EAC
     intraregional trade, reflecting the stronger growth performance of its regional trading partners. This begs the question whether
     Kenya is becoming increasingly less competitive in the EAC region?


     2.	 Decomposition of Kenya’s export performance show that both agricultural and manufactured products contributed to
     the decline. The loss in Kenya’s exports to the region is particularly reflected in its trade with the region’s two other large economies.
     While Ugandan and Tanzanian imports grew at 12.4 and 16.0 percent respectively over the 2000-2015 period, their imports from
     Kenya only increased by 4.3 percent and 6.3 percent. Agricultural products whose exports to the EAC has weakened the most over
     the past 10 years include: cereals (HS10), Products of milling industry; malt and starches (HS11), lac; gums, resins & other vegetable
     (HS13), animal or vegetable oils (HS15), sugar and sugar confectionery (HS17). For instance, in Uganda, Kenya’s largest EAC market,
     the growth rate of (HS11) and (HS13) imports from Kenya declined by 25.3 percent and 11.6 percent respectively over the (2000 to
     2015). Similarly, manufactured goods whose exports to the EAC has weakened the most over the past 15 years include: Chemical
     products (HS38), Plastics (HS39), Photographic or cinematographic (HS37), Raw hides and skins (HS41), Paper and paper boards
     (HS48), Glass and glassware (HS70) Iron & steel products (HS72) Electrical machinery & equipment (HS85), Motor vehicles (HS87)
     and Musical instruments; parts and ace (HS92). Further, in Tanzania, Kenya’s second largest EAC market, the manufacturing imports
     growth from Kenya has declined by 6.2 percent over the compounded annual growth of fifteen years compared to 16.8 percent
     of its manufacturing imports to the World over the same period. The products that contributed to this growth include: (HS 37),
     (HS41) and (HS92). However, it needs to be mentioned that Kenya has also gained market share in a few select dynamic export
     markets including European Union, Asia and America. Nonetheless, the losses far outweigh these gains, thus leading to the overall
     declining trend. Given the importance of manufactured exports in supporting the diversification of Kenya’s economy, the loss of
     market share in these products has implications for diversification of the Kenyan economy.


     3. 	 How does Kenya regain its competitiveness in its backyard? Kenya has become less competitive in the EAC due mostly
     to cheaper products to EAC markets from elsewhere, in particular East Asia (including China). For instance, in both Tanzania
     and Uganda, the share of East Asia (including China) exports has increased from some 45 percent to 60 percent over the past
     decade. This has not only driven down market shares of Kenya’s exports but also that of other countries. However, for Kenya,
     the EAC market remains an important market, and provides a good platform to be able to compete globally. Reversing the
     decline in Kenya’s competitiveness is of paramount importance and will require both domestic policy actions to improve the
     competitiveness of Kenyan firms as well as efforts on a regional level to improve market access for Kenyan products and a much
     freer flow of goods within the EAC.


     4.	 At the domestic level, this will require policy actions to address the very low levels of labor productivity in Kenya (even
     compared to the Sub-Saharan African average). Labor costs in Kenya remain high relative to output and regional peers. While
     Kenya has invested in broadening access to education, the pay-off to educational investment has been low. Many educational
     assets sit idle because of mismatches, reinforcing the impression that Kenya is not making productive use of its available labor force.
     Several measures are needed to promote productivity. These include: (i) helping firm access skills, technology and information
     through, for example, technology extension or technology transfer programs; (ii) ensuring level playing field between informal
     and formal sector, by streamlining and reducing regulation and ensuring fair enforcement; (iii) decreasing the cost of doing
     business by addressing critical infrastructure gaps, especially in electricity, developing key financial infrastructure and special

programs to help enterprises access financing, and accelerate and facilitate international trade; (iv) supporting firm entry and exit,
which is low in Kenya, by facilitating the starting up of a business, and simplifying the insolvency framework; (v) and, streamlining
revenue raising schemes that are increasing the cost of doing business unduly in Kenya.


5.	 At the regional level, market access could be enhanced by eliminating the myriad non-trade barriers trade costs that
impede on intra-regional trade. NTBs affecting intra-EAC trade include non-harmonized technical regulations, sanitary and
phytosanitary requirements, customs procedures and documentation, rules of origin, police roadblocks and high costs of cross-
border communications and digital transactions for the poorest citizens. A reduction in trade costs is expected to benefit all East
African economies. In Kenya, it will favor its capital-intensive sector. Further, a reduction in non-tariff barriers is estimated to increase
consumption of 0.16 percent in Kenya and 0.22percent in Tanzania. Without such action, Kenya will continue to lose out on market
share in EAC, and this will be particularly important for not just its exports but the diversification of its economy since, compared
to its exports to advanced economies, Kenya’s exports are more diversified and include several non-agricultural or have more
manufactured goods.

Box B.2: Trends in county level fiscal management

     County governments have experienced remarkable progress after challenges faced in their first year of devolution, notably,
     budget execution has moved from 64.9 percent in 2013/14 to 90.2 percent in 2015/16. Nevertheless, four key challenges require
     urgent attention: (i) the slow growth in Own source of revenue (OSR); (ii) low execution rate of development spending which still
     falls short of the requirement; (iii) accumulating pending bills; (iv) and, the rising wage bill which constitutes a significant share of
     county budgets.


     1.	 County Governments’ budget allocations grew by 12 percent in FY 2015/16. The total budget amounted to Ksh. 367.4
     billion in FY 2015/16 and Ksh. 326.4 and Ksh.228.6 in FY 2014/15 and FY 2013/14 respectively. The overall actual expenditure
     amounted to Ksh. 295.3 billion and Ksh.258.2 billion representing an 80 percent absorption rate of the budget. Development
     spending also witnessed a 14.5 percent improvement in absorption between FY2014/15 and FY 2015/16.


     2.	 County governments complied with the Public Finance Management Act, 2012, requirement that recurrent expenditure
     should not exceed total revenue. The share of the Counties’ aggregate recurrent expenditure for personnel and operations and
     maintenance (O&M) to total revenue (transfers from the National Government and own-source revenue) for FY 2015/16 was 56
     percent 55 and 58 percent for FY 2014/15 and 2013/14 respectively.


     3.	 However, counties recorded a significantly slow growth          Figure B.2: Annual Targets Vs. Actual Collections, Kshs.
     in Own-Source Revenue (OSR). Own Source Revenue grew
     by 28.9 percent from Ksh 26.3 billion in the FY 2013/14 to
     Ksh 33.9 billion in the FY 2014/15. However, the growth was
     significantly slower between FY 2014/15 and FY 2015/16 at
     3.3 percent. The slow growth suggests that there is need for                                 41.1% shortfall
                                                                                                                    33% shortfall            31% shortfall

     counties to apply fiscal effort and improve efficiency in own
     revenue collection.


     4.	 County revenue forecasts seem more credible but
     there is still a significant shortfall between targets and
     actual collections. Even after revising down the FY 2014/15
     targets due to poor performance, the collections in FY              Source: Controller of Budget

     2015/16 remained below it. The report on county Own
     Source Revenue by National Treasury for eight County Governments highlights lack of credible forecasting methodology,
     lack of in-year monitoring and ambiguity of roles within County Governments in the revenue forecasting process as the main
     challenges facing the county governments. Recent audits also suggest there are gaps in tax administration leading to leakages.


     5.	 Forty-five (45) counties complied with the requirement in the PFM Act, 2012, that at least 30 percent of their budgets are
     allocated to development expenditure in FY 2015/16. However, only 33 counties managed to achieve the 30 percent in actual
     development spending in FY 2015/16. This is a marginal improvement from FY 2014/15 where 31 counties met the required
     threshold in actual spending. With a few exceptions, counties that didn’t meet this requirement are predominantly urban. Nairobi,
     Nakuru, Embu, Nyeri and Kiambu counties were below the 30 percent actual development spending marginally.


     Policies to improve fiscal management at the County level

     6.	 There is need to enhance county own sources of revenue and ensuring their predictability. Own source of revenue (OSR)
     forecasting has improved but growth has slowed down. To address this challenge, the government should ensure that loopholes
     and leakages in counties’ revenue collection are sealed and also develop a policy through which local revenue raising activities
     will be better supported and coordinated.

   7.	 Budget execution can be improved. Counties have shown a positive trend in compliance with fiscal responsibility
   principles in recurrent and development budget allocations. However, Cash shortages and slow procurement procedures have
   led to low development budget execution and an accumulation of pending bills. Counties have been constrained in their service
   delivery by an increasing wage bill and the need to meet various operational and maintenance expenditures. Consequently, there
   is therefore an urgent need for counties to contain their wage bill and align their procurement plans to cash flow plans.


   Streamline the re-allocation of funds. Section 154(2) of the PFM Act 2012 provides limited power to accounting officer to reallocate
   approved fund. However, the county sector expenditure data shows a huge discrepancy between the final approved budget
   figures and the actual spending per sector. Therefore, there is a need to ensure that these shifts in sector priorities leading to
   reallocation of funds are regularized through a Supplementary Budget.




 Box B.3: M-Akiba: Another First For Kenya

   What is M-Akiba? On 23rd March, 2017 the National Treasury launched a world first retail level mobile-phone based government
   bond auction platform – M-Akiba (“Akiba” is the Swahili word for savings). The purpose of the M-Akiba bond is to mobilize
   domestic funds to support government infrastructure projects. Until M-Akiba, the minimum amount required to participate in
   the government bond market was Ksh 50,000, however, under M-Akiba the minimum investment required is Ksh 3000, thereby
   making it more affordable to a wider cross section of Kenyan society. The coupon rate for the three-year M-Akiba bond is fixed at
   a tax free rate of 10 percent per annum. Interest payments will be made every six months. The bond will be listed on the Nairobi
   Securities Exchange and tradeable by mobile phone. The M-Akiba bond market is expected to be liquid as there is expected to be
   a guaranteed buyer. Safaricom and Airtel are the participating Mobile Network Operators (MNOs). The March launch is a pilot and
   seeks to raise Ksh. 150 million. This pilot launch should help test the platform and address any implementation challenges before
   the main launch, which is expected in June, with a target amount of Ksh 4.85 billion to be raised.


   What has been the result so far? M-Akiba bond builds on Kenya’s success story of integrating technology and financial services
   in order to increase financial inclusion for Kenyans, and develop a savings and investment culture among ordinary Kenyans.
   Just six days after the launch of the M-Akiba it is reported that at least 61,000 Kenyans had registered on the M-Akiba platform
   and some Ksh75.2 million (50.2 percent of the target amount) had been raised. With 31 million Kenyans (64.4 percent of the
   population) having mobile money subscriptions, and with deposit rates at banks lower than the M-Akiba coupon rate there exist
   further potential for the government to raise funds, while supporting a savings culture. Notwithstanding the expected success of
   M-Akiba, participation in the government bond market will continue to be dominated by larger investors, pension fund managers,
   high net wealth individuals, and banks, as transactions through M-Akiba will be limited by maximum daily limits on what can
   be transferred through the MNOs and the fact that the likely participants of the M-Akiba bonds will be on the lower end of the
   income scale, most of whom are net borrowers.

Box B.4: Diversifying financing sources via floating a diaspora bond

     1. Role of migration and remittances in the Kenyan economy
     Kenyans have been migrating since the 1960s, with the main driver for migration being the search for better living conditions.
     Today, more than three (3) million Kenyans live abroad (Government of Kenya, 2014). In 2015, about 455,889 Kenyans migrated
     abroad and more than 75% went to developed countries especially the UK (33%), the USA (23%), Canada (6%), Australia (4%), and
     Germany (2%). Migrant remittance inflows have steadily increased since 2000 (Figure 1). In 2016, remittance inflows amounted
     to US$1.6 billion, representing 3.4% of the country’s GDP, and projections indicate an upward trend for the coming years. The UK
     and the USA are the major remittance sending countries accounting for about 2/3 of total remittances in 2015. From 2001-2014,
     the amount of money sent annually by the Kenyan diaspora was on average six (6) times higher than what foreign direct investors
     sent and projections show the gap is likely to continue (Figure 1). In addition to remittances, Kenyans abroad have huge untapped
     potential especially regarding their skills, knowledge, networks, and savings. It is estimated that overseas Kenyans save over $2
     billion annually (Source: The WBG’s Migration and remittances Team).


     2. An opportunity to tap into the Kenyan diaspora savings through diaspora bonds
     The Government of Kenya has recognized the diaspora plays a key role in the nation’s economic development and it could
     support its Vision 2030. A Diaspora Policy was identified in 2014 and it recommends pursuit of a comprehensive remittance
     strategy and formulation of a policy to issue benchmark sovereign bonds that will finance the country’s huge infrastructure
     gap. Because traditional development financing is difficult to obtain, Kenya has the opportunity to tap into its diaspora savings
     by issuing a diaspora bond ― a retailed saving instrument marketed only to the diaspora, or friends of Kenya. This instrument
     could be used to finance infrastructure projects (i.e.: housing, schooling, hospitals, roads, etc.) with direct impact on the diaspora
     relatives or communities back home (Gnozi and Ratha, 2011). In the past, the country has dealt with its diaspora in this regard,
     with the issuance in 2011 of infrastructure bonds targeting the diaspora in particular. Diaspora generally has a lower country risk
     perception, which could allow them to accept lower interest costs. A few governments have used Diaspora bond across the world
     including Israel (since 1951), India (1991, 1998, 2000), Nepal (2010, 2011), the Philippines (2010), and Ethiopia (2011).


     3. Not all diaspora bond initiatives have succeeded and key prior conditions are required
     However, not all diaspora bond initiatives succeed. For
     instance, the government of Ethiopia issued diaspora                Figure B.4: Trends in remittances, ODA and FDI to Kenya
     bonds in 2011 to raise US$4.8 billion. However, these bonds                    3,500

     were massively undersubscribed and in June 2016, the US                        3,000

                                                                                    2,500
     Ethiopia violated securities laws and has to pay back US$6.5
                                                                         Millions




                                                                                    2,000

     citizens. Therefore, it is crucial for the government, before
     issuing the bonds, to insure that key prior conditions are met                 1,000

     to guarantee its success. Special care needs to be taken with                   500

     However, mean rents are 40.8% of income in Nairobi (Kenya National Housing Survey, 2012/2013). This suggests that many households will be willing to spend 40% of monthly
     income in the case of house purchase.

     The average loan is a15-year variable rate loan (maturities typically range between 15 to 20 years) with interest rates varying between 13-18 percent. The analysis assumes an
     interest rate of 14% in keeping with the recently instituted interest rate caps in Kenya (see below). Even if banks propose higher Loan to Values (LTVs) in locations where the prices of
     real estate collateral have been appreciating, these loans still remain out of reach for most borrowers. In August 2016, the Banking (Amendment) Act was signed into law. The new
     law caps lending and deposit rates at 400 bps above and 70 percent of the base rate set and published by the Central Bank of Kenya. There are some concerns that this may have an
     impact on all long-term financing but it remains to be seen how implementation plays out and how banks adjust to this new reality. Margins are high but differ between the largest
     banks, which dispose of a cheap retail deposit base (cost of funds around 4 percent), and other banks that depend on more expensive and volatile corporate deposits (around 12-13
     percent). The former group has more room to further reduce margins if the competition drives them in that direction.

     Box B.6: Findings of the Kenya Mortgage Refinance Company (KMRC) feasibility20

      The purpose of establishing KMRC would be to offer the housing finance market in Kenya a credible, professional
      and high quality large scale medium- to long-term refinance/liquidity provider. KMRC would serve as a secure
      source of long term funding at attractive rates while ensuring sound lending habits among primary mortgage
      lenders (PMLs), resulting in greater availability of fixed rate mortgages and longer available loan terms. This would,
      in turn, help improve the affordability of mortgages, increase the number of qualifying borrowers, and result in the
      expansion of the primary mortgage market and home ownership in Kenya while deepening the capital markets.

      The preliminary analysis shows that after five years of operation, KMRC could double the number of mortgages
      that would have been outstanding in Kenya if the market had grown organically. This would mean a projected
      number of 140,000 mortgages outstanding compared to 70,000 (including SACCOs) by 2022, in the absence of the
      KMRC, with close to one third of the borrowers being of either lower or informal income (for a Ksh 3 million dwelling).
      The facility would also increase the number of fixed rate mortgages and extend the term of such mortgages. In
      order to reach these potential targets, the facility would require Ksh 1.5 billion in equity capital (primarily from market
      participants and other investors); it would also require an additional tier 2 capital investment and capital to finance an
      interest rate buy-down program and/or direct line of credit (LOC) to SACCOs, with a combined value of US$250 million.

      With access to refinance over the next five years, banks could originate an additional 60,000 mortgages for a total
      mortgage debt outstanding of Ksh 635 billion, more than three times the value of Ksh 203 billion today. KMRC
      could also offer both refinancing and ‘pre-financing’ to SACCOs, reaching an additional 25,000 SACCO borrowers
      over a five-year period. The facility would be able to refinance only SACCO loans that are registered formal mortgages
      on titled properties, since KMRC bond investors would most likely accept only collateralized loans for refinance. It is
      estimated that there are approximately 10,000 formal mortgages totaling Ksh 40 billion at SACCOs and that with
      access to KMRC this number would increase to 25,000 and Ksh 81 billion over the next five years.

      It is important to note that many of the essential preconditions for the development of housing finance are
      currently present in Kenya or are under discussion and the presence of KMRC can catalyze further reforms and
      improve the environment for affordable housing as evidenced in other countries.

      It is important to recognize that the initial analysis was completed in the midst of implementation of the Banking (Amendment) Act of 2016 that capped lending and deposit rates at
      400 bps above and 70 percent of the base rate set and published by the Central Bank of Kenya. The analysis suggests that benefits still accrue in terms of increased mortgage volumes
      and lower rates, irrespective of the prevailing regulatory environment. However, considerable uncertainty remains as to how the interest rate cap, as well as the floor on deposits will
      impact long-term lending and the funding of long-term lending

     The NMRC is a private sector company with a public sector purpose of
     developing the primary and secondary mortgage markets by raising long-term
     funds from the domestic capital market as well as foreign markets and thereby
     provide accessible and affordable housing in Nigeria. NMRC was incorporated
     on 24th of June 2013 as Nigeria Mortgage Refinance Company Plc.

     It was developed as part of a wider Housing Finance Project supported by the World Bank through a US$300
     million loan to the Federal Government of Nigeria. The program has three main components: i) development of a
     mortgage liquidity facility; ii) development of a housing finance guarantee product; and iii) development of housing
     microfinance pilot schemes.

     The bulk of the funding was allocated to support NMRC’s balance sheet and future growth. This was done by releasing
     up to US$250 million in tranches of Tier 2 equity. The release of the funds is dependent on performance and issuance
     of bonds. This differs from previous schemes where funding was provided as a straightforward credit line. The structure
     used in Nigeria allows the funds to be leveraged in the market, supports sustainable growth of the company and does
     not create misaligned incentives in terms of pricing of concessional funds versus cost-of-market funds.

     NMRC completed its first bond issue in July 2015 for an amount of NGN 8 billion (US$40 million), as part of a NGN
     140 billion (US$700 million) Medium-Term Note Program. The issuance was supported with a Federal Government
     Guarantee in recognition of the support that a new institution will need to go to market. As NMRC establishes itself,
     the objective is for it to go to the bond market on its own.

     A key step, which NMRC has already completed in developing the market, is the creation of standard underwriting
     criteria. These detail the minimum quality standards that a mortgage loan must meet to be eligible for refinancing
     with NMRC. This effectively creates an industry minimum quality standard and helps with standardization and
     improved efficiency.

     Pension funds in Nigeria have been eager for alternative investments to Government bonds and the bond issuance
     was well received and over-subscribed. As the mortgage market grows, it is expected that NMRC will be the leading
     private issuer in the country.


Box B.8: The Moroccan Guarantee Scheme for Low Income Housing Finance

     Created in 2004, FOGARIM primarily targets low-income households with irregular earnings. It provides guarantees
     covering 70 percent of losses on mortgage loans. Given the type of income, the main selection criteria are prices
     (limited to US$25,000) and the level of monthly installments, capped at about the equivalent to US$200 (upper
     income threshold) and 40 percent of the households’ income (lower threshold). Guarantees can be enforced after
     nine-month arrears, and once the foreclosure process has been initiated. After an initial phase where guarantees were
     granted for free, FOGARIM switched to a risk-linked premium system, where the amount of premiums is inversely
     linked to the size of the down payment.

     In 2009, FOGARIM was merged with another guarantee fund that targets moderate-income civil servants, middle
     class independent workers and non-resident Moroccans buying or building houses up to US $100,000 in value. The
     consolidated fund, Damane Assakane, was guaranteeing MAD 9.3 billion at the end of 2010 (US$1.2 billion), while its
     own funds amounted to MAD 0.95 billion.

     A reform of the guarantees was underway in 2011. In the “social housing” compartment, the price ceiling has been
     raised to US$100,000, and the maximum monthly installment to US$300. For other categories, the price ceiling
     should be removed but the guaranteed amount capped at US$50,000. Claim processing will be overhauled, with
     payment first and validity checks afterwards.

 Box B.9: Testing the Water: A PPP in Affordable Housing in Kenya

   In order to encourage increased private development of affordable housing the Bank is supporting a project
   proposed by Nakuru County Council in Naivasha in October 2016.

   The project consists of the public sector providing land, providing a detailed feasibility study (in the initial phases
   funded and managed by the Bank), and inviting private developers to build housing serving lower income groups.
   The units will be for sale at the commercial risk of the developer.

   Emphasis is being placed on preparing a feasibility study that provides highly detailed data on site conditions,
   available infrastructure, market demand and regulatory issues so as to minimize the risks for the private developer.
   Costs are being kept low (consultants costing a total of about $65,000), so as to establish a replicable methodology.
   Sketch designs are currently being prepared, and the RFP is scheduled to be completed by the end of March.

 Box B.10: A SMART Demand Side Subsidy Mechanism: France - The Zero Percent Housing Loan

   Contrary to what its name could imply, the PTZ is a direct demand subsidy that lowers borrowing costs to households
   meeting certain income criteria. Main features:

   •	 The PTZ is a loan. It can be extended by any credit institution that has entered an agreement with the State for
      that purpose
   •	 It carries a 0% interest for maturities up to 25 years that vary depending on the family income
   •	 The subsidy covers the difference between the Net Present Value of a PTZ and a housing loan at market conditions.
      It is allocated to the lender, initially through an up-front payment, now in the form of a tax reduction
   •	 Eligibility criteria: income ceilings, fairly high (ex. 5,000€ per month for a 3 person household), and price ceilings.
      Both parameters vary with the household size and the location. Additional criteria include environmental
      standards.
   Overall, a non-distortive mechanism (open to any credit institution, no impact on the lender’s interest rate policy)
   that aims at ensuring fixed debt servicing-to-income ratio, a better approach than lump-sums with possible negative
   redistribution impact. One of the issues: discrepancy between the very large potential coverage (about 2/3 of
   households) and the public finance capacities.

 Box B.11: India Lending Model for Informal Borrowers and Informal Property

     In May 2015, the National Housing Bank launched a “Special Urban Housing Refinance Scheme for Low Income
     Housing,” which, for the first time, provides refinance for “loans secured either by collateral of property financed or
     alternatively secured.” Until this point, most housing finance companies engaged only in mortgage-backed lending,
     although some innovative lenders had developed alternative security strategies such as the Self Help Group or
     Joint Liability Group Guarantee. However, these were being used in addition to, and not instead of, conventional
     property based security (albeit sometimes a quasi-mortgage). Indian law and banking regulations did not specifically
     prohibit housing finance operations that were not mortgage-backed, but seemed overwhelmingly to address only
     mortgage-backed lending, and there were no guidelines or directions relating to alternative security. This is perhaps
     one of the reasons for lack of innovation and expertise in alternative security in the housing finance sector.

     In this respect, the “Special Urban Housing Refinance Scheme for Low Income Housing” is an important first step, as it
     clarifies to all concerned that NHB can also cater to alternatively secured lending. Subsequent steps in this direction,
     which can help mainstream alternatively secured lending, could include the issuance of guidelines for alternatively
     secured lending.

     For lenders who seek to provide credit in this sector, the scheme, for the first time, also provides clarity on the
     building regulation requirement for informal and incremental housing in areas where formal approval systems may
     not be in place. Recognizing that urban low-income housing has very specific conditions and risks, the scheme
     provides environmental and social due diligence framework for primary lending institutions who seek refinance. The
     framework for environmental due diligence requires lenders to carry out technical assessments to ensure: i) housing
     in hazard prone locations, or in locations where it can have adverse environmental impact are avoided; ii) sites for
     housing have access to potable water and basic sanitation facilities (or explore options for additional funding to
     address these concerns); iii) screening of household occupations for hazardous or illegal trades and activities; and iv)
     the structural safety of the physical dwelling including compliance with safety standards and building regulations
     (in case of formal housing), and direct assessment of structural safety and load bearing capacity in case of informal/
     incremental housing where formal approval systems are not in place. The framework for due diligence explicitly
     recognizes that formal building plan approval systems may not be available for potential low-income borrowers, and
     provides that this requirement may be replaced by technical assessment by the lender itself.

Kenya is at a critical juncture as it transitions from the completion of the Second Medium Term Plan (MTP-II,
2013-2017) to MTP-III (2018-2022), which is currently under preparation. The report has four main messages.
First, Kenya’s economic growth continued to outperform its peers in 2016. In contrast to the slump in economic
growth in Sub Saharan Africa to 1.5 percent (a three decade low), growth in Kenya accelerated for the third
consecutive year reaching 5.8 percent. Kenya’s robust growth performance was supported by lower oil prices,
favorable agriculture output in the rst half of 2016, a tourism sector rebound, strong inward remittances, a
relatively stable macroeconomic environment and improvements in the steady easing of certain supply-side
constraints due to earlier public investments.

Secondly, due to emerging headwinds, economic activity in Kenya will encounter some speed bumps in the
near to medium term which will likely impact MTP-II implementation and should inform the scope of the
MTP-III. These headwinds include, the ongoing drought, depressed private sector credit growth, the rise in oil
prices, and scal pressures. However, the completion of phase one of Standard Gauge Railway and a projected
strengthening of the global economy is expected to provide some tailwind. The net e ect of these changes in
the economic landscape will likely cause near term growth to moderate to 5.5 percent in 2017 before picking
up to 6.1 percent by 2019 as headwinds (e.g. drought) subside.

Third, sustaining Kenya’s robust growth will require safeguarding its hard earned macroeconomic stability by
continuing to implement prudent scal and monetary policies. The consolidation of the scal stance in line
with the Medium Term Fiscal Framework should help anchor macroeconomic stability and create the scal
space for a public investment drive supportive of the medium term plans. Further, given the systemic
importance of the banking sector, addressing the unintended consequences of the interest rate caps should
help strengthen nancial intermediation in the Kenyan economy.

Finally, while Kenya’s growth has been robust, there are latent opportunities to accelerate growth to levels
necessary to achieve Vision 2030. This report identi es some of these growth and job-creation opportunities as
well as the need to address a critical social need by supporting the development of the housing market for
lower income households in Kenya. On the demand side, a key constraint to housing is nance. The report
addresses policy measures that can be taken to alleviate the housing nance problem, including those that
have worked well in other middle income countries.

The World Bank remains committed to working with key Kenyan stakeholders to identify potential policy and
structural issues that will enhance economic growth and keep Kenya on the path to upper middle income
status in accordance with the aspirations of Vision 2030. The semi-annual Kenya Economic Update o ers a
forum to discuss these development trends. We hope that you too will join us in debating topical policy issues
that can contribute to fostering growth, shared prosperity and poverty reduction in Kenya.
