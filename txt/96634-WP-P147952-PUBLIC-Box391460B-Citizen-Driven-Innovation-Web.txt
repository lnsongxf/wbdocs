    This guidebook aims to bring citizen-driven innovation to policy makers and change agents
    around the globe, by spreading good practice on open and participatory approaches as applied to
    digital service development in different nations, climates, cultures, and urban settings.
    The effort is born of a Memorandum of Understanding for           innovation challenges in a variety of situations, objectives and
    collaboration1 between the World Bank and the European            governance structures. The Living Lab approach strengthens
    Network of Living Labs and their shared interest in applying      these processes as one of the leading methods for ‘agile
    new citizen centric methodologies for innovation.2 These          development’ or the rapid prototyping of ideas, concepts,

While this guidebook is mainly targeted to city mayors and leaders, it may also be read by assistants, administrators, change makers
and digital innovators in municipal administrations as well as in enterprises, universities and civil society organizations alike. The
important point is that each player take the common perspective of seeing the whole picture and aiming to orchestrate all the
resources a city is capable of mobilizing, with a shared goal of transforming it and its residents into at least one economically and
socially prosperous corner of the Earth.

     This guidebook is structured into seven main sections:

      1     An introductory section describes the vision of a ‘humanly smart’ city, in order to give an idea of the kind of result that can
            be attained from opening up and applying citizen-driven innovation methods.

      2     Chapter 1, ‘Getting Started’ helps Mayors launch co-design initiatives, exploring innovation processes founded on trust and
            verifying the benefits of opening up.

      3     Chapter 2, ‘Building a Strategy’ identifies the key steps for building an innovation partnership and together defining a
            sustainable city vision and scenarios for getting there.

      4     Chapter 3, ‘Co-Designing Solutions’ looks at the process of unpacking concrete problems, working creatively to address
            them, and following up on implementation.


      5     Chapter 4, ‘Ensuring Sustainability’ describes key elements for long-term viability: evaluation and impact assessment,
            appropriate institutional structuring, and funding and policy support.

            Chapter 5, ‘Joining Forces’ suggests ways to identify a unique role for participation in international networks and how to

     This is just the beginning of a journey,
     a collective journey with many paths but a common ambition, that of being able to address the challenges that cities across the
     globe face today. You the reader are encouraged to treat this document as an open resource and provide feedback to the authors,
     including your own experiences. This way a common portfolio of knowledge can be built up through a growing collection of
     information on the community of networks and organizations working with citizen-driven innovation and applying it in different
     city contexts.

of diversity that in turn provides opportunities for innovation
in new technologies, services and business models.11 Cities are
the first points of connection for foreign markets and external

entrepreneurial and innovative activity.12 The swifter spread

      In the EU’s CitySDK project, cities and developers worked together
      to define common technical standards for Open Data, through which
      applications can access information and services from any city that
      adopts the common interface. Standards were defined for tourism
      and transport data and also for citizen reporting of city issues.

     infrastructures are something to buy and install, citizen
     engagement is an episodic consultation process to be called
     upon only when necessary, and Urban Living Labs (if they
     are set up at all) carry out occasional experiments of service
     innovation that remain marginal to the city government’s
     main mission. Now the paradigm shift lies in the recognition
     that research and co-design are no longer isolated moments,
     but they have become the norm. The seemingly unstoppable
     trends towards global warming and demographic change,
     among others, together with the accelerating pace of
     change of the technologies designed to address these issues,
     means that the space between solving one problem and the
     appearance of the next has disappeared.

     Over the past few years, many city governments have made
     significant efforts to increase the role of functions such as
     innovation, environment, and social services, often setting up
     dedicated departments and special facilities.28 Yet the issues

      this new service was conceived of as an experiment in an EU-fund-
      ed research project, but simply and immediately produced tangible
      results. The barriers of traditional administrative silos have difficulty
      resisting to such evidence: for how long can the Environment and
