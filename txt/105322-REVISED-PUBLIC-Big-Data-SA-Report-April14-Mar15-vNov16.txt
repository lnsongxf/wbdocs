00EXECUTIVE SUMMARY0110101
Background
   South Africa has more persons living with HIV and patients on antiretroviral therapy
(ART) than any other country in the world (World Health Organisation 2014). Most ART
patients are treated in public sector facilities, but there is a lack of information at
national, district and health facility level on the outcomes of the treatment programme.
In particular, there is a dearth of information about the proportion of ART patients who
are virally suppressed (the ultimate outcome of an HIV treatment programme for
maximum individual clinical benefit and population-level HIV prevention benefits in
terms of reduced HIV transmission). This is in part because of fragmented health
information systems, the lack of unique identifiers captured for each ART patient, and
other historical reasons. The country’s District Health Information System (DHIS)
reports numbers of patients on ART (Total Remaining on ART—TROA), the proportion
of patients with viral load (VL) tests captured in that system, and the proportion of these
tests with a result indicating viral suppression. The most recently reported ART cohort
data from the DHIS showed 46% of ART patients with a VL test and 83% VL
suppression among these (Overmeyer, 2015).

Laboratory monitoring test results are stored in the National Health Laboratory Services’
(NHLS) database. This database has the potential to provide important strategic
information on the ART programme reach and quality if the testing data were to be
systematically linked to patient data. However, linking the data is difficult because the
NHLS and Department of Health (DOH) use separate lists of health facility names and
identifications, and the NHLS test data are not automatically linked to the patient data
stored in the DHIS. The NHLS database is a database of tests, not persons,
and―given that a person can test more than once and via different health
facilities―there is a disconnect between data systems.        This makes individual and
facility linkages and determinations of the percentage of ART patients with viral load
tests done, and viral suppression by ART patient, difficult and limits spatial analysis of
laboratory data for targeting ART adherence investments across South Africa.

Methods
1. In order to analyse the NHLS data we developed an algorithm for patient level
    linking of CD4 count and VL test data using probabilistic record linkage methods.

2. Incorporating the work of other institutions, we merged DHIS and NHLS facility lists.
    This allowed us to link DHIS reports of TROA data with the NHLS database of

    public sector VL tests at the facility level to measure the proportion of patients
    receiving a VL test in a 12-month period and to group the tests results in four
    categories (<400, 400–1000, >1000, and >10,000 copies/mL). We used the unique
    patient identifier in the NHLS lab database to select only the most recent VL test in
    a 12-month period, for each patient.

3. We then determined the proportion of viral load tests done (VLD) and proportion of
    ART patients virally suppressed (VLS) by province, district, sub-district and health
    facility, and provided tables and maps. Next, we used the VLS results from the
    health facilities to match intervention and control facilities in the NDOH/World Bank
    impact evaluation of the adherence guidelines. We also assessed the relationship
    between facilities’ TROA size and viral suppression levels.

4. In order to test the hypothesis that viral suppression levels at one health facility are
    independent of values at neighbouring health facilities, two indices of spatial
    autocorrelation were calculated (Moran’s I and Geary’s c) and a scatter plot
    developed.

Results
    From April 2014 through March 2015, 3,775 public facilities reported 2,993,125
patients on ART. During this period, 2,199,890 unique patients received 2,995,133 VL
tests. At the national level, 75% of patients had received a VL test in the previous 12
months and 78% of those tested had a suppressed VL (below 400 copies/mL), 19%
had VL results above 1,000 copies/mL, and 12% were above 10,000 copies/mL (see
ES Table 1). The proportion of viral load suppression increased with age from a low of
51% in children under 5 years to 83% in patients 50 years and older. One in three ART
patients aged under 25 years was not virally suppressed. Approximately 5% more
female patients had viral suppression than to males. Sixteen percent of male and 11%
of female ART patients had a VL test result above 10,000 copies/mL.

At the provincial level, among patients who had had a VL test in the last 12 months, the
proportion with suppressed VL ranged from 69 to 82% (ES Table 1). Three provinces
had 25% or more patients with VL test results above 1,000 copies/mL, and one
province had 20% of VL tests above 10,000 copies/mL. Comparison across districts
showed much more heterogeneity in terms of VL test coverage (54% - 99%), VL
suppression (47% - 86%) and high viral load above 10,000 copies/mL (8% - 35%).
These differentials were even more pronounced in the comparison across sub-districts
(see ES Figure 1) and health facilities (see ES Table 1). Only 3.4% of all ART facilities
met the 90% target for viral load suppression; 200 clinics had VL suppression levels
below 50%.

We also calculated the overall proportion of patients with known suppression (product
of VL done and VL suppressed―see summary table ES Table 1). The proportion of
patients known to be suppressed was 58% nationally; Western Cape (65%) and Free
State (64%) provinces had the highest proportion of patients known to be suppressed.

Median monthly TROA per facility ranged from 1 to 18,786. TROA was associated with
VL suppression at the facility level, controlling for proportion of patients tested and
province. Two-thirds of all ART patients are seen in the 25% largest facilities and had
VL suppression levels 14.5% (95% CI: 13.1–15.9) higher than the 25% smallest
facilities. Spatial correlation analysis of VL data indicated that neighbouring ART
facilities tend to have similar VL suppression rates.

The VL suppression results for individual health facilities were used to pair health
facilities by similar levels of suppression for the NDOH/World Bank impact evaluation of
the adherence guidelines (see ES Table 2). The 24 health facilities in four selected
health districts were also matched for similar TROA between the pairs of intervention
and control facilities.

Discussion
   Geographic differentials in VL test coverage and VL suppression: This analysis
demonstrates, in South Africa, the diversity in the proportion of patients getting a VL
test annually and patient virally suppressed. The variation shows by geographic location
and facility, as well as by age, gender and demography. The two provinces with best
VL suppression had suppression levels 13% higher than the three provinces with lowest
levels, and when comparing across districts the differential was even greater at 39%.
Viral suppression achieved 96% in one health facility, but was as low as 20% at the
other end of this vast spectrum of viral suppression results.

A pattern of VL suppression by size of patient population: The districts and health
facilities with larger patient populations had better viral suppression levels than districts
and facilities with low patient numbers. This analysis suggests that even if facilities
have high patient loads, they can still achieve good viral suppression results, whereas
facilities with small ART populations seem to have more difficulties in achieving viral
suppression in their patients.

VL suppression varied with the age and gender of the ART patients: Viral load
suppression also was associated with age, with higher levels of viral suppression in the
older age groups. The high rate of unsuppressed viral loads in the 0-4-year-old age
group may be attributed in part to the lack of understanding of treatment and monitoring
procedures by the parents or guardians of this population. These results indicate that
high VL is a critical problem affecting young ART patients and particularly children
under 5 years. Females received approximately two-thirds of VL tests, about the same
as their 67% share of all HIV positive persons on treatment nationally. Our finding that
one in six male and one in nine female ART patients has a high risk of HIV transmission
due to VL levels above 10,000 copies/mL is cause for concern and requires urgent
targeting of treatment adherence support to these patients.

Consideration on the linked NHLS data and the routine data: The comparison of
the NHLS to the DHIS results showed very similar proportions of VL suppressed but
large differences in proportions of patients receiving a VL test. We hypothesize three
possible reasons for these differences: incomplete coverage of facilities by the Tiered
ART Monitoring Strategy (TIER.Net); if early TIER.Net adopters are better managed
facilities they might have higher VL suppression than later TIER.Net adopters; and
differences in completeness of data capturing.

Utility of this analysis: This analysis of the patient-level laboratory cohort
demonstrates its ability to provide detailed information on viral load suppression in
South Africa. The information can identify facilities with low VL suppression and low

proportions of patients tested in the previous 12 months, enabling failures in ART
adherence and viral suppression to be identified and corrected.

The South African government target is 90% VL suppression among ART patients.
This analysis shows that while some facilities are achieving this goal, it is not being met
by any entire district or province. There is great potential to learn about successful
promotion of ART adherence from the one-in-30 facilities with 90% or more of ART
patients virally suppressed.

By any measure, the health system needs to improve compliance with the ART
monitoring guidelines, the processing of laboratory information, and communication of
VL test results at clinic level. More complete VL monitoring and reporting in the DHIS is
crucial to enable satisfactory monitoring of the health of patients and of the treatment
programme’s performance and impact. This would enable managers routinely to
combine the DHIS and NHLS data, providing a powerful tool for better clinical care and
programmatic monitoring. In the short term, we recommended using a combination of
NHLS laboratory data and DHIS data for programmatic and facility monitoring of the
ARV programme. VL data, disaggregated to the level of decision-making, should be
used to guide the allocation of resources for programme improvements.

This work shows that Big Data―in this case a secondary analysis of large sets of
routine data and innovative methodology of record linkage―can inform programme
improvements. Specifically, the present analysis highlights patient demographics,
health facilities and districts that need enhanced adherence support, and it identifies
success stories where viral suppression is achieved and ART patients regularly
monitored to ascertain treatment effectiveness. 

01INTRODUCTION01110110110
   South Africa has the largest population of HIV-infected people in the world and the
largest population of people on antiretroviral therapy (ART), but lacks important
strategic information on the effectiveness of the treatment management programme. In
2012, an estimated 6.4 million people were living with HIV and over 2.0 million people
were on ART in South Africa (Shisana, O et al., 2014). In 2013, the South African
government and international donors spent 2.3 billion USD on HIV/AIDS and
tuberculosis (Meyer-Rath et al., 2015). However, implementation of comprehensive
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) has lagged behind the rollout of the Comprehensive
Care, Management and Treatment (CCMT) programme. More information is needed to
refine treatment strategies to improve their impact and direct scarce resources where
they are most needed.

With the aim of providing useful data for this purpose and establishing a standardised
M&E system at CCMT clinics nationally, The National Department of Health (NDoH)
began implementing the Tiered ART Monitoring Strategy in September 2011 (TIER.Net
system). This monitors various clinical and laboratory indicators (National Department
of Health, 2011). The three tiers are Tier 1: paper registers; Tier 2: non-networked
electronic system; and Tier 3: a networked electronic medical record system. All
facilities with more than 500 patients remaining on ART (TROA or Total Remaining On
ART) have been prioritised to implement the TIER.Net system. As of November 2013,
967 of 1,803 eligible facilities had completed all stages of TIER.Net implementation. In
the September 2013 report on ART data, NDoH reported that, as of the second quarter
of 2013, “approximately 36% of patients had a viral load done and of the viral loads
done nearly 80% of those patients on ART have suppressed viral loads” (National
Department of Health, 2013). Data reported through TIER.Net is published by the
District Health Information System (DHIS).

With regards to bridging the information gap caused by the inadequate M&E coverage,
the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS) has an existing database that is a
potential secondary source of laboratory M&E indicators, such as proportion of patients
with suppressed viral load, or CD4 count at initiation. The NHLS database contains all
public sector viral load and CD4 count tests since 2010. The use of this database is
currently limited because it lacks unique patient identifiers. In a sample of over 43
million lab tests, only 3.8% of the tests were associated with a valid national ID number.

HIV viral load suppression is the most important indicator of successful antiretroviral
therapy (Ford et al., 2014; WHO, 2014). For ART patients with susceptible virus, good
adherence to their medications typically leads to viral suppression (defined in South
Africa as a viral load of less than 400 copies per millilitre, National Department of


                                               7

Health, 2015). Suppression has benefits for the patient in that CD4 counts recover
allowing the patient to fight off disease, and for the community as patients with low
circulating viral loads are less infectious (Miller, Powers, Smith, & Cohen, 2013). Viral
load results of 400 or more copies per mL (cp/mL) suggest that either the patient is non-
adherent to treatment or that they are infected with drug-resistant virus. In either case,
intervention is necessary―for adherence counselling, or to change the drug regimen
(WHO, 2013).

In line with the World Health Organization’s 90-90-90 targets, the NDoH has set a viral
suppression target of 90% of patients on ART in South Africa (UNAIDS, 2014). Current
South African national treatment guidelines call for routine viral load tests 6 and 12
months after treatment initiation and yearly tests thereafter. Additional tests may be
ordered if a clinician needs additional diagnostic information (National Department of
Health, 2015).

In order to assess viral suppression rates in South Africa’s national treatment
programme, we created a patient-level cohort using viral load and CD4 count test
results stored in the NHLS’s Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW). This report presents
an analysis of viral load suppression in this cohort at the provincial, district, sub-district
and facility level in South Africa for a 12 month period from April 2014 to March 2015. 

   This section describes the analytical methods applied, and the creation of the
patient and clinic level cohort from the NHLS CDW laboratory data.

Patient-level Linking
   Health facilities use test requisition forms that state the patient name, date of birth,
gender, and facility name. Patients may move between facilities, and their personal
information is often recorded differently on different requisitions. To be able to track
changes in VL/CD4, a patient-linked cohort of viral load test results stored in the NHLS
CDW was created by linking patient-level information associated with each test result,
to create a data base in which all test results for each individual patient were linked
together. Recall that only a small proportion of the laboratory tests are associated with
a national patient identification number. A patient-level cohort was created by linking
viral load test results for each individual using names and date of birth. The creation of
the patient level cohort was a multi-step procedure that used non-probabilistic and
probabilistic (“fuzzy”) linking procedures using surname, first name and dates of birth
associated with test results. The central task in fuzzy record linkage is to create a



                                                8
                 Analysis of Big Data for better targeting of ART Adherence Strategies



unique identifier that simultaneously minimises over-matching (falsely combining
records that should remain separate) and under-matching (falsely separating records
that should be combined) (Christen, 2006).

The NHLS CDW has had a series of unique patient identifiers. The first matching
algorithm was based upon exact matching of names, dates of birth and street address.
This also used some hospital identification numbers. In mid-2014, the CDW
implemented a fuzzy linking algorithm, but did not have the time and resources to
evaluate the success of the unique patient identifier in regards to over and under-
matching. The project team was asked to evaluate the CDW algorithm and make
recommendations to improve it. The evaluation process identified a number of steps
that improved the matching algorithm.

Record Linkage Procedure
   The record linkage method consisted of five steps: data cleaning, exact-linking, pre-
processing, fuzzy linking, and consolidation via network analysis. The methods were
implemented using Boston University’s Shared Computing Cluster (SCC), a network of
high speed, multiprocessor computers that enabled development of a comprehensive
algorithm that could compare millions of records in less than 12 hours per programme
run.

The procedures were as follows.

1. Data cleaning

       a.   Non-alphabetical characters, single initials, etc. were omitted.
       b.   Words that were not names, e.g., “Mr.”, “Dr.”, “Mother”, “No Name”, etc. were
            omitted.
       c.   Laboratory tests identified as being conducted as part of research studies and
            outside the national CCMT programme were omitted.
2. Pre-processing

       a.   When there were multiple first or last names, matches were searched on all
            name components.
       b.   First name / last name inversions were searched for and corrected. The version
            with the highest number of lab tests conducted was regarded as correct.
       c.   A statistically informed “nicknames and alternate spellings” file (more than
            16,000 names) was created, and matches on those nicknames/alternate
            spellings were searched for.

3. Fuzzy (probabilistic) linking

   a.   A categorical variable for DOB similarity, distinguishing between exact
        matches, probable matches, plausible matches, and non-matches, was
        generated.
   b.   The Jaro-Winkler algorithm was used to measure the similarity of first name
        pairs and last name pairs (Winkler, 2006). To compare names, all 20 million
        cleaned, exact-matched, pre-processed records were compared against each
        other. No blocking was conducted by name, allowing for detection of similar
        names even when the initial letters differed (e.g., Carl ~ Karl). To compare 20
        million records against each other meant 400 trillion potential comparisons. To
        reduce the size of the problem, probabilistic matching (allowing for differences
        in names) was only conducted when the two dates of birth were +/- 11 years
        apart.
   c.   The first name similarity score, last name similarity score, and DOB similarity
        score were combined into a single summary score equal to tot_sim =
        first_sim*w + last_sim*(1-w) – penalty (DOB_sim), where specific penalties
        were assigned for lack of similar DOBs. The weights and penalties were
        chosen empirically in an initial analysis, which sought simultaneously to
        minimise the number of unique IDs and the number of patient IDs combining a
        large number of exact matches. These penalties were chosen such that a cut-
        off of 0.90 would be a plausible initial threshold. The top 10 potential matches
        were identified for each of the 20 million exact-matched pre-processed records.
   d.   Records were determined to belong to the same patient if the total similarity
        score was above a threshold value (see below).
4. Identifying unique patients via network analysis

   a.   Using network concepts, the threshold for a match depended on the density of
        a region in the full network of names/DOBs. Specifically, in areas where names
        were commonly matched to others, a higher threshold was used; in sparser
        areas of the network, a lower threshold could be tolerated. This concept was
        operationalised with the following decision rule: a cluster would only be
        accepted as “a patient” if the diameter of the cluster (i.e., the shortest distance
        between the furthest nodes) was less than or equal to 3, and there were no
        more than 5 connections emanating from any given node. Together, these
        rules imply that no cluster greater than size 10 would be accepted as a patient.
   b.   To implement this approach, a threshold of 0.90 was initially used, and all
        clusters were identified. The decision rule was then applied and the threshold
        was raised for clusters that did not satisfy the rule, eliminating low probability




                                               10
               Analysis of Big Data for better targeting of ART Adherence Strategies



        links, to re-identify clusters. This procedure was iterated in .01 increments in
        the threshold until all clusters satisfied the rule.

Validation of Record Linkage
    The final stage in the record linkage exercise was to validate it against a gold
standard. In the case of the NHLS database, no gold standard exists that could capture
the potential flow of patients across different sites within the national health system.
Therefore, to validate the approach, a gold standard was manually constructed from
NHLS data. Specifically, the project team:

   Drew a random sample of 1,000 lab results from the full database of 40 million VL
    and CD4 count results

   Started with a very liberal (low threshold) version of the matching algorithm and
    generated candidate matches for each of the 1,000 lab results. There was an
    average of 59 candidates per lab result (range 0, 838)

   Graded the match quality. For each of the candidate matches for each of the 1,000
    lab results, four trained research assistants (RAs) graded the match quality on a 4-
    pt scale: 1 = almost certainly not a match, 2 = plausible match, 3 = probable match,
    4 = almost certain match. A total of 59,000 candidate matches were graded twice
    each by separate RAs. After all matches were graded, refresher training was
    conducted and a third RA evaluated all candidate matches in which there was
    disagreement between the first two RAs in order to determine a final match quality

   Considered all 3s and 4s as “matches” and all 1s and 2s as “not matches”

Record Linkage Results
    Figure 1 displays a flow diagram showing the numbers of observations at each
stage of the linkage process. At the start, there were over 44.0 million lab results. After
exact matching and pre-processing, there were 19,856,964 patient IDs. The
probabilistic matching resulted in 12,684,248 unique patient IDs.

Table 1 displays total numbers of unique patients and Type 1 and Type 2 error
probabilities for three available identifiers: Exact Match ID based on first name, last
name, and DOB; the initial CDW unique patient ID that was developed in 2014; and the
new Boston University unique patient ID.

Notes: 1=Type 1 error is the probability that a lab result that was linked for a given patient identifier was not
matched in the gold standard dataset. Type 1 error is over-estimated in all cases (probably by ~5 percentage
points) because the cut-off date for our gold standard dataset was prior to the cut-off date for the fuzzy-matched
dataset. We will fix this in future reporting. 2=Type 2 error is the probability that a lab result matched in the gold
standard dataset was not matched by a given patient identifier.

    The NDoH and NHLS lists of facilities use different names/identifiers for many
facilities. In order to combine DHIS information on the patients on ART at the clinic
level (TROA) with the test result data, the project undertook to link the DHIS and NHLS
facilities lists. Analysis and utilization of NHLS data to inform policy has been
hampered by the lack of a single, unified clinic-level linking file matching NHLS facilities
to NDoH facilities.

The project team set out to construct a uniform NHLS-NDoH linking file, for use by
NHLS and its partners. Several other efforts to construct clinic-level linking files were
discovered. In October-November 2014, the project coordinated a call among several of
these partners, which laid the groundwork for the process to create a unified list of
matching NHLS-NDoH facilities.

Steps in the Construction of the Linking Files
Linking files were constructed by following these steps:

1. Obtaining official lists of facilities from NHLS and NDoH and compiling a master
    facility linking file using files from collaborators

2. Assessing modal matches and initial agreement scores from the merged linking
    files

3. Manually reviewing to identify “best” matches and updating agreement scores

4. Assessing NDoH geo-coordinates among matches

91% of all health facilities in the NHLS data base and that had any CD4/VL tests were
linked to a NDoH facility with a medium to high level of agreement. Results from linking
the NHLS list to the NDoH clinics reporting persons on ART care resulted in linking
91.8% of the facilities accounting for 95.8% of the patients on ART in care in NDoH
facilities.

NHLS CDW Laboratory Dataset
    The NHLS dataset contained 2,995,133 viral load results from April 1, 2014 to
March 31, 2015 from public health facilities in South Africa. Viral load results from each
patient in the cohort were restricted to the most recent result in the time period in order
to limit the number of tests to no more than one per patient. The total number of
patients having a viral load test in the time period was calculated, as well as the
proportion of those patients with tests less than 400 cp/mL (virologically suppressed),
between 400 and 1,000 cp/mL (considered at risk for poor adherence), and greater than
1,000 (non-adherent to treatment or drug-resistant) and 10,000 cp/mL (high risk for HIV
transmission). The proportion of all viral load tests less than 400 cp/mL and greater
than 1,000 cp/mL was calculated for comparison purposes.

These results were compared to data from the NDoH’s DHIS. The DHIS data were extracted
from an Excel spreadsheet: DHIS_$ZA_NDOH5_NIDS_OU5_11_13_ART.xlsm. This
spreadsheet contained the monthly values for TROA from January 2014 to March 2015 for
3,775 clinics. The median TROA value of October and November 2014 for each clinic
was used as the TROA value. October and November 2014 were chosen because they
were the midpoint of the analysis period from April 2014 to March 2015. If a clinic did

not have TROA values for October and November, the median TROA value for the 12-
month period April 2014 to March 2015 was used. One hundred and two facilities with
12 or fewer viral load test results were excluded.

Combining the number of unique patient viral load tests with the TROA, it was possible
to calculate the proportion of patients that had a viral load test within the previous 12
months. The known proportion of virally suppressed patients was calculated by taking
the product of the proportion of patients having a test in the time period and the
proportion of virally suppressed tests.

Associations between clinic patient size (TROA) and viral load suppression were also
calculated. For this analysis clinic size was divided into quartiles, and tested for
differences in viral load suppression using mixed methods analysis of variance
adjusting for multiple comparisons using Scheffe’s test (Kleinbaum, Kupper, Muller, &
Nizam, 1997).

In order to test the hypothesis that viral load suppression at one health facility is
independent of values at neighbouring health facilities two indices of spatial
autocorrelation were calculated (Moran’s I and Geary’s c) (Jacquez, 2008). A
scatterplot of viral load suppression by the average suppression of neighbouring
facilities was created. The scatterplot demonstrates standardised viral load
suppression with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. The mean
standardised viral load suppression was weighted for neighbouring facilities to account
for the distance from the index facility. 

Viral Suppression at National and Province Level
   Table 2 shows the viral load suppression results nationally and by province for the
time period from April 1, 2014 to March 31, 2015, obtained through linkage of patient
and test result data and using the newly created health facilities lists. Nationally, there
were slightly more than 2.9 million persons on ART. 78% of all persons who had a viral
load test were virologically suppressed (VL less than 400 cp/mL), 19% had a viral load
greater than 1,000 cp/mL, and 12% had a viral load greater than 10,000 cp/mL. The
proportion of patients known to be suppressed (having had a VL test and found
suppressed) was 58% nationally. Considering only those patients with a VL test,
KwaZulu-Natal and Free State were the two provinces with the highest levels of
virologic suppression at 82%, while Northern Cape, Limpopo and North West Provinces
had the lowest levels of virologic suppression among those tested at 69–70%.

The proportion of patients with viral load values greater than 1,000 and 10,000 copies
per mL were also highest in Northern Cape, Limpopo, and North West Provinces. The
Western Cape (65%) and Free State (64%) had the highest proportion of patients
known to be suppressed.

Table 3 compares suppression results from the most recent test done per patient, with
the results looking at all viral load tests done in the study period. A total of 2,786,676
viral load tests were performed during the study period. 74% of those tests were
virologically suppressed and 22% were greater than 1,000 cp/mL, compared to 78%
suppressed and 19% greater than 1,000 cp/mL of only the most recent test per patient.
At the provincial level, difference in viral suppression between all tests and the most
recent tests ranged from 2%–4%―except for the Western Cape where there was a 7%
difference. The total number of viral load tests was 94% of the TROA nationally. At the
provincial level, all provinces except the Western Cape had fewer viral load tests than
TROA. Clinics in the Western Cape averaged 1.1 tests per patient in the study period.

Viral Suppression at District and Sub-district Level
   Table 4 shows viral load suppression in the 52 districts. Sixteen districts had viral
load suppression 80% or greater and 16 districts had viral load suppression 70% or
lower. We found a positive relationship between district TROA size and proportion
suppressed. The 16 districts with the highest viral load suppression had a mean
population on treatment of 87,970 patients, while the 16 districts with lowest viral load
suppression had a mean population of only 27,138. The proportion of patients that had
a viral load test in the previous 12 months ranged from a low of 54% to 99%. The
proportion of patients with known viral load suppression ranged from 34% to 73%.

Figures 2a and 2b show the distribution of viral load suppression by district and sub-
district. The lowest levels of viral load suppression were found in the Northern, Eastern
and Western Cape sub-districts, and a few North West sub-districts. Figures 3a and 3b
show the same distribution by absolute numbers. These figures demonstrate that the
areas with lower levels of virologic suppression and lower population density have
fewer numbers of suppressed patients. In 17 districts, between 25% and 47% of
patients had viral loads >1,000 cp/mL. Figures 4a and 4b show the proportion of
unsuppressed viral loads distributed by district and sub-district. Figure 5a and 5b show
the number of patients with an unsuppressed viral load distributed by district and sub-
district. The contrast between these two and the other figures is very telling: while viral
load suppression is much greater in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng provinces, they have
much larger populations of patients with unsuppressed viral loads. Figures 6a and 6b
show the proportion of HIV patients with known suppression by district and sub-district.
This shows a concentration of these patients in some metropolitan areas and in Free
State, Eastern Cape, and KwaZulu Natal.

Viral Load Suppression at Health Facility Level
    Table 5 shows viral load suppression for 3,674 facilities that report a TROA of 12 or
greater in the DHIS. Viral load suppression varied widely by facility: 132 facilities had
90% or better viral suppression, 218 had less than 50% viral suppression.

Table 5 Viral load suppression for people in care and on ART results by facility, April 2014 –March 2015

This table contains data for 3,674 public sector health facilities the following variables
included: Province, district, sub-district, facility name, TROA, number of patients with VL in
past 12 months, percent and number per VL category (<400, 400–1000, >1000, >10000
cp/mL), and VL category. The table can be viewed in a separate window by clicking on this
link.

The VL suppression results for individual health facilities informed the design of the
NDOH/World Bank impact evaluation of the adherence guidelines. This evaluation compares
intervention and control facilities, with the intervention (a standardised package of adherence
strategies for patients on chronic treatments) randomly allocated to 12 health facilities.
Facilities with similar VL suppression levels (and in the same TROA band) were matched to
form pairs. The pairs and their VLS and TROA are shown in the Executive Summary Table 2.

Table 6 shows viral load suppression among facilities broken down into quartiles by
number of patients on treatment. Facilities with more patients on treatment had higher
proportions of patients virologically suppressed. The 25% of facilities with at least 922
patients on treatment had a mean virologic suppression rate almost 15% higher than
the 25% of facilities with 175 or fewer patients on treatment. The observed differences
in viral suppression were all statistically significant and this was a linear relationship.
Facility type was not a confounder of the relationship between virologic suppression
and facility size: over 83% of all the facilities were classified as clinics (rather than
hospitals or other type of facility). When facility type was included in the mixed model
regression, it had minimal effect on the predicted coefficients.

Table 7 shows Moran’s I and Geary’s c statistics for viral load suppression for all the
facilities. Moran’s I has possible values from -1 (perfect dispersion) to 1 (perfect
correlation) and a value of 0 indicates a random spatial pattern. The value of Moran’s I
in this data set is 0.246; 95% CI (0.241, 0.251). The range of Geary’s c in from 0
(perfect correlation) to 2 (perfect dispersion). The value of Geary’s c in this data set
was 0.54; 95% CI (0.48, 0.60). These values indicate that neighbouring facilities are
likely to have similar viral load suppression rates.

Figure 8 is a scatterplot of the standardised proportion of viral load suppression versus
the weighted average of neighbouring facilities (Local Weighted Average), which shows
the same correlation graphically. The reference line has a slope of 1 and indicates
perfect correlation. The fitted line has a slope of 0.367, showing a positive correlation
between the proportion of suppressed viral load at a facility and its neighbouring
facilities.

Viral Suppression by Age and Gender
    Tables 8 and 9 show proportion suppressed by age group and gender. The
proportion of viral load suppression increased with age from a low of 51% in the
youngest age group (children under 5 years) to 83% in the population 50 years and
older. One in three ART patients under 25 years of age was not virally suppressed.
The differences between age groups is statistically significant at the p<0.0001 level.

Females had a higher proportion of viral suppression than men and this difference was
significant at the p<0.0001 level. One in six male and one in nine female ART patients
had a viral load >10,000 copies/mL. 

    This paper presents a novel analysis of data from the DHIS and the NHLS CDW to
provide a snapshot of ARV treatment outcomes in South Africa. The novel elements
are:


1          The probabilistic patient level linking which allows the creation of a patient-level
           cohort from individual laboratory results; and


2          The clinic linking which allows the combination of clinic-level reporting through
           the DHIS and viral load laboratory results from the patient cohort to be
           compared at the facility, health sub-district, district, provincial and national
           levels

The analysis shows that nationally, 75% of patients on ART received a viral load test in
the 12-month period, 78% of those tested were virologically suppressed, and 58% of
the ART patient population is known to be suppressed. This is in contrast to the DHIS
data from the adult cohort which estimated that 46% of patients on ART had a viral load
test in the past 12 months, 83% were virologically suppressed (Overmeyer, 2015) and
therefore only 38% of the ART patients were known to be suppressed.

The robustness of the findings is dependent in part upon the accuracy of the patient
level linking algorithm. We have estimated that this linking algorithm has an under-
linking rate of 11% and an over-linking rate of 15%. Under-linking results in tests not
being joined to patients, which results in patients contributing multiple viral load tests
(i.e., patients being counted more than once), while over-linking results in tests being
incorrectly linked to a different patient resulting in some patients’ viral load tests not
being counted, and a misleading picture of the viral load test frequency and results for
the patient to whom the results are incorrectly linked. Under-linking and over-linking
has an effect on the overall estimate of the number of patients who had a viral load test,
and a smaller effect on the pattern of viral load suppression (the level of distortion
depends on the differences in viral load among those whose records are incorrectly
linked).

The effects of over-linking and under-linking are dependent upon the time period being
measured. A short time period reduces the chances that a patient will have multiple
viral load tests which reduces the chance of over or under-linking. Thus, the analysis
was limited to a 12-month period, chosen because it is expected that all patients would
have at least one viral load test in this time period and that a low proportion would have
had more than one.

Results from all viral load tests were compared to results limited to the patient’s last test
in the study period. At the national level and most provinces, the difference in viral load
suppression was 2–4% lower when looking at all test results. Viral load suppression
rates from all test results provides a lower boundary for viral load suppression as it
includes patients who have had more than one test in a 12-month period; the most
likely contributor to this difference would be from patients with unsuppressed viral loads
in whom a repeat viral load test was requested following adherence counselling.

Regarding the number of patients who were tested, there is a strong consistency
between the TROA and the number of patients who have been tested at least once in
the 12-month period. At the national, provincial, and district levels, TROA always
exceeds the number of patients tested, which is logically consistent and expected. This
same finding doesn’t always hold true at the facility level, but we believe that this is due
to some minor issues with facility matching between the DHIS and NHLS datasets.

The analysis of the DHIS and NHLS CDW datasets also required facility level linking.
We were able to link 95% of the 3,674 clinics reporting a TROA in the DHIS with the
NHLS laboratory viral load test results. The matched facilities account for 96% of the
TROA in the DHIS. While the matching was not entirely complete, the results of an
unmatched analysis of NHLS data at provincial level show negligible differences in viral
load suppression. We excluded 102 facilities with a TROA of 12 or less from the
analysis. These 102 facilities accounted for a total of 523 TROA (0.02% of the total
TROA), so we do not believe that their inclusion would make any difference in our
results.

This analysis assumes that clinics are following viral load monitoring guidelines which
call for the routine use of viral loads at yearly intervals except for the first test at six
months after commencing ART. It is possible that some facilities test people who are
yet to start ART or who are known to be off ART, or that frequent repeat VL tests are
being done in those identified as having a VL greater than 1,000 cp/mL. While this
might explain some of the diversity we see in facility-level virologic suppression, it is
unlikely to explain the differences in virologic suppression by facility TROA size.

This analysis demonstrates the diversity in the proportion of patients virally suppressed
by geographic location, facility and demography in South Africa. Nationally, viral load
suppression was 78%, but some provinces, districts and facilities were able to achieve
higher suppression rates. Among provinces, the two that performed best had
suppression rates 11–12% higher than the three worst-performing provinces. At the
district level, the best-performing districts had suppression rates more than 40% higher
than the worst-performing districts. The gap between the best and poorest performing
facilities was even greater. We found that the best-performing districts had larger
patient populations than poorer-performing districts.

We found a positive linear correlation between facility TROA size and viral load
suppression. The 25% of facilities with the largest TROA had viral load suppression
rates 3.8% higher than the second quartile, 7.4% higher than the third quartile, and
almost 15% higher than the 25% of facilities with the smallest TROA. Implementing
HIV treatment for large numbers of patients can be challenging, especially in regards to
patient waiting times. However, this analysis suggests that facilities with high patient
loads have been able to provide high-quality care as evidenced by the high rates of viral
load suppression found in their patient populations. When examining possible
explanations for this, we ruled out the type of site as the vast majority of sites were
clinics and type of site had no influence on the results. Many other factors could
contribute to the differences in viral suppression across sites: staffing level, staffing
type, time since ART provision started at the site, and rural/urban location, however this
data could not be taken into consideration within the scope of this analysis. Moreover,
we cannot rule out data issues—results at facilities with small patient populations are
more sensitive to a small number of errors, whereas for big facilities, errors get
absorbed in the size of the population.

We demonstrated correlations in the proportions of viral load suppression between
neighbouring facilities using two different methods of correlation. This can be
interpreted as evidence that neighbouring facilities have more similar levels of virologic
suppression than facilities that are further away. Possible explanations could include
shared patient populations with similar socio-economic profiles; or shared provincial
and district governance with similar policies, programmatic support and health systems
factors. However, due to the limited information in our data set we cannot test any of
these explanations.

Viral load suppression also was associated with age, with older age groups having
higher levels of viral suppression. The two oldest age groups contributed 88% of the
viral load tests; 79% of the tests given to 25–49 year olds and 83% of tests given to
patients 50 years and older were suppressed. Around two-thirds of the tests given to
the 5–14 year olds and 15–24 year olds were suppressed, while only 51% of the tests
given to the 0–4 year olds were suppressed. The high rate of unsuppressed viral loads
in the 0–4 year old age group may be attributed, in part, to the lack of understanding of
treatment and monitoring procedures in this population. Nevertheless, these results
indicate that high viral load while on treatment is a critical problem affecting adolescents
and particularly children under 5 enrolled in the ART programme. Nationally, patients
25-49 years of age make up 73% of persons on ART and the 50 and older age group
another 13%, which is similar to the age distribution of test results in the NHLS dataset
(Shisana, O et al., 2014).

Viral testing by gender showed that females received approximately two-thirds of tests
and approximately 5% more females had viral suppression. Nationally, females are
estimated to make up 67% of all HIV positive persons on treatment (Shisana, O. et al.,
2014), so their testing rate is about what would be expected.

The comparison of the NHLS to the DHIS results showed close results for the
proportion of viral load suppressed but large differences in the proportion of patients
receiving a viral load test. The national difference in proportion viral load suppressed
was 2% (78 vs. 83%) while the difference in viral load tests done was 29% (75 vs.
46%). There are a number of possible explanations for the large differences between
DHIS and our findings. Firstly, the TIER.Net data collection is incomplete: the results
come from a national cohort of over 400,000 patients at a time when the same system
was reporting over 2 million patients on ART. The facilities adopting TIER.Net early are
likely to be better managed facilities and might have higher VLS than later TIER.Net
adopters. Secondly, the data are captured two different ways. The NHLS data are
captured from the laboratories using automated methods and housed in a centralised
data warehouse, while the TIER.Net data are captured at the clinic level. For the test to
be captured at the clinic level, test results must be received by the clinic from the
laboratory; results must be printed and filed in the patient’s folder; and the results
entered into TIER.Net. An evaluation of the clinic laboratory interface noted that
process compliance of a clinic receiving lab results was such that only 35% of lab
results were filed in patients’ folders (Young & Galloway, 2010). Such low compliance
could explain a large proportion of the observed differences.

While the range of viral load suppression at the provincial level is narrow, it is much
greater at the district and facility level. If all facilities followed the national viral load
monitoring guidelines, then the results could be accepted at face value and lower viral
load suppression rates could be interpreted as patients not doing as well in one facility
compared to another. However, it is possible that some facilities might have adopted
alternative strategies for viral load testing such as selectively testing ART patients who
they think are not doing well on treatment. Evidence for this also exists in the variability
of proportions of patients estimated to have been tested in the past 12 months across
districts. Some districts tested less than 70% of their patients in the past 12 months,
while others tested more than 90%. If facilities are using different monitoring strategies
then a straight comparison is not possible. It would be important to understand why
facilities are not fully monitoring all of their patients.

In addition to providing patient-level results of viral suppression in South Africa, this
analysis also debuts the patient-level laboratory cohort, demonstrating its ability to
provide detailed information on viral load suppression in South Africa. This information
can be used to identify facilities that have low viral load suppression, a low proportion of

patients tested in the previous 12 months, and a low proportion of patients known to be
virologically suppressed, so that problems can be identified and corrected. It can also
help us learn from the facilities that achieve near-universal viral suppression among
their ART patients. This report has demonstrated the utility of using NHLS test results in
combination with DHIS information. If this combination of data are routinely used to
track progress on ART treatment effectiveness in the future, it could inform the
allocation of resources for programme improvements.

The South African government has set a target of 90% viral load suppression among
HIV patients on treatment. This analysis shows that while some facilities are achieving
this goal, it is not being achieved by any entire district or province. By any measure, the
health system needs to improve the monitoring of patients’ viral loads, the processing of
information and communication of viral suppression results at clinic level. More
complete viral load monitoring is crucial to enable satisfactory monitoring of the health
of patients who are not having regular viral load tests. The adoption and routine use of
the National Health ID number will make the combination of DHIS and NHLS laboratory
data a powerful tool for better clinical care and programmatic monitoring. In the short
term, the use of a combination of both NHLS laboratory and DHIS data is
recommended for programmatic and facility monitoring of the ARV programme.

This work shows that Big Data―in this case a secondary analysis of large sets of
routine data and innovative methodology of record linkage―can inform programme
improvements. Specifically, the present analysis highlights health facilities and districts
which need enhanced adherence support, and it also identifies success stories where
viral suppression is achieved and ART patients regularly monitored to ascertain
treatment effectiveness. 
