Executive Summary

This report presents findings of process evaluation of the Promoting Basic Services (Phase-3) Project,
which was undertaken during the second half of 2015. The evaluation was conducted in terms of six
criteria (relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, impact, sustainability, and coherence) and twelve key
questions. Given the nature of evaluation, lesser emphasis was given on impact assessment. The
methodology included: desk research; key informant interviews with the concerned ministries, federal
agencies, and the development partners; group interviews with key staff of Bureau of Finance and
Economic Development and five sector bureaus in four regions (SNNPR, Oromiya, Somali, and
Benishangul Gumuz); group interviews with key staff of Woreda Office of Finance and Economic
Development and sector bureaus in eight woredas (two in each selected region); and focus group
discussions with 188 community members across eight kebeles (one in each selected woreda). A
major limitation of the present study is that the field data has been collected from a few regions,
woredas, and kebeles. The sample size could not be increased due to time and resource constraints.
The key findings of the process evaluation are summarised in the table given below:

                                                          Key findings

  Relevance &     • The project development objective of PBS-3 was valid and appropriate in the country
  Coherence         context at appraisal, but the program did not address adequately inequities in basic services
                    across regions and across income/wealth quintiles.
                  • The theory of change underscores the relevance of activities/outputs of PBS-3 in achieving
                    project development objective. It also highlights strong complementarity between the PBS
                    program and the sector specific programs. Integration of PBS with sector programs should
                    be one of the key considerations for on-going efforts towards donors’ harmonization.
                  • The water and road sectors require more capital investments, while the PBS funding
                    through block grants supports only revenue expenditure. Thus, the PBS program has hardly
                    benefited these two capital-intensive sectors. The present evaluation is of the opinion that
                    PBS-3 could have covered only education, health, and agriculture sectors instead of thinly
                    spreading resources.
                  • The core principles of PBS-3 are of great relevance, but there is scope for improving
                    sustainability, equity and predictability reviews.
                  • The results framework suffers from some shortcomings such as inappropriate higher-level
                    health indicators; lack of technical note to define indicator for measurement; use of double
                    data source without setting comparable targets; and data inconsistencies.
                  • The Sub-Program A and Sub-Program B of PBS-3 are coherent with the fifth and sixth
                    pillars of the Growth and Transformation Plan respectively. Both the components also
                    complement each other. However, the scope of institutional reforms under Sub-Program B
                    embraces too many challenging areas.
  Effectiveness   • Of the seven higher-level indicators, 43 per cent targets were achieved in 2012-13 and 57
                    per cent in 2013-14. Similarly, of the six PDO indicators, 50 per cent and 60 per cent
                    targets were achieved in 2012-13 and 2013-14 respectively. The overall achievements
                    during the period under consideration may be rated moderate.
                    Sector performance
                  • Net enrolment ratio at Grade 5-8 remained consistently low (less than 50 per cent) and fell
                    far short of the program targets. The proportion of qualified teachers at Grade 1-8, another
                    key indicator, improved over the years but remained significantly below the targets in
                    2012-13 and 2013-14. The targets related to gender parity index, the student-teacher ratio
                    and number of qualified teachers were fully met in both the years.
                  • Penta-3 vaccine coverage increased over the years but targets were underachieved in 2012-
                    13 and 2013-14. The ANC coverage overachieved the targets. The population per health
                    extension worker was below the norm (one extension worker per 2,500 population) in
                    2012-13 but it improved in 2013-14 almost reaching the norm.
                  • Increase in development agents with required specialisation did not meet the targets in both
                    the years, while the targets for food crops productivity and outreach to direct beneficiaries
                                                             Key findings

                      fully met the targets in both the years.
                   • Rural water supply coverage and reduction in non-functional water schemes in 2012-13
                     and 2013-14 remained far below the targets, while all the targets in road sector were
                     achieved during that period.
                     Findings of the field mission
                   • Most of the woredas grade performance of their primary/secondary schools, while lesser
                     number of woredas evaluates health facilities. The findings indicate opportunity for
                     developing an appropriate results based and incentivised service management system.
                   • The woredas are faced with some recurrent challenges/constraints, such as shortage of
                     skilled/trained manpower, high staff turnover, and budget constraint to finance operating
                     expenditure and capital investments. Besides, there are some sector specific problems.
                   • Most of the community members in select kebeles feel that there has been marginal
                     improvement in the quality of basic services compared to earlier years. In their opinion,
                     education, health, agriculture, and sanitation services have improved compared to water
                     and rural road services.
                     Progress in strengthening local accountability and transparency
                   • The targets of financial transparency and accountability and social accountability were
                     achieved in 2012-13 and 2013-14. Anecdotal evidence also suggests that citizen acts on
                     dissemination of budget and expenditure data. Similarly, social accountability facilitations
                     along with other interventions have brought about improvements in basic service delivery.
                     However, community consultation by woreda officials for improving service delivery has
                     not progressed as expected. In recent period, there has been satisfactory progress in linkage
                     between financial transparency and accountability and social accountability activities.
                   • GRM offices are present in all regions except in Afar. Five regions (as against a target of
                     six regions) prepared and adopted standardised manual and guidelines in 2012-13. In 2013-
                     14, the number of such regions increased to eight and the target was achieved. Grievance
                     redress mechanisms at regional, zone, and woreda levels are facing several challenges (e.g.
                     lack of independence; weak enforcement of decisions). Besides, citizens are generally not
                     satisfied with redress of complaints.
                   • The public financial management at woreda level has progressed well. The achievements
                     inter alia include extensive roll out IBEX; improved audit coverage by the Office of
                     Regional Auditor General; and hundred per cent audit coverage by the Office of the
                     Federal Auditor General. However, a large number of woredas do not take follow up
                     actions on audit findings. Procurement is another significant challenge at woreda level.
                   • Under managing for results component, the updating and sharing of PBS results in every
                     Joint Review and Implementation Support has been satisfactory. But the works related to
                     strengthening multi-sector management information systems and conducting some
                     analytical studies have not progressed well. Due to slow progress, forward work plan of
                     this component has been redrawn and prioritised, and budget allocation has been reduced.
                     Aid Effectiveness
                   • PBS program meets very well the aid effectiveness principles of the Paris Declaration.
                   • The semi-annual Joint Review and Implementation Support and Joint Budget and Aid
                     Review do not provide any scope for strategic discussion and decision-making. This calls
                     for rethinking on the existing format of semi-annual joint review forum.
                   • Given the realignment of donors’ support to the PBS program, the donors are working
                     towards developing a common framework for donors’ harmonization. The work is still in-
                     progress. The PBS secretariat has been reconstituted as Service Delivery Secretariat, which
                     is required to play a critical role in donors’ harmonization.
   Efficiency      • The PBS program has moderately achieved value-for-money. Unlike the DfID study, the
                     present evaluation does not consider a declining trend in the real salary as ‘economy’ of
                     staff input costs. In the Ethiopian context, low salary structure is one of the causal factors
                     for staff turnover in the public sector. The value-for-money analysis also reveals that
                     ‘efficiency’ and ‘equity’ values have not been achieved at the desired level.
                   • The Bank’s leadership and implementation support has been satisfactory. GoE has shown
                     sustained ownership and commitment for the program. PBS secretariat has been quite

                                                           Key findings

                      effective in achieving donors’ harmonization and coordination.
                    • The bank has developed environment and social screening tool to manage potential risks
                      associated with any operational interface between the Bank-funded projects and community
                      development program of the regions. The federal government has already approved the
                      screening tool.
   Impact           • The poverty and social impact assessment study of the World Bank finds positive impacts
                      of woreda-level spending in achieving outcomes in education, health, and agriculture
                      sectors. It also claims that benefits of woreda-level spending on education and health have
                      percolated to all income levels, and per capita expenditure favoured disadvantaged regions
                      and ethnic groups.
                    • The present evaluation has tracked progress towards millennium development goals 1 to 5
                      applying counterfactual analysis and using latest available data. The progress has been
                      satisfactory except for maternal health, which remained completely off the track. It may be
                      reasonable to say that the PBS program with its support for expansion of basic services has
                      contributed in this progress.
                    • There is no specific reference or proven records of any unintended or negative impacts of
                      the PBS-3 program except the alleged link of the program with human right abuses in
                      Gambella. The allegation was not found true, but it has brought the program under intense
                      international scrutiny.
   Sustainability   • The medium term projections (2015-16 to 2019-20) undertaken in the present evaluation
                      study shows that if the current fiscal conditions continue, provision of basic services for
                      the growing population would require, in addition to GoE’s own funding, donors’ support
                      of USD 150-200 million per year.
                    • The PBS program has made significant strides towards institutional sustainability in public
                      financial management, citizen engagement through financial and social accountability
                      activities, and establishing grievance redress mechanisms. However, more reforms are still
                      required, especially for institutionalisation of social accountability initiatives.

Lessons learned
    •    Decentralised service delivery supported through inter governmental transfers is an effective
         development model to reduce poverty and achieve other millennium development goals.
    •    The PBS program through its partnership and pooled-fund approach offers an effective
         alternative to general budget support system.
    •    Citizen engagement activities promote direct accountability of the service providers, and
         improve service delivery.
    •    Use of the country systems has been crucial for gaining the government’s ownership of the
         program.
    •    A dedicated resource allocation by the development partners to set up a PBS secretariat is an
         essential step forward to achieve donors’ coordination and harmonization.
    •    Pilots should be undertaken with a perspective plan on how the experience and results of
         pilots will be scaled up to a national level.
    •    Decentralised basic service delivery is a complex process, and it must be supported by deep-
         rooted institutional reforms at sub-national level.
    •    Failure to assess environmental and social risks may put the program at reputational risk.

Recommendations
    •    Focusing on education, health, and agriculture sectors where program impacts are more.
    •    Setting up a high-level program steering committee for strategic discussion and decision-
         making.
    •    Strengthening donors harmonization at two levels:

             −   Sector level (Level-1): Developing a single integrated plan/budget, and common
                 results framework, and conducting a combined joint review mission for the sector
             −   National level (Level-2): Synchronization of multi-sector programs with the similar
                 or complementary program interventions, and developing a common strategy and
                 work plan for the development partners
             −   Redefining objectives and activities of the service delivery secretariat
             −   Ensuring required technical skills by hiring full-term or short-term experts
                 (economist; public financial management specialist; environmental and safeguard
                 specialist; monitoring and evaluation expert; knowledge and communication expert)
    •   Benchmarking service delivery at woreda and service provider levels
    •   Conducting yearly beneficiary survey in each region using standard tools, and integrating the
        regional results to get a national perspective
    •   Regions to check five per cent sector data every year in two to three sample woredas with the
        technical support from CSA
    •   Expediting the exercise on estimation of cost of basic services and resource mobilisation
    •   Pending development of a concrete plan for institutionalisation of social accountability
        activities, undertaking the following:
             −   Sustained awareness campaign for citizens steered by local administrators and
                 council members
             −   Sensitizing council members, government officials, and service providers about
                 citizens’ right to services and their responsibilities, and building their capacity to use
                 of social accountability tools
             −   Engaging the existing community based organizations (e.g. parent teachers
                 associations, health boards, water committees) in social accountability activities and
                 building their capacity to use social accountability tools
             −   Harmonizing social accountability program funded by other development partners
                 (e.g. United States Agency for International Development) with the Ethiopia Social
                 Accountability Program

Chapter 1: Introduction

1.1     Background
1. Ethiopia is a geographically and culturally diverse country with an estimated population of 90
million1. The country has followed a development state model, with poverty reduction as a core theme
of its growth and transformation plan (GTP). It has achieved remarkable economic growth (averaging
10.6 per cent over 2006-2014), and made substantial progress in achieving millennium development
goals (MDGs) including poverty reduction. However, despite growth and development, Ethiopia
remains one of the poorest countries in the world. The country’s per capita income (USD 550) is
much lower than the Sub-Saharan Africa’s average income (USD 1, 638)2.
2. The Government of Ethiopia (GoE) has a long history of working with the development partners
(DPs), which provided substantial funds to the government in the form of general budget support
(GBS). Following the post-election crisis in 2005, some DPs decided to suspend budget support,
while other including the World Bank (hereinafter referred to as Bank), Department for International
Development (DfID), and African Development Bank (AfDB) looked for a new funding mechanism
to support the government since complete withdrawal of budget support might cause reversal of the
country’s economic and human development progress achieved till date. In 2006, the protection of
basic services (PBS) program became the new funding mechanism. Initially, the donors considered
the program for preparing ground for resumption of GBS, but as time progressed both GoE and DPs
started appreciating contributions of PBS in improving decentralised basic services, and the program
continued through phases3.
3. The first phase (PBS-1) ran from June 2006 to December 2009, and it supported the following
basic sectors: education, health, agriculture, and water supply and sanitation. The program completion
cost was USD 2,958 million against budget estimates of USD 1,929 million4. The second phase (PBS-
2) covered the period from May 2009 to January 2013. It expanded the definition of basic services to
include rural roads. The program was completed at USD 3,763 million compared to budget estimates
of USD 2,707 million5.
4. Effective from December 2012, the third phase (PBS-3) began and it is now scheduled to close
on 7 January 2019. The PBS-3 program is rechristened as promoting basic services, reflecting the fact
that both the government and DPs have demonstrated their commitments to protect basic service
delivery and, hence, the extended phase therefore stands for promoting basic services. The revised
budget estimate of the PBS-3 program is USD 1215.74 million, of which USD 924.01 million (76 per
cent) has been disbursed as of 19 May 20156.
5. Very recently, the PBS-3 has witnessed several changing circumstances, such as (i) withdrawal
of DfID’s funding support with effect from 1 July 2015, causing a financing gap of USD 162.4
million7; (ii) realignment of the Bank’s support to basic services through a new program titled
Enhancing Shared Prosperity through Equitable Services (ESPES) at an estimated IDA funding of
USD 600 million; (iii) AfDB’s proposed sector budget support program called Basic Services
Transformation Program (BSTP) at an estimated cost of UA 180 million (USD 252 million); and (iv)
the decision of DfID and the European Union (EU) to focus on direct engagement in basic service
sectors. Notwithstanding all these realignments, the PBS donors have recognised the urgent need for

Chapter 2: An Overview of the PBS-3 Program

This chapter presents key features of the PBS-3, and provides an update on the program’s recent
realignment. A brief note on evolution of the PBS program is presented in Annex-3.

2.1     Key Features of the PBS-3 Program (Dec 2012 – Jan 2019)
2.1.1    Development objectives
9. The PBS-3 program has evolved leveraging on the core architecture and the implementation
experience of the earlier two phases. Its project development objective (PDO) is essentially the same
as pursued under PBS-1&2. In specific terms, PBS-3 is designed “to contribute to the higher-level
objective of expanding access and improving the quality of basic services by funding block grants
that ensure adequate staffing and operations, and by strengthening the capacity, transparency,
accountability and financial management of regional governments and authorities at woreda level”.
2.1.2    Program components
10. Originally, the PBS-3 program included three components viz. Sub-Program A (block grants),
Sub-Program B (strengthening local accountability and transparency systems), and Sub-Program C
(results enhancement fund). The Sub-Programs C was dropped due to implementation challenges.
Recently, a new sub-component has been added to the Sub-Program B.
11. Sub-Program A: This is the main funding component of the program. The funds are provided in
the form of contribution to the government’s inter-governmental fiscal transfers (IGFT), or block
grants, from federal to the regions (excluding Addis Ababa), and from regions to the woredas. At
woreda level, local administration has discretion to decide allocation of block grants to the five basic
sectors based on its own needs.
12. The block grants provided under the program can be used for financing only the woreda-level
recurrent expenditure (salaries and operating expenditure) in the five basic services viz. education,
health, agriculture, water supply and sanitation, and rural roads. With the availability of increased
block grants, the woreda administration goes for hiring additional frontline service providers, such as
primary school teachers, health extension workers (HEW), and development agents (DAs). They also
use block grants to pay salaries of government experts who oversee and manage development of new
water schemes. Similarly, the woredas pay staff salary to set up and operate road desks that support
rural roads construction.
13. Sub-program B: This component supports strengthening local accountability and transparency
systems through three interrelated sub-components viz. (i) citizen’s engagement (sub-component B1);
(ii) local public financial management and procurement (sub-component B2); and (iii) managing for
results (sub-component B3).
14. The citizen’s engagement component seeks to help woredas improve quality of service delivery
through an institutionalized system for financial transparency and accountability (FTA), social
accountability (SA), and grievance redress mechanism (GRM). While the FTA component aims at
deepening the citizens' access to information on budget, expenditure and service delivery, the SA
component creates demand for greater transparency by encouraging citizens’ participation in basic
service delivery through engagement and support of civil societies, non-government organizations
called social accountability implementing partners (SAIPs)9. The Ethiopia Social Accountability

9
  The SA process involves: (i) citizen’s access to information about service standards, plan targets, and budgets;
(ii) training of citizen on how to use SA tools (community score card; participatory planning and budgeting;
citizen report card; gender responsive budgeting; and public expenditure tracking survey) for assessing access
and quality of service delivery vis-à-vis standard/plan/budget; (iii) organization of woreda or kebele level
interface meetings between citizen and service providers so as to arrive at a joint action plan to address the
identified problems/constraints; (iv) implementation of the joint action plan; and (v) monitoring improvements
in access and quality of service delivery by local Social Accountability Committee.
Program, Phase-2 (ESAP-2), which was launched in November 2011, plans and implements the social
accountability activities10. This program is managed by a management agency (MA).
15. The GRM is included under citizen’s engagement component to provide financial and technical
support to the Ethiopian Institute of the Ombudsman (EIO), and to build capacity of the existing
GRM offices in the region by developing a common standard of grievance redress procedures and
handling, and by imparting training to the grievance handling officers.
16. Compared to PBS-1&2, the PBS-3 program has a strong focus on strengthening public financial
management (PFM) and procurement systems at woreda-level. The main activities supported by this
sub-component inter alia include development and dissemination of manuals for cash management,
procurement, internal audit; rolling out of IBEX to woredas; strengthening internal audit’ and
enhancing audit coverage by the office of the federal auditor general (OFAG) and office of the
regional auditor general (ORAG).
17. Unlike the previous two phases, PBS-3 has a strong focus on results. It has added managing for
results (MforR) to Sub-Program B. The MforR component aims at (i) monitoring PBS results; (ii)
strengthening multi-sector, decentralized system for gathering timely and credible data; and (iii)
undertaking targeted surveys and studies that fill crucial gaps in the GoE's and DP's understanding of
how PBS results can be sustainably achieved.
18. Sub-program C: The initial design of PBS-3 included the results enhancement fund (REF), and
DfID allocated GBP 50.4 million for this component. The purpose of REF was to incentivize
budgetary performance of the regions by instituting an annual performance prize. It was expected to
follow the framework of Public Expenditure and Financial accountability (PEFA) to assess budgetary
performance of the regions. However, REF could not be implemented because of several
implementation challenges including the problem of defining appropriate and verifiable benchmarks,
and the difficulties of managing the competing aspirations of the regions as well as ensuring fairness
of REF distribution across the regions11. In 2014, REF was dropped and the funding for it withdrawn.
19. Addition of fourth sub-component under Sub-Program B: The recent restructuring of PBS-3
(July 2015) includes a fourth sub-component under Sub-Program B, namely risk and safeguard
management capacity, with a budget allocation of USD 14.5 million. The main purpose of this sub-
component is to boost woreda level capacity to manage environmental and social risks, and to build
capacity of the implementation support agencies viz. OFAG, the Federal Ethics and Anti-Corruption
Commission (FEACC), and the Federal Public Procurement and Property Administration Agency
(FPPPAA)12.
2.1.3    Core principles, tests and reviews
20. The release of block grant is linked to satisfactory compliance with mutually agreed set of core
principles, which is checked through tests and reviews. There were four core principles under PBS-1,
which were revised in PBS-2 and referred to as SAFE principles13. The PBS-3 program considered
further revision and included eight core principles, namely effectiveness, sustainability, additionality,
fairness, equity, transparency, fiduciary probity, and predictability (Table 2.1).
21. According to the recent restructuring of the program (July 2015), additionality principle and tests
will not be required any more. This is because the Bank’s new program ESPES, which will now
provide block grants instead of PBS-3, emphasises sustained increase in per capita block grant. The,
additionality tests are therefore no longer relevant.


10
   The program was originally expected to close by 31 Dec. 2015. In the steering committee meeting held on 28
Aug 2014, it was agreed to extend the completion period up to 30 June 2016. The decision was formally
endorsed through Amendment No. 4 to Grant Agreement duly signed by the World Bank and the management
agency on 23 March 2015.
11
   DfID mentioned these points.
12
   For further details refer to World Bank (July 20, 2015): Restructuring Paper.
13
   These principles are: sustainability in additionality (S); accountability and fairness (A); fiduciary standards
(F); and effectiveness (E).

   Core principles                                            Review/tests
 Effectiveness         The effectiveness of service delivery is assessed through a review of the following: (i)
                       adequacy of medium term resource allocations to basic service sectors; (ii) balance
                       between recurrent vs. capital spending allocations, and salary vs. non-salary
                       expenditures; and (iii) results achieved. In every JRIS, effectiveness review is
                       conducted for two of the five basic service sectors based on data and information
                       gathered through pre-JRIS field missions; and the inputs provided by sector experts,
                       sector Ministries, and DPs.
 Sustainability        The sustainability review considers (i) financing sources for decentralized basic
                       services, including the government’s own revenue, contributions of DPs (through
                       Channels 1&2), community contributions, etc.; and (ii) the unit costs of providing
                       basic services, both current and projected costs.
 Additionality         This principle ensures that (a) GoE priority for MDGs are expressed in medium-term
                       commitments to increase overall financing for the federal block grants and (b) allocated
                       resources for basic services are flowing in a predictable manner. Two additionality tests
                       are conducted viz. (i) non-declining trend in the proportion of allocated federal block
                       grants (FBG) to regions in total federal expenditure (through treasury sources only i.e.
                       excluding debt payments and MDG support fund) in a given year as well as a positive
                       trend in the medium term; and (ii) non-declining trend in FBG allocation to regions in
                       real terms in a given year. These two tests are conducted twice in a year as explained
                       below:
                         • Ex-ante additionality test (April/May JRIS): The two tests are conducted for the
                            next year (t+1) compared to the current year (t)
                         • Ex-post additionality test (October/November JRIS): The two tests are conducted
                            for the current year (t) compared to the previous year (t-1)
 Fairness              The objective of fairness principle is to ensure (a) that resource allocations from the
                       federal government to the regions, and from region to woredas, are rules-based and
                       transparent, and (b) that block grant disbursements to the regions, as well as from
                       regions to woredas, are executed as planned in the budget allocations. Two fairness
                       tests are conducted in a year as given under:
                         • Fairness test (April/May JRIS): This is an informal test and it is carried out to flag
                             any major discrepancies between half-yearly allocations and transfers of federal
                             block grants (a) from federal to regions, and (b) from regions to woredas.
                         • Fairness test (October/November JRIS): This is a formal test and it is conducted to
                             examine whether the allocated block grant amounts in the preceding fiscal year
                             have been fully disbursed. For the purpose of the test, fully disbursed means that at
                             least 90 per cent of the allocated funds have been transferred. Any disbursement
                             less than 90 per cent needs an explanation.
 Equity                This principle refers to equitable access to basic services between different regions and
                       within regions, while also accounting for gender-related differences. The equity aspect
                       is checked through an equity review, conducted half yearly as follows:
                         • Equity review (April/May JRIS): This review makes an assessment of the
                            discrepancies in access to basic services between the big and emerging regions, as
                            well as discrepancies in terms of gender. The ‘managing for results’ component of
                            the program is expected to provide region and gender-specific data.
                         • Equity review (October/November JRIS): This review is carried out based on the
                            feedback obtained through discussions with the relevant stakeholders (e.g. woreda
                            council members, service providers, beneficiaries) as part of the pre-JRIS field
                            missions. The discussions with the stakeholders are conducted as per agreed terms
                            of reference containing guiding questions.
 Transparency          The core tasks under FTA are dissemination of information on budget, expenditure, and
                       service delivery; and conducting budget literacy trainings for citizens, sector officials,
                       council members, and the PFM team members. The progress on these and related tasks
                       are discussed in each JRIS based on pre-mission field reports, MoFED’s compiled
                       report, and the critical comments from the regional participants. Following the

      Core principles                                         Review/tests
                         discussion, the FTA actions and deliverable for the next JRIS are decided.
     Fiduciary probity   The PBS program requires the government to submit regular financial reports and
                         audits to DPs to demonstrate that fiduciary standards are being maintained and
                         strengthened. Each JRIS hears an update on progress achieved and then defines a series
                         of deliverables for the following JRIS.
     Predictability      The predictability principle seeks to ensure mutual accountability by predictable
                         resource flows for basic service delivery results. Development Partner contributions
                         need to be based on longer-term commitments, so that agreed disbursements can be
                         made on time. Likewise, the Government has a responsibility to accurately reflect these
                         DP contributions for PBS in yearly government budgets. For ensuring predictability,
                         the government and DPs are required to review all these at each JBAR.

2.1.4       Program implementation arrangement
22. Implementing agencies: The Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MoFED) is the
agency for program implementation at the federal level with responsibility for funds disbursement and
smooth functioning of public financial management systems. The other implementing agencies at the
federal level include: line ministries engaged in delivering basic services viz. Ministry of Education
(MoE), Ministry of Health (MoH), Ministry of Agriculture (MoA), Ministry of Water, Irrigation and
Electricity (MoWIE), Ethiopian Road and Transport Authority (ERTA); the Central Statistical
Agency (CSA); OFAG; FEACC; and FPPPAA.
23. At the regional level, the Bureaus of Finance and Economic Development (BoFEDs) have
similar responsibilities as the MoFED has at the federal level. At local level, Woreda Office of
Finance and Economic Development (WoFEDs) and Urban Administration Offices of Finance have
similar responsibilities as those of the BoFEDs.
24. The councils at region, zone, woreda, and kebele levels are responsible for (a) providing general
oversight of program implementation; (b) reviewing and approving annual development plans and
budgets; and (c) facilitating information sharing and harness the involvement of citizens in the
planning, budgeting, and management of delivering basic services. They are also responsible for
sustained monitoring of transparency and accountability initiatives.
25. PBS Secretariat: This was established at the outset of PBS-I and was further elaborated and
formalized at the beginning of PBS-II in 2009. Under the PBS-3 program, a new ToR was developed,
which defined three strategic objectives for the secretariat, namely (i) sustain and improve all
partners’ understanding on the effectiveness, efficiency, and management of block grant resources;
(ii) contribute to an improved understanding of the PBS program’s sector impact; and (iii) provide
effective administration and logistical coordination in support of improved dialogue and supervision.
The ToR also specified the scope of work under eight broader heads, and provided an organogram14.
26. However, in view of the realignment of the donors around the PBS program, the PBS secretariat
has been reconstituted as Service Delivery Secretariat (SDS) with effect from July 201515.
27. Results framework and M&E: The results framework of PBS-3 includes indicators for (a)
higher-level objectives, (b) PDO, and (c) intermediate results. The results indicators were first revised
in 2011, then in 2013, and the last revision took place in July 2015. Including the last revision, there
are now four intermediate results areas, namely: (i) improved availability of qualified staff and
operational resources for delivery of basic services; (ii) improved transparency and fiduciary
assurance regarding the use of public funds; (iii) improved citizens’ engagement on quality of basic
services delivery; (iv) strengthened M&E systems at federal, regional, and sub-national levels; and (v)
improved environmental and social management capacity. The fifth results area corresponds to the
new sub-component added to Sub-Program B.

     More will be discussed about donors’ harmonization and SDS later in this report.

28. JRIS/JBAR: Since inception the program review process has relied on semi-annual joint review
and implementation support (JRIS) mission, which also includes joint budget and aid review (JBAR).
The purpose of JRIS is to review program progress against the agreed results framework; dated
covenants; and other deliverables related to system strengthening as agreed in the previous JRIS. Prior
to JRIS/JBAR, field visits were often organized under PBS-1&2. The same process has been followed
under PBS-3. Prior to each JRIS, field missions are undertaken focusing on thematic areas. It may be
further noted that JRIS trigger disbursements of block grants.

2.2     Realignment of PBS-3
2.2.1   New program ESPES
29. As mentioned in the introductory chapter, the Bank has realigned its support to basic services by
introducing a new program ESPES, which covers a three-year period, from 15 September 2015 to 5
January 2019, and replaces Sub-Program A of PBS-3 that ended on 6 July 2015 with all its funding
allocations being utilised. The new program will be effective from 1 October 2015 onward. The total
donors’ funding support to ESPES is estimated at USD 857.20 million, including IDA funding of
USD 600 million.
30. The development objective of ESPES is to “improve equitable access to basic services and
strengthen accountability systems at the decentralised level”. Equity is the key focus of ESPES and
that makes it distinct from the PBS series. Another unique feature of ESPES is the program’s reliance
on a new financing instrument called the program for results (PforR). This instrument allows
disbursement of funds upon achievement of desired results as specified through a set of disbursement-
linked indicators (DLIs)16.
31. Alongside ESPES, PBS-3 will continue with Sub-Program B until it closes in January 2019. Its
sole objective will be to build capacity at woreda level and improve data collection to monitor results.
2.2.2   Other restructuring
32. GoE and DPs have expressed their support to develop third phase of ESAP, which is planned to
start in July 2017. A road map with medium-term priorities/activities for this program has been
finalised and approved by the steering committee17. ESAP-2 is due to close by 30 June 2016, but a
bridging funding (estimated at USD 4.6 million) is expected to extend the overall disbursement
closing date multi-donor trust fund (MDTF) until June 201718. The six-month period of bridging
funding will ensure a smooth transition to the third phase of ESAP.
33. It is understood that a separate PFM program is being developed as a follow up of recently
closed public sector capacity building program (PSCAP)19. The document is not made public and so
details are not known.

2.3     Summary

                                    An overview of the PBS-3 program

An overview of the PBS-3 program: The PBS-3 program is designed to contribute to the higher-level objective
of expanding access and improving the quality of basic services by funding block grants that ensure adequate
staffing and operations, and by strengthening the capacity, transparency, accountability and financial
management of regional governments and authorities at woreda level. The key features of the program are as
follows:
• PBS-3 consists of Sub-Program-A (block grants), and Sub-Program-B. The latter consists of three interrelated

  components viz. (a) citizen’s engagement (financial transparency and accountability; social accountability;
  grievance redress mechanism; and risk and safeguard management capacity); (b) public financial management
  and procurement; and (c) managing for results.
• The program rests on eight core principles (effectiveness, sustainability, additionality, fairness, equity,
  transparency, fiduciary probity, and predictability) of which additionality test is now dropped.
• MoFED/BoFED/WoFED, the line ministries engaged in basic service delivery, and other federal agencies
  implement the program, while implementation of social accountability activities (ESAP-2) is organized and
  managed by a separate agency. The PBS Secretariat, now reconstituted as Service Delivery Secretary, is
  responsible for organising JRIS/JBAR, and donors’ harmonization.
• The results framework has been revised thrice since inception. The recent restructuring has added a new
  intermediary results area viz. improved environmental and social management capacity. JRIS/ JBAR remains
  the main forum for reviewing progress and challenges of the program.
Realignment of PBS-3: Bank has realigned its support to basic services with a new program ESPES (Sept. 2015
– 5 Jan 2019), which replaces Sub-Program A. The development objective of ESPES is to improve equitable
access to basic services and strengthen accountability systems at the decentralised level. The program is built on
a new financing instrument PforR. The PBS-3 program will continue with Sub-Program B until it closes in
January 2019.
ESAP-2 is going to enter into its third phase, for which a road map has been identified. There is also an
indication that a separate PFM program is being developed as a follow up of recently closed PSCAP.

Chapter 3: Approach and Methodology

This chapter outlines the approach and methodology followed in the process evaluation of PBS-3. As
suggested in the ToR, the process evaluation has been carried out applying OECD-DAC criteria.

3.1         Evaluation Framework
34. The process evaluation of PBS-3 has been carried out applying five criteria, namely relevance,
effectiveness, efficiency, impact, sustainability, and coherence. The first five criteria represent aid
effectiveness criteria recommended by the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Given the nature of evaluation,
lesser emphasis is given on impact assessment. Furthermore, assessment against the OECD-DAC
criteria has been carried out using a set of evaluation questions (EQs), developed in line with the
questions given in the ToR (Table 3.1).
                            Table 3.1: Evaluation framework and key questions
                                          Key evaluation questions &                            Data collection

3.2         Methodology
3.2.1       Desk research
35. As per ToR, the present evaluation is expected to rely heavily on the secondary research.
Accordingly, a large number of documents (reports, studies, aide memoire, etc.) were collected from
the PBS secretariat, development partners, (World Bank, DfID, AfDB), MoFED, and other line
ministries. The documents were thoroughly reviewed and analyzed. In addition, a number of other
reports and studies have been referred for the present study. Bibliography at the end of this report
contains select readings reviewed for present evaluation.
3.2.2      Federal level interviews
The key informant interviews (KIIs) at federal level were conducted with the concerned staff of the
Bank, PBS secretariat, DfID, European Union (EU), Austrian Development Corporation (ADC), and
Italy Development Cooperation (IDC). The African Development Bank (AfDB) responded to specific
questions through mail. A separate discussion was held with the project Task Team Lead of the Bank.
The evaluation team also consulted top officials and staff of MoFED. Meetings were also held with
senior officials of EMIS & ICT Directorate in the Ministry of Education (MoE), Ministry of Health
(MoH), Ministry of Water, Irrigation and Electricity (MoWIE), and Central Statistical Agency. The
KIIs were conducted with a semi-structured questionnaire. The list of people met and interviewed at
federal level is given in Annex-2.
3.2.3      Field mission in select regions and woredas
36. Sample regions and woredas: A small-scale field mission was undertaken to get a feel about the
basic services at woreda level. Given that the assignment provided for a small team of experts and
limited time to complete the evaluation, it was decided to visit four regions; eight woreda, two
woredas from each region; and eight kebeles, one in each woreda. The evaluation team intended to
visit both developed and emerging regions, and accordingly selected Oromiya, SNNPR, Benishangul
Gumuz, and Somali. The selection of regions, woredas, and kebeles was guided by the prior
experience of the mission team members, and the convenience of logistics and travel time (Table 3.2).

37. Data collection at regional/woreda/kebele levels: The first field visit was organized in Sabeta
Hawas Woreda in Oromia region on 11 June 2015 for a deeper understanding of the woreda level
delivery of basic services, as well as for pre-testing of the survey instruments. The actual fieldwork
started on 29 June 2015 going up to 16 July 2015. The evaluation experts were grouped into two
mission teams, and each team covered two regions. In course of data check and validation, some data
gaps were noticed for two regions, namely Oromiya and Benishangul Gumuz. The team members
therefore re-visited those two regions during 25 September to 1 October 2015.
38. In each selected region, group interviews were conducted with the concerned staff of BoFED and
heads, or representatives, of the five sector bureaus using a structured questionnaire. Part-1 of the
questionnaire was structured to collect mainly financial and physical data, while Part-2 of the same
questionnaire included only qualitative questions20. The Part-1 was sent to BoFED head prior to actual
visit to the region so as to save on data collection time. In a similar fashion, the mission teams
conducted interviews, using a two-part questionnaire, with the staff of woreda administration,
WoFED, and sector bureaus. The Part-1 of the questionnaire to collect financial and physical data was
administered at the time of field visit.

39. The community feedback on service delivery was gathered at kebele level through focus group
discussions (FGDs). The FGD checklist contained discussion questions regarding basic service
delivery. It also included questions related to social accountability activities. In all, 188 community
members participated in FGDs across eight selected kebeles.
3.2.4     Data analysis
40. The field data were analyzed using standard analytical tools and graphic presentations. Besides,
the present study has undertaken extensive analysis of secondary data, including counterfactual
analysis to track progress towards MDGs.

3.3       Limitations of the Study
41. The present study suffers from a few limitations:
      •   The timeline for process evaluation of a complex program like PBS has been quite short,
          which restricted the scope for more detailed analysis.
      •   It is expected that all relevant documents and data should be available on website of the PBS
          secretariat. However, the secretariat has not developed its own website. As a result, a great
          deal of time was spent only in collecting documents and data. Some of the reports mentioned
          in the aide memoire could not be collected. This has limited the scope of in-depth analysis in
          some areas.
      •   A process evaluation requires a good sense of actual implementation of the activities at the
          grass root level. But, adequate time and resources are not allocated for that purpose. The
          present study has undertaken only a limited field mission; the findings can at best be treated
          as indicative and not definitive.
42. Notwithstanding the above limitations, it is expected that the findings and recommendations of
the present study would be useful to the government, DPs, and other stakeholders. 	

3.4       Summary

                                          Approach & Methodology

The present evaluation has applied six criteria (relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, impact, sustainability, and
coherence) and a set of evaluation questions. Given the nature of evaluation, lesser emphasis is given on impact
assessment.
The evaluation has relied on desk research, key informant interviews at federal level, and field mission in four
regions (Oromiya, SNNPR, Benishangul-Gumuz, and Somali), and eight woredas. The data were collected at
federal/regional/woreda level using semi-structured and structured questionnaires. The structured questionnaires
were designed judicially blending quantitative and qualitative questions. The FGDs were conducted using a
checklist in eight kebels and188 community members participated.
The first field mission took place from 29 June to 16 July 2015. Recognizing some data gap, field mission was
repeated in Oromiya and Benishangul Gumuz during 25 September to 1 October 2015.
The present study suffers from a few limitations, such as time constraint, non-availability of all the documents,
and limited fieldwork with a small sample size.

Chapter 4: Relevance and Coherence of the PBS-3 Program

In this chapter, the relevance and coherence of the PBS-3 program has been evaluated following the
relevant evaluation questions mentioned in the previous chapter. The evaluation is based on extensive
review of available documents and key informant interviews.

4.1     Country Context at Appraisal
4.1.1   Political development
43. The political context of the PBS-3 program at appraisal was marked by (i) long-term stability of
the government albeit with some concerns; (ii) smooth constitutional transition of power following
the death of the former Prime Minister; and (iii) an allegation of PBS program’s linkage to human
rights abuse in Gambella region leading to heightened international scrutiny.
44. Political stability: The Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), the
present ruling party, came to power in 1991 after almost two decades of armed struggle, overthrowing
the previous military Dergue regime. In the first multi-party parliamentary election held in 2005, the
opposition groups lost heavily to EPRDF. Since then the country has witnessed political stability, with
EPRDF winning successive elections, including the recent one held in May 2015.
45. However, the development partners and other stakeholders, including the opposition and the
media, have been concerned about the limited space for citizens’ formal political engagement in the
country21. The PBS donors have also been concerned with the government’s law that civil society
organisation (CSO) cannot spend more than 30 per cent on administrative costs. It is understood that
such restrictions on administrative costs, which supports activities such as transport, training, M&E
and supervision, might limit CSO operations22. However, PBS-3 has not been affected by any of these
concerns since DPs have been regularly in dialogue with the government to discuss and sort out any
issues related to program implementation. Regarding CSO law, the government assured through a
letter in February 2009 that the law would not impede implementation of social accountability
activities of the PBS program23. Till date, GoE has honoured this commitment, and the social
accountability activities have progressed well.
46. Constitution transition of power: In 2012, H.E. Haile-Mariam Desalegn was appointed as
Prime Minister of the country, following the death of the former Prime Minister, Meles Zenawi. This
was the first peaceful and constitutional transition of power in the political history of Ethiopia. For the
development partners, this was a new milestone of political stability.
47. Heightened international scrutiny: The PBS program came under the scanner of international
scrutiny right at the inception stage of PBS-3. The events leading to this situation are as follows24.
48. On 24 September 2012, the World Bank’s Inspection Panel received a request for inspection
related to PBS-II (Additional financing) and PBS-III, wherein the requesters alleged that the Bank
supported PBS program harmed the Anuak people in Gambella region. The harms described in the
request covered four aspects: (i) the government’s takeover of people's customary land under
community development plan (CDP), also known as villigisation program, without their free and
informed consent; (ii) use of force and intimidation to get people to move; (iii) lack of public services
and assistance at relocation site; and (iv) deterioration of livelihood due to less fertile land and lack of
other income generating opportunities at relocation site. The Panel’s independent investigation report
(21 November 2014) concluded that the PBS program did not cause alleged harms. However, the
Panel observed that the PBS-3 appraisal and supervision did not pay adequate attention to mitigate the

potential risks arising from geographical and sector overlap of PBS and CDP. The Bank responded to
the concerns raised by the Panel with a comprehensive action plan. This is discussed later in this
report (see Sec. 7.3, Chap. 7).
4.1.2   Economic development
49. The economic and fiscal developments around the start of PBS-3 were impressive. The GDP
growth averaged 11.1 per cent between 2004-05 and 2010-11, and then moderated through the years
to reach 10.3 per cent in 2013-14. The tax revenue increased from ETB 14.2 billion in 2005-06 to
ETB 133.1 billon in 2013-14 representing an average growth rate of 32.3 per cent. Correspondingly,
tax-to-GDP ratio went up from 10.8 per cent to 12.7 per cent. The headline inflation dropped by four
per cent points, from 12.3 per cent in 2005-06 to 8.1 per cent in 2013-14, and thereby supported
achieving certain level of macroeconomic stability25. Fiscal deficit (excluding grants) declined from
7.4 per cent in 2005-06 to 3.8 per cent in 2013-14 on the back of strong economic growth and
phenomenal increase in tax revenue. Despite greater financing requirements of GTP and consequent
dependence on external financing, debt-to-GDP ratio of the country stood at 27.9 per cent in 2013-14,
indicating a low risk of external debt stress.
4.1.3   Progress towards MDGs
50. At the time of PBS-3 appraisal, Ethiopia had made impressive progress towards MDGs. The
country witnessed (a) decline in poverty headcounts from 44.2 per cent in 1999-00 to 27.8 per cent in
2011-12; (b) reduction in underweight children under 5 years of age reduced from 47.2 per cent in
2000 to 28.7 per cent in 2011-12; and (c) achievement of MDG target of reducing under five mortality
rate (U5MR) two years ahead of the timeline26. Furthermore, the country was on track for achieving
MDGs related to universal primary education, gender parity in education, HIV/AIDS, and malaria.
4.1.4   Recurrent challenges of basic service delivery
51. Notwithstanding the impressive scaling up and improvements in basic service delivery, PBS-3 at
appraisal confronted several recurrent challenges and constraints, including the following (i) shortage
of skilled or trained human resource; (ii) high staff turnover; (iii) budget constraint for operating
expenditure and capital investment. These problems and still impeding PBS-3 implementation. The
other perennial issues were lack of service quality, and persistent inequities in service delivery across
the regions and income/wealth quintiles (see Annex 4 for evidence of inequities in education and
health sectors).

4.2     Program Relevance
4.2.1   Validity of program development objective
52. Since inception, the PBS program has remained a relevant program in the strategic context of the
country. The reasons are not far to seek. First, PBS has remained embedded in the GoE’s policy of
providing block grants to support decentralised delivery of basic services at region/woreda levels.
Second, the PBS program has been well aligned with the GTP and its MDG targets. The development
objective of the PBS-3 program embraces four out of seven pillars of GTP27. Third, despite significant
expansion and improvements in basic services, the woredas have been grappling with problems such
as resource constraints, staff shortage and turnover, capacity constraints, and weak transparency and


25
   Inflation spiked to as high as 36.4 per cent in 2008-09 and 34.1 per cent in 2011-12.
26
   See MoFED (2012): Assessing progress towards the Millennium Development Goals. Also see Chap. 8
27
   The program development objective of the PBS program is well aligned with the fifth and sixth pillars of the
GTP viz. (a) enhancing expansion and quality of social development (fifth pillar), which inter alia aims at
improving education, primary health care, and safe water and sanitation; and (b) strengthening good governance
and capacity building (sixth pillar). The program’s support to agriculture and road sectors are linked with the
second and fourth pillar of GTP, namely maintaining agriculture as major source of economic growth, and
enhancing expansion and ensuring quality of infrastructure development. Thus, the development objectives of
the PBS program embrace four out of seven pillars of GTP.

accountability systems. The PBS program has been supporting GoE in addressing some of these
challenges by supporting woreda-focussed capacity building and systems strengthening.
53. All the aforesaid points remained valid at appraisal of PBS-3, reassuring the relevance of the
program objectives in the country context. However, the present evaluation finds that the PBS-3 has
not addressed adequately the issue of equitable services although the evidence of inequities in sectors
like basic service sectors was quite apparent at the appraisal stage. Though the results framework of
PBS-3 demands region-wise disaggregated data for high-level and PDO level indicators, it has not
included any specific indicators to assess progress towards bridging regional disparities and income
inequities in accessing basic services. The Bank’s new program ESPES now fills this gap and aims at
providing benefits of basic services to the entire population, particularly the bottom 20 per cent of
income groups, and most poorly performing woredas.
4.2.2      Relevance of PBS-3 activities and outputs in achieving PDO
54. Theory of change for improving basic services: It is imperative to develop a theory of change
to assess the relevance of activities and outputs in achieving the stated objectives of a program.
Following this imperative, a plausible theory of change has been developed to explain how programs
and interventions are expected to protect or promote basic services (Figure 4.1). The framework
clearly brings out that the PBS program, with its financial contribution to block grants and initiatives
to strengthen local governance, is not the only way to protect/promote basic services in the country.
The basic service sectors are supported by a number of other programs.
55. For instance, the MDG fund provided by the federal government supports capital investments in
basic service sectors. The universal rural road access program (URRAP) is a major source of
financing for construction of rural roads. The agricultural growth project (AGP) supports small-scale
investments in rural infrastructure to improve productivity.
56. Similarly, in the health sector, the MDG Performance Fund is a significant source of finance for
procurement of medicines. The general education quality improvement project, second phase
(GEQIP-II) provide funding support for curricular reform; teacher development program; school
improvement plan; management and capacity building including EMIS; improving quality of learning
and teaching through ICT; and program coordination, M&E, and communication28.
57. Referring to the theory of change explained above, it is reasonable to say that PBS-3 activities
and outputs are definitely relevant for program development objective. However, it should be borne in
mind that the sector specific programs also complement the PBS program. Without the support of
those programs, it would not be possible to scale up basic services in all the woredas. However, for
achieving desired outcomes and impact, it is imperative to integrate the PBS program with the sector
specific programs, otherwise there will be duplication of interventions leading to sub-optimal use of
resources. The program integration therefore should be one of the key considerations for on-going
efforts towards donors’ harmonization.
4.2.3      Relevance of focusing on five sectors
58. Since block grants are allowed to finance only the recurrent expenditure (salaries and operating
expenditure) of the woreda-level basic services, it will benefit those sectors that require larger fund
for recurrent expenditure such as education, health, and agriculture extension services. The sectors
like water and rural roads require more capital investments, which are not funded by block grants.
Besides, the woredas allocate a miniscule share of block grants to these two sectors viz. 1.4 per cent
for road and 2.5 per cent for water sector. Thus, PBS support to block grants has hardly benefited
water and road sectors. This evaluation therefore feels that instead of thinly spreading resources, PBS-
3 could have covered only education, health, and agriculture sectors.
4.2.4      Discontinuation with LIG and health components
59. LIG was designed to give pilot woredas an opportunity to use discretionary fund for capital
investment, and to enable them learn capital budgeting, procurement, safeguards, and contracts

management29. An independent evaluation of LIG highlighted that despite capacity constraints, the
woredas implemented a large number of projects with LIG support, and in the process, demonstrated
willingness to learn and adopt national standards/systems30.

60. LIG was a successful pilot project, but its scaling up to national level through PBS program was
simply not a feasible and desirable option. LIG was therefore rightly dropped from the PBS program,
and a new MDG Fund was launched in 2011-12 to support essential local level infrastructure
investments in the basic services. However, most of the woredas do not have capacity to handle large
procurement and contracts management. The MDG funds are therefore managed at the regional level.
There is an urgent need to build capacity of the woredas to undertake construction works, which
possibly could have been a focus area under PFM component of PBS-3.
61. The PBS-3 program also dropped the health component, and did it rightly. The health component
was a sector-specific intervention and its inclusion was not a good fit for a program like PBS that is
not intended to have any sector specific interventions. The discontinuation of the health component
has not caused any programmatic gap since MDG Performance Fund (MDG PF) meets the funding
gaps for health commodities (including medicine) mainly to support maternal and child health care
services at primary health facilities31.
4.2.5    Relevance of core principles
62. Compared to earlier three phases, PBS-3 has included more core principles, including a new
series of reviews pertaining to effectiveness, sustainability, and equity (see Table 2.1, Chap. 2). These
core principles are of great relevance to the program, and most of them are adequately defined.
However, there are implementation challenges as highlighted below:
     •   Sustainability review: Sustainability has always been a core concern of the PBS program. But,
         it has been formalised in PBS-3 through a separate review. However, the focus of this review
         is limited to the funding sources for decentralised services, and estimation of unit cost of
         basic services. Ideally, such review should have considered institutional sustainability.
     •   Equity review: Equity assessment is a challenge because of high government sensitivity about
         the definition of equity. It is understood that equity review as described in PAD (see Table 2.1
         in Chap.2) has not progressed beyond discussion with the stakeholders during pre-JRIS field
         mission.
     •   Predictability: The predictability review involves checking whether the donors’ committed
         funds are included in the budget proclamation. It is not clear how this measures predictability.
         A logical approach would have been to compare actual release of funds with the donors’
         commitments.
4.2.6    Appropriateness of results framework
63. The results framework of the PBS-3 program covers all the basic sectors. In recent restructuring
of PBS-3 (July 2015), the framework has been expanded to include a few indicators to monitor results
related to the newly added sub-component viz. risk and safeguard management capacity. However, the
results framework can be strengthened further by addressing the following weaknesses:
     •   Inappropriate high-level health indicators: The results framework of PBS-1&2 used maternal
         and child mortality rates as high-level (impact) indicators, whereas PBS-3 has replaced those
         two indicators by two PDO level (outcome) indicators viz. ‘proportion of children
         vaccinated,’ and ‘pregnant women received ANC during first visit’. The present evaluation
         strongly feels that PBS-3 should continue with the high-level indicators like maternal and
         child mortality rates even if data are not tractable on a yearly basis.
     •   Absence of technical note to define indicator for measurement: The results framework does
         not provide any technical notes to define indicators for measurement. For instance, number of
         ‘direct beneficiaries’ is a PDO level indicator for agriculture. But, there is no technical note to
         explain who the direct beneficiaries are, and how their numbers are estimated (i.e. through
         survey or any other methods). To give another example, PBS-2 used ‘average distance to

           nearest all-weather road’ as high-level indicator. PBS-3 replaced it by ‘average time to
           nearest all-weather road’. The question arises how time is to be calculated (measurement
           definition). One may also like to know which one is a better indicator – distance or time?
       •   Use of dual data source: Both HMIS and DHS data have been used to define targets, and
           usually the numbers are hugely different. It is doubtful whether any rigorous exercise has
           been undertaken to set year-wise targets in a comparable way using HMIS and DHS data. The
           present evaluation does not see any value of using multiple data source for tracking a result
           indicator. In case the donors insist on using multiple data source, it is imperative to add a
           technical note stating the way targets are calibrated for each data source.
       •   Data inconsistencies: The present evaluation finds some data inconsistencies. For example,
           significant discrepancy has been noticed in the year-wise number of HEWs reported by the
           GTP progress report, April 2015 JRIS presentation (by Policy and Planning Directorate,
           MoH), and Aide Memoire, 27-30 April 201532. This kind of discrepancy is not unusual, but it
           is important to reconcile the figures, or at least mention in the results framework which data
           source is used and why.

4.3        Program Coherence
64. The PBS program is highly coherent with the national policy of providing block grants to support
decentralised delivery of basic services at region/woreda levels. In particular, Sub-Program A is well
aligned with the fifth pillar of GTP, namely enhancing expansion and quality of social development,
which inter alia aims at improving education, primary health care, and safe water and sanitation.
Similarly, Sub-Program B is coherent with the sixth pillar of GTP viz. strengthening good governance
and capacity building.
65. Besides, as evident from the theory of change (Figure 4.1), both the sub-programs complement
each other in improving basic service delivery. In fact, Sub-Program A cannot be implemented
effectively without Sub-Program B. For efficient and effective spending of block grants, it is
important to improve local funds management, transparency and accountability, and deep citizen
engagement in all facets of service delivery. There is also a growing realization that without
strengthening local governance institutions and systems, sustained delivery of quality basic services is
simply not feasible.
66. But, a mooted question is what should have been the scope of coverage of institutional reforms
under Sub-Program B. It seems may that Sub-Program B has embraced too many challenging areas.
The program could have focused only on a few priority areas. For instance, under PFM reform the
focus could have been on building procurement capacity, if that is being identified as the weakest
performance area at woreda level. Similarly, under ESAP the first agenda could have been to sensitize
the local administration and service providers about the citizen’s right to demand and their obligations
to provide basic services, and strengthen capacity of the existing community based organisations (e.g.
parent teachers association at school; health boards; water committees) so as to enable them to work
with local administration service providers for improving basic services. The main argument is that
one sub-program cannot simultaneously address, how well it might have been packaged, all the age-
old issues of funds management, transparency and accountability, and citizen engagement. The
present evaluation is of the opinion that Sub-Program B has been over designed.
67. The theory of change also highlights strong complementarity between PBS and the sector
programs. While PBS is supporting recurring expenditure, sector programs along with MDG funds
are taking care of infrastructure and facilities as well as supply of commodities. Harmonization of all
these programs would be key to enhance quality service delivery.

Process Evaluation of PBS-3, Final Report: Relevance and Coherence of the PBS-3 Program               17
4.4       Summary of Findings

                                Relevance and Coherence of the PBS-3 Program

      Country context at appraisal: The country scenario around appraisal of PBS-3 was marked by political
      stability; heightened international scrutiny following the alleged association of the PBS funding and
      human rights abuse in Gambella region leading to intense international scrutiny of the program;
      encouraging economic development; and impressive advances towards MDGs. Despite significant
      scaling up and improvements, basic service delivery at woreda was affected by a number of recurrent
      challenges (shortage of skills, staff turnover, budget constraint), poor service quality, and inequities in
      basic service delivery (across regions and income/wealth quintiles).
      Program relevance: The program development objective of PBS-3 was valid in the country context at
      appraisal. However, the program did not address adequately the issue of equitable services although the
      evidence of inequities in sectors like education and health was quite apparent at the appraisal stage. The
      other findings are as follows:
          •    The theory of change clearly shows that PBS-3 activities/outputs are relevant for achieving
               PDO. It also highlights complementarity between the PBS and the sector specific programs.
               Integration of PBS and sector programs should be one of the key considerations for on-going
               efforts towards donors’ harmonization.
          •    The water and road sectors require more capital investments, while the PBS program supports
               only the recurrent expenditure. Thus, PBS has hardly benefited these two capital-intensive
               sectors. Instead of thinly spreading resources, PBS-3 could have covered only education,
               health, and agriculture sectors.
          •    The core principles are of great relevance, but in practice sustainability and equity reviews
               have fallen far short of requirements. Besides, the predictability assessment does not appear to
               follow a logical approach. The assessment does not involve comparison of actual elease of
               funds with the donors’ commitments
      Appropriateness of results framework: The results framework suffers from some shortcomings such as
      inappropriate high-level health indicators; lack of technical note to define indicator for measurement;
      use of double data source without setting comparable targets; and some data inconsistencies.
      Program coherence: The Sub-Program-A and Sub-Program-B complements each other. For efficient
      and effective use of block grants, it is important to improve local funds management, transparency and
      accountability, and deep citizen engagement in all facets of service delivery. However, the Sub-
      Program A seems to be more ambitious and attempts to cover too many challenging areas. The
      program could have focused only on few priority areas. There is also strong complementarity between
      PBS and the sector programs. Harmonization of all these programs would be key to enhance quality
      service delivery.

Chapter 5: Program Effectiveness (Progress in Achieving Results)

The effectiveness of PBS-3 program has been assessed in terms of the extent to which the program
has achieved the targets set in the results framework. Annex-5 contains detailed results and charts.
The evaluation team also visited four regions (Oromiya, SNNPR, Benishangul- Gumuz, and Somali),
eight woredas, and eight kebeles. The findings of the field visits are also presented in this chapter.

5.1     Effectiveness of Basic Service Delivery
5.1.1   Progress towards achieving higher-level and PDO targets
68. The progress in the basic service sectors has been assessed using official statistics (wherever
possible), the figures quoted in the results framework in April 2015 Aide Memoire, and the results
presented in April 2015 JRIS. The assessment covers two years, 2012-13 and 2013-14. It may be
pertinent to mention here that the PBS-3 is not the only program that supports basic service sectors.
There are other sector programs and initiatives that are contributing to basic services (refer to theory
of change in Chap. 4). Besides, the PBS contributions are not expected to be uniform across all the
basic sectors. The education, health, and agriculture sectors are likely to be benefited most from the
PBS program (see Sec. 4.2.3, Chap. 4).
69. During the first two years of implementation, higher-level and PDO targets were moderately
achieved (Table 5.1). Of the seven higher-level indicators, targets were achieved only for three
indictors (43 per cent) in 2012-13, and for four indicators (57 per cent) in 2013-14. Similarly, of the
six PDO indicators, targets were achieved for three indicators (50 per cent) and four indicators (67 per
cent) in 2012-13 and 2013-14 respectively. All the higher-level and PDO targets were missed in the
water sector whereas all the targets were achieved in the road sector. Both these sectors require high
capital investments, and their performance has little or no bearing with the PBS program.

5.1.2    Sector wise progress performance
70. Education: Net enrolment ratio (NER) at Grade 5-8 dipped from 48.1 per cent in 2011-12 to
47.2 per cent in 2012-13, and then marginally increased to 49.5 per cent in 2013-14. In both the years,
NER was significantly below the targets as set in the results framework. A consistently lower NER at
Grade 5-8 is a matter of great concern since it reflects dropouts of children in transition from lower to
upper primary level33. Notwithstanding low NER, the gender parity index (GPI) at Grade 5-8 has
been hovering around one quite for some years, indicating a satisfactory progress towards girls’
enrolment in primary education in the country.
71. In recent years, pupil-teacher ratio (PTR) at Grade 5-8 has remained far below the norm of 50
students per teacher. The ratio stood at 44.2 in 2010-11, and it further declined to 36.4 in 2013-14.
Such low PTR implies underutilisation of the existing teachers. In contrast, PTR at Grade 1-4 stood at
59.4 in 2013-14, much above the norm. This means that deployment of teachers at lower primary
level has not kept pace with the steep rise in NER (107.9 per cent in 2013-14), and there is an urgent
need to deploy more teachers at lower primary level.
72. The proportion of qualified primary teachers (diploma and above) at Grade 1-8 was 64.7 per cent
and 70.2 per cent in 2012-13 and 2013-14 respectively. In both the years, availability of qualified
teachers remained significantly below the targets. However, disaggregated data shows that in 2013-14
54.7 per cent of lower primary teachers were qualified compared to 91.7 per cent qualified upper
primary teachers. This means lack of qualified teachers is a problem only at Grade 1-4, and not at
Grade 5-8. So, more attention is required for increasing qualified teachers at Grade 1-4.
73. The PBS program has not considered learning achievement as a higher-level outcome although it
is a proximate indicator to assess quality of education. Among others, quality of education depends to
a large extent on the availability of competent and motivated teachers. According to a small survey
conducted in May 2014, most of the schoolteachers lack pedagogical skills and proficiency in
teaching English34. The same survey also reveals that the teacher absenteeism is not high (12 per
cent), but proportion of teachers not taking scheduled classes is quite high (28 per cent). Thus, teacher
motivation is a challenge.
74. Health: The Penta-3 vaccine coverage increased from 84.9 per cent in 2011-12 to 87.6 per cent
in 2012-13 and then to 91.1 per cent in 2013-14. Despite this increase, the vaccine coverage remained
below the targets set for 2012-13 and 2013-14. The ANC coverage for pregnant women declined
marginally from 2.86 million in 2012-13 to 2.52 million in 2013-14, but the coverage exceeded the
targets in both the years.
75. The population per HEW was below the norm of 2,500 in 2011-12 and 2012-13. But, the
position improved in 2013-14 with population per HEW reaching the norm. According to latest
statistics, cumulative number of HEWs has reached to 42.3 thousand, covering 2,129 populations per
HEW35. However, the present evaluation is not confident about reliability of the reported number of
HEWs due to discrepancies observed across different sources of data36.


33
   There are several socio-economic reasons for high dropouts. These are discussed in Annex-6.

Process Evaluation of PBS-3, Final Report: Program Effectiveness (Progress in Achieving Results)
76. As noted in the previous chapter, the results framework of PBS-3 has not set any higher-level
indicators to track child and maternal mortality, even though health MDGs (Goals 4 & 5) include
these two indicators. While IMR has declined considerably, and U5MR target has been achieved
ahead of time, MMR stands at very high level, 676 deaths per 100,000 live births as of 2011. There is
an indication that MMR has declined to 420 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2013. Even with this
figure, the country remains off-track in achieving MDG target of 267 deaths per 100,000 live births37.
77. The presence of skilled health personnel at birth is one of the proven interventions to reduce
maternal mortality. In Ethiopia, percentage of institutional deliveries assisted by skilled professionals
has remained extremely low viz. 10.0 per cent in 2011, and 14.5 per cent in 201438. Such low level of
institutional delivery inter alia underpins the common belief among many women that institutional
delivery is ‘unnecessary’ and ‘not a customary practice’39. Among the African countries, Ethiopia,
Niger and Sudan have the least access to skilled health attendants40.
78. According to SPA+, most of the health posts (above 90 per cent) are providing ANC, family
planning, and curative services for children less than five year. However, normal delivery service is
available only in 45 per cent health posts41. Most of the health posts are also faced with short supply
of essential medicines.
79. Agriculture: The productivity of major food crops (cereals, pulses, and oil seeds) increased from
17 quintals per hectare in 2011-12 to 17.8 quintals per hectare in 2012-13, and 20.3 quintals per
hectare in 2013-14. The productivity target was missed in 2012-13 by 2.4 quintals per hectare, but
then production increased and almost touched the target in 2013-14.
80. The main focus of agriculture extension services is to promote utilization of improved agriculture
technologies and natural resource conservation and management. Between 2011-12 and 2013-14,
direct beneficiaries of agriculture extension services (smallholder farmers and pastoralists) increased
from 10.51 million to 13.09 million, achieving the national targets.
81. The number of DA with specialization in agro-ecological zones and high value crops was 2,170
and 2,811 in 2012-13 and 2013-14 respectively. In both the years, the numbers of DA were below the
targets. However, The present evaluation is not sure about the reliability of the reported number of
DAs since there is no published document.




37
   Using proxy indicators such as skilled birth attendance and contraceptive rates, WHO has estimated MMR at
420 deaths per 100,000 live births as of 2013. The EDHS estimate of MMR will be available when CSA comes
out with its publication in 2016-17.
38
   These figures are quoted from EDHS 2014. According to HMIS, percentage of deliveries assisted by skilled
health attendants are as given in the table below. However, HMIS figures are not comparable with the EDHS
estimates, which are survey data gathered through recall period up to five year prior to survey. HMIS estimates
are based on supply data for the same year.

Process Evaluation of PBS-3, Final Report: Program Effectiveness (Progress in Achieving Results)
82. It is understood that DA retention and quality of service have been a regular problem due in large
part to poor living and working conditions, and inconsistent implementation of career paths and
incentive packages42. PBS-3 needs to address these problems.
83. Water and sanitation: The rural water supply coverage increased from 55.2 per cent in 2011-12
to 66.5 per cent in 2012-13, and 75.5 per cent in 2013-14. Despite this increase, water supply
coverage fell short of targets in 2012-13 and 2013-14. An option for improving water supply coverage
is to reduce non-functional water schemes. Though non-functional water schemes declined from 24
per cent in 2011-12 to 15.5 per cent in 2013-14, the targets were not achieved.
84. In the absence of reliable time series data on use of latrines by the households, the present
evaluation has relied on Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) data. The households
using some form of improved or non-improved facility increased significantly, from 61.7 per cent in
2011 to 66.5 per cent in 2013-14. At present, only 26 per cent of kebeles have achieved the status of
open defecation free (ODF)43.
85. Rural roads: The rural road connectivity has improved significantly over the years. In 2009-10,
there was no all-weather woreda road in the regions. Since then a total of 39 thousand km of woreda
road was constructed under URRAP up to 2013-14, covering 68 per cent of the existing kebeles44.
Following the aforesaid construction, the average travel time to reach nearest all-weather road
decreased from 2.9 hour in 2011-12 to 2.1 hour in 2012-13, 1.8 hour in 2013-14. The year-wise
reductions in travel time were very close to the targets.
86. According to official statistics, 86 per cent of the roads were maintained in fair and good
conditions throughout the period from 2011-12 to 2013-14, which exceeded the targets set in the
results framework. Furthermore, since 2011-12 the road sector has established and maintained 500
woreda desk offices with appropriate staff to oversee construction and maintenance of rural roads.

5.2     Mission Findings on Basic Service Delivery
5.2.1    Key findings based on staff interviews at select regions/woredas
87. Service standards: Except two select woredas in Benishangul-Gumuz, the other six woredas
have developed service standards for education and health services. This is an encouraging trend.
However, developing service standards is a necessary but not a sufficient to improve service quality.
There must be an effective M&E system to ensure proper implementation of the service standards.
The present evaluation could not probe this aspect due to time constraint.
88. Facility survey: All the regions barring Benishangul-Gumuz have claimed that they conduct
survey of school, health, and water supply facilities. For instance, BoFED and the Bureau of
Education have conducted facility assessment of school and other educational institutions. Some of
the woredas have also conducted some sort of facility survey. All these initiatives are important for
preparing a proper inventory of infrastructure/facilities and in identifying the gaps that are impeding
service delivery. At present, this is a weak link in the basic service delivery.
89. Beneficiary survey: None of the regions and woredas visited conducts beneficiary survey to take
feedback on service delivery. Neither they are systematically gathering feedback from any other
sources. This is not a good practice. Going forward, beneficiary feedback must be an integral
component of the existing MIS of the service bureaus.

   The quoted figures are obtained from the presentation at April 2015 JRIS. To achieve the five-year
construction target of 71.5 thousand km under URRAP (see GTP Annual Progress Report 2014, Table 22),
about 33 thousand km should have been constructed during 2014-15. It is not known whether this target has
been achieved.

90. Woreda level performance in service delivery: All the regions visited have an understanding
about the performance of woredas in basic service delivery. When enquired about what proportion of
woredas are providing basic services reasonably well, the regions could provide some indications. It
appears from the regional responses that the proportion of woredas that are providing better services
is more than 75 per cent in SNNPR; 50-75 per cent both in Oromiya and Somali; and 25-50 per cent
in Benishangul-Gumuz. The regions are not only tracking service delivery at woreda level but also
taking measures to improve service delivery. Examples of such measures are as follows:
    •   Oromiya formed groups of experts to assess performance gaps in service delivery. Based on
        gap analysis, the region provided trainings to staff and the beneficiaries. Besides, the region
        utilised MDG, ULGDP, and others funds to improve infrastructure and facilities.
    •   Somali region conducted regular assessment of service delivery using agreed performance
        criteria. Based on the assessment results, on-the-job trainings were organised to develop
        capacity of the staff.
    •   SNNPR identified lagging woredas (e.g. Segen zone and South Omo woredas) for providing
        special support such as support for conducting monitoring and evaluation; provision for
        computers, vehicles, etc.; provision for support staff; on-the-job training for staff at zone
        level; and organising training on regular basis related to gap areas.
91. As evident from above, the regions have willingness to, as well as some experience of assessing
service delivery at woreda level. It may be pertinent now to introduce an appropriate ‘results based,
and incentivised’ system to evaluate and monitor service delivery at woreda level as per standards.
92. Performance of the service providers: Of the eight woredas visited, seven woredas (87.5 per
cent) grade performance of the primary/secondary schools using some rating criteria, while a
relatively lesser number of woredas (50 per cent) evaluate and grade performance of the health
facilities (Table 5.2). However, none of the agriculture bureaus track delivery of extension services at
kebele level. Similarly, none of the rural road bureaus (or rural desks) assess rural road services.

Process Evaluation of PBS-3, Final Report: Program Effectiveness (Progress in Achieving Results)
93. The responses of the sample woredas further reveal that in two woredas viz. Chelia and Shinile,
only a smaller proportion of primary schools (less than 25 per cent) are doing well (Table 5.2). For
improving service delivery, Chelia has taken several measures such as training of school principals
and staff; experience sharing with the model school on a monthly basis; regular follow up meetings;
and ranking of schools. Shinile has also prepared an improvement plan but it is facing budget
constraint to implement the plan. Turning to health service providers (health posts, health centres), the
performance is somewhat better. According to health bureaus in Jima Argo, Dilla Zuria, and
Shebedino, more than 75 per cent of their health posts are doing well. Similarly, more than 75 per
cent of the health centres in Dilla Zuria and Shebedino are performing well.
94. That the sector bureaus in some of the woredas are tracking and grading the service providers is
an encouraging progress towards improving service delivery. This practice needs to be strengthened
and scaled up to all woredas. The regions are urgently required to introduce a standardised evaluation
and grading system for each of the five basic services, including beneficiary feedback.
95. The challenges and constraints of service delivery: The regions/woredas are faced with some
key challenges and constraints as summarised below:
    •    High staff turnover: Almost all the regions/woredas are facing the problem of staff turnover.
         Poor salary, limited growth opportunity, poor work environment, and heavy workload are the
         main reasons for staff turnover. According to one woreda head, “only the older people want
         to stay and work at woreda. The younger graduates want to try their luck in bigger cities like
         Addis Ababa”.
    •    Shortage of skilled/trained human resource: Most of the woredas are constrained by shortage
         of skilled human resource for service delivery. Several factors are responsible for staff
         shortage, such as high staff turnover; inadequate staff training; recruitment of staff without
         matching job profile; etc.
    •    Budget constraint: The woredas are faced with shortage of funds for office operations; repairs
         and maintenance works; capital investment; staff recruitment and training; public awareness
         campaigns; support supervision; M&E/data collection; etc.
    •    Logistic problem: Most of the service bureaus at woreda level do not have vehicles to reach
         out to the service points, especially in remote areas. For instance, in Chelia woreda (Oromiya)
         engineers are forced to walk long hours and many left the job mainly due to this factor.
    •    Sector specific problems: There is wide range of sector specific problems apart from those
         mentioned above. Some examples are as given under:
             -    Lack of local suppliers of textbooks and lab equipment (Dilla Zuria)
             -    Inadequate health posts; shortage of equipment, transport, ambulance (Shinile)
             -    Shortage of medicines (Dilla Zuria)
             -    Non-motorable road to reach remote areas to provide agriculture extension activities,
                  and to support community during animal and crop disease outbreak (Chelia)
             -    Shortage of agriculture inputs (Bambasi)
             -    Unwillingness of farmers to use fertilizers due to lack of awareness (Chelia)
             -    Lack of capacity of the local contractors to complete shallow water well in time (Jima
                  Arjo)
             -    Delay in road construction due to limited technical and financial capacity of the local
                  contractors (Shebedino, Dilla Zuria)
96. It is quite obvious from above that some of the problems/constraints of the regions/woredas are
generic in nature and have been continuing for long viz. ‘shortage of skilled/trained manpower’, ‘high
staff turnover’, and ‘budget constraints for operating expenditure and capital investment’ especially at
woreda level. The programs like PSCAP, PBS, and ULGDP have partially addressed these problems

                                                                                                      24
Process Evaluation of PBS-3, Final Report: Program Effectiveness (Progress in Achieving Results)
through capacity building and budget support. But these programs have not been able to address the
issue of high staff turnover. Regarding the sector specific problems/constraints, the regional and local
governments need to develop joint action plan to deal with them.
5.2.2      Quality of service delivery (FGD findings)
97. During field mission, FGDs were conducted with the community members in eight kebeles.
Altogether 188 community members participated in the FGDs. The FGD participants were asked to
respond, among others, to the following questions related to quality of service delivery viz. (i) whether
they see any improvement in quality of basic services compared to previous two to three years, and
(ii) what are the reasons for saying service quality has ‘improved’ or ‘not improved’. The findings are
summarised in the following paragraphs45.
98. Primary education (n=170): A majority of the community participants (84.1 per cent) feel that
quality of education has improved marginally, and smaller number of them (9.4 per cent) considers
that primary education has improved significantly. The perception of improved service underscores
several factors such as easy access to schools; improved infrastructure; availability of sufficient
numbers of qualified teachers; education in mother tongue; and no discrimination in enrolment of
students. However, some participants (6.5 per cent) in Libon Gamo Kebele (Cheliya woreda,
Oromiya) do not see any improvement in quality of primary education in recent years.
99. Health (n=166): Like in the case of education, many community members (75.9 per cent) say
that the quality of health services has improved marginally, while about a fourth of them (24.1 per
cent) rate improvement in services to be significant. The reasons cited for their perception are as
follows: improved access to health facilities; availability of adequate number of health extension
workers; availability of ambulance services; reduced waiting time at the health facilities; and
increased availability of family planning and contraceptive services.
100. Agriculture extension services (n=165): Most of the community members (78.8 per cent) feel
that quality of agriculture extension services has improved marginally. A smaller proportion of the
participants (10.9 per cent) consider that services have improved significantly. The community
perception of improved services stem from a number of factors such as increased supply of improved
seeds and fertilizers; support provided by development agents; and specialized training and advises.
However, all the community members (10.3 per cent) in Chechu kebele (Dilla Zuria woreda, SNNPR)
do not see any improvement in the quality of extension services.
101. Water supply (n=161): Regarding quality of water supply, the opinions of the community
members are divided. Some of the community members (47.8 per cent) feel that quality of water
supply has marginally improved, while some (10.6 per cent) rate the improvement significant. But,
the community members (41.6 per cent) in Harores kebele (Jigjiga woreda, Somali), Tome kebele
(Shinile woreda, Somali), and Chechu (Dilla Zuria woreda, ANNPR) do not see any improvement in
the situation characterised by unclean water; non-functional water schemes; and difficulty in
accessing drinking water sources.
102. Sanitation (n=167): Over half of the community members (52.1 per cent) find significant
improvement in use of latrines, while some others (39.5 per cent) see only marginal improvement.
There are number of reasons for improved use of latrines such as increased level of awareness;
training on hygiene and sanitation; shame attached with open defecation; and improved availability of
water. However, a small number of community participants (8.4 per cent) feel that access and use of
latrine has not improved in recent years.
103. Rural road (n=165): A good number of community members (50.9 per cent) feel that quality of
rural roads has improved marginally, while some of them (10.9 per cent) see significant improvement.
The perception of improved rural road underscore good road conditions; connectivity with the main
road, connectivity with the woreda town and local market; etc. However, the community participants

45
     The number of valid responses (n) is shown in parenthesis.
                                                                                                      25
Process Evaluation of PBS-3, Final Report: Program Effectiveness (Progress in Achieving Results)
(17.6 per cent) in Seiga-22 kebele (Asosa woreda, Benishangul-Gumuz) state that quality of rural
roads has worsened, while the participants (20.6 per cent) in two kebeles viz. Dabus kebele (Bambasi
woreda, Benishangul-Gumuz) and Chechu kebele (Dilla Zuria woreda, SNNPR) do not see any
improvement.
104. On the whole, the FGD findings suggest that most of the community members at kebele level
feel that basic services have improved marginally compared to three years before. The community
perceive that education, health, agriculture, and sanitation services have been better than water and
rural road services.

5.3       Progress in Strengthening Local Accountability and Transparency
5.4.1     Citizen’s engagement
105. Financial transparency and accountability: The FTA initiatives are well integrated with the
government’s public financial management system, and impressive progress has been made. About 97
per cent of the woredas now post budget and expenditure using revised template, and in the process
informing 29 per cent citizens. Among the service delivery units, 67 per cent disclose information
using standardised service delivery templates. Multi-media are used to disseminate FTA information,
such as notice/bill board, TV, radio, pamphlets, training, and pocket calendar. Initiatives are also
underway to introduce procurement templates.
106. Alongside shifting to revised FTA templates, many regions have introduced result focussed FTA
reporting format to collect information from woredas. Of the four regions visited by the evaluation
teams, SNNPR and Somali regions are receiving woreda reports in the result focussed FTA format.
The other two regions, Oromiya and Benishangul-Gumuz, are not using the new reporting formant46.
107. A FTA assessment was conducted in 2013, which inter alia reveals that 42.5 per cent of the
households have seen the FTA templates posted in their jurisdictions47. The percentage varies across
the regions. In Benishangul-Gumuz, 86 per cent of the households have seen posted templates,
whereas proportion of such households is only 3 per cent in Somali. The study also shows that of the
households who have seen budget information through posted template, 37 per cent have discussed it
with their respective woreda/City officials, while 26 per cent have discussed among themselves.
108. In course of field mission, the present study has also come across some anecdotal evidence that
suggest that citizens indeed act on FTA dissemination of budget and expenditure information. A few
cases are as follows:
      •   Wocjema primary school (Dilla Zuria woreda, SNNPR) posted its annual plan and budget,
          but funds utilisation and progress was not satisfactory. The parent teacher association lodged
          a complaint with the woreda education office, which in turn engaged an auditor to check the
          accounts of the school. The auditor found misappropriation of funds by the school principal,
          and he was removed from the post of principal and retained just as a teacher. In addition, the
          misappropriated amount was recovered from his monthly salary.
      •   In Harawe kebele (Shinile woreda, Somali), the farmers training centre (FTC) was not
          functional since it was not located near village. The centre was not equipped with materials
          and lacked water facility. After the community came to know about agriculture budget, they
          took initiative to make FTC functional.
      •   Being aware of the budget disclosed through FTA board, the community in Shenile kebele
          (Shinile woreda, Somali) asked for reasons why the kebele did not have electricity, especially
          for irrigation works, despite budget allocation.

46
   It was reported at April 2015 JRIS that Addis Ababa, Dire Dawa, Harari, Somali, Afar, Gambella and SNNPR
regions received reports from the woredas as per the result focussed FTA format.

     •   The budget for rural road and bridge construction was posted to inform the community in
         Dila Aferara kebele (Shebedino woreda, SNNPR). As per construction budget, the contractor
         was supposed to use new wood. But the community noticed that the contractor was using old
         wood, and they lodged a complaint with the road office. The contractor was asked to use new
         wood as per budget provision.
109. One of the avowed objectives of FTA is to increase citizen’s understanding of the budget and
expenditure posted through different media. All regions have been conducting Budget Literacy
Training (BLT) for citizen, sector officials, council members, and the PFM team members. So far 420
thousand citizens have attended BLT48. However, female participation in BLT continues to be a
challenge and needs special attention49. Apart from low female participation, there are other on-going
challenges affecting FTA viz. frequent turnover of trained PFM members, and lack of commitment of
some PFM team members50.
110. Social accountability: Under ESAP-2, the social accountability activities are implemented by 48
SAIPs in 223 woredas as against target of 150 woredas51. As per latest information, 39,872 citizens
and 16,154 local officials and service providers have received training on how to use social
accountability tools (community scorecard, citizen’s report card, participatory planning and
budgeting, gender responsive budgeting, public expenditure tracking survey, etc.)52. There are 272
SAP wordas that have developed joint action plans for service quality improvement based on interface
meetings between service users and providers53.
111. The results framework of PBS-3 has set a PDO target that the woreda officials would seek views
of 50 per cent people in their kebeles on improving quality of basic services. This target has not been
achieved during 2012-13 and 2013-14. According to ESAP-2 baseline survey (29 May to 6 June
2013), those who have been consulted on improving basic services in their kebeles range from 22.3
per cent for rural roads to 33.1 per cent for health services. The present evaluation also enquired in all
the eight woredas visited about the progress made in consulting the community members at kebele
level for improving basic services. None of the woredas could furnish any information in this regard.
112. It is claimed that ESAP-2 along with other interventions has facilitated service improvements in
all the five basic service sectors. The improvements, among others, include addition of school
classrooms; recruitment of additional teachers, qualified health personnel, DAs; construction of roads;
and new water points (Table 5.3).
113. There are potential benefits of FTA-SA linkages, and these are now well understood by the
government officials, service providers, SAIPs, and PFM teams54. In recent period, initiatives towards
FTA-SA linkage have progressed a lot. MoFED has prepared and disseminated FTA-SA linkage
guideline, action plan, and standard format of memorandum of understanding (MoU) to all BoFEDs.
BoFEDs have already signed MoUs with SAIPs In Afar, Tigray, Harari, Somali, and Addis Ababa,
and there is at least one member in the Social Accountability Committee (SAC) from PFM team55.
The FTA team is also participating along with SAC in the interface meeting between community
members and the service providers.

   The low female participation is on account of cultural factors and household workload, which prevent them to
leave home and attend BLT at woreda towns. There is a need to focus on increasing female participation, and
one option could be to organise BLT at cluster of kebeles rather than at woreda towns. Refer to presentation (the
case of FTA and GRM) at April 2015. JRIS.

114. Grievance redress mechanism: The institutional structure of GRM in Ethiopia has evolved over
years, and it consists of Ethiopian Institution of the Ombudsman and GRM offices at regions, zones,
and woredas. As a Constitutional requirement, EIO was set up in 2000 through a Proclamation (No.
211/2000) with the objective of preventing and rectifying maladministration and promoting good
governance56. At present, it has branch office in Tigray, Amhara, Oromia, SNNPR, Dire Dawa, and
Gambella and there is a plan to open branch office in all the remaining regions. Legally EIO is
independent and accountable only to the House of Peoples’ Representatives. But some concerns about
its independence still persist because of dominance of the executive organs. Besides, the proclamation
does not clarify how the institution can enforce its decisions. EIO is also facing the challenge of
budget constraint and lack of capacity.
115. The GRM offices are present in all regions except in Afar. The kebele manager serves as a focal
point for the GRM office at the kebele level. Although many of the regional GRMs have yet to clarify
and define their GRM processes and procedures, there is more or less similar GRM legal framework
in four regions and two city administrations. The remaining regions are yet to make progress in
developing their respective legal framework and are mainly basing their GRM processes on the
business process reengineering. The regional government funds GRM offices, and in turn they are
required to report to the government. A recent study has brought out several challenges of the GRM
system at regional/zone/woreda levels, such as lack of independence, and weak enforcement of
decisions57. The same study also points out that the citizens are generally not satisfied with redress of
complaints by the GRM offices. This is a matter of concern and deserves immediate attention.
116. PBS-3 has supported EIO by providing financial and technical support. The program also
supported capacity building of the existing GRM offices in the region by developing a common
standard of grievance redress procedures and handling, and by imparting training to the grievance
handling officers. The PBS-3 targets of setting fully functional GRM offices in five regions in 2012-

13 and in six regions in 2013-14 have been fully achieved. Regarding preparation and adoption of
standardised manual and guidelines for GRMs, target was not achieved in 2012-13. Five regions
against a target of six regions prepared and adopted standardised manual and guidelines in 2012-13.
But in 2013-14, the number of such regions increased to eight and the target was achieved.
5.4.2    Public financial management and procurement
117. The PFM system at the woreda level has matured over the years. One notable achievement is the
roll out of IBEX in 800 woredas. Besides, a new financial management system called Integrated
Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) has been under implementation in ten pilot
budget units, including MoFED58. These units are expected to go live shortly with the new IFMIS.
118. In 2013-14, audit coverage by ORAG was 40 per cent and met the target. But, the coverage was
less compared to 45 per cent coverage (against a target of 35 per cent) achieved in the previous year.
Furthermore, only 5.1 per cent of the woredas acted on the prior period audit findings during 2013-14
as against the target of 25 per cent. The performance was better in the previous year, with 15 per cent
woredas (against a target of 20 per cent) following up the audit findings.
119. The non-compliance with the audit findings by a large number of woredas is a serious concern,
especially in view of the chronic weaknesses in woredas’ public financial management such as weak
property management; long outstanding advances and payables; missing documents; delay in bank
reconciliations; misclassification of expenditure; weak cash management; and weak internal control
of payments59. The non-compliance with the audit findings is also a big set back, given the initiatives
taken to ensure audit follow up such as appointment of audit committees in 400 woredas;
establishment of an internal audit task team by MoFED to support the audit committees; various
supervision missions undertaken by MoFED/BoFED; and repeated raising of this issue in the PFM
technical working group (TWG) and DP-GoE meetings60.
120. Regarding external audit, the coverage at the federal level by OFAG has increased from 90 per
cent in 2010-11 to 100 per cent in 2013-14. This is a remarkable achievement. The 2014 PEFA report
further reveals improvement in timely response to audit observations by auditees.
121. Procurement is a significant challenge at woreda level. On average, a woreda procurement unit
provides procurement service to 23 sector offices following a centralised procurement system (pool
system)61. This system suffers from many shortcomings, including delay in procurement62. The
woredas are also constrained by lack of technical skills to deal with works procurement and contracts
management. The lack of technical skills may reflect shortage of full-time staff and/or lack of trained
and experienced staff. There are also gaps in procurement planning, preparation of bid documents, bid
evaluation, and contracts management63. It is imperative to equip woredas with professional/trained
procurement staff and address the systemic bottlenecks in the procurement system.
122. For transparency and accountability to public, the woredas are required to post procurement
award decisions. In this regard, progress has not been satisfactory. In 2013-14, 254 woredas posted
procurement information as against the target of 400 woredas. It is understood that the procurement
templates have been prepared and would be disseminated to the woredas for posting procurement
information. The availability of template is expected to encourage posting procurement information.

5.4.3    Managing for results
123. In terms of monitoring PBS results, MforR has performed reasonably well. The results matrix is
updated and progress against higher-level and PDO indicators with regional disaggregated data
(wherever available) are shared in every JRIS. Of course, the JRIS discussions on results tend to focus
more on quantitative achievements and less on qualitative issues64. For instance, discussion on gender
disparity in April 2015 JRIS mostly centred around on newly available data. There was hardly any
deliberation on the factors underlying the gender inequities, and how to address those factors.
124. A core objective of MforR is to strengthen multi-sector MIS with data quality assurance. In this
regard, the progress has not been uniform across the sectors. EMIS has been rolled out in 817 woredas
as against the target of 600 woredas. In the health sector, the target for HMIS implementation in 90
woredas has been over achieved. However, there have been significant delays in MIS implementation
in WASH, rural road, and agriculture sector due to delay in procurement of IT equipment at federal,
regional, and district offices65. WASH-MIS has been implemented in 330 woredas, achieving only 55
per cent of the target, while none of the regions has rolled out MIS in road and agriculture sectors.
Recently, some progress has been made. For instance, MIS software development, verification, and
validation have been completed in the road sector66. Besides, 50 per cent of actual data collection on
census of national network is completed67. In agriculture sector, development of Excel based MIS has
been completed68.
125. Under MforR, data quality assurance has progressed quite well. Using Ethiopia Data Quality
Assessment Framework (EDQAF), CSA has assessed data quality of education sector twice (2012,
2015), health sector once (2014), and road sector once (2012). Thus, CSA deliverables are met as per
targets set in the results framework.
126. CSA rates data quality of education acceptable. But, there are problems related to timeliness and
completeness of data reported from Somali, Benishangul, Harai, and Dire Dawa69. Besides, EMIS &
IT Directorate currently has four experts for data management at national level70. The directorate
urgently needs to recruit statisticians who can assist preparation of analytical reports that are currently
missing. It also sees the need for having one statistician in each region. The other challenges inter alia
include lack of infrastructure to exchange and linking data online, delay in data collection in some
regions, and absence of regional level EMIS in most regions.
127. Regarding HMIS, CSA finds data management and storage is strong at regional level (except in
Afar, Gambella, and Somali) but weak at lower levels (e.g. health post, health centres, and woreda).
Data accuracy is a challenge. Addis Ababa, Benishangul Gumuz, Harari, Oromiya, and Tigray are
found to be over-reporting and Afar Gambella under-reporting the number of 1st visit ANC. It may be
further noted here that data quality assurance/control mechanism has not been developed to check
data accuracy
128. The progress of MforR on analytical works has been slow. DPs therefore urged the government
to review and priorities pending studies, and accordingly six analytical studies have been dropped71.
The recently completed studies inter alia include the following studies: mini-EDHS, SPA+, gender
disaggregated development data, education SDI survey, M&E assessment studies for education and
health sectors, and DA tracking study. There are some studies that have been delayed considerably

   This assessment is based on the experience of attending April 2015 JRIS. Some DPs also felt in the same way

such as cost of service delivery, benefit incidence study, and water sector data quality assessment. All
these studies are important and should be expedited.
129. In view of the limited progress in some areas as discussed hitherto, the forward work plan of
MforR has been redrawn and prioritized, and budget allocation has been reduced.

5.4     Summary of Findings

                            Program effectiveness (progress in achieving results)

Effectiveness of basic service delivery
Progress towards achieving higher-level and PDO targets: Of the seven higher-level indicators, targets were
achieved only for three indictors (43 per cent) in 2012-13, and for four indicators (57 per cent) in 2013-14.
Similarly, of the six PDO indicators, targets were achieved for three indicators (50 per cent) and four indicators
(67 per cent) in 2012-13 and 2013-14 respectively. All the higher-level and PDO targets were missed in the
water sector whereas all the targets were achieved in the road sector. Both these sectors require high capital
investments, and their performance has little or no bearing with the PBS program.
Primary education: NER (Grade 5-8) and proportion of qualified teachers (Grade 1-8) remained below the
targets in 2012-13 and 2013-14, while targets related to GPI and the pupil-teacher ratio are fully met in these
two years. The lower primary education (Grade 1-4), which is not tracked in the results framework, is facing the
problems of high pupil-teacher ratio and significant shortage of qualified teachers. The teachers’ motivation to
take class was also found to be low.
Health: Penta-3 coverage targets were underachieved in 2012-13 and 2013-14, while ANC coverage exceeded
targets. In 2013-14, norm for population per HEW (2,500 per HEW) was almost achieved. Some of the sector
issues that are not tracked in the results framework are the following: low SBA deliveries; normal delivery
service available in less than half of the health posts; and short supply of essential medicines in most of the
health posts. Mixed progress in achieving health MDGs. While IMR has declined considerably and U5MR
achieved ahead of time, MMR continues at a very high level.
Agriculture: The number of DAs with specialisation has not grown as per the targets set for 2012-13 and 2013-
14. The problem of DA retention and quality of service continues unabated. However, food crop productivity
targets nearly achieved, and outreach to direct beneficiaries (smallholder farmers and pastoralists) fully met the
targets.
Water and sanitation: Rural water supply coverage and reduction in non-functional water schemes in 2012-13
and 2013-14 remained far below the targets. At present, about two-third of the households use some form of
latrine, and one-fourth of the kebeles are open defection free.
Rural roads: Due to improved rural road connectivity, time to reach nearest all-weather road reduced and the
targets set for 2012-13 and 2013-14 were almost achieved. Also, the targets of maintaining the roads in fair and
good conditions were fully achieved. Besides, the road sector has established and maintained 500 woreda road
desks with appropriate staff.
Mission findings on basic service delivery
Findings based on KIIs in select regions/woredas: Most of the woredas follow the practice of grading their
primary/secondary schools using some criteria, while much lesser number of woredas evaluates the performance
of the health facilities. Both the findings indicate opportunity for developing an appropriate ‘results based, and
incentivised’ system to monitor service delivery at provider level.
The woredas are faced with some recurrent challenges/constraints such as shortage of skilled/trained manpower,
high staff turnover, and budget constraint for operating expenditure and capital investment. Besides, there are
some sector problems (see text for examples).
Findings based on FGDs: Most of the community members at kebele level feel that basic services have
improved marginally compared to earlier years. They also perceive that education, health, agriculture, and
sanitation services have improved relative to water and rural road services.
Progress in strengthening local accountability and transparency
Citizen engagement: The FTA initiatives have been well integrated with the GoE’s public financial management

                                                                                                               31
Process Evaluation of PBS-3, Final Report: Program Effectiveness (Progress in Achieving Results)
                           Program effectiveness (progress in achieving results)
system, and impressive progress has been made. All the FTA targets were achieved in 2012-13 and 2013-14.
The field mission also gathered anecdotal evidence to suggest that citizens acted on FTA dissemination of
budget and expenditure information.
Social accountability: The social accountability activities have progressed significantly, surpassing the targets
set for 2012-13 and 2013-14. The SA facilitation together with other interventions has also brought about
commendable improvements in the basic service delivery. However, community consultation by woreda
officials for improving basic services has not progressed as expected. In terms of FTA-SA linkage activities,
there has been satisfactory progress in the recent period.
Grievance redress mechanisms: EIO has branch office in six regions, and GRMs are in place and functional in
almost all the regions. Besides, all regions have adopted standard manuals and guidelines. A recent study has
brought out several challenges of the GRM system at regional/zone/woreda levels, such as lack of
independence, and weak enforcement of decisions. The same study also points out that the citizens are generally
not satisfied with redress of complaints by the GRM offices.
Public financial management and procurement: The PFM system at the woreda level has matured over the
years, and the progress includes: rolling of IBEX all over the country except in few woredas; improved audit
coverage by ORAG; and complete audit coverage by OFAG. However, a large number of woredas do not
follow up actions on audit findings.
The woredas are constrained by lack of technical skills to deal with works procurement and contracts
management. For transparency and accountability, the woredas are required to post procurement award
decisions. Not much progress has been made in this regard.
Managing for results: The updating and sharing of PBS results in every JRIS has progressed well, but the work
related to strengthening multi-sector MIS and conducting analytical studies has been slow. Some areas of
concern are: slow roll out of WASH MIS; failure to roll out MIS for agriculture and road sectors; and delay in
conducting some critical studies (e.g. cost of service delivery, benefit incidence study, water sector DQA). In
view of such slow progress, the forward work plan has been redrawn and prioritized, and budget allocation has
been reduced.

Chapter 6: Aid Effectiveness of the PBS Program

The present evaluation has looked into aid effectiveness of the PBS program in the background of the
aid landscape in Ethiopia. The assessment is carried out in this chapter using the Paris Declaration.
This chapter also includes a brief discussion on the PBS-donors’ engagement in policy dialogue with
the government. Currently, donors’ harmonization has reached a cross road, given the realignment of
their support to basic services. The donors are now developing a new framework for harmonization.
The initiatives taken in this regard are briefly noted in this chapter.

6.1     Aid Landscape in Ethiopia
130. A large number of active development partners are operating in Ethiopia72. In 2013 (the latest
year for which OECD-DAC data are available), total official development assistance (ODA) was
USD 3.9 billion73, of which ‘aid on budget’ amounted to USD 2.9 billion (74 per cent)74. Over the
years, ODA flows to the country have shown two discernable trends. First, humanitarian aid has
declined, reflecting the country’s improved resilience to cope with humanitarian emergencies75.
Second, share of concessional loans in ODA portfolio has increased compared to grants indicating
Ethiopia’s growing debt sustainability capacity76. It may be further noted that despite growth in ODA
volume, the country’s aid per capita continues to be lower than the average of Sub-Saharan Africa77.
131. Since its inception in 2001, the development assistance group (DAG) in Ethiopia has been
engaged with the government to promote effective delivery of ODA, and to foster cooperation and
coordination among all the development partners and the government. DAG now comprises of 27
bilateral and multilateral DPs, and its overarching aid coordination structure consists of (i) DAG’s
own set up (executive committee, secretariat, and technical working groups), (ii) MoFED’s Effective
Development Cooperation Task Force (donor-government sector working groups), and (iii) donor
working groups78. DAG holds regular dialogue with the government through the annual GTP progress
review meeting and the high-level forum79. In addition, MoFED convenes the Effective Development
Cooperation Task Force to further promote adherence to the development effectiveness agenda in the
country. The task force meets every quarter and follows up on the implementation of aid effectiveness
plan and targets of the country. The task force also carries out groundwork for policy dialogue
between the government and DAG in high-level forum.
132. In 2007, aid management platform (AMP) was launched to enhance transparency, mutual
accountability, and efficiency in development cooperation. AMP refers to a web-based aid database,
which is managed by MoFED. Currently more than 24 donors have AMP workspace, which can be
directly accessed by them to enter their commitment and disbursement data80. AMP guidelines clearly
state the role and responsibility of donors and MoFED. However, the donors have not yet started
entering the data81. In 2013, MoFED published its annual ODA Statistical Bulletin presenting on-
budget aid using EFY 2005 AMP data. The bulletin was distributed to all development partners.


72
   According to the aid management platform data, there are 22 bilateral and 24 multilateral DPs. See DAG
Annual Report 2013-14. Profiles of 41 DPs are available in another DAG publication (July 2015) titled Profiles
of 41 Development Partners in Ethiopia.

Going forward, the DPs and the government are required to institutionalize the use of AMP data to
inform future program decisions.
133. In 2013, post-Busan monitoring survey was conducted in Ethiopia, contextualizing it with the
aggregate results for 46 countries82. In total 24 DPs in Ethiopia participated in monitoring exercise,
which captured 82 per cent of the total ODA in the country during July 2011-June 2012. The
monitoring results show that Ethiopia scored above the global average for select indicators of aid
effectiveness (viz. aid predictability, aid on budget, mutual accountability, gender equality, and use of
the country system) albeit there was a decrease in score on the use of national PFM and procurement
systems compared to the last evaluation in 201083. Based on the results, an action plan was put in
place to make further progress84.
134. In terms of aid effectiveness at program level, it is pertinent to note that the PBS and PSNP
programs were featured as showcases on aid effectiveness at the fourth high-level forum held in
December 2011 in Busan, South Korea85.

6.2       Aid Effectiveness of the PBS program
135. The present evaluation has assessed the aid effectiveness of the PBS program in terms of the five
principles of the Paris Declaration of aid effectiveness viz. ownership, alignment, harmonization,
managing for results, and mutual accountability. The findings suggest that the PBS program, as
evolved through phases, meets all the criteria demonstrating a high degree of aid effectiveness.
136. Ownership: The GoE engagement in the design of PBS-1 was limited, but involvement matured
in the successive phases leading to complete ownership of the program design including the core
principles and the results framework. The government ownership and deep commitment is also
evinced by the fact that its share in block grant transfers increased from 58.1 per cent in 2006-07 to
85.5 per cent in 2014-15.
137. Alignment: The development objectives of the PBS program are well aligned with four out of
seven pillars of GTP (see Chap.4, Sec. 4.2.1). Besides, the program makes use of the government’s
Treasury systems and accounts to transfer block grants to the woredas. For performing tests related to
core principles, as well as for monitoring results, the program mainly relies on GoE’s administrative
database and M&E system.
138. Harmonization: The pool-funding system of the PBS program through multi-donor trust funds
(managed by the World Bank) has been a key instrument to achieve donors’ harmonization. The pool-
funding system has not only reduced the transaction costs, but also relieved MoFED from following
multiple financial procedures and reporting systems that the individual donors might have imposed86.
The other key mechanisms that have supported donors’ harmonization are following:
      •   JRIS missions: The semi-annual JRIS mission provides a single platform to all donors, the
          federal and regional governments, management agency, and other government and non-
          government agencies for developing a shared understanding of the results, progress, and
          challenges of the PBS program. This common platform has eliminated taxing the government
          with multiple donor missions.


82
   MoFED conducted the exercise under the guidance of the Effective Development Cooperation Task Force.
The DAG secretariat facilitated cooperation between DPs and GoE.
83
   For detailed monitoring results see DAG (June 2014): Post-Busan monitoring results for Ethiopia
84
   Although Ethiopia does not have an aid policy or partnership policy, the DAG and MoFED have previously
agreed on an aid effectiveness action plan with clear indicators to measure. See DAG (June 2014): Post-Busan
monitoring results for Ethiopia, p3

86
   In the absence of data, the present evaluation could not estimate savings in transaction costs, net of the Bank’s
funds management fees and the PBS secretariat’s operating costs.
                                                                                                                 34
Process Evaluation of PBS-3, Final Report: Aid Effectiveness of the PBS Program
      •   PBS donors group: The PBS donors meet monthly to discuss the various issues related to the
          program implementation and to take joint decisions. The World Bank holds the permanent
          chair of this forum, while the co-chair rotates among other donors. A close scrutiny of a
          sample of minutes of the meetings shows that the system of monthly meeting has been quite
          effective in fostering collective decision-making and DP harmonization.
      •   PBS secretariat: The decision to use dedicated resources to set up a PBS secretariat has been
          a critical design feature of the PBS program. Both the donors group and MoFED appreciate
          the wide-ranging activities that the secretariat undertakes to facilitate harmonization and
          coordination among DPs, and between the government and DPs.
139. The pool funding system and the other mechanisms as described above together present a well-
harmonised donor position to the government, which in turn makes the government’s task of donors’
engagement smooth and manageable. In view of this, it is quite reasonable to say that the PBS
program fully meets the harmonization principle of aid effectiveness.
140. Managing for development results: The PBS-3 program has a stronger focus on results. In
particular, the program design includes a specific component viz. managing for results. The program
results are updated and discussed in every JRIS, and the measures to improve the results and to
address specific challenges are jointly decided by GoE and DPs.
141. Mutual accountability: The PBS program ensures high level of mutual accountability through
semi-annual JRIS/JBAR (which also includes pre-JRIS field visits to select regions/woredas). The key
aspects of JRIS/JBAR that pave mutual accountability are the following:
      •   Joint review of results/deliverables: JRIS/JBAR is the primary mechanism by which the
          government and DPs undertake a joint review of (a) program results, progress, and
          challenges; (b) application of the core PBS principles; and (c) financial management of the
          program. The review process promotes GoE-DP dialogue, leading to joint agreement about
          the action plan going forward.
      •   Trigger for disbursement of funds: The satisfactory outcomes of JRIS/JBAR trigger release
          of block grant (under Sub-Program-A)87.
      •   Deepening accountability: JRIS/JBAR is attended by a large number of sector and regional
          representatives. This deepens mutual accountability for results beyond MoFED-DP level, and
          involves stakeholders from the regions, sectors, government agencies, and CSOs. However,
          in recent years, participation of line Ministers and other high-level government officials in
          JRIS has been uneven, causing a bit of concern 88.
142. There are other initiatives that have deepened mutual accountability such as participation of
channel one programs coordination office (COPCO) of MoFED in alternative monthly meeting of
DPs, and the MoFED directors holding the chair of technical working groups that are lagging behind
and demanding greater participation from the sector ministries.

6.3       Donors’ Engagement in Policy Dialogue with the Government
143. Historically, budget support system provided opportunity to the donors’ for engagement in policy
dialogue with GoE on macro issues such as economic stability, poverty reduction, governance, human
rights, and political accountability. This opportunity was embedded in the budget support instrument.
144. Since inception of the PBS program, JRIS/JBAR has become the main forum for GoE-DPs
dialogue, which mainly centres on reviewing program results and developing operational plans to deal

with key implementation issues. The government has been very responsive to this kind of dialogue
because in its view policy dialogue under PBS must focus on how to improve delivery, quality, and
governance of basic services89. Going forward, the donors also agreed that macroeconomic dialogue
should not be within the purview of semi-annual JRIS/JBAR, and following this understanding GoE
and DPs have been continuing with technical exchanges on macroeconomic policy issues at quarterly
meetings. The PBS secretariat has facilitated such technical exchange.
145. At the outset of PBS-3, GoE committed to set up an alternative forum, outside the main program,
for having sustained dialogue on macroeconomic policy issues90. GoE took some time to set up this
forum. In 2014, a macro dialogue forum was established. From the government side, MoFED and the
National Bank of Ethiopia participate in this forum. With the setting up of this forum, there is now a
formal mechanism for donors to engage in dialogue with GoE on macroeconomic policy issues albeit
DAG continues to provide a bigger forum for any dialogue on economic/financial/sector issues.
146. The evaluation team further noticed that JRIS/JABR does not provide scope for strategic
discussion and decision-making. Rather JRIS acts as a forum for sharing results, progress, and
challenges with larger number of stakeholders; building a consensus regarding action plans to address
the challenges; and agreeing deliverables for the next session of JRIS. This raises the question
whether the format of six-monthly JRIS/JABR needs to be changed, or additional forum should be set
up (e.g. high-level project steering committee) to create space for any strategic discussion regarding
the PBS program, including discussion on resource mobilisation and institutionalisation of good
governance practices to ensure expansion and sustainability of quality basic service delivery.

6.4     Recent Initiatives for Donors’ Harmonization
147. As mentioned in the introductory chapter (see Para 5, Chap. 1), the PBS donors have recently
realigned their support to basic services, creating a new challenge for harmonization. Despite their
different modalities to support the government, the donors are keen to have a common platform to
sustain dialogue and harmonized efforts to promote basic service delivery.
148. The DPs initiated the development of a roadmap for harmonization in early 2015, and identified
a few priority areas, such as developing knowledge management system; creating a new coordination
entity replacing the existing PBS secretariat; revising JRIS process and format; setting up a
knowledge forum; strengthening DAG engagement and recognition; building communication
strategy; and developing sector engagement plans91.
149. As a follow up of the above roadmap, the PBS secretariat was reconstituted as SDS with effect
from July 2015. After many deliberations, the DPs developed a ToR for SDS. It contains twelve
overlapping objectives and seven functions92. The evaluation team finds this ToR less compact and
focussed, and therefore requires revision.
150. Very recently (January 2016), DPs held a one-day workshop and further deliberated on the issues
and various options of harmonization93. The workshop identified several weaknesses in the existing
harmonisation system, such as lack of a common work plan; different structures and performance of
the existing TWGs; and less scope for strategic dialogue and priority setting through JRIS/JBAR. The
workshop also reached a number of broader agreements including, among others, the following:
developing a common planning framework to reduce duplication of interventions, and identify areas
of synergy; reviewing and updating the tools of harmonization including JRIS and TWGs; and
increasing the engagement with regions and woreda

151. The development of a roadmap for harmonization is still a work in-progress. The donors need to
flesh out the action plans, and enter into a mutually agreed memorandum of understanding (MoU).
Also, the SDS needs to be adequately staffed, and its ToR must be defined appropriately.

6.5      Summary of Findings

                                     Aid effectiveness of the PBS program

Aid landscape in Ethiopia: Ethiopia scores above global average in terms of aid predictability, aid on budget,
mutual accountability, gender equality, and use of the country system. Among the multi-donor funded
programs, PBS and PSNP were featured as showcases on aid effectiveness at the fourth high-level forum held in
December 2011 in Busan, South Korea.
Aid effectiveness of the PBS program: The present evaluation finds that the PBS program meets very well the
aid effectiveness principles of the Paris Declaration.
Donors’ engagement in policy dialogue: Since inception of the PBS program, JRIS/JBAR has been the main
forum for GoE-DPs dialogue regarding program results, and developing operational plans to deal with key
implementation issues. Until the formation of a macro dialogue forum in 2014, GoE and DPs discussed
macroeconomic issues at quarterly meetings. With the setting up of this forum, PBS donors now have an
appropriate mechanism to engage in dialogue with GoE on policy issues. The present evaluation has also
noticed that JRIS/JBAR does not provide any scope for strategic discussion and decision-making. This raises
the question whether the format of JRIS/JABR needs to be changed, or additional forum should be set up (e.g.
high-level project steering committee) to create space for any strategic discussion regarding the PBS program.
Recent initiatives for donors’ harmonization: The donors’ harmonization has now reached a cross road, given
the realignment of their support to basic services. In this regard, the PBS secretariat has been reconstituted as a
Service Delivery Secretariat with effect from July 2015. The donors are keen to develop a common framework
for harmonization, and several rounds of discussion have already been taken place. The work is still in-progress,
and the donors need to flesh out concrete action plans and enter into a memorandum of understanding. The SDS
needs to be adequately staffed, and its ToR must be defined appropriately.

Process Evaluation of PBS-3, Final Report: Aid Effectiveness of the PBS Program
Chapter 7: Program Efficiency

This chapter deals with the evaluation of program efficiency, which includes assessment of (a) value-
for-money (VfM), (b) program implementation, and (c) risk management. The VfM analysis has taken
into account four criteria, namely economy, efficiency, effectiveness, and equity. The evaluation has
mainly relied on review of secondary literature and analysis of secondary data.

7.1     Assessment of Value-for-Money
152. Cost drivers at woreda level: Analysis of woreda level expenditure in recent years (2011-12 to
2013-14) reveals that the education sector has 35.5 per cent share in total expenditure, while health
and agriculture accounts for 11.1 per cent and 10.9 per cent respectively (Figure 7.1). Water and road
sectors absorb very small shares in the total expenditure, 2.5 per cent and 1.4 per cent respectively.
Thus, the combined share of the five basic service sectors in the total expenditure at woreda level is
about 61 per cent.
          Figure 7.1: Sector shares in expenditure at woreda level (2011-12 to 2013-14)
                                     Road	1.4%	                   Water	2.5%	
                                                                                   Agriculture	
                                                                                     10.9%	



                                                                                   Health	11.1%	
                                   Others	38.5%	




                                                                                 Educa1on	
                                                                                   35.5%	



153. Salary payment to staff has remained the major cost driver of basic service delivery at woreda
level, accounting for 78 per cent of the total expenditure (Figure 7.2). Among the sectors, share of
salary in total recurrent and capital expenditure is highest in the education sector (90 per cent),
followed by health (69 per cent), and agriculture (65 per cent). Water and road being more capital-
intensive sectors, salary represents relatively smaller shares (42 per cent and 19 per cent respectively).

154. Economy: Given the predominance of salary component at woreda level expenditure (especially
in education, health, and agriculture sectors), the economy aspect of VfM needs to be analyzed with
reference to salary cost. In this regard, a DfID funded VfM study (hereinafter referred to as VfM
study) reveals the following94:
     •   In Ethiopia, the pay scale of teachers and health professionals are better than other civil
         servants with similar qualifications95. However, compared to private sector, the experienced
         teachers and health professionals get lower pay. Furthermore, the salary of primary teachers
         relative to per capita GDP is significantly low in Ethiopia as compared to Tanzania and
         Uganda but slightly higher than Kenya.
     •   Index of real average unit costs of teachers in primary and secondary schools declined from
         100 in 2010-11 (base year) to 76.16 in 2011-12, and then marginally improved to 78.3 in
         2012-13. The index improved further to 82.10 in 2013-14, but still remained about 18 per
         cent lower than the 2010-11 level96. On the whole, teacher’s salary has declined in real terms
         over the period.
     •   All procurements related to Sub-Program-B have taken place as per the government systems
         which albeit suffers from several weaknesses. Recognising high procurement risks, PAD of
         PBS-3 proposed several risk mitigation measures. Presumably, risk oversight would ensure
         economy of procurement.
     •   The costs of program implementation support, largely staff related, are low. One contributing
         factor is small staff size of the PBS secretariat. The Bank’s fund management fee also
         compares well with the amount charged by other international agencies.
155. Based on the above findings, the VfM study concludes that block grant financing for basic
service salaries under Sub-Program-A has achieved good value-for-money at economy-level.
156. The present evaluation, however, holds a different viewpoint regarding economy of the staff
costs. Any decline in real staff costs, or prevalence of low pay structure in the public sector compared
to private sector and other African countries, does not necessarily mean economy of staff costs. In the
Ethiopian context, low salary structure is one of the key causal factors for staff turnover in the public
sector. For a more meaningful analysis, the VfM study should have taken into account costs of staff
turnover, including the benefits forgone of the training and other capacity building expenses incurred
for those who left the basic service sectors. In sum, the present evaluation is of the opinion that low
and declining real salary indicates ‘hidden problems’ and not ‘value’ for money.
157. Efficiency: Like the VfM study, the present evaluation finds some concerns about the efficiency
with which the PBS inputs have been transformed into outputs. These are listed below97:
     •   Though absolute number of teachers has increased over the years, lack of qualified teachers
         at Grade1-4 still continues to be a challenge98.
     •   Despite the availability of health posts and health centres (nearly as per norms), as well as
         presence of a strong force of HEWs, the coverage of critical services like ANC (during 1st
         visit) declined, from 2.86 million in 2012-13 to 2.52 million in 2013-14. Similarly, the
         coverage of Penta-3 vaccine remained below the targets set for 2012-13 and 2013-14.
     •   The number of DAs with specialization of agro-ecological zones and high value crops has
         not increased as per targets set for 2012-13 and 2013-14.

   ITAD (Feb. 2015): Value for money assessment of the promotion of basic services (PBS) programme
95
   In Ethiopia, a pay revision took place at the start of 2014-15, after frozen pay scale since 2010-11.
96
    The total salaries in basic service sectors at woreda level increased between 2006-07 and 2013-14 at a
nominal growth rate of 23.8 per cent and at 1.7 per cent in real terms. The trend data are not shown here.
97
   These points are drawn from Chap. 5.
98
   The number of teachers increased from 171,079 in 2004-05 to 335,109 in 2012-13. See PAD, ESPES, p 15.
                                                                                                       39
Process Evaluation of PBS-3, Final Report: Program Efficiency
      •   Although most of the key output indicators covering Sub-Program-B were on track during
          2012-13 and 2013-14, the progress under MforR was limited, with slow funds utilization.
158. It is evident from above that the PBS-3 program has not achieved the planned level of efficiency.
There is a need for close monitoring of the results to improve efficiency.
159. Effectiveness: The VfM study suggests that the PBS has been a very effective program. The
conclusion is based on (a) the findings of a recent poverty and social impact assessment (PSIA) study
conducted by the Bank; (b) the DfID’s business case for PBS-3, and (c) draft PEFA report99. The VfM
study has not done any independent analysis.
160. The DfID’s business case provides an estimate of benefit-cost ratio (BCR) of the PBS program.
The estimated BCR is 1.43, which shows that benefits outweigh the costs. The BCR calculation is
based on a set of assumptions, which the VfM study could check to a large extent for validation with
the latest available data and information. The sensitivity analysis further reassures that BCR would be
greater than one under different adverse scenarios.
161. In this context, the present evaluation is of the opinion that the VfM study could have undertaken
independent cost benefit analysis instead of relying solely on DfID’s business case. For instance, the
study could have estimated rate of return to schooling using Minecerian earnings functions. Such
estimation has been carried out for GEQIP-II, which shows that rate of return to schooling is
approximately 17 per cent in Ethiopia100.
162. Similarly, VfM study could have undertaken a cost effectiveness analysis for health sector by
estimating cost of disability-adjusted life year (DALY) saved due to reduction in maternal and child
deaths. Since the PBS program has supported basic mother and child services by providing additional
HEWs, the DALY analysis could have provided some insights into effectiveness of the PBS program.
163. Equity: The PBS-3 and its predecessor programs have not made any visible impact in reducing
inequities in basic services. The inequities in service delivery across the regions and income/wealth
quintiles have persisted over the years (see Annex 4 for evidence of inequities in education and health
sectors).
164. The VfM study further highlights the formula-based allocation of block grants from the federal to
the regions, and from the regions to the woredas as GoE’s approach to foster equitable development
in the country. It may be noted here that the regions apply varied allocation formulae, and many of
them have not updated their formulae for long period of time101 . Thus, there is a need to assess first
the efficacy of the regional formulae in achieving equitable allocation of block grant to woredas.

7.2       Efficacy of the Program Implementation
165. Financial management of the program: As per the restructuring paper (20 July 2015), the
revised budget estimate of PBS-3 is USD 1215.74 million (IDA fund of USD 600 million plus Trust
Fund of USD 615.74 million). The program budget has shrunk by USD 162.4 million due to DfID’s
withdrawal from the program102. Of the revised budget amount, USD 924.01 million (IDA fund of
USD 489.5 million plus Trust Fund of USD 434.51) million was disbursed as of 19 May 2015. This
represents 76 per cent disbursement of donors’ funding support to PBS-3.

Process Evaluation of PBS-3, Final Report: Program Efficiency
166. Budget utilisation of Sub-Program B has not been as satisfactory as expected, especially the
budget absorption under the sub-component MforR. As per PBS secretariat update, of the total budget
of $22.7 million (revised budget) for MforR, around $13.8 million was spent or committed as of
March 2015, representing funds utilisation of 60.8 per cent. Due to slow progress in funds utilisation,
MforR activities have been revised and re-prioritised.
167. As on 30 June 2015, the management agency disbursed a total amount of USD 12.79 million to
all SAIPs, which accounted for 89.5 per cent of the allocated grant amount of USD 14.29 million. Of
the disbursed amount, actual expenditure was USD 10.72 million representing 83.8 per cent funds
utilization103. In fact, funds utilisation under ESAP-2 has been better than other components under
Sub-Program-B.
168. The quarterly IFRs, annual audit report, and concurrent audit reports are all submitted in time.
However, there are some challenges. The IFR reports lack narration or explanation for the reported
budget variance104. Also, there has been delay in submission of audit feedback and follow up actions
are not taken to avoid repeated audit findings105.
169. The PBS audit report for 2012-13 was submitted in time and it did not contain any qualifications.
But the management letter noted some findings related to lack of banks reconciliations, and some
wrong posting of expenditures106. These issues have since been addressed with the regions refusing to
release PBS funds without completion of bank reconciliations, and by circulating guidance on
expenditure classification107. The audit report for the year 2013-14 was due in January 2015, but the
present evaluation is not aware about the status of this report.
170. Bank’s performance: The bank’s overall performance in designing and implementation of PBS-
3 has been satisfactory. The Bank put together a relevant and coherent PBS-3 program, building on
six years of prior experience of program implementation as well as after giving due consideration to
political, social, and economic developments of the country at appraisal stage. However, as discussed
earlier, the Bank could have done better by addressing the issues of regional and income/wealth
inequities in accessing the basic services, and by improvising the results framework to address the
shortcomings as pointed out in this evaluation (see Sec 4.2.7, Chap. 4).
171. Turning to managing funds through MDTF, the Bank has performed well as acknowledged by
key development partners like DfID. According to DfID, the Bank’s management of funds is
satisfactory with the timely provision of quarterly IFRs and external audit report108.
172. The Bank’ overall leadership and program implementation support is laudable. It has ensured
country-based presence of a qualified team to provide effective implementation support. With the
support of PBS secretariat, the Bank has successfully conducted semi-annual JRIS/JBAR as per plans.
As mentioned earlier, the PBS program meets very well the aid effectiveness principle. The credit
goes to the Bank for its effective leadership, and the PBS secretariat for its support for donors’
harmonization and coordination. MoFED and other donors highly appreciate the Bank’s leadership
and implementation support.
173. Government’s performance: Under the leadership of MoFED, the government has been highly
supportive to PBS program implementation. The GoE‘s ownership and deep commitment is also
evinced by the fact that it is the largest financial contributor to the PBS program. GoE has also shown
deep respect for core principles, and wholeheartedly participated in all JRIS/JBAR. As mentioned in
successive Aide Memoire, each year GoE has met the criteria of additionality and fairness tests.

Process Evaluation of PBS-3, Final Report: Program Efficiency
Besides, over the six years from 2008-09 to 2013-14, the federal government fully transferred the
budget amount of block grant to the regions109 .
174. Performance of the PBS Secretariat: The PBS secretariat undertakes a wide range of activities,
and it has played a crucial role to support program implementation, and to achieve donors’
coordination and harmonization110. Both DPs and MoFED appreciate the efforts put in by the
secretariat. However, there are areas where the secretariat could have paid attention to add more value
to the program.
175. For instance, effectiveness, sustainability, and equity reviews have relied on thematic, pre-JRIS
field mission to a few woredas. The field mission often lacked specific focus on these principles, and
findings based on few woredas are not good enough to draw any inferences. This is an area where the
in-house expertise of the secretariat, the Bank, and other DPs could have been pulled together to
produce specific studies to stimulate DP-GoE dialogue on the subject. The results framework is
another area where the secretariat could have added more value by addressing the shortcomings as
pointed out in this evaluation (see Sec. 4.2.7, Chap. 4).
176. In addition to above, the secretariat has not taken any initiatives to develop and implement
communication and knowledge management strategy. Except publishing a few issues of PBS update
during 2015, the secretariat has not produced any knowledge products (e.g. documentation of best
practices). It is also noticeable that the secretariat has not hosted a website to post documents, reports,
results and progress data. Such dissemination would have attracted comments, observations, and
suggestions from various stakeholders including the beneficiaries.

7.3     Risk Management
177. At the appraisal stage, the Bank was aware of the risk of possible human abuse under CDP in
Bennishangul-Gumz, Gambella, Somali, and Afar (see Annex 6, PAD 29 August 2012, p 97).
However, no specific measures were considered to mitigate the CDP related risks. In this regard, the
Investigation Panel observed that the Bank’s approach did not meet the standards of a systematic or
holistic assessment of risks as set in the operational risk assessment framework (ORAF). The Panel
also found this omission as non-compliance with the Bank’s OMS 2.20 on project appraisal.
However, the Bank responded to the concerns raised by the panel with a comprehensive action
plan111 . In particular, the Bank has developed environmental and social screening tool to manage
potential risks associated with any operational interface between Bank-financed projects and CDP.
The government has already approved the tool. Besides, a safeguards implementation manual and
training program are also under development, which will enhance the capacity of woreda for
environmental and social risks management.
178. The PBS includes several other risk mitigation measures, such as (i) making provision for GoE-
PBS dialogue on inflation and broader macroeconomic issues outside the purview of the PBS-3
program; (ii) JRIS review of progress towards developing sustainability through increased generation
of domestic revenue; (iii) inclusion of FTA, SA, and GRM components to promote local governance

109
    PAD (August 19, 2015): ESPES, p 47
110
    For instance, during 2014, the secretariat carried out inter alia the following activities: (a) providing
administrative, logistic and technical support for holding pre-JRIS field mission and JRIS; (b) coordinating
involvement of senior representatives of line ministries/agencies in the meetings of the technical working
groups, and providing DPs with regular updates of TWGs; (c) facilitating technical discussions on
macroeconomic issued in a separate forum outside the PBS program; and (d) drafting the JRIS Aide Memoire
and supporting DPs and the government counterparts to finalize the Aide Memoire so as to make timely
disbursement to FBG. The team-lead of the present study also participated in April 2015 JRIS and witnessed the
huge contributions of the secretariat in successful conduct of the JRIS. See Annual Report, Jan-Dec 2014; and
Semi-Annual Report, Jan-June 2015.

and accountability, as well as GoE’s written assurance that the civil society law would not stop
implementation of social accountability activities; (iv) setting up donor-funded PBS secretariat to
provide program implementation support and aid effectiveness; and (v) several initiatives by MoFED
to address recurrent challenges of financial management, including restructuring of COPCO. All these
risk mitigation measures have been implemented.

7.4      Summary of Findings

                                               Program efficiency

Value-for-money: The views of the present evaluation on VfM are the following. The declining real salary costs
in the basic service sectors does not indicate ‘economy’ of staff input costs. PBS-3 has not achieved the planned
level of ‘efficiency’. The ‘effectiveness’ of the program has been satisfactory, but equity in service delivery has
not been achieved.
Efficacy of the program implementation: The overall funds disbursement was 76 per cent as of 19 May 2015.
But, disbursement and utilisation of funds under Sub-Program-B excluding ESAP-2 has not been satisfactory.
Funds utilisation under ESAP-2 has been better than other components of Sub-Program B. IFRs and audit
reports are submitted in time, the latest external audit contains no qualifications.
The Bank’s leadership and implementation support has been satisfactory. GoE has shown sustained ownership
and commitment for the program.
The PBS secretariat has played an appreciable role to support program implementation and to achieve donors’
harmonization and coordination. Of course, there are areas where it could have added more value, such as:
producing specific studies on program effectiveness, sustainability, and equity so as to stimulate GoE-DP
dialogue; improvising results framework to address the shortcomings highlighted in this study; and developing
and implementing strategy for communication and knowledge management.
Risk management: The Investigation Panel observed that the Bank’s approach did not meet the standards of a
systematic or holistic assessment of risks as set in the ORAF. However, the Bank has taken initiatives, among
others, to develop environmental and social screening tool to manage potential risks associated with any
operational interface between Bank-financed projects and CDP.

Process Evaluation of PBS-3, Final Report: Program Efficiency
Chapter 8: Impact and Sustainability

This chapter is devoted to assess the PBS program using the criteria of impact and sustainability.
Given that this is a process evaluation, impact assessment has not been carried out in details. The
evaluation of sustainability has focused on both fiscal and institutional issues.

8.1       Impacts of the PBS Program
8.1.1     Impact of block grant spending on sector outcomes (PSIA study)
179. The Poverty and Social Impact Assessment (PSIA) study of the Bank analysed effectiveness of
woreda block grant spending on education, health, and agriculture using data on woreda level per
capita recurrent expenditure, and variety of education, health, and agriculture outcome indicators
between 2008 and 2011112. The key findings based on log-linear regression are as given under113:
      •   NER and PTR showed a significant relationship with woreda-level per capita recurrent
          expenditure after controlling for the effects of rural/urban divide and ethnicity. According to
          the estimated equations, one per cent increase in per capita recurrent expenditure on
          education would increase net enrolment by 0.27 per cent, and PTR by 0.22 per cent.
      •   Similarly, significant association was found between per capita health expenditure (recurrent)
          and health outcomes. The regression results showed that one per cent increase in per capita
          health expenditure, after controlling for capital expenditure at regional level, would increase
          ANC by 0.086 per cent, and deliveries by SBA by 0.27 per cent.
      •   In case of agriculture, one per cent increase in per capita expenditure on extension workers
          was associated with more than one per cent increase in yield of enset, fruit, and coffee.
180. The findings clearly suggest that woreda-level spending on education, health, and agriculture has
been effective in achieving key sector outcomes114.
181. The PSIA also examined the issue of equity in decentralised spending at woreda level. In this
regard the study made some important observations as follows. The benefits of woreda level spending
on education and health accrued to all income levels, and per capita expenditure under the existing
allocation framework favoured historically disadvantaged regions and ethnic groups. More than 50
per cent of the woredas in Gambella and 30 per cent in Benishangul-Gumz spend more than 110 per
cent of the national average per capita on basic services. Similarly, four majority-Anyiwak woredas
are noteworthy for receiving more public resources than all other woredas in the nation. In view of
these findings, the study observed that additional resource allocation and spending in disadvantaged
regions and ethnic groups appeared to help them to catch up with national level basic service delivery.
8.1.2     Progress towards achieving MDG targets
182. The positive impacts of block grants on sector outcomes (as brought out by PSIA) are expected
to accelerate progress towards achieving MDGs. Keeping this in mind, the present evaluation has
tracked progress towards MDGs (Goals 1 to 5) applying counterfactual analysis and using latest
available data115. The findings are as follows. Of the five MDG goals, the target has been fully
achieved with respect to only one indicator under Goal 4 (reduction in under five mortality rate). The
progress made so far with respect to Goal 1 (eradication of poverty and hunger), Goal 2 (universal
education), and Goal 3 (promoting gender equity) are on track although the targets may not be
achieved by 2015. But, progress towards achieving Goal 5 (improving maternal health) has remained
completely off the track. On the whole, the progress towards MDGs has been satisfactory, and it may

towards the Millennium Development Goals. In this section, data have been updated up to 2013-14.
be reasonable to say that the PBS program with its support for expansion of basis services has
contributed in this progress (see Annex 6 for detail analysis of progress made towards MDGs).
8.1.3      Unintended or negative impact of the PBS-3 program
183. In course of reviewing relevant documents, the present evaluation has not found any specific
reference or proven records of any unintended or negative impacts of the PBS program. The only
unintended negative impact of PBS-3 has been its alleged linkage with human right abuses in
Gambella. Though the Inspection Panel did not find any evidence of PBS program causing alleged
harms, the event heightened international scrutiny of PBS-3.

8.2        Sustainability of Basic Services
8.2.1      Fiscal sustainability
184. The key factors to determine fiscal sustainability of providing basic services are: (i) demand for
basic services, given the population growth; (ii) required expenditure to support the demand based on
cost of services; and (iii) availability of domestic resources to meet the expenditure. Till date, no
exercise has been undertaken to assess fiscal sustainability of basic services based on these factors.
Only a small study on cost of basic service delivery was conducted by IGFT-TWG in a few districts
in Amhara from 12-22 October 2014116. In the absence of any available study, this evaluation has
made an attempt to to assess whether basic services could be fiscally sustained in the mid term (2015-
16 to 2019-20).

           Assumptions:
               •    Projections are made taking 2013-14 as base year for which actual expenditure and revenue
                    data are available. The projected figures for 2014-15 are not shown here.
               •    Population is assumed to grow as per medium variant projection by CSA.
               •    Per capita pro-poor spending (recurrent and capital expenditures) at national level was ETB
                    1,459 (USD 76) in 2013-14. It is assumed to grow at 8 per cent, which was the rate of inflation
                    in 2013-14.
               •    In 2013-14, the expenditure other than pro-poor spending was ETB 58.7 billion. The same is
                    inflated at 10 per cent per year over the projection period.
               •    GDP is assumed to grow at 10 per cent (growth rate was10.3 per cent in 2013-14).
               •    Tax-to-GDP and non-tax-to-GDP ratios are assumed at 12.5 per cent (actual was 12.7 per cent
                    in 2013-14), and 1.0 per cent (actual was 1.2 per cent) respectively.

185. The base case projection shows that if the current fiscal conditions continue, spending on basic
services for the growing population would push budget deficit (without grants) to GDP ratio from 3.8
per cent in 2013-14 to 4.2 per cent in 2015-16, and then to 4.5 per cent in 2019-20 (Table 8.1). In
absolute term, budget deficit will average ETB 7.5 billion (or USD 362 million) per year over the five

year period from 2015-16 to 2019-20117 . This deficit is not manageable without donors funding
support unless the government can boost revenue in a big way. In 2013-14, external finance (net)
bridged 52 per cent of the budget deficit. Applying the same ratio, the required donors’ funding would
be around USD 150 to 200 million per year.
186. The sensitivity analysis shows that one per cent point reduction in tax-to-GDP ratio would cause
budget deficit to increase by about one per cent point over the projected base case figures (Figure
8.1). Thus, it is imperative that GoE take all measures to increase tax revenue commensurate with the
revenue potentials of the country’s growing economy. Under worst scenario, which combines one per
cent point decrease in GDP growth rate, one per cent point drop in tax-to-GDP ratio, and one per cent
point increase in rate of inflation – budget deficit will significantly shoot up jeopardising provision of
basic services for the growing population. This means that GoE needs to closely monitor economic
growth and stability.

187. The present exercise on medium-term projections suffers from a few limitations. First, in the
absence of unit cost estimates, budget provisions for basic services are estimated using per capita
expenditure of the base year. In all probability, unit costs of service delivery as per sector standards
will be much more than the base-year per capita spending. Second, the budget provision for basic
services does not include any estimates for repairs and maintenance of infrastructure and facilities.
Third, in the absence of any diagnostic study on domestic resource mobilisation, the present
projection has relied only on historical tax and non-tax to GDP ratios for projections.
8.2.2    Institutional sustainability
188. Since inception of the PBS program, there have been conscious efforts to institutionalise good
governance system and practices, and build capacity at woreda level. The objective has been to put in
place a critical system to support basic services that is both financially and institutionally sustainable.
In fact, the Sub-Program B of PBS-3 aims at achieving this objective. A brief discussion follows on
the progress made towards institutional sustainability at woreda level.
189. The PFM has become a deep-rooted, matured system, with several institutional strengthening
measures such as roll out of IBEX in most of the woredas; streamlining of internal and external audit
systems; organising PFM team; and engagement of channel one coordinator in every region.
However, lack of professionals and trained staff especially for procurement, and high staff turnover

undermine the system’s capability for better management of public funds. The new PFM project is
expected to continue with PFM reforms and address many such issues.
190. FTA activities have been largely institutionalised through development and dissemination of
guidelines and templates. Though it may take more time, efforts to impart budget literacy training
would slowly bring about the kind of awareness required to make FTA effective. However, it is less
likely that FTA activities at current level will be sustained in the absence of any program support. A
great deal of leadership by BoFED/WoFED is required to sustain the on-going institutionalisation
process. Their capacity needs to be developed.
191. The grievance redress mechanisms are already in place and functional except in Afar. Given the
government’s political commitment to introduce GRMs through out the country, there is no serious
sustainability risk. However, it is imperative to develop and implement a separate nationwide strategic
plan and program to scale up and improve GRM services.
192. Turning to social accountability, the big challenge is how to institutionalise social accountability
interventions. At present, social accountability activities are driven by SAIP, the initiatives are sector
specific, and the pilots are trying to develop a new institutional mechanism to mobilise citizens
around service delivery. Mooted question is whether social accountability activities will be sustained
without program support. The present evaluation feels that from the point of view of sustainability, a
good starting point under ESAP-2 would have been to first activate and train the existing CBOs (e.g.
parent teachers association) for social accountability activities. Also, more emphasis could have been
given to involve local administration and political representatives for spearheading the SA movement.
193. A critical element to support basic service delivery is to establish a structure for results based
management. It is imperative therefore to strengthen MIS in basic sectors. This is what MfoR has
been pursuing with the sector ministries. Good progress has been made with the education and health
sectors and work is in progress in the other sectors.
194. In sum, the PBS program has made significant strides towards institutionalising public financial
management, citizen engagement, and grievance redress mechanisms. However, more reforms are
still required, especially for institutionalisation of social accountability initiatives.

8.3       Summary

                                             Impacts and sustainability
      Impact of block grant spending on sector outcomes (PSIA study): This impact study reveals that
      woreda-level spending on education, health, and agriculture has been effective in achieving key sector
      outcomes. It also claims that benefits of the woreda-level spending have also percolated to all income
      levels, and per capita expenditure favoured historically disadvantaged regions and ethnic groups.
      Progress towards achieving MDGs: The progress towards achieving MDGs has been satisfactory
      except for Goal 5 (improving maternal health), which has remained completely off the track. It may be
      reasonable to say that the PBS program with its support for expansion of basis services has contributed
      in this progress.
      Unintended or negative impact: The present evaluation has not found any specific reference or proven
      records of any unintended or negative impacts of the PBS program, except the alleged link of the
      program with human right abuses in Gambella. This allegation was not found true, but it has put the
      Bank’s reputation at risk, and heightened the international scrutiny of PBS-3.
      Sustainability of basic services: The medium term projection (2015-16 to 2019-20) shows that if the
      current fiscal conditions continue, basic services to the growing population would be possible only with
      the donors’ funding support of USD 150-200 million per year.
      The PBS program has made significant strides towards institutional sustainability but more needs to be done,
      especially for institutionalisation of social accountability intiatives.

Chapter 9: Lessons Learned and Recommendations

This concluding chapter presents a number of lessons learned from the PBS experience, and makes a
few recommendations.

9.1     Lessons Learned
195. The present evaluation draws a few lessons from the PBS experience as summarised in the
discussion that follows.
196. Decentralised service delivery supported through IGFT is an effective development model
to reduce poverty and achieve other MDGs. Ethiopia’s decentralised service delivery through
intergovernmental fiscal transfers (block grants) to sub-national governments (regions/woredas) has
been effective in making progress towards poverty reduction and achieving other MDGs. However,
the progress has not been even across the regions, as well as across the income/wealth quintiles.
Going forward, the development efforts need to be strengthened to promote equitable service
delivery. This is what ESPES aims to achieve using PforR instrument.
197. The PBS program through its partnership and pooled-fund approach offers an effective
alternative to general budget support system. The PBS program was originally designed as a
response to post-2005 election crisis that resulted in suspension of GBS by some DPs. Over the years
it evolved as a successful alternative to GBS, showcasing high degree of aid effectiveness, and with
great potential to adopt PforR instrument.
198. Citizen engagement activities promote direct accountability of the service providers, and
improve service delivery. The PBS program has extensively relied on FTA, social accountability,
and GRM activities to create space for citizen engagement with local administration and service
providers. The evidence is growing to show that such citizen engagement has tremendous potential to
improve service delivery in all the basic service sectors.
199. Use of the country systems has been crucial for gaining the government’s ownership of the
program. The PBS has made extensive use of the government’s treasury system for transfers of block
grants and other program funds (excluding direct transfer of funds to the management agency). Also,
the program has relied on administrative database and M&E systems for monitoring results. Such
alignment of the program with the existing country systems has led to greater ownership of the
program by the government.
200. A dedicated resource allocation by DPs to set up a PBS secretariat is an essential step
forward to achieve donors’ coordination and harmonization. In a multi-donors set up, role of a
donors’ secretariat hardly needs to be emphasised. The evidence shows that the PBS secretariat has
provided a wide range of services to support program implementation as well as to achieve donors’
coordination and harmonization.
201. Pilots should be undertaken with a perspective plan on how the experience and results of
pilots will be scaled up to a national level. The experience and learning of LIG pilot under PBS-1&2
was not utilised to improve woreda level investments and capacity building. Similarly, social
accountability activities have been piloted in over 25 per cent woreda in the country, but a concrete
blueprint is still missing for institutionalization of the citizen’s engagement in local administration of
basic service delivery. There should be an end-game plan for any pilot project.
202. Decentralised basic service delivery is a complex process, and it must be supported by
deep-rooted institutional reforms at sub-national level. The PBS experience suggests that for
effective delivery of basic services, the local governance system (FTA, SA, GRMs) should be capable
and robust, which can be achieved only through long-term institutional reforms. Both PSCAP and
PBS have pursued the goal of good governance at sub-national levels. But, despite improvements over
the years, there are inherent challenges (e.g. inadequate resource generation, high staff turnover, PFM
weaknesses) that still impede service delivery. It is quite evident that a program like PBS alone cannot
address all the governance and service delivery issues at woreda/kebele levels. The current thinking of
launching a separate PFM project seems to be a move in the right direction.
203. Failure to assess environmental and social risks may put the program at reputational risk.
The Bank’s Investigation Panel observed that the PBS-3 appraisal and supervision did not pay
adequate attention to mitigate the potential risks arising from geographical and sector overlap of the
PBS program and CDP. Although the PBS program was not found to cause harms in Gambella, the
program came under heavy international scrutiny.

9.2        Recommendations
9.2.1      Focusing on education, health, and agriculture sectors where program impacts are more
204. Given that PBS support for block grants finances only recurrent expenditure, the sectors that
require more recurrent expenditure have been benefited by the program. These sectors are education,
health, and agriculture extension services. The capital-intensive sectors like road and water sectors
have not really benefited from the PBS program. It is recommended that the PBS program focus only
on education, health, and agriculture sectors, and avoid thinly spreading resources and programmatic
efforts for the road and water sectors that basically need funding support for capital investment and
operating expenditure.
9.2.2      Setting up a high-level steering committee for strategic discussion and decision making
205. As mentioned in this report, the semi-annual JRIS forum has not been designed to push high-
level strategic discussion on issues such as regional inequities; gender mainstreaming; resource
mobilisation; and institutionalisation of citizen engagement. In view of this, GoE and donors may like
to set up a high-level program steering committee (PSC) involving concerned line Ministers, senior
government officials, and DPs. Actual structure and functional modality needs to be elaborated once
the stakeholders agree to set up a PSC. Given the strategic nature, PSC discussion needs to reflect on
diagnostic data (e.g. disaggregated gender data published by CSA), findings of the analytical studies,
emerging evidence from field mission, etc.
9.2.3      Strengthening donors’ harmonization
206. Harmonization framework: The present evaluation proposes a basic framework of donors’
harmonization, which needs to be elaborated further in consultation with the DPs (Table 9.1).
207. At the sector level (Level-1), harmonization will involve developing a single integrated plan and
budget for the entire sector, including all DP funded activities/programs. This is currently followed in
the health sector based on HSDP harmonization manual, and it may be adopted in the other basic
sectors too118. The “one plan, and one budget” approach has advantage of eliminating duplication of
efforts and sub-optimal use of resources.
208. The expected results of the sector plan and budget allocations needs to be laid down in a common
results framework, which can be tracked jointly by the line Ministry and the DPs. At present, DPs
track their individual results framework. This is a duplication of efforts and may be avoided.
209. It is further proposed that instead of having separate joint review missions by each DP, efforts
should be made to have a single, combined JRM for the sector program, which will reduce burden of
the line ministry and reduce transaction costs. The line Ministry and DPs will be jointly responsible
for implementation of the single, harmonized plan. It would be useful to bind them through a
memorandum of understanding (MoU) that describes the mutual roles and responsibilities of the
signatory partners.

210. At the national level (Level-2), harmonization will involve synchronization of multi-sector
programs with the same or complementary types of interventions so as to gain from synergies of the
programs supported by different DPs. To illustrate the point, reference could be made to AfDB’s
newly proposed program called basic services transformation program (Jan 2016 to December 2018),
which consists of two components viz. (a) enhancing quality and equity in basic services; and (b)
strengthening accountability, transparency and citizen’s engagement. Clearly, BSTP resembles
ESPES/PBS-3. In such case, the purpose of harmonization will be to ensure that both the programs
complement each other, and the activities are not duplicated. For instance, in promoting citizen
engagement through FTA, SA, and GRMs, the AfDB’s program can use the tools, formats, and
guidelines already developed and implemented under the PBS program. Similarly, the program
implementation areas (woredas/kebeles) may be divided in such a way that the combined coverage of
PBS-3 and BSTP is maximised. To achieve this kind of program synchronisation, it is imperative to
develop a common strategy and work plan.

                            and coordinate with DPs          per ToR (refer to Table 9.2)
                            This has already been done.
                            The PBS secretariat has been
                            reconstituted as SDS with a
                            set of objectives & activities
                            that inter alia would lead to
                            better donors’ harmonization.

211. Objectives and staffing structure SDS: The PBS secretariat has been reconstituted as SDS with
effect from July 2015, which is now entrusted with the responsibility of donors’ harmonization. It is
proposed that SDS focus on four strategic objectives (Table 9.2): (i) coordination and harmonization
of the DPs; (ii) results management (M&E); (iii) supporting risk management and application of
environment and social safeguards; and (iv) communication and knowledge management.
212. Given the four strategic objectives of ToR, SDS must have the required technical skill sets. It is
proposed that SDS ensures service of the following experts: (i) economist; (ii) PFM specialists; (iii)
safeguard specialist; (iv) M&E expert; and (v) knowledge and communication expert. The services of
these experts may be availed through full-term or short-term consultants. DPs may decide the actual
mix keeping in view the budget allocations.

                                              − Sending common messages in public interest; etc.
                                        •   Develop a web-based repository of knowledge products (e.g. reports,
                                            studies, success stories, best practices) for easy public access
                                        •   Develop a web-based forum for sharing knowledge products, as well
                                            as for independent exchange of views among various stakeholders

9.2.4    Benchmarking service delivery
213. In the context of quality service delivery, there is no escape from benchmarking the basic service
delivery at woreda and the service provider levels. The findings of the field mission undertaken in this
study has revealed that the regions have willingness and some experience of assessing service
delivery at woreda level. The field mission has also observed that the sector bureaus in some of the
woredas are tracking and grading the service providers. All these are encouraging trends and should
be supported.
214. It is recommended that the regions and woredas be encouraged to introduce appropriate system
for results based performance management (RBPM). MoFED may take the initiative to develop
guidelines, tools, and templates for RBPM in consultation with the regions/woredas. It would be also
necessary to conduct training programs for the BoFED and the sector bureau staff on how to use the
templates of RBPM.

215. In addition to above, it would be extremely useful to document best practices on service delivery
and use of service standards, and share them with the regions, woredas, and sectors.
9.2.5    Conducting beneficiary survey
216. Beneficiary feedback is an important input to improve service delivery and must be tracked
periodically. This is a missing link in the program management and evaluation system of the PBS
program. The present evaluation strongly recommends introduction of yearly beneficiary survey as an
integral part of the program’s M&E system. Each region should undertake beneficiary survey using
standard tools, and the regional results should be integrated to get a national perspective.
9.2.6    Regions to check five per cent administrative data related to basic services
217. It is almost a truism in every developing country that the database forming the administrative
MIS is not adequately checked for accuracy and data validation. This makes it imperative to conduct a
minimum level data check before using official data for assessing progress against results indicators.
It is recommended that each region undertake a 5 per cent check of the sector data based on a sample
of two to three woredas. CSA may provide technical support to the regions. The process may continue
with rotation of sample woredas for strengthening the MIS system.
9.2.7    Expediting the study on service cost estimation and resource mobilisation
218. The medium term projections undertaken in this study shows that the government would require
donors funding support to meet fiscal deficits if basic services are to be scaled up to serve the growing
population. This means that federal and regional governments are urgently required to estimate costs
of basic services, and the resources required to meet the costs. The federal/regional governments are
also required to look for means and ways to augment resource generation. This is a long overdue
exercise, and any further delay in completing this exercise would be detrimental to fiscal
sustainability of basic services.
9.2.8    Institutionalization of social accountability activities
219. Pending the development of a concrete plan for institutionalization of social accountability, the
present evaluation would like to make a few suggestions as follows.
     •   It is recommended that the regions launch sustained campaign to encourage the citizens to
         demand their rights for basic services and seek accountability of the service providers. Such
         campaign should be steered by the elected council members and local administrators at the
         regional, woreda, and kebele levels. The involvement of council members and administrators
         would instill confidence among the citizens about the government’s commitment to ensure
         transparency and social accountability.
     •   Simultaneously, the council members, the government officials, and the service providers
         need to be sensitized to respect the citizens’ right to demand basic services, and reminded of
         their duties and obligations to meet the citizens’ demand. They are also required to learn
         various social accountability process and tools.
     •   The social accountability process also needs to be embedded in the exiting community based
         organisations (CBOs), such as parent teacher associations at school level, health boards,
         water committees, and community participation in rural road construction. The CBO
         members need to be trained on SA process and tools
220. It is also recommended that ESAP be harmonised with similar kinds of projects or programs
funded by other DPs. For instance, United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is
in the process of designing a flagship program titled strengthening participation and accountability
for community engagement (SPACE) leveraging on the momentum created by ESAP-2. So, it
provides a good opportunity to pull resources and develop a joint program.

 Title:      Process Evaluation: Promoting Basic Services Phase 3 (PBS 3) Program in Ethiopia

1. INTRODUCTION & BACKGROUND
Introduction
1.1 On behalf of the Government of Ethiopia and donors to the Promoting Basic Services (PBS)
    Program the PBS Secretariat wishes to commission evaluation specialists (the “Evaluation
    Provider”) to design and implement an independent process evaluation of the Promoting
    Basic Services Phase 3 Program (PBS 3) in Ethiopia.
1.2 This evaluation is part of the PBS 3 Core Evaluation series comprising of four components:
a)        Process Evaluation: To provide an independent assessment of the performance of the PBS
          program including identification of strengths and weaknesses which will lead to
          recommendations for improvements to the current phase and any possible successor program
b)        Demand Side Service Utilization Study: A quantitative analysis on service utilization using
          Benefit Incidence Analysis (BIA) will be employed to assess service utilization by
          households, disaggregated by socio-economic status (SES), rural/urban location, gender, and
          other socioeconomic characteristics such as elderly, squatters, vulnerable children, disabled,
          etc.
c)        Beneficiary Incidence Analysis: A qualitative (participatory) assessment to identify the
          percentage of people responding positively on whether their views are incorporated during the
          design/planning phase of service delivery program (Perception survey results).
d)        Consolidated Core Evaluation Report: Drawing on overall evaluative evidence from core
          evaluation and other analytical products.
1.3 This process evaluation will focus on the policy and operational effectiveness of PBS 3119. PBS 3
    plans a total of two process evaluations during the course of the program. These Terms of
    Reference cover the first evaluation only. The evaluation will draw on available evidence and
    data, including other evaluative and analytical studies concerning the program’s effectiveness and
    impact e.g. Poverty and Social Impact Analysis, Beneficiary Impact Assessment Study, DfID
    Value for Money Study.
      Background
1.4 Since 2006, the Protection of Basic Services (PBS) program has supported the delivery of five
    basic services across Ethiopia: health, education, water and sanitation, agriculture, and (starting in
    2009) rural roads. Simultaneously, the program also promotes stronger citizen engagement and
    improved accountability through local civil society organizations. Based on a strong partnership
    between Ethiopia’s major donor agencies and its federal, regional, and district-level
    administrations, the program’s support has been essential to achieving several of the MDGs in
    Ethiopia.

   Definition used for this assignment: Process Evaluation assesses and explains the particular program
operations and processes. It can be used throughout the life of a program, from start-up to maturity, and
whenever program operations change thereby requiring adjustments of the program. During program start-up,
process evaluation is used to monitor initial program implementation so that bottlenecks can be addressed
speedily and good practice can be documented for future applications. After program stabilizes and matures, a
process evaluation can be used to provide ongoing feedback to management. Unlike impact evaluation, process
evaluation cannot establish causality with a known margin of error. Process evaluation can only uncover
plausible reasons why a program is working or not.

                                                                                                          56
1.5 PBS 3 has now been effective since December 2012. It continues to support the promotion of
    better services in Ethiopia, including ensuring sustained and further gains in access paired with an
    increased focus on quality of services. The program now comprises two sub-programs:
        o      Sub-program A: Basic Service Block Grants (USD 6.2 billion). This sub-program l
               finances recurrent (salaries, operations and maintenance) expenditures in the five basic
               service sectors (education, health, agriculture, water and sanitation, and rural roads) at
               local levels. The Basic Service Block Grants are disbursed from the federal level to the
               regions, and from the regions to the woredas. They are discretionary at the sub-national
               level, i.e. each woreda decides the allocation of the grants to the five basic service sectors
               based on the needs in their woreda.
        o      Sub-program B: Strengthening Local Accountability and Transparency Systems (USD
               114.6 million). While the country’s decentralized, integrated system of fiduciary,
               administrative and information governance is robust, the Government and Development
               Partners recognize that it can and should continue to be strengthened, particularly in its
               implementation in the large number of very diverse woreda administrations throughout
               Ethiopia. Sub-program B will seek to maintain and strengthen these systems, with a
               strategic focus on the woreda-level as the front-line of administration with responsibility
               for PBS objectives. The sub-program includes three interrelated components: (B1)
               Citizen’s Engagement, (B2) Local Public Financial Management, and (B3) Managing for
               Results.
1.6 With strong government ownership (and financing) and effective coordination and harmonization
    of donor support, the PBS program has contributed to impressive development results. Examples
    include:
    •       a reduction in the under-5 mortality rate from 123 per thousand in 2005 to 88 per thousand in
            2010;
    •       a dramatic increase in school net and gross enrolment rates; and
    •       improvement in the share of the rural population with access to clean water from 35 per cent
            in 2004/05 to more than 60 per cent in 2009/10.
1.7 To track progress towards common objectives and agreements, the program is based on a set of
    interrelated "Core PBS Principles". These core principles derive from Government commitments
    reflected in its Constitution, its current Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP), as well as
    sectoral and multi-sectoral plans. These Core Principles provide an important backdrop to
    understanding the scope of the process evaluation and include:
    •       Effectiveness: The Effectiveness principle focuses on how to maintain effective service
            delivery with a view to identifying ways to further improve them. Although effectiveness is
            influenced by a broad range of issues, the PBS program considers adequate sectoral resource
            allocation, balanced intra-sectoral allocation, and results achieved as it reviews the
            Effectiveness
    •       Sustainability. The PBS program seeks to ensure that financing of basic services can be
            sustained over the long-term even without the PBS Program. When reviewing sustainability,
            the PBS program considers financing sources for decentralized basic services, and the unit
            costs of basic service delivery.
    •       Additionality. The Additionality Principle ensures that government priority to the MDGs are
            expressed in medium-term commitments to increase overall financing for the federal block
            grants and hence to basic service at sub-national level and that allocated resources for basic
            services are flowing in a predictable manner.
    •       Fairness. The Fairness Principle ensures that resource allocations from the federal
            government to the regions and from regional governments to woredas are rules-based and


Process Evaluation of PBS-3, Final Report: Annex-1
                                                                                                          57
            transparent, and that block grant disbursements to the regions as well as from regions to
            woredas are executed as planned in budget allocations
        •   Equity. To review the Equity Principle, PBS will track and assess any discrepancies in access
            to basic services among the different regions and woredas and between genders, with a view
            to identifying possible interventions to address these discrepancies
        •   Transparency. A core principle of the PBS program's contribution to the access and quality
            of basic services is to provide stakeholders with more information about resource flows,
            standards and results.
        •   Fiduciary Probity. The PBS program relies on a robust fiduciary system reaching from the
            federal level through regions to local administrations. It involves numerous mechanisms to
            maintain the strength of that system.
        •   Predictability. The predictability principle seeks to ensure mutual accountability by
            predictable resource flows for basic service delivery results. Development Partner
            contributions need to be based on longer-term commitments, so that agreed disbursements can
            be made on time. Likewise, the Government has a responsibility to accurately reflect these
            DP contributions
 1.8 Aid effectiveness has been a hallmark of the PBS program since its inception. By way of its
     multi-dimensional approach, the program uses country systems while supporting systems-
     strengthening in the areas of monitoring & evaluation and public financial management. Through
     the PBS Secretariat, the program has dedicated human and financial resources to ensure donor
     coordination and harmonization resulting in improved joint oversight, more effective dialogue,
     and reduced transaction costs for all parties.
 1.9 As PBS 3 approaches its Mid Term Review and looks towards the emergence of a possible
     successor program, this evaluation will be important to informing ongoing implementation, and
     future program design aspects.
 1.10     A full description of the program is available in the World Bank’s Project Appraisal
     Document available at http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2012/08/16711203/ethiopia-
     third-phase-promoting-basic-services-project.

 2. PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES
 Purpose
2.1     The main purpose of the process evaluation will be to provide an independent assessment of the
        performance of the PBS program including identification of strengths and weaknesses. The
        evaluation will focus on the interaction between policy and operational effectiveness.
        Information generated by this evaluation will be important to (i) provide feedback to enhance
        ongoing program implementation (ii) enhance program accountability and (3) inform decision
        making amongst government and development partners in future program design and resource
        allocation.
2.2     The specific objectives of the evaluation are to (i) review the performance of the project across
        the dimensions of relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, impact, sustainability and coherence (ii)
        provide recommendations on future improvements for program design.
2.3     In assessing the performance of the program the evaluation will consider the following
        dimensions, based on the OECD DAC Criteria for Evaluating Development Assistance120 :
        a. To evaluate the relevance of PBS 3 in the following context:

 Process Evaluation of PBS-3, Final Report: Annex-1
                                                                                                      58
           •     To what extent are the objectives of the program still valid? How appropriate is PBS 3 in
                 view of the political, economic and social context in Ethiopia?
           •     Are the activities and outputs of the program consistent with the overall goal and the
                 attainment of its objectives? How appropriate are the Core Principles of the program in this
                 regard?
      b.       To evaluate the effectiveness of PBS 3 in the following context:
       •         To what extent are program objectives likely to be achieved? This should have a particular
                 focus on operational and policy impacts of PBS, especially in the areas of equity and
                 fairness.
           •     What are the major factors influencing the achievement or non-achievement of the
                 objectives?
      c.       To evaluate the efficiency of PBS 3 in line with DFIDs Value for Money approach and in the
               following context:
           •     Have PBS 3 objectives been reached in a timely manner?
           •     Could the same results have been achieved with fewer resources? Could the same resources
                 have been used differently to achieve more results?
      d.       To evaluate the impact of PBS 3 in the following context:
        •        What has happened as a result of PBS 3 until the present stage of implementation?
      e.       To evaluate the sustainability of PBS 3 investments in the following context:
        •        To what extent has PBS helped to promote improved service delivery financing, also
                 differentiated by different revenue sources?
           •     To what extent has PBS 3 led to a better understanding of domestic resource mobilization
                 achievement and potential?
           •     To what extent has PBS 3 enhanced service delivery capacity at decentralized levels e.g.
                 through participation, empowerment, ownership, local resources are available and sustained
                 political support exists.
      f.       To evaluate the coherence of PBS 3 in following contexts:
           •     How does PBS 3 complement existing government strategies for service delivery in terms
                 of national planning and sectoral engagement?
           •     To what extent have development partners harmonized and aligned common efforts towards
                 PBS 3? In particular to examine the role of the PBS Secretariat in facilitating any such
                 actions.
 Constraints and Limitations:
2.4   A number of constraints should be noted when addressing the above objectives.
 •             The evaluation will draw on a rich foundation of available information and data. The
               evaluation will triangulate existing information and rely greatly on key informant discussions,
               rather than collecting or commissioning new data.
 •             The scope of certain objectives is narrowed given the particular nature of PBS 3. For example
               (i) the evaluation of impact is reduced given the challenges of attribution under the program
               e.g. national coverage, nature of recurrent expenditure. A range of analytical studies will help
               inform this objective. (ii) the evaluation of sustainability reflects specific work objectives set
               out during program implementation.
 •             Certain dimensions of analysis will have greater priority than others. The process evaluation
               fills knowledge gaps especially relating to relevance, effectiveness, sustainability and
               coherence.

3.3   It should be noted that in addition to this exercise, a follow up evaluation will be conducted
      during the calendar year 2017. The preference is for the same firm to undertake this evaluation.
      However the PBS Secretariat reserves the right to advertise for this work, particularly if the
      evaluation provider does meet performance expectations.

          4. METHODOLOGY
4.1   At the outset of the exercise the evaluation provider is expected to set out a work-plan with
      detailed methodology.
4.2   To produce the above deliverables and outputs the evaluation provider is expected to undertake
      certain tasks, including (but not limited to) the following:
 •    review existing project evaluations and studies undertaken in each of the components and the five
      basic service sectors



 Process Evaluation of PBS-3, Final Report: Annex-1
                                                                                                                          60
 •      collect and analyze both qualitative and quantitative information related to program; in particular
        materials generated under the Effectiveness, Equity and Sustainability reviews
 •      familiarize themselves with available supervision materials, mainly in the form of supervision
        mission reports and Aide Memoire’s from Joint Review and Implementation Support (JRIS)
        missions
 •      Participate in a JRIS mission as observers
 •      Undertake semi-structured individual interviews based on clear guidelines and check lists.
        Stakeholders interviewed will include key government and development partner stakeholders
        involved in PBS. These should include but not be limited to: ministers; relevant sector ministry
        staff at national, regional and district levels; academics; and private sector and civil society
        resource persons.
 •      Undertake group interviews / focus groups. Organisation of one or more thematic meetings or
        workshops with representatives of the different categories of stakeholders in order to collect the
        same type of information from different persons at the same time, to increase its validity and the
        overall understanding of the issue. Focus groups with members of private sector associations and
        other relevant sectors of civil society based on clear guidelines and check lists should be ensured.
 •      Share initial data analysis with relevant stakeholders through the organisation of a workshop so as
        to ensure completeness and correctness
 •      Others as suggested.
4.3     The evaluation provider should be aware that this stocktaking exercise will proceed in tandem
        with design and appraisal process for the next phase of the project by the World Bank. As such,
        the evaluation provider may be expected to share interim ideas and conclusions to help inform the
        ongoing design process.
4.4     As previously noted, the evaluation is expected to draw heavily from the regular monitoring data
        emerging from national and sector survey and administrative sources and parallel evaluations and
        studies. A range of additional studies are also ongoing which will increase the depth of the
        evidence base including a formal impact evaluation of the social accountability component.
4.5     A large part of the evaluation work, especially the work concerning PBS inputs and their effects
        on public policy processes and management is likely to be carried out in Addis Ababa. However
        in order to ensure a full local perspective and to substantiate findings via triangulation the
        evaluation provider will execute field visits at regional and woreda levels to consult with
        government officials, beneficiaries, civil society and private sector. .
4.6     The PBS Secretariat will work with the evaluation provider to compile relevant documentation
        and agree on appropriate stakeholders for interview. If the evaluation team is not permanently
        based in Ethiopia the team should make necessary arrangements for a visit to conduct the
        necessary interviews including with stakeholders based outside Addis Ababa.

            5. LEVEL OF EFFORT, SKILLS AND QUALIFICATIONS
 5.1.       The maximum total duration of the assignment is 170 working days, over no more than a
            four month time period. This time period includes preparation, travel, field visits, reporting,
            submission of comments and submission of final report. Two visits to Ethiopia will be
            required if the evaluation provider is based outside of the country.
 5.2.       It is expected that the evaluation provider will mobilize three senior experts (including team
            leader) and one junior expert. They are expected to work as follows: Expert 1 (50 days),
            Experts 2 and 3 (35 days) and Expert 4 (50 days).

          6. DUTY OF CARE
6.1   The evaluation provider is responsible for the safety and well-being of their personnel (as defined
      in Section 2 of the Contract) and third parties affected by their activities under this contract,
      including appropriate security arrangements. They will also be responsible for the provision of
      suitable security arrangements for their domestic and business property. All duty of care,
      transport, translation and logistical support, office space, and insurances will be the responsibility
      of the evaluation provider.
6.2   DFID will share available information with the supplier on security status and developments in-
      country where appropriate. DFID will provide the Duty of Care risk assessment matrix for Addis
      Ababa.
6.3   All evaluation provider personnel will be offered a security briefing by the British Embassy/DFID
      on arrival. All such personnel must register with their respective embassies to ensure that they are
      included in emergency procedures. A copy of the DFID visitor notes will be provided (and a
      further copy each time these are updated), which the supplier may use to brief their personnel on
      arrival.
6.4   In addition, all members of the evaluation team will take the security briefing from the UN
      Department of Security Services (UNDSS) before travelling outside of Addis Ababa.
6.5   The evaluation provider is responsible for ensuring appropriate safety and security briefings for
      all of their personnel working under this contract and ensuring that their personnel register and
      receive briefing as outlined above. Travel advice is also available on the FCO website and the
      evaluation provider must ensure they (and their personnel) are up to date with the latest position.
6.6   The evaluation provider is responsible for ensuring that appropriate arrangements, processes and
      procedures are in place for their personnel.
6.7   If the evaluation provider is unwilling or unable to accept responsibility for Security and Duty of
      Care as detailed above, bids will be viewed as non-compliant and excluded from further
      evaluation.
6.8   Acceptance of responsibility must be supported with evidence of capability and DFID reserves
      the right to clarify any aspect of this evidence. In providing evidence evaluation providers should
      consider the following questions:
          a) Have you completed an initial assessment of potential risks that demonstrates your
          knowledge and understanding, and are you satisfied that you understand the risk management
          implications (not solely relying on information provided by DFID)?
          b) Have you prepared an outline plan that you consider appropriate to manage these risks at
          this stage (or will you do so if you are awarded the contract) and are you
          confident/comfortable that you can implement this effectively?
          c) Have you ensured or will you ensure that your staff are appropriately trained (including
          specialist training where required) before they are deployed and will you ensure that on-going
          training is provided where necessary?
          d) Do you have an appropriate mechanism in place to monitor risk on a live / on-going basis
          (or will you put one in place if you are awarded the contract)?
          e) Have you ensured or will you ensure that your staff are provided with and have access to

 Process Evaluation of PBS-3, Final Report: Annex-1
                                                                                                         63
        suitable equipment and will you ensure that this is reviewed and provided on an on-going
        basis?
        f) Do you have appropriate systems in place to manage an emergency / incident if one arises?

        7. LOGISTICS AND PROCEDURES
 7.1 The evaluation provider will not be required to deploy on a permanent basis. The evaluation
     work-plan should detail how long the provider will be in Ethiopia.
 7.2 All evaluation team members are expected to commence their assignment at the same time.
 7.3 The evaluation providers are asked to provide details on the ethical issue they expect to face
     (including potential risks to interviewees) and mitigating measures that they will apply to this
     task, in particular the issue of engaging with children and young people.
 7.4 Inception, work planning and review meetings with PBS Secretariat staff and the Evaluation
     Steering Group will take place as required to ensure that the evaluation team has all the
     necessary advice and guidance to ensure that the Government of Ethiopia and Development
     Partners as customers for this work are satisfied with the various measures in place.
 7.5 Opportunities and timescales for commenting on a quality assurance of study outputs will all be
     agreed at the outset.

        8.       GOVERNANCE, REPORTING & CONTRACTING ARRANGEMENTS
 8.1    The evaluation provider will be accountable to an Evaluation Steering Group (ESG), led by
        the PBS Coordinator – Task Team Leader (TTL) for this exercise. The steering group should
        include members of the Government of Ethiopia, Donor Partners and the PBS Secretariat.
 8.2    The target audience for the evaluation reports will be this Steering Group in the first instance,
        but a wide range of other interested stakeholders thereafter. These are likely to include both
        Ethiopian and international interest groups, civil society groups, academics and donors. The
        evaluation team will need to ensure that results are accessible to all these groups. In particular,
        users of basic services will be both part of the process of monitoring and evaluating, and key
        audiences in terms of sharing final analyses.
 8.3    The terms of reference for the ESG will be developed before the final contract is signed.
 8.4    The ESG, through the PBS Secretariat structure, will facilitate the provision of documents for
        the evaluation provider’s work.
 8.5    Each deliverable will be reviewed and quality assured by peers, experts and government
        counterparts.
 8.6    Evaluation providers must ensure that they behave in an ethical manner. In particular,
        suppliers must not ask local operators to enter into an exclusivity agreement.
 8.7    Financial disbursements will be made upon satisfactory completion of agreed activities within
        the evaluation work-plan and framework.
 8.8    It is essential that the evaluation report be presented in Ethiopia to government, development
        partners and other core PBS stakeholders. It is envisaged that the Joint Review and
        Implementation Support (JRIS) mission will be a key mechanism for dissemination of the key
        findings but the evaluation provider should also consider alternative mechanisms of
        disseminating relevant information to the full range of relevant stakeholders. In this
        connection, evaluation provider will prepare a dissemination strategy.
 8.9    English will be the language of all correspondence, reports and presentations.

Annex-4: Progress Towards Equitable Services in Education and Health

This annex presents an assessment of progress made towards achieving equitable services in primary
education, and maternal and child health care services.

A. Primary Education
Regional level inequity: The regional data on NER, GPI, PTR, and proportion of qualified teachers
as of 2013-14 reveal that some regions are lagging behind the others. For instance, NER (Grade 1-8)
is less than 85 per cent in Afar, Dire Dawa, and Bennishangul-Gumuz (Figure 1). Similarly, primary
schools in Somali, Oromiya, and SNNPR are having PTR higher than the norm of 50 students per
teacher. In the same vein, the proportion of qualified teacher at Grade 1-4 is less than 50 per cent in
Afar, SNNPR, and Somali. So, for improving equitable primary education, specific interventions
would be necessary in the aforesaid regions.

Inequity across wealth quintiles: EDHS provides estimates of net attendance ratio (NAR) of
primary school-age children (7 to 12 years) across wealth quintiles of the households. A close scrutiny
of EDHS data reveals significant variations in NAR across the wealth quintals. The gap in NAR
between poorest and richest wealth quintiles was 43 per cent points in 2005, reduced to 32 per cent
points in 2011, and stayed around that level in 2014 (Figure 2).
Similar kind of wealth disparities in respect of other critical indicators of primary education (e.g. drop
out rate, completion rate) is likely to exist. It is imperative therefore to conduct periodic household

B. Primary Health Care
Regional level inequity: This evaluation has assessed regional inequity in terms of select indicators
viz., population per health post, per health centres, and deliveries by skilled providers. The findings
are follows.
Population-to-health post ratio is higher than the standard (5000 populations per health post) in Dire
Dawa, Tigray, Harari, and Amhara, indicating shortage of primary health facilities (Figure 3). These
regions plus SNNPR and Somali also have shortage of health centres vis-à-vis the standard (25,000
populations per health centre). Contrary to common belief, the emerging regions seem to have
adequate health posts and health centres relative to population size. Turning to deliveries, Dire Dawa
has highest proportion of deliveries assisted by skilled professionals (58 per cent) followed by Harari
(40 per cent). SBA deliveries are much lower in the remaining regions and least in Afar (7 per cent).

Inequity across wealth quintiles: Like in many developing countries, coverage of maternal and child
health services are higher in the richest quintile compared to the poor quintiles. For instance, the gap
in ANC coverage between women in the poorest and in the richest wealth quintiles was 45 per cent
points in 2005, increased to 58 per cent points in 2011, and then marginally reduced to 51 per cent
points in 2014 (Table 1). Similarly, gap in delivery by skilled providers in the poorest and richest
wealth quintiles increased from 26 per cent point in 2005 to 50 per cent points in 2014. The poor-rich
gap in Penta-3 coverage also increased from 22 per cent points in 2005 to 36 per cent points in 2011.
On the whole, inequity in maternal and child service coverage has increased over the years.

In conclusion, the analysis of secondary data clearly shows that despite progress in primary education
and primary health care services, regional level inequities still exist at significant level. Inequities
between poorest and richest wealth quintiles are also pronounced in these two sectors. It is in this
context, the World Bank’s new program ESPES aims to ensure that the whole population benefit from
basic services, particularly the bottom 20 per cent of income groups and most poorly performing
woredas.

Annex-6: Progress Towards Achieving MDGs

The present evaluation has tracked progress towards MDGs (Goals 1 to 5) using counterfactual
analysis and based on latest available data. The findings are summarised in this annex.
Eradication of extreme poverty and hunger (Goal 1): The proportion of population below the
poverty line declined sharply from 44.2 per cent in 1999-00 to 27.8 per cent in 2011-12 (Figure 1-A).
This represents a whopping reduction by 17.7 per cent points over a period of one-and-a-half decade.
A further reduction by 3.8 per cent points would enable the country achieve MDG target of 24 per
cent. Given that inflation is now contained to single digit, the MDG target has possibly been achieved
by this time. However, it should be borne in mind that even if poverty reduction touches 24 per cent
that would mean 22 million population still remaining below the poverty line.

The food poverty or hunger, as measured by proportion of underweight children (under 5 year), has
also declined from 47.2 per cent in 2000 to 28.7 per cent in 2011-12 (Figure 1-B). If the trend
continues, it is quite likely that MDG target of 22.7 per cent underweight children will be achieved in
2015. On the whole, Ethiopia is on track to achieve MDG targets of poverty and hunger reduction.
Universal education (Goal 2): NER increased sharply from 52.2 per cent in 2001-02 to 85.4 in 2011-
12 and continued almost at the same level, and then rose to 92.6 per cent in 2013-14 (Figure 2-A). It
is quite likely that NER will reach quite close to MDG target of 100 per cent.

While NER is on track, there are two caveats to note. First, NER at first cycle (Grade 1-4) always
remained significantly higher than NER at second cycle (Grade 5-8). The gap was 35.4 per cent points
in 2005-06, and it increased to 58.4 per cent points in 2013-14 (Figure 2-B). The consistently lower
NER at second cycle reflects dropouts before reaching the second cycle. Another disturbing trend is
the persisting difference between GER and NER. At first cycle, difference was as high as 44.6 per

cent points in 2005-06, indicating enrolment of many children at higher age compared to normal
schooling age of 7 years. The difference has been reduced since then but it still stood high at 29.0 per
cent point in 2013-14 suggesting that enrolment of over aged children had continued.
Children from poorer backgrounds tend to enroll later, make slower progress, and are more likely to
drop out without completing the schooling121. Absenteeism and drop-out among boys is often higher
than for girls and are largely due to their involvement in unpaid domestic and agriculture works,
whereas for girls these are mainly the result of a need to look after younger siblings and the direct cost
of schooling (such as school uniforms, exercise books, pens and pencils, parental contributions
towards school improvement activities, etc.)122.
Another MDG indicator to measure universal education is the primary completion rate. The progress
of this indicator over the years has been completely off the track. The completion rate at Grade 5
increased from 42 per cent in 2001-02 to 76.1 per cent in 2012-13 and then fell to 69.5 per cent in the
following year (Figure 3-A). The completion rate at Grade 8 had been even lower. The proportion of
children completing Grade 8 increased from a low base of 18.7 per cent in 2001-02 to 52.8 per cent in
2012-13 and then declined to 46.7 per cent in 2013-14 (Figure 3-B). Though the reasons for dip in
completion rates both at Grade 5 and Grade 8 are not known, it is evident that achievement in NER
has been compromised by faltering progress in primary completion rate.
Gender equity in primary education (Goal 3)123: For Grade 1-8, GPI improved significantly from
0.85 in 2005-06 to 0.93 in 2013-14 (Figure 4). Though the progression is on track, achieving MDG
target value of unity in 2015 is less likely124.

    Goal 3 also includes achieving gender equity in secondary education and participation of women in the
parliament. In the context of this study, these aspects have not been analyzed in this section.
124
    It may be mentioned here that gender disparities widens at secondary and tertiary levels as compared to
primary level education. Early marriages, especially among children from rural and poor households, tend to
inhibit educational progression among girls from primary to secondary level.

Reduction in child mortality (Goal 4): Ethiopia reduced U5MR to 64 per 1000 live births in 2013,
and thereby achieved Goal 4 two years ahead of the deadline125 . However, reduction of Infant
Mortality Rate (IMR) remained slightly off-track in 2011 and the country is less likely to achieve
MDG target of 31 per 1000 live births (Figure 5-A). Furthermore, death of new-born continues to be a
major challenge. The new-born accounts for 40 per cent of under-five deaths in the country126.

Improving maternal health (Goal 5): At 871 deaths per 100,000 deliveries in 1990-91, Ethiopia was
one of the countries with the highest Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) in the developing world. MMR
declined to 871 in 2000-01, and to 673 in 2004-05 (Figure 6-A). A modest reversal in progress was
recorded during 2010-11 when MMR increased to 676 deaths per 100,000 live births. Given the huge
gap between 2011 figure and the MDG target value of 267 deaths per 100,000 live births, the progress
has been completely off the track. Most maternal deaths occur during delivery and post-delivery
period. This indicates that there are still significant obstacles in terms of access to and provision of
antenatal and obstetric health care services, especially in rural areas. In 2014, coverage of ANC from
a health professionals (which is another MDG indicator of maternal health) and proportion of births
attended by skilled health personnel was as low as 41.2 per cent (Figure 6-B) and 15.4 per cent
respectively127 .

In conclusion, the country made satisfactory progress in achieving MDGs except for improving
maternal health (Goal 5), which has remained completely off the track. It may be reasonable to say
that the PBS program with its support for expansion of basis services has contributed in this progress.
