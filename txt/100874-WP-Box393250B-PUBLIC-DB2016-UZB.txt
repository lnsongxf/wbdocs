THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business
2016: starting a business, dealing with construction
permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in the economy
profile.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2015 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

      The company must register with relevant local authority (khokimiyat),
      which can be done online at: https://my.gov.uz/ru/service/214 or in
      person.

      In case of electronic registration, the company founders must fill out
      the forms, scan and attach supporting documents, and send in
      electronic request to the government’s IT system.

      The following documents must be submitted:
      • standard application form;
      • two counterparts of the constitutive documents: the shareholders
      agreement and the charter (for LLC). Please note that the requirement
      to notarize the constitutive documents for the procedure of state
      registration has been eliminated in Uzbekistan for companies owned by
      domestic founders. Also note that domestic companies may be
      registered basing on the standard form of constitutive documents.
      • a bank receipt confirming payment of the state registration fee;
      • the proposed seal design prepared by a private company, approved at
      the first meeting of the company;
      • the unique login and password, confirming reservation of the
      company’s name in the centralized database.

      After the documents are received, an analyst must verify the documents                     UZS 118,400 (equal

      • certify the samples of company's seal and stamp;
      • register the LLC in the State Register of Legal Entities;
      • issue certificate on the state registration of the LLC.

      The registration process typically takes 48 hours. Upon issuing the
      company’s official registration certificate, the registering agency must
      grant an original charter and foundation agreement with a registration
      note on the title page, along with all registration documents and
      permits filed with the one-stop system.

      In case the local registering authority finds the documents submitted
      for registration unsatisfactory, it shall make a decision on refusal to
      register the LLC and submit such decision to the applicant within 3
      working hours of the time the documents were submitted for
      registration.

      After the LLC is registered, the local registering authority automatically
      provides the data on the registered LLC to the state statistics
      authorities, state tax authorities, and internal affairs agencies at place of
      location of the LLC.

        of approved materials)

        BuildCo applies to the Hokimiyat of Tashkent for the land
        allotment. In the application BuildCo must specify the purpose
        for which the land is required, its location and size, the
        approximate dates of commencement and completion of
        construction, details of a legal entity or an individual passport
        data.

        The Hokimiyat forwards the application to the Main Department
        of Architecture and Construction (Главное Управление
        Архитектуры и Строительства – GUAS) for consideration. Main
        Department of Architecture and Construction will send the head
        architect of the district where the warehouse is planned to
        conduct an on-site inspection. The head architect of the district
        will prepare a map of 1/2000 scale for the land plot. Once the            30 days              UZS 826,000

        map is prepared, GUAS establishes a land commission to
        consider the land allotment case. The land commission consists
        of different agencies including engineering communications,
        utilities and government agencies. The land commission gets
        together every week to examine the cases and approve the
        decision. By law, these approvals have to be obtained by the
        GUAS in a one-stop shop principle; however, in practice the
        building company obtains the approvals by itself.

        After the land allotment document is signed and approved by all
        members of the commission, the Hokimiyat has to send the
        application package to the Tashkent General Plan (Tashgenplan)
        for obtaining their approval. This is needed because Tashkent
        has a general plan and any new construction has to meet the
        zoning rules and architectural norms set by the General Plan.
        GenPlan will approve the land allotment application and send it
        back to GUAS, which will forward the application to the
        Hokimiyat. There is a separate commission at the Hokimiyat that

      According the the Government Resolution No. 150 from May
      2013, the cost for the land allotment is the following:

      1. Land selection - For the preparation and coordination of

        Submit application to Tashkent City Electrical Network and await
        technical conditions

        The customer submits an application for the electrical connection to the
        Tashkent City Electric Network Enterprise and waits for them to issue
        technical conditions. The technical conditions specify the point of
        connection and other technical arrangements. In this particular case, the
        segment of the cable, for which the customer is responsible, is identified.



        There is no online application. The application can be submitted in

        An external inspection by the Tashkent City Electrical Networks is
        necessary for the issuance of technical conditions, however presence of
        someone from the applicant’s party is not required.

      Obtain excavation permit from municipality

      If the connection passes through a road the electrical contractor obtains
      an excavation permit (ордер) at the Municipality for the Maintenance of
      the Tashkent City. They issue the permit where the time limit for
      finishing the works is specified. The permit should be brought to the City
      Road Inspection (ГАИ) for concurrence and to receive signs which could
      be put on the road while the works are in progress. If the works are not
3     finished in time and the road is not restored in time there is a fine which   7 calendar days     UZS 120,000

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in

economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
