THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

from 1 to 189 by the ease of doing business ranking.           Population: 17,289,111

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business
2016: starting a business, dealing with construction
permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in the economy
profile.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2015 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

       Registration of medium-sized and large-sized business entities is
       performed based on a “one-stop-shop” principle: all the registration
       documents should be submitted to one state authority, the
       Public/Population Service Centers:

       The relevant justice authority shall issue a certificate of state registration
       of a company not later than 1 day following the day of submission. If
       documents are filed online via electronic government portal the state
       registration shall be performed within 1 hour from the moment of
       documents submission. SMEs are exempted from payment of a
   1   registration fee as of January 1, 2015.                                           2 days        no charge

       The list of the required documents includes the following:
       1) a notification on commencement of entrepreneurial activity;
       2) copies of IDs; and
       3) power of attorney (if applicable).

       At the same time entrepreneurs need to obtain an electronic signature.
       An electronic signature can be obtained at public registration centers in
       2 days’ time. On the second day following the application for an e-
       signature entrepreneurs need to present themselves at the registration
       center for the identity check.

        BuildCo applies to the City Akimat to obtain the right on the
        specified land plot for constructing a warehouse. The Decision
        gives the right to design the project on the specified land.
        Government Resolution No. 237 dated 18 February 2012
        introduced amendments to the "Rules of issuance of baseline
        materials and data for designing of constructions". Government
   1    Resolution No. 237 came into force on 14 June 2012. According            10 days               no charge
        to the amended Rules, a customer who is willing to construct a
        building must obtain a decision of Akimat on issuance of a land
        plot for construction purposes. The amended Rules further
        provide that the term of consideration of an application to
        obtain such a decision is stipulated by the Land Code.

        Agency: Akimat of Almaty City



        Request and obtain architectural planning assignment (APZ)
        and technical conditions for utility connections

        To obtain an architectural-planning assignment, BuildCo must
        submit a business plan and project feasibility study to the city
        architecture department. The application must include any plans
        for construction, a description of the business activities to take
        place on site, and estimated utility hook-up and consumption
   2    requirements. In addition, BuildCo must submit a copy of the             10 days               no charge
        property title along with the plot document, approval of
        engineering-geological estimation of the plot, and company
        registration documents.

        The architectural planning assignment is a permit to develop a
        building plan/design/project. It includes some provisions and
        requirements that must be taken into account while developing
        the project and building.

      After obtaining the architectural planning assignment, BuildCo
      should develop a project (design) and must then obtain several
      agencies' approvals of the project in accordance with the
      architectural planning assignment and the applicable laws. Each
      of these agencies reviews the application documents and the
      project and may physically inspect the land.

      Government Resolution No. 1452 dated 16 November 2012
      amended the "Rules of issuance of baseline materials and data
      for designing of constructions" approved by the Resolution No.
      425 dated 6 May 2008. According to the amended rules, APZ
      and technical conditions are issued by the structural subdivisions
      of a relevant Akimat. In order to obtain APZ and Technical
      Conditions BuildCo will have to submit an application with the
      structural subdivision of Almaty Akimat which must be
      accompanied with (i) decision of Almaty Akimat to issue a land
      plot for construction purposes; (ii) assignment for construction
      approved by BuildCo. Structural subdivision is required not later
      than on the next day following receipt of an application to
      forward the request for Technical Conditions to the appropriate
      utilities providers. Utilities providers are required to provide the
      Technical Conditions, or in case of refusal, the motivated
      explanation of refusal. The term for consideration and issuance
      of an APZ and Technical Conditions, in this scenario, may not
      exceed 8 business days. However, in practice, it might take 1
      month.


      Agency: Almaty City Architecture and Town-Planning Department



      Request and obtain project clearance from the Sanitation
      and Epidemiological Authority (SES)

      According to the Law on Radiation Safety of Population N 219-I
      as of April 23, 1998 and other by-laws, the Sanitation and
      Epidemiologic Authority (SES) examines construction projects for
      their compliance with state radiological, sanitary and hygienic
      regulations. No specific time limit is expressly provided by law
3     for this procedure. In practice it takes about 1 month. The SES        30 days      KZT 30,000
      will conduct an inspection to undertake a radiological
      measurement. The approval is obtained after the fee is paid. The
      fee is based on various factors and is approximately KZT
      30,000.00.

      The Fire Service Department issues the project clearance to
      ensure that fire norms have been adequately met in the project
      design. Comments for revision or endorsement are also issued.
      There is no time limit stipulated for this procedure and it can
      take up to 1 month. Any subsequent consideration would take
      15 days.

      Agency: Fire Service Department



      * Request and obtain environmental expertise of
      documentation

      Subjects of environmental expertise are divided into 4 categories
      depending on the hazard class of the facility to be inspected
      pursuant to the sanitary classification. The environmental
      expertise with respect to facilities of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th
      categories is performed by the Akimats of Almaty City. A
      warehouse falls under the 4th category.

      Article 50 of the Environmental Code of the Republic of
      Kazakhstan was amended by the Law dated 15 July 2011
      (entered into force starting from 1 January 2012). This amended
      Article reduces the initial terms of state ecological expertise
      ("SEE") to be conducted by the competent authority in two
      stages: 7 calendar days for preliminary SEE (initial term - 2        25 days       no charge
5
      weeks), and up to 1 month for the main stage of SEE (initial term
      - up to 3 months).

      According to Clause 22.2) of the Rules on SEE conduction,
      approved by the Order of Minister of Environmental Protection

        V, the current would be 400 amperes;
        where it is 230/400 B, the current would be
        nearly 200 amperes).
       Is 150 meters long. The connection is to
        either the low-voltage or the medium-
        voltage distribution network and either
        overhead or underground, whichever is
        more common in the area where the

        a 10-meter road (such as by excavation or
        overhead lines) but are all carried out on
        public land. There is no crossing of other
        owners’ private property because the
        warehouse has access to a road.
       Includes only a negligible length in the
        customer’s private domain.
       Will supply monthly electricity
        consumption of 26,880 kilowatt-hours
        (kWh).
       Does not involve work to install the internal
        electrical wiring. This has already been

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in
figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report). And for
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
