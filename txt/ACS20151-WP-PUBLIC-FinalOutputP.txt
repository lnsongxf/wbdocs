                                      Executive Summary
This report1 argues that Moldova’s government could reduce fiscal risks to the economy by
reducing the size of spending and improving its efficiency, making the tax system simpler, with
fewer tax preferences, and strengthening the tax administration. After years of robust
performance, in 2015–16 Moldova’s public finances came under pressure. Fraud in the banking sector
and economic recession have pushed up public debt, reducing fiscal space and undermining investor
confidence. Grants from donors have fallen. Less revenue has forced the government into an ad hoc
spending adjustment, with an abrupt reversal of the recent welcome trend of higher capital spending.
The government could address these challenges along three dimensions: fiscal stance and
sustainability, spending, and revenues. First and foremost, nonetheless, it should concentrate on
gradually reducing current spending. As experience in other countries has demonstrated, fiscal
consolidation based on spending cuts in a context and circumstances similar to these in Moldova, may
yield better results than one based on tax increases.
The first dimension to consider is safeguarding fiscal sustainability. Moldova managed to reduce
its debt from over 80 percent of GDP in 2000 to just over 20 percent in 2008. After the global crisis,
debt hovered above 30 percent of GDP before called public guarantees for defrauded bank depositors
escalated it to more than 45 percent in 2015. While this level of public debt is broadly in line with the
average for low middle-income countries, fiscal sustainability may be challenged by the lack of market
access, limited fiscal deposits, and the risk that further contingent liabilities in the financial sector may
emerge and need to be covered. It is recommended that the authorities promote development of the
domestic government securities market and work hard to limit the scope of contingent liabilities. In
recent years, Moldova’s fiscal policy has been a-cyclical, that is, neutral relative to the economic cycle.
However, the fiscal rule the government introduced in 2014 -- stipulating that the fiscal deficit,
excluding grants, should not exceed 2.5 percent of GDP, although the deficit ceiling could be exceeded
by the amounts of externally financed investment projects -- would neither improve fiscal sustainability
nor promote counter-cyclicality. A retroactive analysis applying Moldova’s rule to 2000–15 finds that
the fiscal balance and debt would have been worse than what actually happened in terms of both
sustainability and counter-cyclicality. It is therefore recommended that the authorities improve the
fiscal rule to make it a more effective anchor for sustainability and output stabilization.
The second dimension is reducing the size and improving the efficiency of spending. At 37.8
percent of GDP on average for 2000–14, Moldova’s government spent more than countries with similar
per capita income, degree of human development, and government efficiency. Improving governance is
an important prerequisite for possible expansion of expenditures in the future. Today Moldova spends
more on public consumption than comparators and is a clear international outlier on education outlays.
Starting in 2010, following a decade of increasing expenditures, the government began to reduce
spending, most notably on education and social protection, as it created more fiscal space for capital
spending. However, it needs to do more to contain current expenditures and to secure critical public
investments. Today, Moldova’s public spending is far from efficient: according to the Public Sector
Performance indicator2 , more efficient regional comparators achieve similar outcomes using 40
percent lower revenues. Spending on education and health is particularly high, but even beyond these

Public Expenditure Reviews (PERs). Recent PERs have focused on public investment management,
intergovernmental fiscal relations, and public support to agriculture.

public spending to the outcomes of public policies, see Box 5 for details.

sectors there is room for efficiency gains. Pension system is becoming socially unsustainable. The
efficiency of spending could be improved by reforming the pension PAYG system, (including raising the
retirement age), better targeting social assistance, optimizing the hospital, primary and secondary
school networks, reducing public employment, strengthening procurement practices, and revising how
the government invests its capital.
The third dimension is making the tax system simpler. Moldova collects more revenues than peer
countries but also depends on external grants. As in most other Eastern European countries, the
revenue structure is skewed toward taxes on goods and services (indirect taxes). Moldova’s tax
revenues have been declining as tax exemptions proliferated. While the tax administration has
improved, continuing deficiencies in capacity and governance cannot deal with the problem of high
informality. Moldova could make the tax system simpler, more efficient, and revenue-enhancing by
reducing tax preferences, increasing the nontaxable amount of the personal income tax, improving
property valuation, increasing excises, improving tax administration, reducing compliance costs, and
simplifying the tax structure. Most importantly, the government needs to deal with tax expenditures,
since tax initiatives over the last 15 years resulted in the adoption of a wide range of reduced tax rates
and tax exemptions, with significant costs for the budget. In the short term, additional revenues might
supplement expenditure cuts to safeguard fiscal sustainability. In the longer term, though, Moldova
would need to find substitutes for external grants, so that they gradually become a relatively smaller
source of revenues.
A brief summary of the recommendations along the three dimensions is presented in Table 1.
The details are presented in the main body of the report.

                Chapter I. Fiscal Sustainability and Fiscal Stance

Moldova is currently experiencing fiscal pressures despite low deficits over the last 15 years that
resulted in a much reduced level of public debt. Policy slippages led to a recent decline in official
financing, while guarantees issued in 2014–15 to cover depositors in three failed banks pushed
debt past 45 percent of GDP and undermined investor confidence. Fiscal sustainability may be
further challenged by the lack of market access, limited fiscal deposits, and the risks that further
contingent liabilities from the financial sector may need to be covered. Meanwhile, Moldova’s fiscal
policy has been mostly neutral to the economic cycle for the last 15 years. However, the fiscal rule
introduced in 2014 would neither improve fiscal sustainability nor promote counter-cyclicality.
The authorities should carefully watch potential contingent fiscal liabilities and ensure that the
fiscal rule becomes an anchor for sustainability and output stabilization.

        Macro Developments and Fiscal Pressures

1.      After more than a decade of mostly high growth, Moldova’s economy fell into recession in
2009 and again in 2015. Since the early 2000s, the economy grew by 5 percent a year on average; the
poverty rate as nationally defined dropped from 26 percent in 2007 to 11 percent in 2014; and growth
in the consumption of the bottom 40 percent of the welfare distribution was consistently higher than
the average. However, in 2015 an adverse external environment, summer drought, and a banking crisis
put the brakes on economic growth (Figure 1). The deep recession of Moldova’s eastern partners and
the trade restrictions Russia imposed on imports from Moldova slashed remittances from Russia and
halved exports to that country, and exchange rate depreciation pushed up inflation. Hot weather and
low precipitation caused a double-digit decline in agricultural GDP. And a banking crisis brought on by
massive fraud in three banks lowered confidence in the banking sector, leading to significant interest
rate increases and reduced credit to the private sector. Among the monetary and fiscal costs of
resolution of the insolvent banks (equivalent to 12 percent of GDP) were higher public debt, lower
foreign exchange reserves, damage to business confidence, and fewer macroeconomic buffers to sustain
economic shocks. The economy contracted by 0.5 percent in 2015 (see Annex 1 for the main macro
indicators).

2.      Since 2015 the contraction in the economy and a shortfall in external financing has been
putting heavier fiscal pressure on the government. Moldova also received only a fraction of planned
external grants and financing due to political instability and delays in economic reforms. Moreover, the
cost of debt service shot up as currency depreciation and monetary tightening pushed up real interest
rates. To adapt to the changed circumstances, since mid-2015 the government has been rationing
expenditures. Some categories, notably capital outlays, have been cut dramatically as the government
protected the public wage bill and social protection spending (Figure 2). In the medium term, these
pressures are likely to be aggravated by adverse demographics, social spending commitments, and
recognition of contingent liabilities in the banking sector that are estimated at 12 percent of GDP. The
challenge for the government now is to adjust the fiscal stance without unduly slowing growth;
maintain fiscal sustainability; and ameliorate the negative impact on the living standards of the poor
and vulnerable.

         Fiscal Sustainability

3.      For the past 15 years, low deficits helped Moldova keep its public debt sustainable. For
2000–143 the deficit averaged 1.3 percent of GDP, lower than the average for Europe and Central Asia
(ECA) and significantly lower than for other middle-income countries with per-capita income similar to
Moldova’s (Figure 3). Likewise, Moldova’s public debt was on average lower than in MICs and close to
the ECA average (Figure 4). Moldova managed to reduce its debt from over 80 percent of GDP in 2000
to just over 20 percent before the 2008–09 financial crisis. After the crisis, debt rose to 30 percent of
GDP before the payment on public guarantees to bank depositors elevated it to above 45 percent in
2015.

4.     According to the Joint IMF-World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) Moldova’s debt
remains sustainable, but it is sensitive to an increase in contingent liabilities. While sensitive to
exchange rate depreciation and a sudden increase in other debt-creating flows, Moldova’s debt
dynamics are in general projected to remain sustainable in both the baseline and alternative scenarios.
The DSA concludes that pursuing prudent fiscal policy and advancing structural reforms continue to be
necessary to ensure debt sustainability (IMF 2015).

5.      The government’s heavy reliance on foreign borrowing may also be risky. Foreign
financing was very important for deficit financing in recent years. In 2010–15, on average 64 percent of
the deficit was financed by net external borrowing (Figure 5). While official long-term financing
dominates the composition of public external debt (Figure 6) given the lack of access to private
international capital markets and the thin domestic securities markets,4 a large part of official financing
is in the form of budget support that depends on sustained progress in advancing reform. Political
instability and delays in reform implementation could substantially reduce the available financing. This
could further reduce the government’s ability to finance planned spending, as happened in 2015
(World Bank 2016).

6.      Fiscal sustainability is being challenged by risks of additional contingent liabilities and
low growth, low labor market participation, and negative demographic changes. Given the very
low formal employment rate, driven by an unsustainably low retirement age and a persistent fall in the
labor force participation of both men and women, by 2015 there were 1.4 inactive adults per active one
(aged 15+). Combined with an increasing share of elderly, most of whom are inactive, Moldova is
looking at an exceptionally high economic dependency ratio, which persists through different scenarios
for labor force participation. Current demographic projections estimate that the pension system
dependency ratio (number of pensioners per contributor) will rise from 77 percent in 2014 to a peak of
108 percent in 2055 because the future workforce (the contributors) will be smaller than the current
workforce. Finally, the risks of additional contingent liabilities, especially in the financial sector, are not
negligible because the root causes of the previous banking crisis have not yet been fully dealt with.
Following the public disclosure of the banking fraud, the authorities began to take the first steps to
address the governance problems throughout the financial sector. However, more needs to be done to
strengthen the independence, powers, and supervision capacity of the regulators (NBM and NCFM), and
to ensure shareholder transparency and good corporate governance in financial institutions. The recent
example of Ukraine illustrates how an accumulation of quasifiscal liabilities can make public debt
unsustainable (Box 1).

Ukraine’s example show how quickly public
debt may become unsustainable. In 2007,                 (Percent of GDP)
Ukraine’s fiscal deficit was 2 percent of GDP and its
public debt amounted to 13 percent. In 2014, the
overall deficit (including the deficit of state-owned
gas supply company Naftogaz) reached 10 percent
of GDP, public and guaranteed debt exceeded 70
percent, and in 2015 payments of debt interest
reached 4.5 percent of GDP. In November 2015
Ukraine had to restructure external public debt
with private creditors. Public and publicly-
guaranteed debt stabilized at about 80 percent of
GDP in 2015 (Figure B1.1). It continues to be a
major source of vulnerability for Ukraine.              Source: Moldova and Ukraine authorities.

A combination of procyclical fiscal policies, economic crises with currency depreciation, and a
proliferation of quasi-fiscal operations led to unsustainability:
        Pre-2008 Ukrainian fiscal policy was procyclical and budget spending grew rapidly due to high
         increases in wages, subsidies, and transfers. While the headline fiscal deficit stayed relatively low
         at 2 percent, in 2007 the cyclically adjusted deficit was 3.5 percent.
        Ukraine then experienced two deep recessions, one in 2009 and one in 2014–15, both
         accompanied by steep currency depreciations. Real GDP declined 15 percent in 2009, and 17
         percent in 2014–15 (figure B1.2). In 2015, Ukraine’s economy was 17 percent smaller than in 2007.
         Likewise, as a result of several waves of currency depreciation, the Ukrainian hryvnya lost 80 percent
         of its value between 2007 and 2015. Since a large share of Ukraine’s public debt was denominated in
         foreign currency, the combination of recession with depreciation forced a rapid rise in the debt-to-
         GDP ratio.
        Coverage of the deficits of Naftogaz and recapitalization of the state-owned banks aggravated
         fiscal unsustainability (Figure B1.3B1.3). The Naftogaz structural deficit grew rapidly because the
         authorities were reluctant to fully align gas tariffs with the surge in imported gas prices. Currency
         depreciations increased the required tariff adjustments denominated in local currency. In 2014 the
         Naftogaz deficit reached 5.6 percent of GDP.
        Meanwhile, during both recessions the financial sector and the government stepped in to
         recapitalize state-owned and systemically important banks. Public spending on bank
         recapitalization and the Deposit Guarantee Fund (DGF) peaked at 2.4 percent of GDP in 2015. These
         additional needs were financed through new public borrowings.

         Fiscal Policy

7.       Moldova’s fiscal policy has been acyclical for the last 15 years. During the boom years of
the early and mid-2000s, Moldova kept public finances almost balanced or ran a fiscal surplus. When
the economy dived into a 6 percent recession during the 2008–09 global crisis, the authorities swiftly
responded by raising the headline fiscal deficit. As a result, the underlying structural fiscal deficits have
been much less volatile, moving in the 1–3 percent range throughout the period (Figure 7). Therefore,
fiscal impulses have been very small, with a close to zero correlation between them and the output gap
(Figure 8). In 2014–15, fiscal impulses were almost zero.

         Moldova’s Fiscal Rule

8.       The fiscal rule introduced Figure 9: Actual and Simulated Fiscal Balance, 2000–15
in Moldova in 2014 could neither (Percent of GDP)
improve fiscal sustainability nor
promote counter-cyclical fiscal
policy. Fiscal rules are typically
adopted       to      ensure       debt
sustainability, stabilize output, and
limit the size of government.
Moldova introduced a budget
balance rule (see Box 2), stipulating
that, from 2018 and on, the fiscal
deficit, excluding grants, should not
exceed 2.5 percent of GDP, although
the deficit ceiling could be exceeded
by the amounts of externally
financed investment projects. A rule Source: Moldovan authorities, World Bank calculations.
that does not adjust for the stage of
the business cycle is unlikely to help stabilize output and introduce counter-cyclical fiscal policy. In
addition, the rule is not explicitly linked to debt sustainability. A backward recalculation of Moldova’s
rule applied to 2000–15 shows that this fiscal rule would have performed worse than what actually
happened in terms of both sustainability and counter-cyclicality. If the fiscal deficit had been at the
ceiling following the rule, the deficit would have averaged 2.2 percent of GDP for the 15 years—0.9
percentage point higher than the actual (Figure 9). For instance, the fiscal deficit would have been 4.2
percent of GDP in 2015 compared to the actual 2.3 percent. While its sustainability impact would have
been relatively small, it would have performed much worse in stabilizing output. For instance, it would
not have required the government to run fiscal surpluses during the period of high economic growth in
the early to mid-2000s.
 Box 2: Types of Fiscal Rules
 Governments adopt fiscal rules to ensure debt sustainability, to stabilize output, and to limit the size of
 government. To achieve these objectives, a fiscal rule imposes long-lasting constraints on fiscal policy through
 numerical limits on budgetary aggregates. There are 4 main types of fiscal rule:
        Budget balance rules require that the budget be balanced; the target can be specified as the overall,
         primary, cyclically-adjusted, or over-the-cycle balance. Examples include Mexico and Paraguay (overall
         balance), Colombia, Chile, Norway, and Romania (structural balance).
        Debt rules set an explicit target limit for the public debt-to-GDP ratio. This type of rule is used by
         Bulgaria, Poland, Lithuania, Peru, New Zealand, and Switzerland, among others.
        Expenditure rules put permanent limits on total, primary, or current spending in absolute terms,
         growth rates, or percent of GDP. Poland, Spain, Finland, Japan, and France use expenditure rules.
        Revenue rule: set a ceiling or floor on revenues with the goal of boosting revenue collection,
         preventing an excessive tax burden, or both. Examples include Panama, Norway, Canada (Alberta), and
         Kazakhstan.
 Due to trade-offs between the properties of different fiscal rules, many countries have combined elements of
 several. Most common are combinations of a budget balance rule with a debt rule or with an expenditure rule.
 The combination of budget balance with expenditure rules is often used in high income countries, while the
 combination of a budget balance rule with a debt rule is more common in emerging markets.

        Fiscal Policy and Private Savings

9.       It is crucial to understand how fiscal policy and private savings are linked in order to
gauge the impact of a potential fiscal stimulus on the economy. While macroeconomic stability is
the main objective of fiscal consolidation, and fiscal policy therefore aims primarily to reduce the
deficit, the discussion in this section goes a step further—to a situation where fiscal policy is used to
stimulate the economy. Moldova improved its public finances in 2010–14, as indicated by the declining
fiscal deficit. However, growth prospects for the medium term are not so encouraging. Meanwhile,
fiscal performance has recently deteriorated, mainly due to the liabilities that arose from the banking
crisis and a notable decline in grant revenue. While fiscal dynamics are currently under pressure, an
equally relevant issue is how a potential fiscal stimulus would impact future policymaking in an
environment where a fiscal anchor is operating and fiscal adjustment is back on track. It may therefore
be a useful exercise to look into the trade-offs between revenue and spending policies and private
savings so as to inform fiscal policy and understand how it may constrain the economy. Box 3
summarizes the conceptual framework for such an analysis; Box 4 presents the savings and investment
profile of Moldova.


 Box 3: Why the Fiscal Policy-Savings Relationship Matters: Testing Ricardian Equivalence
 How effective fiscal policy is depends on, among other factors, the response of private savings to a
 change in fiscal stance. Changes in the budget deficit that affect public savings may be partly counteracted
 by changes in private savings. In fact, in many OECD economies fiscal adjustments with the objective of
 stabilization have been associated with inverse movements in private savings (OECD 2004). There may be
 many reasons for this, because fiscal measures can be offset by private saving responses through a variety of
 channels. The primary one is through disposable income; the marginal propensity to consume out of an
 additional unit of income is generally less than one in the long term (additional income is partly saved and
 partly consumed). Another offset can occur when private savings go up indirectly because of higher interest
 rates caused by higher budget deficits. Finally, these could be complemented by the negative effects on asset
 prices of increased government debt (OECD 2004). As a result, a tax cut by the government to stimulate the
 economy, for example, may be less effective if the offset coefficient between public and private saving is high.
 The Ricardian equivalence tells that since consumers are forward-looking, how government spending is
 financed does not affect consumption decisions, and therefore it does not affect aggregate demand.
 The hypothesis to be tested is whether a 1 percentage point increase in public savings leads to a less
 than 1 percent increase in total savings. Full Ricardian equivalence implies that a 1 percentage point
 decline in public saving (e.g., through a tax cut or a rise in spending) leads to an equivalent increase in private
 saving—when consumption is kept constant, higher disposable income implies higher private saving. In other
 words, there is a one-to-one negative relationship between public and private savings. In practice, full
 Ricardian equivalence hardly holds, as has been demonstrated in empirical studies in both the developed and
 the developing world. The analysis for this section tests the impact of the various components of public
 balances (different policy tools) on private savings.

10.     The results of the econometric estimation in Moldova suggest that, controlling for other
factors, there is a powerful negative association between public and private savings. The baseline
analysis tested the relationship between public and private savings while controlling for real GDP per
capita, the interest rate on deposits, and the real exchange rate (see Annex 2 for data and
methodology). All coefficients are statistically significant at a 95 percent confidence interval except the
coefficient for the constant term. As shown in Table 2, a 1 percentage point increase in public savings
(driven by an increase in revenues, a cut in expenditures, or both) leads to a 0.7 percentage point

decline in private savings. As expected, the coefficient for real GDP per capita is positive, which suggests
that private savings tend to increase as countries climb the income ladder. Similarly, the positive
coefficient for the deposit rate indicates that households and firms react rationally to higher interest
rates by saving more. Finally, the coefficient for the real exchange rate has a negative relationship with
private savings. This is not surprising: Real depreciation makes foreign goods more expensive for local
consumers, leading to a decline in consumption and an increase in private savings. Coefficients for
female labor force participation, the inflation rate, and government spending were also added to the
regressions but turned out to be insignificant when considered together with the baseline variables.

11.     The estimations of the impact of revenue policy on savings were inconclusive. The
analysis also considered alternative specifications by including income and consumption taxes in
addition to the control variables. Both estimations yielded statistically significant results for all
variables except the constants, at a 95 percent confidence interval. However, though the coefficient for
tax revenues from income was positive, the coefficient for tax revenues from consumption was
negative. These variables capture the actual fiscal realizations in nominal terms rather than the tax rate.
As a result, higher revenues from consumption taxes are a reflection of consumption, but higher
revenues from income taxes reflect better incomes. Thus, the results are intuitive in the sense that
heightened consumption is negatively correlated with private savings but higher income is positively
correlated.


 Box 4: Saving-Investment Balance in Moldova
 Both savings and investment as a share of GDP have been volatile for the last 20 years. Although low in
 the late 1990s and early 2000s, both savings and investment rates shot up in the run-up to the global economic
 crisis, although the pace of increase for the latter was faster, reaching 34 percent in 2008 and widening the
 saving-investment gap (Figure B4.1). Starting in 2009, the economy seems to have entered a new phase of
 lower but stable levels of investment at a narrow 23-24 percent interval. Concomitantly, savings declined
 sharply, reaching the low of 11 percent in 2011 before beginning to increase again slowly. As a reflection of
 this volatility, the large current account deficit in 2007-08 had narrowed down to 6 percent by 2014.
 Public and private savings moved in opposite directions until 2009. Private savings, as expected,
 represent a higher share of total savings. Public and private savings moved in opposite directions in 1997 –
 2010 before they began to co-move in 2011 (Figure B4.2). This general negative correlation between the public
 and private components of savings suggests a negative offset coefficient (less than 1), which is tested in this
 section.

        Recommendations

12.      Moldova must move to preserve its fiscal sustainability and avoid procyclical policies.
Recent developments have increased the risks to Moldova’s fiscal sustainability because the
government protected all depositors in three failed banks. Meanwhile, the risks of additional contingent
liabilities, especially in the financial sector, are not negligible, though the authorities started to address
the causes of the previous banking crisis and to improve the transparency of shareholding. Meanwhile,
the current rule could make fiscal policy procyclical. Therefore, it is recommended that the authorities:
          Carefully monitor contingent fiscal liabilities and come up with clear, more stringent
           rules for providing government guarantees. The government should carefully monitor
           contingent fiscal liabilities primarily in the financial sector but also in the energy and (other)
           state-owned enterprises.
          Make the fiscal rule more effective. The government could improve the use of its fiscal rule
           as an anchor for sustainability and output stabilization by reconsidering the exclusion of
           investment projects with external financing from the deficit ceiling, and adjusting the rule to
           account for the economic cycle. The deficit rule could be supplemented by an operational
           expenditure rule.
          Develop the government securities market. The authorities should also promote
           development of the domestic government securities market so that it can finance an
           increasing share of public financing requirements.

              Spotlight: Good Practices in Fiscal Consolidation
13.     While fiscal consolidations depends on specific country circumstances, the economics
literature suggests that fiscal consolidations based on spending cuts are often preferable to tax
increases. Based on the experience of the OECD countries in 1970-2007, Alesina and Ardagna (2010)
conclude that spending-based adjustments are more likely to reduce the deficit and public debt than an
adjustment based only on tax increases. Based on a historical analysis of fiscal consolidation in
advanced economies, IMF (2010) suggests that adjusting spending is less likely to lead to a recession.
However, when consolidation must be large, adopting multiple instruments, both spending and
revenue items, increases the probability that debt stabilization will succeed (OECD 2012). Annex 3
provides data on how spending and revenue measures might contribute to fiscal consolidation in OECD
countries.
14.     “Smart” expenditure reform may be thought of having three pillars: achieving efficiency
gains in service delivery, ensuring the sustainability of spending, and establishing fiscal
institutions. Efficiency gains could be achieved, for example, through improvements in public
administration – both on wages and employment, public health care, public education, and other public
services. Social spending reforms could focus on improving the targeting and managing the scope of
social transfers and public pensions. At the same time, more vulnerable households need to be
protected. All these could be complemented by institutional reforms to promote spending control and
ensure sustainability.
15.     When large fiscal adjustment is needed, spending cuts are typically accompanied by
revenue increases. It is good practice for governments to first explore the scope for broadening tax
bases to keep tax rates low and direct their attention to mobilizing revenues from the least distorting
taxes. The consolidation package should focus on measures that reduce the distortions that are most
harmful to growth, and tilt revenue structures toward taxes and charges that are the least inefficient or
that correct externalities.

       Lessons from Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania

16.     Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania had very high growth rates up to 2008, when they were hit
hard by the global crisis. The cumulative output loss associated with the recession in the Baltics was
almost twice the size of the losses suffered by the hardest-hit countries in the 1997-98 Asian crisis
(Groenendijk and Jaansoo 2015). Latvia suffered the largest loss of output, and recovered the latest; the
crisis was the shortest in Lithuania. Estonia`s economy contracted by 4.1 percent in 2008 and 14.1
percent in 2009, Latvia`s by 2.8 percent in 2008, 17.7 percent in 2009, and 1.3 percent in 2010, and
Lithuania`s GDP fell by 14.8 percent in 2009. In parallel, general government balances deteriorated
significantly. Between 2008 and 2011, the general government budget deficit averaged 0.9 percent in
Estonia, 6.1 percent in Latvia, and 7.1percent in Lithuania.
17.      All three Baltic countries undertook sizable fiscal consolidations in 2008–10. All three
states front-loaded their fiscal consolidation, put more emphasis on cutting spending, and
complemented that with revenue measures. The total consolidation packages over 2008-10 amounted
to 13.8 percent of GDP in Estonia, 14 percent in Latvia, and 13.4 percent in Lithuania. Most of the
spending cuts took place in 2009, when they accounted for 70 percent of the total consolidation
packages in Estonia and Latvia and 78 percent in Lithuania (Table 3; Groenendijk and Jaansoo 2015). In
Latvia, the relative importance shifted more to the revenue side but remained on the spending side in
Estonia and Lithuania. The Baltic countries do not have an independent monetary policy: during 2009-
10, all operated currency boards and subsequently all three joined the Eurozone.

18.     The Baltic countries moved to decrease their public wage bills. Estonia and Latvia
implemented hiring and pay freezes. More importantly, all three countries cut public wages at the
outset of the crisis—Latvia by 18 percent, Lithuania by 10 percent, and Estonia by 8 percent (Table 4).
Civil servants also saw benefits cuts as additional pay funds, training funds, and one-time support
schemes were abolished. All three countries complemented these wage measures with staff reductions
and public sector reorganizations (Groenendijk and Jaansoo 2015).

19.    Spending cuts in health, education, and pensions complemented the reduction in public
wages. Spending on health fell in all three countries; for example, in Latvia it declined cumulatıvely by
0.8 percent of GDP in 2009–10 (Groenendijk and Jaansoo 2015). Latvia and Lithuania implemented
reforms to encourage saving and efficiency in education by introducing a funding system based on fixed
amounts per student. In Lithuania, the educational reforms yielded savings of 0.3 percent of GDP in
2009 and 0.5 percent in 2010. All three countries also raised the retirement age and temporarily froze
pensions. Estonia restructured its pension schemes, and Estonia and Lithuania reduced pension
payments (Table 5).

20.     Revenue measures accompanied spending cuts in the Baltic countries. All three increased
excise duties on tobacco, alcohol, and fuel (Table 6). Moreover, the standard VAT rate rose in all three
countries, from 18 percent to 21 percent in Latvia and Lithuania and to 20 percent in Estonia. Reduced
VAT rates were also increased (Groenendijk and Jaansoo 2015). Estonia and Lithuania abolished
several VAT exemptions. In addition, Lithuania introduced a real-estate tax in 2011, and all three Baltic
countries moved to broaden the tax base in order to boost revenues (Groenendijk and Jaansoo 2015).

                                           Chapter II. Spending
Moldova’s government spends more than countries with similar per-capita income, degree of
human development, and government efficiency. It spends more on public consumption and is a
clear international outlier in education outlays. Starting in 2010, the government began to reduce
spending, most notably on education and social protection and it created more space for capital
spending. However, Moldova’s government is still far from efficient: comparators produce similar
outcomes using 40 percent less revenue. The efficiency of its spending could be improved by
reforming the pension PAYG system, better targeting social assistance, optimizing hospital and as
primary and secondary school networks, reducing public employment, strengthening procurement
practices, and revising how it invests its capital.

        Government Spending over Time

21.     Compared to the previous decade, in 2010–15 higher transfers to citizens elevated
budget spending by 1.7 percentage points, to an average of 39.3 percent GDP. Spending had been
growing gradually through the 2000s and peaked at 45.3 percent of GDP in the crisis year of 2009. As
Figure 10 shows, in 2010–15, compared to 2000–09, transfers to the population increased the most
(1.8 p.p.), driven by higher pensions, followed by capital investments (0.8 p.p.), particularly in road
infrastructure, and spending on goods and services (0.8 p.p.), driven by the health sector. Meanwhile, a
reduction in the public debt-to-GDP ratio helped lower interest outlays. Transfers for production,
mainly agricultural subsidies, decreased 0.7 p.p. In the functional classification, outlays on social
protection went up by 2.1 p.p., mostly because of higher spending on pensions (Figure 11).

22.     Over 2010–15, the government reduced current spending and created space for capital
spending. Due to education reforms and reductions in spending on public order and national security,
the total public wage bill decreased by 1.8 p.p. to 8.5 percent of GDP in 2015, though that is still high by
international standards (Figure 12). Spending on goods and services also went down (by 1.1 p.p.), and
so did transfers to the population (1p.p.), which is the biggest spending item, mainly comprised of
pensions and social payments. Higher support from foreign grants and loans helped to push up capital
spending on infrastructure, with public investment in roads have gone up almost 2 p.p. since 2010. In

                                                         13
2014 capital spending set a 15-year record of 8.5 percent of GDP, before reversing in 2015 as external
assistance defined. As Figure 13 shows, by functional classification, the adjustment came from
efficiency gains, especially due to school network and staff rationalization in education (-2.2 p.p.) and to
the new targeted program and reduction of categorical compensation schemes in social assistance (-1.4
p.p.).

        Moldova’s Spending in Comparative Perspective

23.     Moldova’s government spends more than other countries with similar per-capita income.
At 37.8 percent of GDP on average for 2000–14, Moldova’s general government expenditures were 8.5
percentage points higher than the average for lower middle-income countries (MICs) and 3.7 p.p.
higher than the ECA average (Figure 14). Compared to regional peers in the same income category
(Armenia, Georgia, Kyrgyz Republic), Moldova also stands out for high spending for the last 15 years,
especially in the 2006–08 pre-crisis period. Moldova’s general government spending is in fact in line
with ECA countries of similar size but with much higher GDP per capita, such as the Slovak and Czech
Republics. In addition, many countries reduced government spending as a share in GDP significantly
over the last 15 years, while Moldova has a higher share than in the early 2000s (Figure 15).

24.     Moldova spends more than countries with similar levels of human development and
government efficiency. Countries whose spending is similar to that of Moldova tend to have higher
human development and more efficient governments (Figure 16-Figure 19). In other words, higher
level of government spending is usually associated with a high level of income – a proxy for social
agreement on government output -- and high government efficiency. Moldova needs to spend less given
its current level of government effectiveness. This analysis highlights the importance of good
governance as a prerequisite for possible expansion of expenditures, provided they provide public
goods or tackle externalities.

25.      Current spending dominated Moldova’s public expenditures. Moldova spent most on social
security insurance (11 percent of GDP), wages (9 percent), and goods and services (8 percent). Social
security insurance in Moldova is significantly higher than in the lower MICs, but on par with that ECA
average, which could be explained by demographic trends and history that are similar to those of the
rest of ECA. On average Moldova spent more on wages and purchases of goods and services lower MICs
and ECA countries (Figure 20). Purchases of goods and services were one of the largest among all peer
countries except for the Kyrgyz Republic (Figure 21).

Wage Bill
27.       The government began to cut the wage bill after the 2009 crisis, mostly by reducing
public employment. Between 2010 and 2015 public employment went down 16 percent and the wage
bill fell by nearly 2 percent of GDP, to 8.5 percent (Figure 24). Most of the job cuts were in education
(down 25 percent), which accounts for half of public employment, a staggering number in international

28.    Meanwhile, the fiscal pressure stemmed from smaller expenditure items. The wage bill
rose the fastest for social care facilities, justice, defense, and public order (Figure 28). Wages also rose
substantially for the National Patrol Inspectorate Police and the Inspectorate-General. High wage
outlays in social care facilities was associated with a more dynamic increase in wages at home care

29.      The fastest wage growth was in the
judiciary, although justice reform is slow.
The wage bill in the justice sector registered in
2009–14 the highest cumulative contributions
to the overall growth of the wage bill envelope
(force5) (defined according to World Bank
2015b). The wages paid to judges went up 80
percent and almost doubled for those on
courts of appeal.6 The fiscal pressures caused
by higher wages for the justice sector did not
improve performance; most surveys show
even more popular and corporate distrust in
Moldova’s justice system. According to the
2013 International Survey of Enterprises, only
31.9 percent of economic agents in Moldova
consider courts to be reasonable, impartial, Source: BOOST data base, World Bank calculations.
and incorrupt, compared to 38.9 percent for
all of Eastern Europe. Additionally, while total cases per 100,000 inhabitants in Moldova are about half
the EU average, 70 percent of economic agents do not believe that courts will protect their property
rights, which discourages their intentions to invest.

30.     The total wage bill is probably understated. Some wages for road construction projects are
registered as capital spending (an estimated 0.2 percent of GDP in 2015) and wages in the health
sector, particularly in hospitals, are in part registered as procurement of goods and services through
the National Health Insurance Company (about 2 percent of GDP in 2014). In addition, the steep drop in
the education wage bill in 2013 was due to the higher education system, where wages fell from 6.7
percent of total wage bill to nil in 2014, an unrealistic decline (for more detail, see the education sector
section).

31.     Ineffective and fragmented local government makes it difficult to reduce the public wage
bill. On average municipalities in Moldova are considerably smaller than in most peer countries (World
Bank 2014a). Almost 90 percent of the spending on municipal wages goes to the local executives,
whose remuneration has gone up 53 percent since 2009. Education is still the largest public employer
and there is room at local levels for optimization. The adjustment of 2010–12 decreased the number of
education employees financed through the central budget by 60 percent, but at the local level
opposition from local authorities kept the decrease to just 14 percent. About 10 percent of all local
jurisdictions do not cover their spending from their own revenues. Reducing the number of local
authorities and centralization and streamlining of public services, together with the introduction of
effective internal controls, may relieve the pressure of wage bill spending.




5   Detailed analysis of fiscal data in this report is based on Moldova BOOST data, available for 2009-14.
6   Since 2012, the wages at Chisinau court of appeals have gone up 40 percent and doubled at the Balti court of appeals.



                                                                19
32.     There are considerable differences in earnings across various public institutions.
Moldova’s average wage is the lowest in the region and is 10 times smaller than in the EU15 average
(Moldova’s GDP per capita is 9 times smaller than the EU15 average). However, in Moldova earnings in
autonomous agencies and for managerial positions (Courts of Accounts 2015) are significantly higher
than average. In fact, state agencies and national regulators usually have higher wages than the rest of
the public sector. For instance, in the last three years alone, the wage bill at National Competition
Council increased 160 percent and it almost doubled at the Central Election Commission and the
Broadcast Coordination Council. At the same time, public entry-level positions are paid lower than
average salaries, making difficult retain young and qualified personnel. Bonuses given at the discretion
of managers often constitute a larger proportion of total earnings for higher-graded posts, especially at
the very top of the scale. This system of remuneration is opaque.

Goods and Services
33.     The fiscal pressure on spending on goods and services comes from purchases of smaller,
often one-off items. At 8.1 percent of GDP (Figure 30), spending on goods and services accounted for
21 percent of public spending. The biggest item, half of the total, was for mandatory health insurance
services,7 followed by 22 percent for education8 (Figure 29). However, the fiscal pressure is coming not
from large but from smaller items. Heightened fiscal pressure came from procurement of fuel and
power service by the Agency for Energy Efficiency, which has increased 7.6 times since 2011, and from
procurement by the Internal Affairs authorities.9

34.     Poor practices undermine the quality and efficiency of public procurement. The quality of
the supplied services and goods is not improving (see the functional analysis) and the procurement
process is inefficient and slow. The majority of public acquisitions, on average almost 8 percent of
GDP10, are managed by the Agency of Public Acquisition. Even after installation of a new information
system, numerous legislative drawbacks, red tape, and the lack of transparency undermine efficiency.
The number of contracting authorities is also high, which prevents efficiencies of scale. While
opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises are limited, Courts of Accounts and civil society
periodically highlight the unusually high number of cases when the prices of procurement contracts are
changed after companies win the bidding. There is also potential for cutting spending on low-priority
goods by making public entities more accountable through, e.g., publication of budget planning and
provisions.




7   In part, this category represents wages to the health sector.
8The dynamics of procurement in higher education institutions is distorted by a change in public financing of the sector.
Funds allocated are categorized as state order and not wages.
9The four institutions that explain this are the general inspectorate of police (60 percent growth); commissioner general of
policy Chisinau (up almost 500 percent growth); information and technology service at MIA (more than 300 percent growth)
and Ungheni police department (1255 percent growth).
10About 22.5 percent is for construction, 6 percent for education and training services, and 14 percent for pharmaceutical and
food products and fuel and cars.

Transfers to the Population
35.    Population aging is driving spending on pensions and social benefits. Social benefits and
pensions paid through the state social insurance budget accounted for 88.3 percent of transfers in 2014
(Figure 33 and Figure 34). Since 2013, the main fiscal pressure has been coming from spending by the
National Insurance House and particularly pensions (more detail below).

Capital
36.    The government has boosted capital spending, relying increasingly on external loans and
grants. Growth in capital spending has averaged almost 6 percent of GDP for the last 15 years (Figure
35) and its share in total spending rose from 11 percent in 2009 to 22 percent in 2014 (Figure 36), as
the share of externally funded spending grew from 26 percent to 39 percent. Capital spending
contributed on average 3.8 p.p. to general spending growth, with a clear upward trend to 2014.

37.     Capital spending is concentrated in a few areas; road services absorb the most. The roads
services, utilities and agriculture account for half of public capital expenditure (Figure 37). Road
modernization accounts for one-third of capital spending and is mainly financed by external donors.

The share of capital spending on agriculture increased due to investment subsidies through the
Agriculture Subsidy Fund and other agricultural programs started in 201411 12(World Bank 2015a).
Spending on utilities went up to 8.2 percent in 2009–14 mainly because of new donor-supported water
supply services.

38.     Most of the fiscal pressure in 2009–14                Figure 37: Contributions to Average Growth of
came from recent health, energy projects and                  Capital Spending, 2009–14
spending on utilities. National health                        (Percentage Points)
investment projects begun in 2014 accelerated
the most. Capital spending under the national
health projects reached 0.5 percent of GDP in
2014, from 0.02 percent in 2009. The healthcare
service improvement project alone accounts for
43 percent of total capital spending on national
health projects. Capital spending on utilities
increased to 0.7 percent of GDP in 2014, from
0.3 percent in 200913. Investments in the gas
connection between Moldova and Romania have
also accelerated, as well as investments in
environmental protection, which have more
than tripled since 2011.14

39.     Trends in budgeted capital spending
have tended to be consistent with Moldova’s strategic objectives, except for energy, utilities, and
the railway network. Increased domestic funding for road maintenance in recent years has made it
possible to mobilize external funds for investments in road rehabilitation and capital repairs. However,
with its extensive railway system, Moldova needs to invest in maintaining and developing it. In
agriculture, capital spending mainly consists of transfers to farmers (investment subsidies). Trends in
education are consistent with the rehabilitation needs of an oversized general primary and secondary
school network: investment has declined but capital repairs increased. In health, with domestic
resources scarce, external funding has dominated capital spending. Energy investments are held back
by unresolved institutional bottlenecks. To ensure sustainable operation of energy and heating
companies, and to attract much-needed private investment, the sector urgently requires governance
and institutional reforms, debt restructuring, and immediate investments. The repair needs in
municipal water and sanitation systems are considerable. Setting tariffs at cost-recovery level is a
prerequisite for concentrated efforts to increase absorption of donor funds and better manage
investment.


11 The following agricultural programs begun in 2014: National Wine and Vine Office, Rural Finance and Agricultural Business

Emergency Moldovan Agriculture Support Project, IFAD VI Project and the Viticulture and Wine Sector Restructuring Program,
0.2 percent of GDP.
12 Over 2011-2014, one of the biggest fiscal pressures stemmed from capital spending to a joint stock company Farmaco. This

culminated in 2014 with a spending of 0.5 percent of GDP.
13 Main fiscal pressure came from the Water supply service development under the Ministry of Environment (490 percent

increase), spending on street lights (2870 percent increase) and district planning (224 percent increase).
14 The pressure to increase this spending envelope came from the Environmental Fund in Rezina district (1.4 times increase in

funds); Ministry of Environment (1.7 times increase); Criuleni district (4.7 times increase) and Drochia district (1400 times
increase).

40.     Given severe infrastructure needs and a constrained fiscal envelope, capital spending
must be made more efficient. The scope for raising revenues is limited and declining external
assistance could restrict funding for capital investments. Capital needs should be carefully estimated
based on analysis of the existing portfolio, especially unfinished projects. Spending needs also to be
adjusted to make more space for public investment in the medium term as management and absorption
capacity improve. Since there are no unified databases of existing, unfinished, and frozen projects,
efficiency gains should start with portfolio inventory and optimization. In general, efficiency gains
might come from improvements in planning, monitoring, and evaluation of public investments. Public
investments should follow the government regulation on public investment project cycle.15

Social Protection
41.    A change in the pay-as-you-go (PAYG) pension formula in Moldova has reduced pensions
relative to wages to one of the lowest levels in the region: In 2013, the average old-age pension was
about 28 percent of the gross wage, one of the lowest gross replacement rates in the ECA region. In
1995 the pension formula has yielded a gross replacement rate of 45 percent, but changes introduced
in 1998 pushed the replacement rate down. After 1999, the salaries on which the pension benefit
formula was calculated were not revalued (valorized) to account for the cumulative growth of the
average wage between when the salary was earned and the date of retirement. That reduced initial
replacement rates and created differences between new and old pensions. Moreover, the policy for
minimum pensions heavily redistributes toward agricultural workers at the expense of insured
individuals who pay average and above-average contributions. Moreover, frequent discretionary
increases in pensions undermine the fiscal sustainability of the pension system. These policies
compress the benefits structure, weaken the linkage between contributions and pension benefits, and
discourage contributions.

42.    Low pensions create an incentive to evade contribution evasion, which causes the
pension system deficit. In 1999, pension outlays amounted to 4.4 percent of GDP; in 2014 they
reached 7.5 percent. Over the same period, the number of contributors shrank by more than 40
percent. Contribution revenues fell short of covering growing pension costs, which resulted in a gap of
10 percent in national social insurance expenditures. Currently, only about 30 percent of the working-
age population contribute to the system but almost all elderly receive pensions. The shrinking
contributor base and the high number of pensioners together drive up the system-dependency ratio. By
2020 the ratio is projected to rise from the current 0.76 pensioners: 1 contributor to 1 pensioner: 1
contributor because of the aging work force (Figure 38). The shrinking coverage has implications for
poverty among the elderly and for the future cost of social protection.




15Public Investment Management Resolution (No. 1029, dated December 19, 2013) describes the public
investment project life cycle and establishes criteria for screening projects.

43.     The retirement age of 57 for women           Figure 38: Pension System Dependency Ratio,
and 62 for men is low by international               2014–70
standards. In 2003 relatively low life expectancy    (Ratio)
in Moldova was an argument to suspend raising
the retirement age. Though Moldovan life
expectancy at birth is indeed among the lowest in
the ECA, since 2006 the life expectancy at
retirement age has improved—in 2013, it was
15.7 years for men and 19.6 for women, which is
similar to other transition economies in the
region. Assuming life expectancy at retirement to
be about 15 years, the women’s retirement age is
currently too low and even men’s needs to start
rising gradually.

prosecutors, members of the government and
Parliament, and others account for 11 percent of old-age pensioners; their pensions cost about 13
percent of total pension outlays.

45.    Unless there is parametric reform and better compliance, the pension system will
converge to a quasi-flat pension system paying low benefits. The gap between earnings and
pensions will grow and the system will not be socially sustainable. The average replacement rate is
projected to decrease steadily from 28 percent to almost 13 percent in 2047.

46.     Many social assistance benefits are

share of GDP allocated to targeted social assistance
began to go up, but after 2012 the number of
beneficiaries of targeted cash transfers began to
shrink. Social assistance programs are directed to
the 14 percent or so of the total population who are
not eligible for the social insurance pension.
However, about 20 percent of total social
assistance spending leaks to people in the top 60
percent, with some programs channeling well
above 30 percent of their budget to people who are
better-off people (World Bank, 2016 forthcoming).
There are five groups of payments, but all are
fragmented and too small to have much impact.
The targeted program Ajutor Social and the heating

to expanding the coverage of poverty-targeted cash transfers.

47.     Social care facilities, which provide services to poor and vulnerable population groups,
together cost about 1 percent of GDP, but programs, providers, and levels of government are
highly fragmented. Although Moldova has made some progress in de-institutionalizing care and
providing community-based services, some are still residential. Social care is decentralized to local
governments, the poorest of which have few resources to fund it Moreover, local authorities often lack
capacity to assess the need and plan service delivery. Moldova has made progress in engaging non-
governmental organizations to provide services, but this is mostly done by relying on external funding
rather than local budgets. Spending on social care facilities has doubled since 2009. The biggest items
are for shelters and rehabilitation, though there are also other kinds of centers and social assistance
and care services. All spending items have gone up considerably, however, with personal assistance
services in particular having increased 85-fold.

Education
48.     Trends in education are consistent with the need to rehabilitate an oversized general
primary and secondary school network. After a peak of 9.4 percent of GDP in 2009, education
spending fell to 7 percent in 2014–15. Due to overstaffing, particularly at local levels and in non-teacher
staff, on average 51 percent of all sector spending goes to secondary education, with lyceums and
gymnasiums being the biggest recipients (30 percent). The share of preschool education was 22
percent with an upward trend due to high demand for kindergartens (Figure 40). On average 12
percent was spent on higher education and over 6 percent on extracurricular activities (Figure 401).
Due to low pupil- to teacher ratios (Figure 42), 60 percent of public resources were being spent on
wages, but that share has been declining along with staff positions (Figure 41).

49.     With the majority of resources spent on wages, nutrition, and utilities, there is little left
for quality improvements. Half of non-wage current spending is nutrition (22 percent), mainly for
kindergartens and secondary schools, and utilities16 (27 percent). Staff training and retraining
represent 0.2 percent of all non-wage current spending, while almost the same amount goes to buying
books and manuals. The teaching force needs to be strengthened. About one-third of the 32,000
primary and secondary teachers lack pedagogical certification and almost 15 percent are past
retirement age. The teaching load, based on hours, is low by OECD standards, and there is a mismatch
between teacher skills and school needs. With a salary 23 percent below the country average and a lack
of career advancement opportunities, it is difficult to attract and retain the most talented. Moreover,
school managers usually lack the basic management skills the new law requires.

50.    Capital spending on education is low and mainly channeled to secondary education. With
the school network optimization project, a larger share of funds is being spent to improve water,
sewage, heating systems, and buildings. On average 60 percent of capital expenditures were for repairs,
of which half went to secondary schools. Only a small share of capital spending went to new facilities.

51.     Despite its high cost, the quality of Moldovan education is poor. The country’s 15-year-olds
performed at the bottom of Europe in the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment
(PISA) 2010. In fact, 57.3 percent of Moldova’s students are illiterate: they fall short of the basic reading
proficiency they need to participate effectively and productively in society, and the situation is worse in
rural areas. The education system is unable to produce the skills employers are demanding. A 2013
survey by the National Confederation of Employers cited a low-skilled labor force and the current
education and training system as key constraints; the Global Competitiveness Index ranks Moldova 103

Health
52.     Averaging 4.8 percent for the last 15 years, health is the third largest spending category.
Mainly due to a large and costly network of hospitals, by the end of 2009 spending on health had
reached a record high of 6.4 percent of GDP. However, it has since then health expenditure has been
contained at some 5.5 percent (Figure 44). Spending by the National Health Insurance Company (NHIC)
represented 80 percent of all expenditures on health. For 2009–14 health-related capital spending was
very low at 0.4 percent of GDP and went mainly on refurbishment of existing physical and technical
infrastructure. The capital spending increase in 2014 was due to the launch of the Healthcare Services
Improvement Project (0.2 percent of GDP).

53.    Inefficiencies and imbalances in service provision between Chisinau and the rest of the
country impede health service delivery; 60 percent of health spending goes to national, district,
departmental, and Chisinau municipal hospitals.17 Moldova’s rate of hospital beds per 100,000 people is
32 percent above the EU average, and is concentrated in Chisinau municipality, with many overlaps
between municipal, national, and departmental hospitals. Meanwhile, in rural areas, thinly distributed
public resources and dilapidated infrastructure are a threat to the safety of patients. Of 71 public
hospitals in Moldova, 24 conduct fewer than 1,000 surgeries a year.18

54.     Although the bulk of financing is directed to hospitals, they fail to provide quality
services. There is a persistently decreasing trend in hospitalization rates based on referral from family
doctors (from 22 percent in 2013 to 20 percent in 2015). As a result, primary and outpatient health
care is not fulfilling its prevention function, which is less costly than hospitalization. Life expectancy in
Moldova is 10 years lower than in peer countries; 87 percent of all deaths are caused by
noncommunicable diseases; and infant mortality is among the highest in the region.



17National Clinical Hospital, the Oncological Institute and the Mother and Child Institute are among the most ‘expensive’
hospitals.
18 CNAM administrative data suggests that 22 raion hospitals and 2 departmental hospitals (the State Chancellery and Ministry
of Health hospitals) conduct fewer than 1,000 surgeries a year.

          Efficiency of Public Spending

55.     Moldova spends more than peer countries, but its spending performs less well, according
to the Public Sector Performance (PSP) indicator (see Table 7 and Box 5). Moldova had one of the
lowest scores on administrative performance in the PSP sample; the government scored low on
securing property rights, administering justice, enforcing contracts, and providing a business-friendly
regulatory environment. The score of the education sector was in fact the lowest in the sample. The
health sector is also at the bottom, reflecting a very high incidence of tuberculosis and infant mortality,
and low life expectancy, which along with that of Russia and the Kyrgyz Republic is very low. Mainly
due to strong economic growth, Moldova’s total PSP score was only 5 percent below the average, but it
was still among the lowest performers. Moldova had the highest score on the average GDP growth and
above-average score on unemployment rate. Without these two indicators, Moldova’s PSP would have
been 20 percent below the average.

Box 5: The Public Sector Performance (PSP) Indicator
The PSP approach compares countries on a variety of socioeconomic indicators. It then relates public
spending to the outcomes of public policies. The greater the positive impact of higher spending on the
indicators, the more efficient a country is assumed to be. There are two sets of performance indicators: process
or opportunity indicators, and indicators traditionally used for measuring macroeconomic outcomes. The first
looks at administrative, education, and health outcomes. The second tries to measure the outcomes of
government interaction with markets and look into income distribution and stability.

56.     Moldova is far from the efficiency frontier of the sample countries because it “wastes” a
substantial amount of public spending. Efficiency is ranked by comparing each country’s position
relative to the production possibilities frontier. The more distant a country is from the frontier, the less
efficient its public sector is. The most efficient countries in the sample are Poland, Lithuania, and
Kazakhstan.19 Russia, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Ukraine spend more but are less productive than
Moldova (Figure 46).

57.    Moldova could perform as well as it does even if it spent less. Its input efficiency score,
using Data Envelop Analysis20, is 0.6, meaning that it should be able to attain the same level of output


19Kazakhstan’s high score is explained by high average real GDP growth, low volatility of GDP growth, low poverty rates, and
relative good scores on administrative performance. In combination with a low spending-to-GDP ratio, this places Kazakhstan
on the production possibility frontier.
20 Data envelop analysis (DEA) is a linear programming technique for measuring relative performance of decision making
units and construction of production possibility frontiers. The method assumes that if a unit can achieve a certain level of
efficiency using a given number of inputs, another unit can do the same. In this case, the calculated input efficiency determines
how much less a country could spend in order to attain the same outcomes—in other words, what a country’s public

(public performance) using only 60 percent of the funds it currently spends (Figure 47). In this sense,
Moldova is wasting 40 percent of its public resources, so there is a lot of space for making public
spending more efficient. In other words, Moldova’s spending-to-GDP ratio could have been much lower
and still would have got the same results.

         Recommendations

Moldova can make its spending more efficient, with improvements especially needed in
education and health; there is ample room beyond these sectors as well. The analysis in this
chapter suggests the following recommendations:
              Continue optimizing the primary and secondary education network and expand
               formula financing to other education sub-sectors. Currently general primary and
               secondary education budget allocations are based on a formula that takes into
               consideration the number of students in an institution. This has led to optimization of that
               network and to more efficient allocation of resources. A similar practice should be
               followed in pre-school, vocational education and training (VET), and higher education.
               The system of VET and higher education should be better aligned to the needs of the
               economy. Government should also allocate more resources to teacher training and
               educational materials.
              Optimize the hospital network. Old infrastructure and the costs of Moldova’s hospitals
               make it difficult to reallocate resources to preventive health care. Government should
               rationalize the costly hospital networks while building up the quality and coverage of less
               costly primary and preventive care. This could be achieved by drawing up a master plan
               for hospital network rationalization, increasing the use of ambulatory care, building the
               managerial capacities pf hospitals administrators, and better monitoring health outcomes.
              Reform the pension PAYG system to preserve fiscal and social sustainability. The
               immediate measure is to re-establish valorization of the past earnings in the pension
               formula along with a lower accrual rate and adequate benefit indexation. Wage
               valorization of the salary base and price indexation of pension benefits would improve
               pension adequacy for new beneficiaries and maintain the real value of future pensions.
               This approach corresponds to good international practice because it preserves the
               purchasing power of the elderly, furthers fiscal sustainability, and strengthens the link
               between contributions and benefits. Benefit adequacy will only be sustainable in the
               longer run if the retirement age is increased. The retirement age in Moldova should
               gradually rise to equalize the age for women at 62 and then for both genders up to 65.
               Increasing the retirement age, in addition to previous measures, would improve
               replacement rates. It would strengthen the sustainability of the pension system and allow
               for future reforms, such as introduction of fully-funded pensions. Supplemental pension
               benefits should be phased out.
              Improve the targeting of social assistance. Government should increase the scope for
               well-targeted programs, Ajutor Social and the heating allowance, and reduce
               fragmentation of spending on social care facilities and categorical benefits.


expenditures as a percent of GDP would be if it was on the production possibilities frontier compared to its actual public
expenditure as a percent of GDP.

   Reduce the wage bill by reducing the number of public employees. Strategic staffing
    and merit-based remuneration should start with the inventory of public employees and
    the use of a centralized fiscal oversight and reporting mechanism (FMIS). Reducing public
    employment at the local level should be given special attention. The fragmentation of local
    government authorities can be addressed by reducing the number of local authorities and
    by centralizing and streamlining public services. To attract and retain the necessary
    skilled staff, the authorities should introduce merit-based remuneration.
   Reinforce procurement practices. Reducing the number of contracting authorities by
    unifying and matching procurement needs could be useful. Government could also reduce
    spending on low-priority goods by making public entitles more accountable, perhaps by
    publishing budget planning and provisioning and strengthening anticorruption efforts).
   Better regulate public capital investment. Government should realize the potential of
    the new regulations on public capital investments to set up transparent and efficient
    mechanisms for project preparation, appraisal, and selection. It could create and regularly
    update a comprehensive database of investment projects, whether active and frozen. The
    database should be consistent with the public asset management register and other
    sources of information. Spending identified as inefficient, such as maintenance of
    unfinished construction projects, should be stopped. Asset management decisions should
    be guided by portfolio optimization. The government should institutionalize its
    monitoring and evaluation system and make the results an integral part of budget
    decision making.

                                          Chapter III. Revenues
Moldova collects more revenues than peer countries but also depends on external grants. As in
most countries in Eastern Europe, the revenue structure is skewed toward taxes on goods and
services. Moldova’s revenues have recently declined due to a reduction in grants from foreign
donors because of policy slippages that delayed disbursements and because of the impact from the
proliferation of tax exemptions. While tax administration has improved, deficiencies in capacity
and governance cannot deal with the problem of high informality. Moldova could make the tax
system simpler, more efficient, and boost revenues at the same time by reducing tax preferences,
simplifying labor taxation, increasing the nontaxable amount of the personal income tax (PIT),
improving property valuation, increasing excises, and improving tax administration.

         Trends and Composition

58.     Revenues increased by 0.5 percent of GDP on average in 2010–15 compared to the
previous decade and amounted to 37.2 percent of GDP. This moderate increase masks large shifts
in composition (Figure 48). The increase in the health insurance revenues was due to introduction of
the health insurance scheme in 2003. The main growth drivers of budget revenues were VAT, because
of high imports and consumption (+0.7 p.p.) and external grants, because of more foreign assistance to
pro-European governments since 2010 (+1.2 p.p.). Meanwhile, after the 2009 crisis, revenues from
special funds and means were down 1.4 p. p. and non-tax revenues down by 0.7 p.p. Corporate income
tax (CIT) collections were on average lower by 0.2 p.p., since they were zero-rated during 2008–11,
while a narrower tax base because of inadequate valuation of assets explains the decrease in revenues
from real estate taxes.

59.    While the trend relative to the previous decade is up, more recently revenues declined
by 2.5 percent of GDP from 2010 to 2015. Grants peaked at 3.7 percent of GDP in 2014, before
plunging to 1.7 percent GDP in 2015, which constituted almost half of the total decline. Social security
contributions also declined 0.7 p.p. because inadequate incentives to contribute (see discussion on
pensions in Chapter 2) reduced the number of contributors. VAT collections declined by 1.5 p.p.
because new VAT exemptions were introduced, rates were reduced, and the share of consumption in

                                                            33
GDP gradually declined. Meanwhile, CIT revenues went up 1.5 p.p. after the 12 percent rate was
reintroduced in 2012 (Figure 49).
60.    Moldova’s revenues are larger than those of countries with similar per capita income. In
2010–14 general government revenues, including grants, were 8 p.p. higher than the average for
countries with similar incomes and 3.3 percentage points higher than the ECA average (Figure
50Figure 51). External grants have averaged 3 percent of GDP for the last 15 years—higher than
Moldova’s regional peers but in line with countries with similar incomes. However, Moldova’s
dependence on external grants has been trending up gradually and reached 3.7 percent of GDP in 2014.
Meanwhile, other countries in the region with a relatively high share of grants managed to reduce their
dependence on this source. While some large countries in the region, such as Poland and Turkey, had a
higher share of fiscal collections than Moldova, countries of similar size (Lithuania, Georgia, Albania)
and Romania had a lower fiscal load (Figure 52).

61.      Similarly to most countries in Central and Eastern Europe, Moldova’s revenue structure
is skewed toward taxes on goods and services while income taxes are low. For 2000–14 the
former averaged 14.7 percent of GDP, a very high share among both lower MICs and globally (Figure
53). This is mostly explained by high final consumption and imports, which led to high VAT collections,
and by the difficulty of verifying incomes and profits and collecting taxes on them. The CIT rate of 12
percent is among the lowest in the region, and the CIT share relative to GDP is one of the lowest in the
world (Figure 54). In Moldova’s case, however, a low CIT rate has not helped to attract higher FDI
inflows than peers.21 Not surprisingly, foreign investors are interested in more than just low tax rates:
political stability, a predictable business environment, ease of doing business, good infrastructure, a
skilled labor force, a sizable market or access to a sizable market are some of the factors helping attract
foreign investors.




21 At 4.4 percent, Moldova’s share of FDI in GDP in 2014 is slightly higher than the average o f the region and of lower MICs.
However, Moldova’s ability to attract FDI is poor when benchmarked against comparator economies like Albania, Croatia, and
Georgia. In addition, a substantial part of the FDI stock may not be genuine foreign investment but rather a recycled funds of
local origin seeking anonymity or legal protection of foreign jurisdictions

62.     The revenue structure by sectors of the economy reflects the large presence of the state
and the service-oriented nature of the economy. As Figure 55 highlights, public entities and
administration paid over 27 percent of all taxes—public administration pays 7 percent of all domestic
collections administered by the State Tax Inspectorate. Meanwhile, wholesale and retail trade is a clear
sectoral leader, which accounted for almost a quarter of all collections, followed by other service-
oriented activities: transport, communication, and real estate (Figure 56).

         Policy and Administration

63.     On the policy side, Moldovan tax initiatives resulted in adoption of a wide range of
reduced tax rates and tax exemptions, with significant costs for the budget. Over the last 15 years,
Moldova has introduced reduced and zero rates for VAT, reduced the CIT rate from 32 percent to 12,
and to 6 percent for capital gains. PIT rates were lowered in 2004 and the number of taxable income
brackets was reduced to two. However, enlargement of the tax base by abolishing tax preferences and
exemptions has not accompanied the decline in rates. There is a wide spectrum of tax expenditures for
small businesses, agricultural enterprises, and software development companies. Also, numerous tax
expenditures in the form of lower CIT and lower VAT rates were granted to agricultural entities,
residents of scientific and innovation parks, companies making investments, residents of free economic
zones and recently software companies (see Table 8). Tax expenditures in agriculture alone were
estimated at 0.6 percent of GDP. Tax expenditures amounted to about 60 percent of tax collections in
agriculture and about 40 percent of budgeted direct spending on agriculture (World Bank 2015a).

64.     VAT collections, especially at customs, suffer from high noncompliance. Since 2009, VAT
revenues have lagged the dynamics in import and sales due to high share of reduced and zero-rated
supplies. The VAT tax gap was estimated at 4 percent of GDP in 2010–15, about 70 percent of which is
attributed to VAT at customs and the rest to the Tax Service (Expert-grup 2016).



                                                           37
65.    Labor taxation is complex. It ranges from relatively unprogressive taxation of full-time
employment contracts to regressive taxation of self-employed workers due to lump sum payments for
mandatory social and health contributions. The system also offers many opportunities for tax evasion
through patent payments, self-employment contracts, and capital gains. As a result, the system does not
encourage formal employment and compliance.

66.     Property tax collections are among the lowest in the region and decreasing. Because real
estate is not properly valued, taxes on property in Moldova are about 1 percent of total tax revenues,
compared to about 5 percent in OECD countries, and it is going down. There is room for higher revenue
from the property tax, if valuation is improved (Overview Note 2016).

67.      Excises are low. Excise tax revenue, 3.2 percent of GDP in 2015, was significantly lower than
the averages in the EU and Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) for the main products usually subject to
excise duties. This is particularly true for cigarettes, petroleum fuel products, and ethyl alcohol and
spirits. In 2010, total excise on cigarettes in Moldova was 5 percent of the average total excise in CEE
and only 3 percent of the average in the EU. Similarly for petrol, diesel, and ethyl alcohol, and spirits for
which total excise in Moldova was between 15 and 31 percent of total excise in the EU and CEE (IMF
2011).

68.    High estimated tax buoyancy22 may indicate that Moldova relies a lot on discretionary
revenue measures. The estimated average annual buoyancy of tax revenues for 1999–2013 was 1.5
(Papaphilippou 2014). Such a relatively high coefficient could indicate heavier reliance on discretionary
measures, compared to an automatic revenue response to changes in nominal GDP. In Moldova, annual
laws on the budget and on fiscal policy incorporate policy measures that could be codified and not
change every year. The discretionary nature of the Moldova tax system is amplified by the large
number of taxes, which complicates administration and tax policy making.

69.    Tax administration has recently improved. Moldova has made substantial progress with
respect to the time it takes to comply with tax requirements (Figure 57). This declining trend in
compliance transaction costs was brought about by the introduction of the e-declaration system, online
payment for some taxes, and the reduction in the number of declarations.




22   Tax buoyancy is an indicator to measure the responsiveness of revenue mobilization to changes in GDP.

70.     However, improving services is hampered by perceptions of corruption and weakness in
the tax administration. According to BEEPs (2013), about 14 percent of companies had to pay bribes
in their interaction with tax administration, and small businesses were disproportionally affected
(Figure 58). At the same time, weaknesses in tax administration, including inadequate attention to large
taxpayers, a focus on minor compliance matters, a lack of integrity in taxpayer registration, and
underdeveloped risk management throughout the tax process, all encourage the informal economy.
This leads to unfair competition: according to the 2013 BEEPs, 32.3 percent of companies reported that
they must compete against unregistered or informal firms. The State Tax Service (STS) recently
improved risk profiling for selecting large taxpayers for comprehensive audits. As a result, the number
of audits went down from 971 in 2012 to 543 in 2014, while collections from audits went up from 39 to
46 MDL million. However, information-matching (other than VAT purchase to sales) continues to be
manual because information systems are fragmented. Reinforcing and expanding STS risk-based
compliance management by targeting registration, filing, and payment will enhance the efficiency and
increase revenue collection.

appoints the heads of local offices but all
other staff recruitment and human

organizations, such as the Customs
Service, have centralized management of

from the talent available and efficient allocation of staff in response to business needs. A gap analysis of
management systems conducted by the Internal Control Directorate identified a lack of process

                                                    39
descriptions, criteria for performance assessments to measure the efficiency of various tax functions,
inadequate human and financial resources, and risks in key business processes. The lack of mobility of
staff, nontransparent procedures, and poor oversight of local operations leads to a poor governance
environment and undermines STS effectiveness in managing taxpayer compliance (see Box 6 for how
the Slovak Republic dealt with similar problems).

 Box 6: Tax Reform in the Slovak Republic
 In 2004 Slovakia introduced a reform to make the tax system simple, easy to administer, and neutral
 to different types of income. It decided to shift more tax burden from direct to indirect taxation, since direct
 taxes represented more than 50 percent of tax revenues. The authorities decided to take care of social and
 distributional policy not though taxation but through spending policy, such as means-testing benefits to the
 poor. The tax reform had the following features:
        Broader base and lower income tax rates. Almost all exemptions and specific lower tax rates from
    CIT and PIT were cancelled, notably for new firms, substantially broadening the tax base and aligning
    investment incentives with EU state aid rules. The broader base made possible the CIT rate reduction from
    25 to 19 percent without negative fiscal impact. Three PIT brackets were replaced by a single rate of 19
    percent and a substantial non-taxable amount to ensure progressivity.
        Special regime for the self-employed. Self-employed persons have to pay only half the social
    security contribution rate (35.2 percent) and taxes on 60 percent of their income. This policy is currently
    being reconsidered because it has created legal opportunities for evasion; the number of self-employed
    has increased to 20 percent of labor force. Slovak authorities are also thinking about abolishing mandatory
    healthcare contributions and including them in general taxation.
        Cancelation of “unproductive” taxes. Slovakia completely abolished several taxes that had low
    returns: inheritance, property transfer, dividend tax, several local taxes. The social impacts were
    calculated and a tax bonus (negative income tax) on families with children was introduced.
           Single VAT rate. The differentiated VAT rates of 10 and 23 percent were unified at 19 percent.
           Higher excises. The authorities steeply increased excises on petrol, alcohol, and tobacco.
 The tax reform turned out to be almost revenue neutral and contributed to higher growth. A
 comparison of the estimated tax revenues that would have been received in 2004 without reform and the
 revenues actually received suggests that the decline in PIT revenues (estimated at 0.8 percent of GDP) and CIT
 revenues (0.8 percent of GDP) was almost entirely offset by the increase in VAT revenues (0.8 percent of GDP)
 and excise revenues (0.6 percent of GDP). In the 10 years after 2004, Slovakia grew 3.9 percent on average,
 one of the top three fastest-growing economies among new EU member states.

            Recommendations

Moldova’s tax system can be made simpler, more efficient, and more revenue-enhancing. A
simple tax system is easier to administer and has lower transaction costs for businesses. One step
toward a simpler system would be to reduce or remove various tax privileges and special treatments,
though additional steps may be needed to reap more revenue without raising tax rates. In the short
term, additional revenues might supplement expenditure measures to ensure fiscal sustainability, since
the economy is confronting a number of external and climate-related shocks. In the longer term,
Moldova would need to find substitutes for external grants, which would gradually become a relatively
smaller source of revenue. The authorities are invited to consider the following recommendations:

            Reduce tax preferences. Rather than raising nominal tax rates, the government should
             concentrate the efforts on increasing tax productivity by reducing the scope for exemptions

                                                          40
    and preferential rates. Closure of VAT loopholes has the highest revenue potential, given the
    number of exempted, reduced, and zero VAT rates and the high VAT administration costs. Of
    particular concern is the preferential treatment of agricultural products, passenger
    transport, and financial services. Fiscal preferences, such as zero-rated VAT supplies in the
    Free Economic Zones could be replaced by provision of targeted services (World Bank
    2015b). The authorities could also consider introducing VAT taxation of cars. Streamlining
    the tax deduction and the VAT refund process and discouraging or better analyzing credit
    VAT will reduce the tax gap and fraudulent activities. The preferential CIT rates for farmers,
    SMEs, and individual entrepreneurs should be standardized and y a simple and targeted
    system of tax deductions or tax bonuses introduced. The authorities could consider
    cancelling tax preferences for some types of taxable revenues and revising PIT deductions
    and exemptions, especially in those in agriculture and individual entrepreneurs.
   Improve tax administration, reduce compliance costs, and simplify the tax structure. A
    modern tax service organization could deliver better services to taxpayers. To encourage
    compliance, reduce burdensome bureaucratic requirements to ensure easy registration,
    filing, accurate declarations, and risk-based analysis. Here indirect methods applied on
    taxation of high-wealth individuals and making the large taxpayer units more efficient is
    vital. In drafting the new Tax Code, consider a simpler tax structure. At the moment, over 90
    percent of budget revenues are collected from nine taxes, but there are over 100 different
    taxes, fees, and other sources of revenue.
   Over the medium term raise excises in line with the EU integration agenda. The excise
    rates need to increase gradually in line with the EU requirements. The authorities could also
    abolish excises on certain products (gold, caviar, electro, coffee, crystal glass, etc.) where tax
    administration costs more than the revenues from taxation of these items brings in.
   Make the PIT more progressive by increasing the nontaxable amount to the minimum
    living standard. In addition, the one-off patent payments could be replaced by an easy-to-
    administer tax deduction for self-employed professionals in order to assure that labor
    taxation is more progressive for everyone.
   Improve property valuation to collect more from real estate taxes. Collections could go
    up significantly if the value of assets was adjusted to market value.

Annex 2: Data and Methodology for Econometric Estimation of Determinants of Private
Savings
        The data sources used in this empirical exercise are World Development Indicators (WDI) and
the publications of the National Bureau of Statistics of the Republic of Moldova. The analysis is based on
the entire coverage period of 1997–2014 less one year lost due to differencing. The WDI cover a large
number of variables, such as gross savings as a percent of GDP, GDP per capita (PPP, current
international dollars), deposit interest rates, and the real effective exchange rate index. Unfortunately,
it does not decompose public and private gross savings. However, the National Bureau of Statistics
provides a breakdown of savings by nonfinancial organizations, financial organizations, public
administration, services rendered to the population, and households. Thus, it was possible to construct
private gross savings and public gross savings series by applying the share of public savings in total
savings calculated by the National Bureau of Statistics to the gross savings obtained from WDI. The
National Bureau of Statistics also provided fiscal variables, since data for recent years are not available
in WDI. Fiscal variables are available for 2000–2014, and these were extrapolated back to 1997 by
using the rate of changes obtained from the WDI data.
        The Augmented Dickey-Fuller unit root test was applied to all variables to check whether all
series are stationary. However, the results suggest that most of the variables have trends and are non-
stationary in levels. Thus, the analysis took first differences of all variables except real GDP per capital
and the real exchange rate in order to make the series stationary. Real GDP per capita and the real
exchange rate were made stationary by taking log differences to make them stationary. The estimation
uses OLS with HAC VCov Matrix.
