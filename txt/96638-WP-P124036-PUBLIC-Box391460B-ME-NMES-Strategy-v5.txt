This note examines key stages of national monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems’ development in different country
contexts and argues for tailored approaches to building M&E capacities. The development of national monitoring and
evaluation systems (NMESs) rests on four building blocks—vision of leadership, an enabling environment, capacity to
supply and analyze M&E information, and capacity to demand and use M&E information. Developing countries can
differ significantly in their performance along these four dimensions—some have virtually no NMES, while others are at a
much more advanced stage where reliable and timely M&E information is generated and used. Most developing countries
likely fall in between. Using the example of five African countries, this note discusses the differences and similarities in
capacity-building needs for countries at different levels of NMES development.
