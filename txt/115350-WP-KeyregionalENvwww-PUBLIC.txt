Innovation potential is higher in Pod-

entrepreneurship is holding both re-

Innovation Scorecard,20 developed by
the European Commission, Podkarpac-

(second lowest out of four categories),
while Œwiêtokrzyskie falls into a cate-
gory of modest innovators (the lowest
category). (Figure 22) Podkarpackie was

have seen one of the largest increases
in the value of this indicator between
2004 and 2010, and after a decline
in 2010-12 it has continued improving
its innovation performance in the last
four years. The main strength of the Pod-

Basic infrastructure

Basic infrastructure investments and
maintenance remain important, but
are not a constraint to growth. Invest-
ment in basic infrastructure is a crucial
foundation of economic development
and competitiveness, and shouldn’t be
overlooked. In fact, providing access to
basic infrastructure is one of the key
policies to drive spatial convergence of
welfare in developed countries. How-
ever, evidence suggests that even in lag-
ging regions of Poland, the basic infra-
structure coverage has reached levels
where it can no longer be seen as a sub-
stantial constraint for economic deve-
lopment.

The weakness of water supply and
sewerage systems in Œwiêtokrzyskie

resolved, and only targeted invest-
