                          Appendix 3 – Analysis of Survey Results
     It is important to note that this study was not commissioned to evaluate the results of RDRP vocational training.
     Therefore, the main focus of the researchers was on identifying factors that result in success and developing learning
     for future DDR vocational training activities in the region and beyond.
     This Annex provides the reader with a detailed analysis of survey results by (i) demographics, education, vocation,
     (ii) disability status, and (iii) former military affiliation.
     Results by Demographics, Education and Vocation:
     In addition to an overall analysis of the survey data from the entire sample, data analysis was conducted for each of
     the three main sample sub-groups: Group A – VSW Vocational Training graduates, Group B – VSW Apprentice-
     ship graduates, and Group C – ex-combatant non-participants. Following is an analysis of the survey data related to
     demographics, education and vocation which compares results between the three primary sub-groups.
     Demographics
     Demographic data collected on the
     overall sample varied little between the                       Table 2 – Armed Group by Sample Group
     core sample group (Group A) and the
     two control groups (Group B and Group                                   Vocational      Apprentice-       Non-Partici-
     C). Of the overall sample, 70.1% of Group                                Training       ship Group        pant Group
     A consisted of former Rwanda Defence                                    Group (A)           (B)               (B)
     Forces (RDF), while 29.9% formerly
                                                       Ex-Military (RDF)        115               30               42
     belonged to Armed Groups (AG). Group
     B and C had similar ratios (66.7%/33.3%           Ex-Armed Group            49               15               16
     and 72.4%/27.6% respectively).
     The mean year of demobilization for vocational training respondents (Group A) respondents was 2003, ranging
     from 1997 to 2009. Group A respondents spent an average of 8.50 years in armed groups while Group B averaged
     a slightly higher 9.20 years, and Group C averaging the highest with 10.71 years in armed groups. The long average
     duration since reintegration indicates that respondents have had a long time to reintegrate economically and socially
     which is likely to be a factor contributing to positive training outcomes.
     The mean age of the primary sample group was just over 37 years of age (Group B and C were 38 and 39 respective-
     ly). Respondent ages ranged from 22 to 55 years of age. These results were slightly higher than that of the latest tracer
     study which produced a mean age of 36 from 371 respondents (Rwanda SEDRP Survey 2012/13). The higher
     mean age of ex-combatants in Rwanda over other TDRP countries could be related to the timeframe and nature
     of the fighting in Rwanda. Key stakeholders interviewed frequently stated that ex-combatants who had completed
     vocational training tended to be much older than their apprenticeship or non-participant counterparts. The demo-
     graphic data collected for this study, however, does not support this claim.
     Sex of respondents was distributed similarly across all three groups with a clear majority of the sample (98.9%) being
     male. Therefore, no meaningful analysis could be conducted on the basis of gender. In general, it can be challenging
     to perform analysis disaggregated by gender in Rwanda because there are few registered female ex-combatants in
     comparison to males. According to RDRC statistics, only 425 females have been demobilized to date compared with
     67,972 males. Additionally, only 3% of the most recent tracer sample was composed of women.




64
Of the primary sample group, 81.6% were married, 9.2% had never married, 6.1% were cohabitating but not married,
2.5% were currently separated, and less than 1% were widowed. Much higher percentages of the two control groups
responded with “cohabitating,” with 22.2% of Group B and 13.6% of Group C responding in this manner. About
77.1% of the recent tracer was married with 13.2% reporting cohabitation.
Mean number of dependents for all respondents was 4.21. The number of dependents ranged from 0 to 10 across
the sample with little variation in average and distribution across the three groups. Tracer respondents averaged a
similar 4.66 dependents.
Demographics of the respondents appeared to play a role in vocational training factors, particularly with regards to
age, length of time since demobilization, and marriage status. Generally, it seems that more time in terms of reinte-
gration and maturity, relates to better outcomes which will be explored in more detail in later sections.
Education
In Rwanda, an ex-combatant’s eligibility for participation in DDR vocational training and apprenticeship programs
was based on eligibility for assistance through VSW. The level of vulnerability of the individual (and thus their
VSW eligibility) was determined via criteria outlined in the RDRP “Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration
Commission Project Implementation Manual” (2002). Key factors included shelter and land access, possession of
marketable skills, valuable assets and dependents, and whether the individual had a permanent disability. Education
was not a key factor in determining VSW eligibility. However, all participants of the vocational training program
were required to meet basic education prerequisites such as the completion of formal education at the P6 level
(completion of primary school) or higher as well as pass basic literacy and numeracy exams. All illiterate but other-
wise eligible ex-combatants were requested to attend literacy and numeracy training prior to joining vocational skills
training. Such competencies were not prerequisites for participation in the Apprenticeship program.
The VSW criteria above suggest the existence of a compelling contrast in education levels and competencies
between vocational training and non-vocational training participants amongst the greater ex-combatant population
in Rwanda. While the results of this study indicate some distinction in education levels along these lines, a more
pronounced contrast did not materialize as expected. Unsurprisingly, the mode level of education across all groups
was Primary 6 (P6), the minimum grade-level qualifier for VSW vocational training. It is surprising, however, that
41.5% of Group B had completed P6 prior to training. While only 31.6% of Group A reported P6 as the highest level
completed, the average top grade level completed for that group exceeds Group B by 0.16 percentage points and
Group C by 0.41 percentage points.
Of the Group A (vocational training) respondents, 98.8% reported the ability to read and write, while 95.6% of
Group B (apprenticeship) and 86.4% of Group C (non-participant) respondents indicated reading and writing abili-
ties. This pattern of distinction between Group A and B was expected but to a much greater extent given the selec-
tion criteria for vocational training. Further, the percentage of literate respondents among Group C was anticipated
to be much higher given that these individuals were deemed by their exclusion in the VSW to be less “vulnerable.”
Nevertheless, as education did not play a key role in VSW selection, this figure might have fluctuated in either direc-
tion. When asked whether they were currently continuing their studies, only 3.1% of Group A and 3.4% of Group B
responded “yes.” All of Group B respondents responded “no” to this question.
Vocation
Survey questions in this section probed facets of vocation such as income generation, household income, unem-
ployment, work in the area of training, and business skills knowledge.
Of the respondents, 81.5% of Group A, 80% of Group B, and 84% of Group C identified themselves as currently
employed in some capacity. About a third of the respondents cited employment in the private sector as their primary




                                                                         MAKING VOCATIONAL TRAINING WORK: A Study of Vocational Training in DDR   65
     source of income while around 20% of both Group A and Group B said they generate the majority of their income
     from self-employment related to agriculture. Further, just over 20% of vocational and apprenticeship trainees were
     found to be self-employed in a vocational trade albeit not necessarily in their area of DDR training. Around 40%
     of both vocational and apprenticeship trainees affirmed that they have worked in their area of DDR training in the
     past. Those who cited a secondary source of income most frequently mentioned self-employment in agricultural
     activities. Possible factors driving self-employment, skills use and sector-shifting are explored in greater detail in
     later sections.
     Of employed respondents, very few described themselves as being reliant on the informal economic sector. These
     results tally with recent tracer results as well, as only 1.6% of that sample reported generating income from informal
     sector activities. Around 80% of respondents in each of the three groups reported that they work all year round. Ad-
     ditionally, fewer than 75% of Group A and non-VSW participants alike reported contributing 100% of their house-
     hold income, while 47.6% of Group B beneficiaries reported being the sole contributor. Such findings stand in stark
     contrast with the circumstances of ex-combatants in neighboring countries such as Uganda and DRC where large
     numbers of ex-combatants have frequently generated high percentages of their income from informal livelihoods
     activities such as street peddling and hustling.
     It must be noted here that the economic situation throughout Rwanda differs from other TDRP countries due in large
     part to significant growth in foreign investment, built on peace and political and economic stability achieved over
     the last decade. Regardless of the cause of the high numbers reported, the absence of significant variance between
     respondents who completed DDR skills training and those who did not is notable in itself. While such results could
     be interpreted negatively with regard to formal training, given that the non-participant Group C received no such
     formal DDR training and still emerged ahead of the other two groups in terms of current employment rates, alter-
     natively they indicate the success of the VSW in bringing the most economically vulnerable ex-combatants to parity
     with less vulnerable ex-combatants.
     Data pertaining to present and past Income Generating Activities (IGAs) further indicate the success of ex-combat-
     ants who have undergone vocational training:
     Of those who identified as unemployed, 78.3% of Group A reported having worked since demobilization which
     contrasted considerably with just 20% of Group B and 10% of Group C respondents reporting having worked since
     demobilization.
     Of Group A, 53.1% reported having generated income from a vocational trade, compared with just 36.5% of Group
     B and 11.0% of Group C.
     In terms of income generation from

     access to skills training or resources,
     given the Rwanda DDR context and VSW selection criteria. Land access played a central role in assessing vulner-
     ability for VSW selection. Therefore, it was assumed that non-VSW participants would have had greater access to




66
land and thus would have been more likely to take advantage of agriculture-associated income-generating opportu-
nities. However, this would likely not have been the case for VSW Groups A and B, and given that less than 2.5% of
respondents in both groups received VSW training in agricultural activities.
With regards to employment and vocation, the sample reported similar rates in some areas, though key outcomes
were found to vary significantly by training status in other key areas. Across all three groups, there appeared to be
little variation in terms of employment rates, job stability and percent of household contribution, signaling that the
VSW had likely met its objectives in bringing economically vulnerable ex-combatants up to par with those deemed
least vulnerable. Also, very few of the respondents were found to be engaged in the informal economic sector, which
is a departure from ex-combatant livelihoods experiences in neighboring DDR countries. In terms of notable varia-
tion across groups, vocational training and apprenticeship graduates were found to be self-employed at higher rates
than those who did not receive DDR skills training, and vocational training graduates surpassed non-vocational
training respondents in the areas of employment since demobilization, generating income from vocational work,
and working on non-agriculture related work.
Results by Disability Status
Analysis of the survey results also involved disaggregating Group A data based on whether or not the respondent
was disabled. Of vocational training beneficiaries surveyed, 25% (41 respondents) were disabled. Demographics
and survey results were comparable across the two sub-groups with the few notable exceptions described in this
section. While it was not within the scope of this study to probe type of disability or the extent to which respondents
were impaired by their disability in terms of securing employment, identifying and understanding factors impacting
specifically on one of the largest vulnerable sub-groups of ex-combatants is crucial for overall understanding of the
efficacy and sustainability of service delivery and benefits of vocational training.
In terms of self-employment, more than twice the
percentage of non-disabled Group A respondents           Table 6 – Business Skills Knowledge by Disability Status
was currently self-employed (27.6% vs. 12.2% of
disabled). The non-disabled group consistently                                    Disabled         Not Disabled
reported higher knowledge levels in skill areas crucial
for successful self-employment in the surveys. On a        Marketing                0.60               0.83
scale of 0 to 3 (“3” being “possessing a lot of knowl-
edge,” and “0” being “possessing no knowledge”), the       Accounting               0.51               0.74
mean values for non-disabled group responses was
0.83 in marketing, 0.74 in accounting, 0.67 in com-        Communication            0.57               0.67
munication and 0.97 in management. In compari-             Management               0.71               0.97
son, mean values for the disabled group were 0.60,
0.51, 0.57, and 0.71 respectively. On average, neither
group reported significant levels of knowledge for any of the given subject areas. What is significant is the consis-
tency with which the non-disabled group rated themselves, about 0.2 percentage points higher in every area.
Unemployment was slightly higher among the disabled (19.5% vs. 14.6%). Among those who were unemployed,
80% of disabled respondents characterized their chances of finding work in the near future as “poor,” while only
50% of the non-disabled group responded the same. 87.5% of the sub-group with disabilities reported working
the whole year through (compared with 74.3% of the sub-group with no disabilities). Results suggest that while
it may have been more difficult for disabled ex-combatants to initially secure employment, the livelihoods of their
non-disabled counterparts may have been more itinerant in nature due to higher levels of physical ability, mobility
or higher threshold for risk. Compared with non-disabled ex-combatants there is little difference in employment
sectors: 21.6% of the disabled group were employed in private security, compared with 22.5% of non-disabled; 8.1%
of each group was employed as mechanics; and 5.4% of each group as plumbers. The only sector in which there was




                                                                         MAKING VOCATIONAL TRAINING WORK: A Study of Vocational Training in DDR   67
     a noticeable difference was agriculture where 24.3% of disabled were actively generating income compared to 18%
     of non-disabled. An analysis of reasons for choosing skills area revealed that physical disability was not a major factor
     in choosing a training skill (10.5% of disabled respondents).
     With regards to economic cooperatives, 47.5% of those with disabilities compared to only 26.0% of non-disabled re-
     spondents reported being in a cooperative. Of those who were involved in cooperatives, the largest single sub-group
     of disabled respondents (40.9%) felt that being in a cooperative facilitated the use of their skills but did not help
     generate more income whereas the largest single sub-group of non-disabled respondents (36.8%) felt that coopera-
     tives helped them generate more income but did not facilitate the use of their skills.
     The equity of data results across both groups for the remainder of survey responses would suggest that disability was
     not a major factor in training outcomes for the sample. However, results related to business skills, unemployment
     and cooperative participation suggest areas for further research to determine whether endogenous or exogenous
     factors are at play and why.
     Results by Former Military Affiliation
     As part of the data analysis, survey results of Group A were further disaggregated by armed group (ex-military
     (RDF) and non-military ex-armed group).
     As previously stated, 71.1% of Group A was ex-RDF and 29.9% was non-RDF ex-combatant. About half of each
     armed group was interviewed in Kigali with the remaining respondents distributed throughout the other two survey
     regions. Ex-RDF respondents were slightly older with an average 38 years of age compared to a mean age of 35 for
     non-RDF. Average year of demobilization and number of years spent in the armed group was around 2003 and
     8-9 years, respectively. A slightly higher percentage of Ex-armed Group identified themselves as “disabled” (30.6%
     compared to 22.8% of ex-military). Both groups possessed similarly high literacy rates with an overall average of
     98.8% of respondents able to read and write.
     In terms of vocation, both groups compared quite closely in most areas of the survey with a few notable exceptions.
     Of unemployed ex-RDF beneficiaries, 86.7% revealed that they had worked in some capacity since demobilization,
     while 57.1% of unemployed ex-armed group beneficiaries responded similarly. A much higher percentage of ex-armed
     group beneficiaries are currently using their skills (75.5% vs. 35.1% of ex-military). One explanation for this discrep-
     ancy could be linked to private security employment given that income generation from the private security sector
     was far more frequently mentioned among ex-RDF (28.8% vs. 6.7% of ex-armed groups). Such findings could be
     related to something as simple as security firm employers seeking a level of solace in hiring those who had received
     combat training from the national military rather than a “rebel” or fringe group. The key question here is whether
     the ex-military respondents were using their skills less because of greater access to private security employment or
     whether they were working in private
     security in higher numbers because
     they were as a group less prepared or ill-         Table 5 – Employment Overview by Former military Affiliation
     equipped in their respective skill areas.

tools. No respondents from the “ex-other” group (0.00%) mentioned this as a factor. Further, no ex-RDF respon-
dents (0.00%) cited any responses akin to getting a job in another field (i.e. private security) as the reason for not
using their skills.
In terms of business skills knowledge, ex-RDF respondents consistently rated themselves higher in all areas surveyed.
In the knowledge areas of marketing, accounting, communication and management, ex-RDF responses averaged
between 0.73 and 0.96 on a scale of 0 to 3 (“0” being no knowledge and “3” being “a lot”), while non-RDF responses
averaged between 0.43 and 0.73 over the four areas. Yet, these results do not appear to tally with entrepreneurship
skills training received during vocational training, as nearly twice as many ex-RDF (40.4%) stated that they received
no such training (compared with 26.5% of non-RDF). One hypothesis for explaining this apparent dichotomy could
be that ex-RDF acquired the aforementioned skills during their time in the military. Regardless of how these indi-
viduals may have acquired such skills, the survey results gave no indication that possessing pre-acquired business
skills has had any direct effect on overall economic outcomes. In fact, the ex-armed group overall consistently rated
their economic situation higher than ex-military with an average rating of 3.06 on an ordinal scale of 1 to 5 compared
to an average rating of 2.85 offered by the ex-military group. Percentage-wise, 31.3% of ex-RDF rated their situation
as worse than the majority of other ex-combatants while only 12.2% of ex-armed groups rated themselves the same.
Analysis disaggregated by armed group revealed that ex-military and ex-armed group respondents offered compa-
rable responses with a few notable exceptions. Surveys found that far higher percentages of unemployed ex-RDF
beneficiaries had been employed than non-RDF while far higher numbers of non-RDF were currently using their
skills. Ex-military respondents generally rated themselves higher in terms of business skills knowledge but it was
unclear where such knowledge was acquired given that nearly half of ex-RDF reported not receiving business skills
training during vocational training. Further, ex-armed group respondents rated their economic situations and ability
to support self/family much higher than their ex-military counterparts.

      33.	 Reinsertion is the first part of the reintegration process. It includes an initial three-month period of assistance to help ex-combatants meet their minimum
           basic needs from the day of discharge, including a Basic Needs Kit (BNK), and Recognition-of-Service Allowances (RSA) for regular military personnel.
           Armed Group dependents are also provided with a BNK as well as basic support and rehabilitation services.
      34.	 Of 28,441 ex-combatants demobilized in Stage II of RDRP (2002-2008), 25,981 received Reintegration Grant. According to 2002 PIM, the ex-
           combatants were provided with a RG of FRw 100,000 six months after demobilization. There were no changes to the time frame and RG amount in a
           revised PIM dated 2007.
      35.	 The VSW is provided to ex-combatants of stage I and II, who remain vulnerable after having exhausted all their previous benefits. According to RDRC, a
           total of 35,699 ex-combatants have benefitted from the VSW (as of 2009).
      36.	 The eligibility criteria to receive support through VSW was updated in 2007 and currently, the criteria include the following (i) Lack of shelter, (ii) Lack
           of land, (iii) Lack of marketable skills/steady income or valuable assets, and having more than five dependents, and (iv) Permanent disability/chronic
           illness.

37.	 A GTZ-Kf W evaluation of the RDRP noted the added value of the vocational training in terms of scaling-up in 2006.
38.	 The RDRC and representatives of ex-combatants conduct monitoring of the quality of training provided on a routine basis. In addition, the newly
     established Workforce Development Authority carries out evaluations which culminate in the issuance of certificates of completion of the training.
39.	 The RDRC also works with experts for each trade from the VTCs to discuss the content and quality of the toolkits. These experts also verify the quality of
     the toolkits before they are delivered to the beneficiaries.
40.	 Kingma, Post-war Demobilization and the Re-integration of Ex-combatants into Civilian Life.
41.	 More than USD 200 million in financing went to reintegration components of MDRP-TDRP supported DDR programs in the last decade (figures in
     USD): Angola: 88 million, Burundi: 20.9 million, CAR: 8,6 million, Democratic Republic of Congo: USD 45 million, Republic of Congo: 16,5 million,
     Rwanda: 26,5 million, Uganda: 3,5 million.

45.	 An evaluation conducted by the GTZ and KFW in 2010 (on the Stage II of EDRP) rated the program and the reintegration component “good” in terms
     of sustainability.
46.	 It is important to note that this study was not commissioned to evaluate the results of RDRP vocational training. Therefore the main focus of the
     researchers was on identifying factors that result in success and developing learning for future DDR vocational training activities. Please see Appendix 4
     to see a detailed analysis of survey results by demographics, education, vocation, disability status, and former military affiliation.
47.	 Unavailability constituted exceeded capacity of courses and absence of skills program, courses or instructors in the preferred skill area.

56.	 Here, the context behind “toolkits” answer is related to the fact that tools and supplies received during DDR have become obsolete or have lost their
     applicability in the trade due to changing technology and market demands. It is important to note that all beneficiaries received toolkits and supplies
     based on the training they received in Rwanda.
57.	 The value and importance that beneficiaries place on a DDR training program (their buy-in) is a critical factor that resulted in successful outcomes and it
     is essential that further attention be devoted to understanding what in Rwanda DDR or the social and cultural context is driving such attitudes and beliefs,
     which is discussed further in the study.

      79.	 Further, when respondents were asked if they ever had quarrels with neighbors, more than 92.2 percent reported “No, Never,” while this figure is higher
           (94.9 percent) when asked if they had quarrel with the local government officials. The 2012 Tracer Study found similar trends with regards to quarrels
           with family (86.5 percent “No, Never” and friends (93.3 percent “No, Never). A majority of respondents (70 percent) said they feel close to the people in
           the community.

      90.	 According to the anecdotes from the key informant interviews and observations, “having a family,” with respect to ex-combatants, appears to be an
           indication of maturity and responsibility. Generally, an ex-combatant who has a family is expected to be mature, determined and more eager to work.

         people we interviewed, at least.
