         Produced by the World Bank’s Social, Urban, Rural & Resilience Global Practice,
         the Urban Development Series discusses the challenge of urbanization and what
         it will mean for developing countries in the decades ahead. The Series aims to
         explore and delve more substantively into the core issues framed by the World
         Bank’s 2009 Urban Strategy Systems of Cities: Harnessing Urbanization for
         Growth and Poverty Alleviation. Across the five domains of the Urban Strategy,
         the Series provides a focal point for publications that seek to foster a better
         understanding of (i) the core elements of the city system, (ii) pro-poor policies,
         (iii) city economies, (iv) urban land and housing markets, (v) sustainable urban
         environment, and other urban issues germane to the urban development agenda
         for sustainable cities and communities.

Organic waste management is a growing global concern as cities experience increasing waste
generation and the associated climate impact. Traditionally, municipal waste has been managed
using a range of solutions, from advanced technologies, such as well-designed sanitary landfills
in high capacity countries, to open dumping and burning in low-capacity countries. However,
with rising consumption, scarce land, and escalating environmental impact, alternate waste
treatment mechanisms are needed—ideally by “closing the loop” on the world’s raw materials
rather than allowing the negative impact of waste to compound.

Composting is a sustainable organics management solution that can potentially be low cost
and require less technical capacity than alternative treatment methods. While the technical
solutions available for municipal-level composting are well understood, the financing models
and policy environments that create a conducive atmosphere are less so.

Since municipal solid waste generation is expected to continue rising, especially in low- and
middle-income countries, along with the associated greenhouse gas emissions, this report
attempts to understand how cities can more sustainably manage organic waste through
composting. This research focuses on successful municipal-level composting models and the
social, policy, and financial environments that enabled them. Starting with the pre-conditions
needed in the initial planning phase to potential financing models and supportive policies that
apply throughout, this report walks through the key factors a city must deliberate prior to
pursuing composting as a waste management solution.

The anticipated audience for this work includes practitioners and policy makers. Readers are
assumed to have basic technical knowledge related to composting but are not required to be
experts in technology, policy, or financing matters. There is no single model that is applicable
to all cities, rather, this report presents various financing and policy trends among successful
operations in low- and middle-income countries. These common themes can serve as a starting
point for building a composting sector, but the specific models appropriate for waste collection,
composting operations, scale, production, and distribution will differ by city.

While many models of composting have been tested, the following qualities were consistent
for the successful projects studied within the report. With regards to capital expenditures, all
received external funding support to establish operations. However, all later became financially
self-sufficient through a mix of operational revenues. While for a period of time carbon markets
provided a financial incentive, the most salient revenue sources today are tipping fees, compost
sales supplemented by sale of related services or goods, and importantly, avoided disposal costs.
The compost produced in these cases targeted a specific customer segment and benefited from
quality assurance measures that are standardized by policy.

Composting rates have been low in developing countries but are growing slowly at all scales.
Composting is being adopted as an organic waste management strategy as well as a way to
address climate change and agricultural needs. However, it is a solution that has been widely
unsuccessful in low and middle income countries for a number of reasons including technical,
financing and policy issues. This report focuses on the financing and policy environment that
could lead to successful composting projects and the preconditions that must be in place
before considering composting as an option.

Composting plants in developing countries operate in a fragile market. Consumers face
competing products that can provide fast-acting results and are cheaper due to fertilizer subsidies.
However, compost provides many advantages to the end user, varying from land restoration,
moisture retention, and long-term crop nutrition. This paper discusses a number of operational
strategies, reflecting on composting operations that have been succeeded and failed. These include
designing an end product that fits a specific customer and end use, manufacturing high-quality
compost from uncontaminated feedstock, utilizing quality assurance schemes and branding, and
deploying business-savvy marketing and distribution schemes.

While all steps from determining a market to distributing compost products are important,
a common failure seen globally is with regards to the feedstock utilized. A lesson learned
repeatedly throughout the world is that pure organic materials will result in a higher quality
compost product than contaminated organic materials. Agricultural waste and market waste
tend to be the cleanest, most accessible inputs; however, some cities have experimented with
mixed municipal solid waste (MSW) derived compost which quickly harms the reputation
and development of the sector when not managed properly. There are opportunities to utilize
source-separated MSW if strict quality enforcement exists.

Market considerations are only one piece of a complex puzzle. Other essential success factors
for composting projects lie in the project’s financial management and the policy environment
of the locality. On the financial management side, experience has shown that while grants and
loans are necessary for the initial buildout of the facility, operating costs must be financially
self-sufficient. Aside from gate fees and sale of compost, projects have diversified their revenues
through collection fees, sales of recyclables, consulting and educational services, and while
markets were supportive, carbon credits. As evident within the upcoming narratives, financing
strategies vary greatly by model and region.

Even if a composting project is soundly planned and financed, a plant cannot succeed without
the support of an enabling policy environment. Policies that nurture the development of a
composting sector include landfill taxes and organic waste disposal bans that channel feedstock
to organic composting methods. In contrast, policies that stifle composting projects include
those that create an uneven playing field between compost and fertilizers through subsidies

                             and those that force organic waste treatment facilities to compete for feedstock. Ensuring that
                             policies are aligned to support composters requires coordination between all stakeholders:
                             national and municipal governments, NGOs, financiers, and the private sector. Beyond these
                             policies, which help develop the composting sector, quality assurance of the product is a
                             necessary mechanism to sustain operations.

                             While municipal-scale composting has traditionally been more successful in upper-middle and
                             high-income countries than low-income countries, tried and true models are slowly paving a
                             path for this cost-effective organics management technique around the world.


                             Report Approach and Structure

                             This report will provide an overview of optimal market conditions, common financing options,
                             and enabling policy environments for composting projects globally. In order to understand
                             the success factors of current composting practices, field research was commissioned in seven
                             countries and one region: Austria, Bangladesh, Brazil, Ghana, India, Sri Lanka, Uganda,
                             and Europe. Municipal-level composting is being undertaken nationally in these countries.
                             However, each composting project occurs within differing circumstances and incentive
                             structures. In practice, composting projects vary as much by national directions and practices
                             as the social, policy, and economic environment of the city or locality—these case studies
                             highlight the interplay between national and local conditions that enable the projects’ success.
                             This report is structured as follows:

                             ●● Chapter 1 introduces background information on composting generally and discusses the
                                opportunities and challenges faced in developing countries
                             ●● Chapter 2 provides an overview of prevailing market conditions and strategies that would

                                ideally lead to a sustainable composting sector
                             ●● Chapter 3 details common financing mechanisms for composting projects that have been

                                used for composting projects globally
                             ●● Chapter 4 discusses the policy environments and incentives that promote composting

                                production and market development
                             Chapters 5-10 offer the commissioned case studies that provide insights into national
                             policies and enabling environments in different geographies. These allow for learning from
                             tangible actions taken and associated outcomes. Shorter case studies or examples are provided
                             throughout the report to illustrate other global scenarios.
                             ●● Chapter 5 discusses Austria’s decentralized, agricultural model of composting

                             ●● Chapter 6 presents success factors behind Waste Concern, a private joint venture formed

                                in Bangladesh
                             ●● Chapter 7 features the organic farm model of composting in Brazil

                             ●● Chapter 8 discusses a public and private composting operation in India

                             ●● Chapter 9 describes a national grant program that powered municipal-scale composting in

                                Sri Lanka
                             ●● Chapter 10 highlights the history and development of organics recycling in Europe


                             A summary of the key lessons drawn from the global case studies is included in Table 1. For
                             ease of reading, key messages and lessons are highlighted at the beginning of relevant chapters
                             or sections throughout.

Key Messages

Compost is an increasingly relevant mechanism for organic waste management in developing countries:
●●   Waste generation is estimated to reach 22 billion tons per year by 2025, driven by population, economic
     development, and increased consumption
●●   Waste in developing countries is primarily biodegradable: up to 65–75% in low income countries
●●   45% of soils face nutrient depletion in certain areas, which is exacerbated by synthetic fertilizers
●●   Organic waste accounts for 2-4% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions


The advantages of compost are many:
●●   Cost: composting potentially reduces waste management costs by avoiding landfill fees, extending landfill
     life and reducing transportation costs
●●   Agriculture: when added to soil, compost replenishes nutrients and organic matter, sustains moisture and
     plant growth, increases plant uptake of fertilizers, prevents soil erosion and reduces irrigation requirements
●●   Environment: composting is a carbon neutral (and potentially even negative) natural degradation process.
     It reduces methane and toxic leachate generation from landfills as well as waste runoffs and algae blooms,
     which can disrupt the local ecosystem


Historically, compost projects in developing countries (particularly those dependent on municipal waste
feedstocks) have struggled and have experienced high failure rates. Implementation has been limited, and
best practice models are only developing. Only 8% of waste is composted globally, and as low as 1.5% in
low income countries. Reasons include:
●●   Lack of coordinated policies, regulations, and enforcement that support composting across multiple sectors
●●   Lack of market demand, unreliable feedstock supply, and unfair competition (synthetic fertilizer subsidies)
●●   High operating costs due to unnecessarily complex technology poorly suited to local market conditions, often
     inadvertently encouraged by grants or subsidies that are provided up-front rather than based on outputs
●●   Poor management of solid waste operations
●●   Lack of tipping fees from the municipality and other feedstock suppliers
●●   Lack of compost standards, quality control and certification systems resulting in contaminated compost and
     a bad reputation with end users
●●   Reliance on revenues from carbon emissions credits as part of the Kyoto Protocol’s Clean Development Mech-
     anism, which contracted abruptly in 2012 with the expiration of the international agreements

2 Sustainable Financing and Policy Models for Municipal Composting




  Key Messages (cont.)

  Municipal composting models are most common in upper-middle and high-income countries. However, while
  each project differs based on local circumstances, elements of successful projects have been:
  ●●   A coordinated policy environment specifically designed to encourage composting such as through organic
       waste diversion and regulations that encourage end-product use, coupled with strong enforcement
  ●●   Availability of external funding (e.g., grants and subsidies) to cover some or all of the capital investment
  ●●   Financial self-sufficiency across a mix of revenue streams (e.g., tipping fees, compost sales, sale of recycla-
       bles, sale of related services & goods, carbon credits) to cover operational expenditures
  ●●   Use of low-tech options for affordable upkeep, especially where labor and land are inexpensive
  ●●   A guaranteed stream of clean, quality feedstock, or, well-separated and processed municipal waste
  ●●   Production of a specialized product that meets the needs of a well-targeted market
  ●●   Existence of compost standards, quality control and certification systems that are trusted by consumers
  ●●   An integrated waste management approach that increases the efficiency and financial viability of compost-
       ing by streamlining waste delivery and processing, and increasing revenue opportunities
  ●●   Engaging external parties, such as farmers, NGOs, and the private sector to improve efficiency and credi-
       bility

                        Box 1. Stree Mukti Sanghatana’s Waste Management Services in Mumbai, India
     Stree Mukti Sanghatana (SMS) is a non-governmental organization that has overseen waste management operations in
     Mumbai since 1998. With over 3,000 wastepickers collecting, treating and disposing of waste on behalf of the municipal
     government in over half of Mumbai’s wards, SMS operates based on zero waste philosophies.

     In terms of organic waste management, SMS requires households to separate their waste into dry and wet waste and then
     utilizes the wet waste for composting or biogas. Wet waste in most residential areas is composted in pits on-site by the
     wastepickers, which reduces transportation costs, decreases emissions, and saves properties money by using the compost
     on-site. While services are being performed at a municipal scale, community-level composting has been chosen as an
     appropriate solution for Mumbai.

             Box 3. Survey of Common Perceptions of Compost and Reasons for Non-Use in Uganda
The composting sector in Uganda is still at an early stage. Compost production is suspected to be quite low although data on
compost production and demand is not readily available. For reference, the nine municipalities participating in the Uganda
Municipal Waste Compost Project through the World Bank Community Development Carbon Fund have a total installed
composting capacity of 70 MTPD. In 2014, none of the plants were believed to be operating at full capacity yet.

While Uganda has one of the highest soil nutrient depletion rates in the world, farmers in Uganda use extremely small
quantities of synthetic fertilizers (Majaliwa, 2012). On average, farmers use 1.8 kg of synthetic fertilizer per hectare per
year while the average usage rate across Sub-Saharan Africa is 9 kg per hectare per year (Benson et. al., 2012). The low
use is attributed to the high cost of synthetic fertilizers, a lack of knowledge, limited access and issues of poor perception.
As an alternative to synthetic fertilizers, farmers use a variety of practices including: crop rotation, intercropping, green
manureing, cover cropping with plants that are able to take nitrogen gas from the air and store it, and land fallowing, in
place of using commercial soil amendments.

The World Bank commissioned a country report on Uganda in 2014, which included collection of primary data from three
representative districts: Mukono for urban areas, Buikwe for semi-urban and Lira for rural. Data was obtained through inter-
views with 91 stakeholders including: 20 tree nursery operators, 18 potted flower nursery operators, 46 crop farmers and 7
government/NGO staff. User perspectives of compost (Table A) and the reasons for whether or not they purchase products
(Table B) illuminate the challenges of developing a robust composting market.

            Box 3. Survey of Common Perceptions of Compost and Reasons for Non-Use in Uganda (cont.)

     Of the “other” reasons cited in Table B, most common responses included:

     ●●   Lack of knowledge about the benefits of using compost
     ●●   Lack of knowledge about the safety of MSW compost
     ●●   Lack of information about the quality and composition of MSW compost
     ●●   Lack of consistency across different compost batches
     ●●   Lack of awareness about potential sources of compost
     ●●   High transportation cost and poor road networks

     ●●   The weight of compost and its bulky presentation compared to synthetic fertilizers
     Understanding market limitations offers valuable perspective on the barriers to compost sector development in Uganda.
     Survey results highlight the need for awareness building among end users to improve the perception of compost along
     with potential process improvements to increase compost quality and consistency.

   European quality assurance schemes are comprised of the following elements:

   ●●   Definition of feedstock type and quality
   ●●   Limits for contaminants (heavy metals, impurities, salt content)
   ●●   Hygiene requirements (time-temperature regime and testing of indicator pathogens)
   ●●   Quality criteria for nutrients and organic matter
   ●●   Third-party inspection and controlling of the product and the production (quality management)
   ●●   In-house control at the site for all batches (e.g., temperature, acidity, carbon dioxide levels)
   ●●   Quality label or product certificate
   ●●   Annual quality certificate for the site and its successful operations
   ●●   Product specifications for different application areas
   ●●   Recommendations for the proper use in different application areas
   ●●   Production control and process management guidelines
   ●●   Education and qualification requirements for facility operators
   ●●   Partnerships with accredited laboratories for product testing
   ●●   Process, product quality and end-use related research
   ●●   Promotion of quality standards, compost image and use
   ●●   Marketing tools




                            Box 5. An Example of a Community-level Product Certification System
   In Brazil, small-scale peasant farmers follow an unconventional certification process known as the Participatory Guarantee
   System where peer farmers evaluate each other’s products rather than a third party. It is based on mutual agreement and
   trust between producers, traders and consumers. Peasant farmers organize themselves into local groups and then form a
   commission to carry out inspections on each other’s farms and verify product compliance with national standards. Within a
   region, all of the groups come together under an umbrella organization, which is accredited and audited by the Ministry of
   Agriculture. The umbrella organization is responsible for evaluating and verifying the results and issuing certification and the
   organic stamp to the peasant farmers. This process is less expensive than through national systems, aligns with the natural
   incentives of the compost producers, facilitates the efficient dissemination of information across farmer groups, and allows
   for a continuous certification process as farmers harvest different crops each season. Farmer participation in the program
   has increased from 138 families in 2009 when the participatory certification program was first implemented to 1,793
   producers in 2014.

                           Box 6. Producing Compost from Municipal Solid Waste in Rio de Janeiro
   Waste management in Rio de Janeiro is provided by the municipal public company COMLURB (Companhia Municipal de
   Limpeza Urbana), an organization with a budget of $500 million per year, 21,000 employees, and around 1000 pieces of
   equipment (e.g., collecting trucks, front loaders, dumpster trucks, bulldozers, sweepers). Currently the majority of the 10,000
   tons per day of municipal waste generated in the city is disposed in landfills. By the end of 2016, 70 tons each day (half of
   which is organic matter) will be directed to a new biomethanization plant. This plant will produce 10 tons of compost per
   day. Approximately 9.5 tons will be used for the municipal forestation projects and the remaining 5 will be sold to farmers.
   Currently, COMLURB is producing about 5 tons of compost per day through an aerobic system, where the organic fraction
   of the MSW is decomposed in open windrows followed by a screening in a rotary trommel.

   The sale of compost to farms has been consistently and remarkably successful, unlike most municipal waste compost projects
   around the world. A driver of this success is an on-site research center at which compost is tested for quality, heavy metal
   composition, and adherence with national standards. While farmers were initially skeptical of compost produced from
   municipal waste, marketing and promotion by the city enticed farmers to conduct tests and trials. Demand increased when
   quality results were achieved. The compost was formerly used for growing citrus and coffee and is now mainly used for
   growing vegetables.

   The biomethanization plant will use 8 automated methanization tunnels to produce biogas and compost. The technology is
   simple and unsophisticated, has few moving parts, and requires minimal maintenance. Inputs are initially hand sorted before
   entering the tunnels for an anaerobic decomposition phase. Outputs include biogas (about 60% methane content) that will
   be used either for energy generation or for vehicle fuel (after purification), and the remaining organic matter will be shifted
   to a windrow system for curing and finally screened to the final product.

   The final compost product is sold at a low price to farmers (~$8/ton), of which transportation costs are a large component.
   Today, 100% of the compost produced is sold.

                                         control and testing programs
                                    ●●   Set enabling policies: Ensure that policies encourage compost demand, such as
                                         through subsidies, agricultural guidelines and organics disposal bans

                                    ●●   Use contracts: Negotiate binding contracts with the agricultural, hospitality, or
                                         market sectors for a guaranteed amount of high-quality feedstock. In return, offer

              Quality feedstock     ●●   Diversify feedstock sources: Avoid reliance on a single source of supply, while

  Key Messages
  ●●   Capital costs are often accounted for by a large upfront investment by an external organization, including
       grants from national governments and from development agencies
  ●●   Operational costs should be self-sustained through operational revenues, namely gate fees and compost
       sales, and may be supplemented by subsidies and tax agreements
  ●●   The private sector can be involved in any phase of composting and provides financing and risk mitigation in
       exchange for opportunities to earn a return
  ●●   Developmental assistance and national funding are often included in a compost project’s funding scheme
  ●●   There is no magic bullet for financing; most composting projects in developing countries are financed by 2-4
       sources in combination

                      Box 7. Debt Financing for a Private Sector Composting Project in Massachusetts
   In the late 1990s, KeyBank, a US commercial bank, debt financed two privately owned and operated composting facilities
   in Nantucket and Marlborough, Massachusetts. KeyBank evaluated the projects across the following basic criteria:

   ●●   Was the composting technology well established and currently operating at other facilities?
   ●●   Was the investment adequate in size to be attractive to KeyBank (minimum $5 million investment required)?
   ●●   Was the team comprised of strong and reputable team members?
   ●●   Had permits been approved or were they forthcoming?
   ●●   Did owner equity reach 20-30% of the total project cost?
   ●●   Was the projected annual operating cash flow at least 1.5 times the amount of the loan?
   ●●   Based on an independent valuation of the project’s income, was the loan amount less than or equal to 75% of the total
        project cost?
   In order to evaluate these criteria, KeyBank required the loan applicants to submit a loan package comprised of a business
   plan including construction plans, budget, company history, the qualifications of top management professionals, and a
   pro-forma financial analysis. The financial projections were expected to reflect existing supply and offtake agreements
   (including minimum tipping fees, minimum and maximum monthly feedstock quantities, feedstock quality requirements)
   and local market factors, along with detailed, well-justified assumptions. An independent engineer was required to
   review and verify all plans, at a cost incurred by the applicant. Construction bonds, construction advances and
   performance bonds were also required of the applicant to ensure that the plant was built according to the construction
   plans and to cover any additional costs to modify the plant post-construction in order to comply with output requirements.
   The financed composting facilities in Nantucket and Marlborough are still in operation today.

   municipality to full operation on the part of the counterparty.

   Short term service models include:
   ●●   Contract: Through a competitive procurement process, a private firm is hired to deliver composting services for a finite
        period of time. The government pays this entity, rather than sharing revenue. An example of this service is a site study
        or a source-separated organics collection program.
   ●●   Concession: The government grants a private firm the opportunity to invest in and provide services for a period of
        time, in exchange for rights to profit.
   ●●   Lease: A private operator pays the municipality for the use of composting assets. Profits, such as through compost sales,
        tax benefits, or carbon credits, can be shared between the government and the private operator. The private operator is
        responsible for maintenance and repair, while the municipality is responsible for upgrades and investments.
   ●●   Management: The government hires a private operator to manage a facility, sell a product and collect revenues, but
        pays the operator a fee. This is a less common model for composting.
   Longer term service contracts include:
   ●●   Design-Build-Operate: Private operator will design, build, and operate a facility and is sometimes responsible for
        maintenance. These include feasibility and market assessments, systems design, construction, and project management.
        Funding can be supplemented, and operations should be financially self-sustaining.
   ●●   Design-Build-Finance-Operate: This form of contracting requires the private operator to take responsibility over
        financing the project from design to operation. Since the private operator is required to source funding, the municipality
        may need to offer risk mitigating measures such as credit guarantees. The municipality can further reduce risk by
        providing a feedstock supply and offtake agreements.
   ●●   Build-Operate-Transfer: A private operator takes either full or partial responsibility over financing the construction,
        operations, and maintenance of a facility, and therefore owns rights to outputs and revenues through which they
        are compensated for their investment. The operation will eventually be returned to public control at which point the
        municipality is responsible for operations and maintenance and long-term financing. These contracts are risky, as control
        over the success of the operation is in the hands of the contractor for an extended period of time. Further the condition
        of the operation at the time of transfer must be carefully monitored and enforced.
   ●●   Build-Own-Operate: In this structure, the private sector is responsible for an operation end-to-end, and there is no
        obligation to transfer to the private sector. Many composting operations are privately owned but may receive external
        funding.

                              Box 9. Example of a Build-Operate-Transfer PPP in Lahore, Pakistan
   In 2003, the Solid Waste Management Department of the City District Government of Lahore (CDGL), Pakistan issued a
   public tender for a private sector company to design, built, operate, and transfer a 1,000 MTPD composting facility at
   the Mehmood Booti Landfill. The Safi Group, a leading industrial corporation in Pakistan was awarded the tender and
   established the Lahore Compost Ltd. to undertake the work. Under the contract, the CDGL provided land at no cost and
   guaranteed the delivery of waste from residential areas and fruit and vegetable markets. The facility became operational in
   2006 with a processing capacity of 300 MTPD and was gradually scaled up to 1,000 MTPD by 2009. The total project
   cost was estimated at $5.52 million with an initial investment of $3.11 million, which was financed through a combination
   of long-term debt from the parent company ($2.87 million) and equity ($2.65 million). Revenues from carbon credit sales as
   part of the United Nations Clean Development Mechanism were expected to cover annual operating costs, while compost
   sales were to cover debt service. The project will be transferred back to the CDGL after a period of 25 years.

                         Box 10. Strategies for Attracting Private Sector Participation in Composting
   Market and demand
   ●●   Lack or limits on subsidies for chemical fertilizers, or equivalent benefits for compost
   ●●   Requirement for fertilizer companies to sell or market compost
   ●●   Strong incentives for farmers to use compost
   ●●   A robust organics market, along with organics labeling / certification, that drives organic compost demand
   ●●   Subsidies for the compost product and promotion by the government
   ●●   Clear value-add of compost to improve competition with chemical fertilizers

   Policies and regulatory environment
   ●●   Presence of supporting policies, such as organic waste diversion, soil requirements, co-marketing requirements
        and source separation programs
   ●●   Controls on organic waste disposal from commercial entities (e.g., restaurants, stores, hotels)
   ●●   Publically accepted standards and guidelines that establishes compost quality standards (grades) and
        appropriate use cases for each quality grade
   ●●   Certification system for the compost product as well as the operator
   ●●   Product testing requirements by either the compost facility or third party
   ●●   Strong enforcement mechanisms of all policies

   Financing and cost recovery
   ●●   Indicators of financial recovery for the private operator, including clear revenue opportunities, and investment
        guarantees
   ●●   Financial support by the government or banks and intuitions to cover initial capital costs and output-based support
        for operational costs
   ●●   Government guarantees on minimum compost offtake amounts, product pricing, or feedstock pricing
   ●●   Multiple product offtake agreements for the final compost product at an acceptable price, preferably from
        creditworthy entities
   ●●   Diverse supply of feedstock associated with a tipping fee or high quality feedstocks (e.g., market waste, agricultural
        waste, manure) that can be obtained at little or no cost. Agreements with municipalities and other entities for long-term
        supply at established prices are ideal
   ●●   Favorable tax incentives, including on value add, import, sales, and favorable utility rates

   Operations
   ●●   In-kind support, such as provision of land for facility building and of quality feedstock
   ●●   Capacity building to increase the technical capabilities that enable success
   ●●   Adequate baseline information on organic waste in the city, which helps operators understand the market
        readiness for compost

   California’s Pollution Control Tax-Exempt Bond Financing Program (CPCFA) provides California businesses with a lower-
   interest alternative to conventional debt financing. The program serves as an intermediary to issue bonds as a creditworthy
   institution and provides this financing to eligible projects. Businesses may use the funds for the acquisition, construction,
   or installation of equipment, land, cost of bond issuance, soft costs (engineers, attorneys and permits), and buildings
   associated with waste disposal and recovery facilities. Prospective borrowers submit an application to the California Debt
   Limit Allocation Committee. If approved, a detailed review of the project’s technical and financial plans and obtainment
   of all necessary certificates ensues. Successful borrowers may then request an “allocation.” Once a project receives an
   allocation, the State Treasurer sells the bonds and disperses payment. Restrictions include the following:

   ●●   95% of proceeds must be used for the defined project
   ●●   2% of bond proceeds can be used for costs of issuance
   ●●   25% of bond proceeds can be used for land costs in certain cases
   ●●   The average life of the bond issue cannot exceed 120% of the weighted average of the estimated useful life of the assets
        being financed
   In November 2013, Zero Waste Energy Development Company LLC, a company formed in 2011 by GreenWaste
   Recovery Inc. and Zanker Road Resource Management, Ltd., commenced operations at the world’s largest dry anaerobic
   digestion facility in San Jose, CA. The company obtained $103 million of bond financing through the CPCFA to finance
   site improvements, additional equipment, and vehicles and to repay bonds that were previously issued. The organics
   management system is currently comprised of 16 dry digestion tunnels and 4 in-vessel composting units, which can process
   90,000 tons per year. The complete project is expected to include three times this capacity. Among seven applicants, Zero
   Waste Energy Development Company LLC was the only CPCFA bond recipient in 2013.

                      Box 12. An Integrated Waste Management Approach in Teresa, Philippines
   Teresa is a municipality in the Philippines located 50 km from Manila in the province of Rizal. It is one of 61 municipalities
   located in the Laguna Lake watershed, which feeds the largest lake in the Philippines and the second largest freshwater lake
   in Southeast Asia. Waste in Teresa has traditionally been managed haphazardly through open dumps and open burning. In
   2000, the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act in the Philippines mandated the closure of dumpsites. In 2006, a major
   2,000 square foot dumpsite in Teresa was closed.

   In 2007, an Integrated Solid Waste Management Facility was built where the dump once lay. The Laguna Lake Development
   Authority (a quasi-governmental entity that promotes sustainable development) had begun a project called Laguna de Bay
   Institutional Strengthening and Community Participation Project (LISCOP). This project was funded by the World Bank and
   the Netherlands Ministry of Development and targeted environmental renewal projects within the Laguna Bay Watershed,
   which had been suffering from the impacts of increased human impact. The materials recovery facility in Teresa was one
   such component of LISCOP.

   The LISCOP project received a $5 million loan from the World Bank and another $5 million through a grant. The facility
   in Teresa was funded through a PHP 8.2 million total (PHP 3.27 million grant, PHP 3.68 million loan, and a 15% equity
   split between the Laguna Lake Development Authority and the Local Government Unit). Further, the World Bank Community
   Development Carbon Fund enhanced financial security is financing the purchase of carbon credits for greenhouse gas emis-
   sions reductions associated with the project’s waste reduction, recycling, and composting through the Clean Development
   Mechanism.

   The Teresa Integrated Solid Waste Management Facility is a multi-waste stream materials recovery facility that processes
   mixed waste from the municipality. The facility has a number of distinct components, beginning with a segregation center
   where waste is sorted and recyclables are gathered. In a plastics recycling area, a hammermill pulverizes waste and a
   densifier consolidates plastic fragments into tiles, traffic barriers, tables, and other products. There is also a hollow brick
   manufacturing area in which sand, gravel, and cement are mixed with shredded plastic and residuals to produce concrete
   blocks for local builders. Organics are sent to the composting area where materials are first shredded and then composted
   through a bioreactor and windrow system and finally treated to final quality using a sifter and grader. The compost prod-
   uct is tested by growing vegetables and other seedlings on site and is sold for PHP 120 (~$3.20) per 50-kg bag—less

   than half the prevailing market price for compost—and farmers are prioritized in the sale of this compost. Other products
   further diversifying revenues include nets produced from coconut husks and charcoal produced from pulverized paper.

   Social behavioral transformation was a key component of this project. Residents were encouraged to conduct home com-
   posting, to source segregation, and maintain general cleanliness. A competition was conducted between barangays (neigh-
   borhoods) and local schools on their performance and results were both posted in the central square and announced at
   Catholic mass services. Cash prizes were given to the winners at the end of the year.

   Much of the success of this project is attributable to an effective partnership strategy with the private sector. Companies
   sponsored fliers directing residents to source separate and recycle their waste and provided bins and tarps for the publicity
   campaign. Farms supplied bamboo for fencing for the facility. A cement firm supplied free bags of cement each week for
   the manufacturing of hollow bricks. Finally, a tile manufacturer provided the salaries for local green advocates for the first
   six months.

   This integrated effort has not only diverted 38% of waste in two years but also increased municipal revenues from recycled
   product sales and has provided new employment opportunities to the local community. The facility continues to educate cit-
   izens and ensure financial sustainability through its newly established Integrated Solid Waste Management Training Center
   that trains other local government units and community groups on managing solid waste in an integrated manner.

                  operations
                  and              ●●   Diversify revenues: Reduce reliance on product sales and tipping fees, which are subject
                  maintenance           to market fluctuations, by implementing additional revenue generation activities such as
                  costs, leading
                                        sales of recyclables and waste collection
                  to a negative
                  margin           ●●   System optimization: Ensure composting process is efficient (e.g., turning frequency of
                                        piles and volume of water added) to reduce utilities and fuel consumption. Technical
                                        assistance and knowledge sharing can inform best practices.

Operator does Contracted           ●●   Conduct due diligence: fully research potential contractors and confirm a track record
not deliver on party does               of success in similar contexts and sufficient operational and financial capacity to take on
objectives     not execute              project. Request operational and financial documents; interview previous clients
               on planned
               or expected         ●●   Pay based on results: Use an output based payment contract to ensure that results are
               objectives               achieved in a timely manner. For example, compensate waste haulers based on the tons of
                                        feedstock delivered to the facility. Adopt penalty provisions when daily waste quotas are
                                        not met and ensure penalties are enforceable. Similarly, vary private operator payments
                                        based on amount of compost produced or sold, such as by assigning rights to product
                                        sales directly the private operator
                                   ●●   Diversify operators: Assign operational responsibility to multiple actors. Using contracts,
                                        delegate discrete responsibilities to different operators (e.g., building the plant, delivering
                                        the feedstock, producing the compost). Using contracts, mandate each contractor to
                                        deliver a complete, ready-to-go product or system and assume financial responsibility until
                                        adequate delivery. This can be a useful way to assign and motivate operators to complete
                                        the set task as quickly and effectively as possible
                                   ●●   Require performance bonds: Require contractors to assume financial risk by issuing
                                        performance bonds to insure against unforeseen roadblocks
                                   ●●   Confirm incentive structure: Ensure that the contractor is properly incentivized to perform
                                        in each required area as per the contract structure
                                   ●●   Write sound contracts: Ensure that contracts properly detail roles and expectations,
                                        ownership of end products,and terms that can be renegotiated versus not.

  Key Messages
  ●●   Be aware that composting is a crosscutting issue that could be affected by policies related to solid waste
       management, agriculture, environmental, land-use, and planning. Therefore, negotiate and work with stake-
       holders accordingly
  ●●   Strategically navigate policies that promote synthetic fertilizers or alternative organic waste management
       technologies that might stunt the development of the composting sector
  ●●   Align regulatory measures and product quality standards with the buyer’s needs
  ●●   Ensure that incentives are aligned for stakeholders such that the end product has market demand
  ●●   Complement policies (i.e., diversion targets) with sufficient infrastructure

   The European Union issued the Landfill Directive in 1999 that requires its member countries to reduce the quantity of biode-
   gradable municipal waste being sent to a landfill based on set targets. Each member country must reduce the biodegradable
   waste landfilled to 35% of 1995 levels by 2016, or 2020 for a selected group of countries. This policy is being driven by
   environmental concerns due to the GHG emissions being produced by food waste decomposing in landfills. Since the Land-
   fill Directive must be followed in order to be a part of the EU, even countries aiming to join the EU are gradually preparing
   to comply with the policy.

                                    Box 14. Seoul, Korea, a Leader in Food Waste Recycling
   In the 1980s, Korea’s waste generation and
   treatment was relatively unremarkable on
   the global front. However, today, the coun-
   try boasts one of the highest municipal solid
   waste recycling rates amongst OECD coun-
   tries: 84.4%. Food waste comprises roughly
   36% of municipal waste, and even though
   waste generation is rising, 100% of food
   waste was recycled in Seoul in 2012—a city
   with 10.5 million residents within 605 km2.

   This remarkable success was propagated by
   a series of legislations restricting the disposal
   of food waste and enabled by the develop-
   ment of advanced treatment technologies. In
   1995, a volume-based fee was established          Seoul, Korea. Photo credit: Pixabay
   on waste, although landfilling remained the
   predominant treatment mechanism. In 2005, food waste was fully banned from landfills and source separation was re-
   quired. Finally, in 2013, a food waste reduction plan was established and powered by a volume-based disposal fee.

   In 2013, ocean dumping of food waste leachate was also prohibited—a formerly intuitive strategy for a country surrounded
   by sea. With a large volume of food waste no longer destined for landfill, and restrictions on disposal tightened, backlogs
   of food waste ensued and a need for new technologies and systems was clear.

   The city turned to a pay-as-you-throw strategy for food waste reduction in which citizens are charged for the amount of waste
   they dispose. A system proliferating in urban areas is the high-tech central community bin. These bins identify individuals
   using RFID chips, weigh individuals’ drop-offs, and automatically charges a fee. Municipalities are also testing home waste
   bins identifiable by chips, household disposers connected to the central sewage system (organic matter serves as feedstock
   for biogas), and central reducer bins that use heat and air to cut waste volume before the organic matter is processed to
   compost or animal feed.

   On the treatment end, large investments are supporting the build-out of new treatment facilities. In Seoul, approximately
   44% of food waste is treated by public facilities and 56% by private. By 2018, Seoul plans to nearly double the treatment
   volume by public facilities by building four new facilities. A budget of KRW 252.5 billion (approximately $220 million) for
   2014-2018 was anticipated for this purpose (as of 2014).

   However, food waste management principles dictate that food should be used for feed or compost before treatment. Com-
   munity composting has been heavily promoted—through partnerships with NGOs, district competitions, and urban farms.

   In Korea, leadership at various levels collaborate to manage waste. The central government sets the 10-year plan and
   research and development goals, prioritizes technologies, and promotes campaigns for waste reduction. The Seoul Met-
   ropolitan Government establishes and implements city policies and supports operations. Districts are each responsible for
   building a waste management plan and collecting fees and penalties.

       Box 15. Enriching Compost Products to Increase Market Attractiveness—Fortifer and FertiSoil Products
                                                   in Ghana
   Compost has experienced a challenged past in Ghana. Given that municipal source separation programs do not exist,
   compost products have been typically manufactured from mixed MSW. A 2006 survey of farmers revealed that 40% of
   respondents did not use MSW compost because of poor product quality, and 35% said that it was too costly (Danso, et al.,
   2006). Crops sold in urban markets, especially exotic vegetables, have a short growth period and require more nitrogen
   than what is available in MSW-derived compost. Additionally, farmers prefer synthetic fertilizers, due to their tenancy
   agreements with landowners and the need for immediate boosts in crop productivity. Further distorting the market, synthetic
   fertilizers were subsidized by the national government in Ghana between 2008 and 2013.

   As a result of these challenges, compost manufacturers in Ghana have pursued enrichment techniques in order to increase
   the nutritional value of their compost products and appeal to agricultural and horticultural end markets. Today, companies
   are co-composting mixed MSW with a variety of animal and agricultural wastes and are pursuing innovative strategies to
   compete with other locally available products.

   The International Water Management Institute (IWMI) in Accra has boosted the nutrient value and attractiveness of its MSW
   compost through:

        (i)	 Co-composting MSW with dewatered fecal sludge;

        (ii)	 Blending compost with synthetic fertilizer or urine to create a ‘fortified’ product; and

        (iii)	 Pelletizing compost to reduce its bulkiness and create a product similar in appearance and handling to a synthetic
               fertilizer (Adamtey, et al. 2009; Nikiema, et al. 2014).

   The branded name of this product is Fortifer. With funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the UK Department
   for International Development, Grand Challenges Canada, and the From Waste to Food program, IWMI is developing a
   national marketing plan for product commercialization. As of October 2015, IWMI was also supporting the construction of
   a new low-cost, open air composting facility to produce 500 MTPY of Fortifer in Tema (Smith, 2015).

   DeCo!, an NGO in Tamale Ghana, also composts mixed MSW with other nitrogen-rich sources of waste such as fruit waste,
   vegetable waste, neem tree leaves, shea butter processing waste, corn cobs, groundnuts and poultry manure to improve
   the quality of its end product, which is called FertiSoil and was launched in 2013. In 2014, DeCo! processed 3,000 MTPY
   of wastes and supplied compost to 3,000–4,000 farmers. A large portion of DeCo!’s compost is sold to partner NGOs,
   such as Advance and Abokobi Society of Switzerland and research institutions, such as the Savanna Agricultural Research
   Institute (SARI), that distribute product free of charge to farmers, while a smaller portion is sold directly to end users. Due
   to extensive field testing, product refinement to align with farmers’ needs and promotional campaigns by SARI and the
   Ghanaian Ministry of Agriculture, demand for FertiSoil is increasing. The group has plans to build two additional facilities
   with projected earnings of $1.8 million.

   To further this plan and build upon the need for high nutritional value waste streams, DeCo!, in partnership with the Com-
   munity Life Improvement Programme (CLIP), a community development organization, piloted the country’s first household
   separation program in Northern Ghana in 2015. Ten households in each of 15 communities were provided with two waste
   bins; one for organic waste and another for non-organic waste. Organics were collected by CLIP every other day to prevent
   odor and vermin issues, totaling four MT per week and were processed at the company’s composting facility. While DeCo!
   engaged in an education campaign with participating households, they discovered that when an entire family was not pres-
   ent for the training, individuals were susceptible to making separation errors and even using the bins to store and transport
   water, instead of for their intended purpose. These results highlighted the need for further education (DeCo!, 2015).

                    Box 16. Multi-pronged Approach to Develop Demand for Urban Compost in India
   The Government of India is forcing the development of the composting sector in cities with four approaches:

        (1)	 The central government requires that all urban governments process biodegradable waste by “composting, ver-
             mi-composting, anaerobic digestion or any other appropriate biological processing for stabilization of wastes”
             (Government of India’s Municipal Solid Waste Rules, 2000). Quality standards are also established in the Rules to
             provide guidance on the proper makeup of compost.

        (2)	 The central government is offering market development assistance to incentivize scaling up the production and
             distribution of compost products. There is a payment of Rs.1500 per tonne of city compost offered for sector devel-
             opment.

        (3)	 Fertilizer companies are required to co-market compost with their fertilizer products through their dealers’ network.
             The market development assistance could be channeled to these companies since they are marketing and distribut-
             ing the products. In anticipation of complications ahead, the Government of India is planning to set up a mechanism
             between the Department of Fertilizers, Ministry of Urban Development, Department of Agriculture and the fertilizer
             marketing companies to solve coordination issues as needed.

        (4)	 The Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare will lead an education campaign with regards to
             urban compost for farmers and the Ministry of Urban Development is planning to increase construction of compost
             facilities across all states.

   Since 1998, several ministries in Thailand have taken the initiative to strengthen solid waste management practices related
   to organic waste management. Composting was being seen both as an alternative disposal method as well as a way to
   develop an export-oriented agro-food industry.

   The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment is driving and initiating many composting projects nationally. This work
   is also complemented by composting-related research efforts being undertaken by domestic universities. Simultaneously, the
   Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives set quality standards in 2005 for compost and fertilizers derived from organic
   materials to ensure high quality products are being generated. Creating even more demand, the Ministry of Industry began
   promoting composting as an alternative disposal technique in 1998.

   Lastly, the Ministry of Energy and the Ministry of Interior signed an agreement in 2007 to encourage mutually beneficial
   solid waste management practices. Their objective is to ensure that organic waste is being used productively through various
   technologies that would allow for compost creation and fuel production in addition to fish feed production.

                    Decentralized Composting in Partnership
                       with the Agriculture Sector in Austria

  Key Success Factors
  ●●   The promotion of home composting, which reduces the overall quantity of organics in the waste management
       stream
  ●●   The use of small-scale, low cost windrow composting technologies as opposed to capital intensive in-vessel
       systems
  ●●   A supportive national and European policy framework that mandates source separated collection, requires
       organic waste diversion from the landfill and ensures high quality compost production through a recognized
       quality assurance scheme
  ●●   High materials processing and compost quality standards imposed by the farmers managing the waste
       because they are using 70 – 90% of the product on their own crops (Amlinger, 2012)
  ●●   Limited need for marketing and product sales

     The municipality of Graz serves a population
     of 356,000 people in the city and surround-
     ing villages. The Graz municipal authority is
     responsible for the collection and pre-treatment
     of approximately 30,000 MTPY of organic
     waste. Source separated waste is pre-treated
     with sorting, screening to remove inert materi-
     als, shredding, and homogenization in a cen-
     tralized facility. The pre-treated raw material is
     then transported from the centralized facility
     to 18 decentralized on-farm composting fa-
     cilities. The contracted farmers, who process
     between 200 and 3,000 MTPY of feedstock,
     operate open windrow composting systems
     and are responsible for covering all on-site
     capital and operating expenses.

     on their agricultural lands or market it. In other instances, the municipality becomes the owner of a portion of the compost
     product for public use and distribution to residents. There are periodic inspections in Graz to ensure compliance with the

   sustain operations due to a lack of demand and poor marketing strategies (Ali 2004; Zurbrugg 2003). Innovative cam-

  ●●   Production of differentiated end-products that match local market demand
  ●●   Diversification of revenues streams across tipping fees, compost sales and recyclables sales (Terra Firma)
  ●●   Well-developed distribution networks
  ●●   Willingness to sell product manufactured on-site in addition to acting as a distributor of products produced

                      Using a National Grant Program to
                Develop Composting Capacity in Sri Lanka

  Key Success Factors
  ●●   Grants from the national government for initial plant construction and ongoing facility upgrades thereby
       eliminating debt service
  ●●   Access to a variety of organic feedstock, including fish, slaughterhouse waste and dried fecal sludge that
       enrich the end product
  ●●   Utilization of product distribution partners to reach markets in Eastern Sri Lanka
  ●●   Revenue diversification through the sale of recyclables in addition to tipping fees from waste received from
       other authorities

  Key Success Factors

  n	 Aggressive and binding biodegradable waste recycling targets set by the European Commission
  n	 National compost standards and legislation including technical requirements (best available technology
     documents) for construction and operation of composting plants
  n	 National quality assurance systems for compost (e.g., Germany, Belgium, Austria, Italy, The Netherlands,
     Hungary)
  n	 Cost prohibitive alternatives due to environmental taxes
  n	 Freedom to develop individual strategies by each Member State to comply with EU legislation, which has
     allowed for different approaches. Most successful countries have adopted mandatory source separation
     programs in combination with landfill taxes or bans

Notes on methodology:
●●   These emissions estimates were calculated using the tool CURB: Climate Action for Urban Sustainability developed by the
     World Bank in partnership with AECOM Consulting, Bloomberg Philanthropies, and the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group
●●   Emissions are primarily calculated using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change methodologies
●●   Emissions are calculated for a proxy city: Rio de Janiero, Brazil using waste composition and generation data collected by the
     World Bank in 2014. Total quantity generated was 3,665,600 tonnes which assumed 0.58 tonnes/capita/year
●●   Any residual waste that cannot be processed using the outlined method was assumed to be disposed in a landfill with no
     methane collection
●●   No energy capture was assumed for the treatment methods, unless otherwise mentioned
●●   Greenhouse gasses considered are methane, carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide
