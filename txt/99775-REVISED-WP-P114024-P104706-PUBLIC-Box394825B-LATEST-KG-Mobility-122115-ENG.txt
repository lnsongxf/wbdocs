                                  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.      In the last decade, sustained economic growth significantly contributed to reduce
poverty across all segments of the population in the Kyrgyz Republic. In about ten years the
share of people below the national poverty line fell indeed from almost 70% to about 37%, with
most of the improvements especially benefiting the population living in rural areas. Rural poverty
rates indeed declined dramatically between the early 2000s (73%) and 2008 (about 40%), also
thanks to the increasing number of migrant workers1 and the corresponding rise in the inflow of
remittances.

2.      Starting from 2009, however, the pace of poverty reduction in the Kyrgyz Republic
began to stagnate. Poverty rates stopped decreasing after 2008 and started to reverse in 2010, in a
context of still sustained but rather unstable economic growth. In particular, most of the
deterioration took place in the urban areas, where the share of poor people rose from about 22 to
about 35% between 2009 and 2012.

3.       Given this trend, one of the present challenges at the national level is to determine
how to revive the poverty reduction process in the current less favorable economic
environment. To this end it is then crucial to make a new effort to better understand the evolution
and main characteristics of poverty dynamics in the Kyrgyz Republic in order to determine: (i) who
is persistently poor as opposed to those moving out of or falling into poverty over time; (ii) what
are the main determinants of the movement (or the absence of movement) observed in and out of
the poverty status.

4.       In this context, this report aims at shedding some light on the reasons lying behind
the stagnation observed in poverty reduction since 2009. It does so by moving beyond the
traditional static poverty analysis to adopt a “truly” dynamic approach to investigate individual
wellbeing and behavior. It indeed focuses on the degree and main characteristics of economic
mobility in the Kyrgyz Republic. Mobility analysis can indeed help to unveil what happened below
the surface of poverty stagnation, thereby enabling to understand whether the reduced pace in
poverty eradication was associated with high or low mobility in and out of the poverty status and
to obtain a profile of the corresponding groups. In this study we are particularly interested in
analyzing the role of labor market outcomes in moving people (or preventing them from moving)
out of poverty.

5.       This report could benefit from the availability of “true’ longitudinal data at the
individual level. Mobility analysis was indeed carried out resorting to a relatively new data set of
micro-data, made available by the Deutsches Institut fuer Wirtschaftsforschung (DIW) in Berlin.
Unlike other available data sources, the DIW data-set consists of actual panel data, collected
through a survey (the “Life in Kyrgyzstan Survey”2), which was able to track the same individuals
over time. In particular, results presented here are based on the first two waves of data, referring to
the years 2010 and 2011. The third wave, relative to the year 2012, was not available at the time
this report was drafted and will be included in the analysis in the forthcoming months.

6.       In particular, this report focuses on the economic mobility of individuals (and
corresponding households) belonging to the bottom 40% of the Kyrgyz population. This is
indeed the target population chosen by the World Bank Group for the achievement of its second
(and twin) goal of shared prosperity (the first one remaining poverty reduction). Moreover, in the
specific case of the Kyrgyz Republic total poverty rates in the period under analysis ranged between
34 and 37%, thus making the poverty and bottom 40% pools almost identical. That is why,
throughout the whole report we will often speak interchangeably of poverty and bottom 40% groups
of the population.

7.      Overall, the evidence suggests the existence of relatively high economic mobility
between the bottom 40% and top 60% of the Kyrgyz population. Churning (i.e. movements of
people in and out the poverty pool) between these two welfare groups was indeed relevant between
2010 and 2011: about 40% of those belonging to the bottom 40% in 2010 managed indeed to enter
the upper deciles in the following years; conversely, about 19% of those who were in the top 60%
in 2010 fell down into the bottom 40% in 2011.

8.       For each selected transition group, the report depicts a detailed profile of
corresponding main socio-economic characteristics. Four transition groups were in particular
identified: (i) those who were found to be stuck in the bottom 40% in both 2010 and 2011; (ii) those
who managed to move up from the bottom 40% in 2011; (iii) those who entered the bottom 40%
in 2011, and (iv) those who managed to stay in the top 60% in both years under analysis. The
evidence shows a few significant differences among these four groups in terms of both households’
invariant and individual characteristics.

9.       Households’ size and dependency ratios appear to be significantly different between
the selected transition groups. The rural/urban divide also appears to be a strong factor of
differentiation. Households persisting in the bottom 40% are characterized on average by a
relatively higher number of both members and dependents compared with those managing to move
up to the top 60% in 2011. Symmetrically, both size and dependency ratios are significantly lower
in households managing to stay in the top 60% in both years compared with those falling into the
bottom 40% in 2011. As far as the geographical location is concerned, rural households appear to
be more likely to persist in the bottom 40% compared with urban ones.

10.      Focusing on individual characteristics, summary statistics suggest a relevant role of
both education and labor market outcomes. When the selected transition groups are broken
down by the individual characteristics of the household head, the evidence shows that heads with
a relatively higher educational attainment are more often found in households either moving out
and up from the bottom 40% in 2011 or staying in the top 60% in both years. Similarly, households
escaping poverty appear to be characterized by a relatively higher employment rate of their
household head; this looks particularly true if the head is employed in the service sector.

11.       To test the robustness of these first summary results, a multivariate regression
analysis was carried out to investigate the correlates of economic mobility for each of the
selected transition groups. A linear probability model was used, regressing the probability of
belonging to each of the four selected transition groups against both households’ invariant and
individual characteristics. Results confirm many of the features highlighted by the simple summary
statistics, but also look different from them in some important respects.

12.    Household size and dependency ratio confirmed as significant drivers of economic
mobility. Regression analysis, carried out with different specification models, confirm that larger
households with a relatively higher number of dependents are more likely to be stuck in the bottom


                                                 ii
40% over time. Conversely, multivariate analysis did not find a clear-cut and significant correlation
between the probability of persisting in poverty/moving out of it and households’ location in rural
vs. urban areas (though some strong correlations seem to characterize some specific regions/oblasts
of the country).

13.     Households’ reliance on remittances seems to play a positive role for economic
mobility. Receiving remittances is indeed found to be associated on average with a relatively higher
probability of leaving the bottom 40%, but it also appear to enhance the chance for top 60%
households to remain in the upper deciles in the following period.

14.      No clear-cut correlation emerges instead for the availability of social benefits. The
evidence shows indeed that receiving social benefits does not appear to influence either persistency
into the bottom 40% or the movement out of it, whereas a significant correlation is found between
social benefits and the probability of remaining in the top 60% in both years.

15.     Educational attainment emerges as key driver of economic mobility. Data analysis
highlights a strong link between the educational attainment of each member of a household and the
corresponding outcome in terms of economic mobility. Households belonging to the bottom
40% in 2010 with a relative higher share of members with a tertiary educational attainment are
indeed found to face a significantly higher chance of leaving poverty in the following year.

16.      Sector and quality of employment appear to be relevant for economic mobility. As far
as labor market outcomes are concerned, being employed (as opposed to being either unemployed
or inactive) does not seem to matter for economic mobility. What appears to be more significant in
terms of correlates of mobility is instead the specific sector and quality of the jobs people are
employed into. Working in agriculture and mining enhances indeed the chance of persisting in the
bottom 40% in both years, whereas being employed in the service sector seems to significantly
increase the probability of staying in the upper deciles and avoid poverty. A similar finding emerges
for jobs of different quality, with households with a relatively higher share of members employed
in low-skilled types of occupations facing a significantly higher probability of being stuck in
poverty over time.

17.     Finally, a section of the report was devoted to address the characteristics of a specific
sub-group of households belonging to the bottom 40%, i.e. those who turned out to be stuck
in the very first deciles of the welfare distribution. We focused in particular on those households
who were found to persist in either the very first or the second deciles of the distribution as well as
those who moved down from the second to the first decile between 2010 and 2011; in this report,
these households were defined as the “chronic poors”.

18.      Chronic poor households more often found in urban areas and depending on (low?)
wage incomes. They are often unemployed or inactive. Compared with the rest of households
belonging to the bottom 40%, chronic poor ones are more likely to reside in urban areas and resort
on a relatively higher share of wage income compared with other income sources (working poors?).
They also claim to rely on a significantly higher proportion of income deriving from alimony,
inheritance, and scholarships. As far as their labor market status is concerned, chronic poor appear
to have a significantly higher probability of being non-employed (i.e. either unemployed or
inactive).

                                      1. BACKGROUND


1.1      In the last decade, the Kyrgyz Republic achieved significant improvements in poverty
         reduction. The Kyrgyz Republic is one of the poorest countries in the ECA region: about
         two-thirds of its population lives in rural areas. Like most of other ECA countries, it
         benefited from a decade of sustained growth, which significantly contributed to reduce
         poverty across all segments of the population. Between 2003 and 2008 the share of people
         below the national poverty line fell indeed from 49.9% to 31.7%, with significant
         reductions both in the urban and rural areas of the country (Chart1).

1.2      However, the pace of poverty eradication began to loose strength in the more recent
         years. Starting from 2009 poverty reduction began indeed to stagnate, and started to
         reverse in 2010: according to the last available data, the national poverty rate amounted to
         about 38% in 2012, in a context of still sustained but rather unstable growth in the total
         economy (Chart 2). In particular, urban areas appear to have been relatively more affected
         by this deterioration compared with the rural ones (though poverty rates are still
         significantly higher in the rural regions; Chart 1).

1.3      This paper tries to throw some light on what could have happened and why. It does
         so by providing a more thorough investigation of poverty dynamics and its determinants in
         the Kyrgyz Republic. It indeed tries to move beyond the traditional static poverty analysis
         to adopt a “truly” dynamic approach to investigate individual wellbeing and behavior.

1.4      This was made possible by the availability of a relatively new data-set of micro-data
         at both the household and individual levels, produced by the Deutsches Institut fuer
         Wirtschaftsforschung (DIW) in Berlin, as part of a wider research project3. Unlike the
         Kyrgyz Integrated Household Survey (KIHS), the DIW survey (called “Life in Kyrgyzstan-
         LiK” survey) is a true panel survey, which tracks individuals over time, thereby allowing
         to move from static to truly dynamic analyses of individual well-being and behavior. The
         availability of longitudinal data is indeed expected to enable us to shed light on the
         transitions in and out of the poverty status, as well as on the persistence into it, also
         providing some insight into its main determinants4.

  The project – “Economic Transformation, Household Behavior and Well-Being in Central Asia: The Case
of Kyrgyzstan”, was funded by the Volkswagen Foundation and carried out in collaboration with Humboldt
University of Berlin, the Center for Social and Economic Research (CASE-Kyrgyzstan), and the American
University of Central Asia. Overall, it aims at (i) collecting nationally representative panel survey data in
Kyrgyzstan; (ii) investigating well-being and behavior of individuals and households in this country; and (iii)
improving research capacity within Central Asia (for more details, see: http://www.diw.de\kyrgyzstan).

1.5     The focus of this report will then be on the economic mobility of households and its
        members. Mobility analysis5 can indeed help to unveil what happened below the surface
        of poverty stagnation. We will indeed investigate how many and what types of households
        tend to: (i) persist in poverty, (ii) move out of poverty, (iii) move into poverty, and (iv) stay
        out of poverty. This will enable us to understand whether observed stagnation in poverty
        reduction has been associated with high or low mobility in and out of the poverty status
        and to obtain a profile of the corresponding groups. At the same time the wide set of
        households’ and individuals’ characteristics collected by the DIW survey will help us to
        identify some of the key determinants of the observed mobility patterns. In this study we
        are particularly interested in analyzing the role of labor market outcomes in moving people
        (or preventing them from moving) out of poverty.

1.6     The rest of the paper is organized as follows. After a short description of the DIW dataset
        and its main features (chapter 2), chapters 3 is devoted to explain in detail our empirical
        strategy, whereas chapter 4 contains our main findings. Finally, the last chapter offers some
        conclusions.

                                         2. THE DATA
2.1     Data are derived from the Life in Kyrgyzstan (LiK) Survey, carried out by the DIW
        between 2010 and 2012, as part of the research project “Economic Transformation,
        Household Behavior and Well-Being in Central Asia: The Case of Kyrgyzstan”6. The
        LiK survey is a multi-purpose, socio-economic survey covering many different topics of
        interest in the analysis of well-being and behavior of individuals and households. Data
        cover information on demographics, assets, expenditure, migration, employment,
        agricultural markets, shocks, social networks, and subjective wellbeing7.

2.2     It is an individual panel survey. All adult members (i.e. aged 18 and older) of the sampled
        household are interviewed and followed over time. This means that: “if a member of an
        original household leaves the household (e.g. to form an own family), she is still part of
        the sample. If relevant, other members (e.g. spouse and children) of the new household are
        then included in the sample as well”8.

2.3     The LiK survey is representative at the national, rural/urban, as well as south/north
        levels of the country. It collects data in all seven Kyrgyz oblasts and the cities of Bishkek
        and Osh.

2.4     Three waves of this survey have been carried out so far, covering respectively the
        years 2010, 2011 and 2012. At present only the first two waves of data have been made
        available. In the original 2010 sample, households were drawn through stratified two-stage
        random sampling9. In 2010 the survey was carried out on 3,000 households and 8,160
        individuals. In the following year interviewed households amounted to 2,863 (for a total of
        8,066 individuals), 95.2% of which had already been interviewed in 2010. Table A1 in the
        appendix provides an example of the main sample characteristics with respect to the 2010
        wave of data.

2.5     The survey consists of three main questionnaires: (i) a household questionnaire, to be
        filled in by the most informed household member; (ii) an individual questionnaire, to
        be filled in by all adults aged 18 and over; (iii) a community questionnaire, to be filled
        in by a representative of the local administration. For our research purposes, the
        following variables of interest were selected:

        (a) From the household questionnaire we extracted most of the available information on
            each HH’s composition and related demographic characteristics (e.g. number of
            components, gender, age, ethnicity, as well as geographical location).

   See footnote 3, page 1.

    Each adult individual was administered a household, an individual and a community questionnaire.
Information about children was included in the household questionnaire.

   A detailed description of the LiK survey can be found in Brück et al. (2012), “Household Survey Data for
Research on Well-being and behavior in Central Asia”, IZA DP No. 7055, November.
        (b) From the household questionnaire we also took the information about each household’s
            consumption and expenditure, as well as data on main income sources.

        (c) We then turned to the individual questionnaire to gather information about each adult’s
            educational attainment and all available data referring to her/his labor market status. In
            particular, it was possible to distinguish between employed and non-employed and
            among the employed it was possible to know each adult’s sectorial affiliation, her/his
            wage status (e.g. employer, own-account worker, employee, etc.), her/his occupational
            status (e.g. managers, professionals, clerks, production workers, etc.). It was more
            difficult to distinguish the pool of non-employed between unemployed and inactive
            but some rough estimation is possible.

        (d) We have not used any information contained in the community questionnaire so far10.




10
   We are however planning to use the community questionnaire in the forthcoming second phase of this
research project, especially focusing on information on access to services and infrastructure.

3. ECONOMIC MOBILITY: THE EMPIRICAL STRATEGY
                                  A.    BUILDING THE PANEL DATA-SET

3.1      The first step of our empirical strategy consisted in linking the available waves of data
         by exploiting the panel structure of the survey. This was done so far only on the first
         two waves, i.e. those covering the years 2010 and 2011, since the 2012 data have not yet
         been made available11.

3.2      By merging the 2010 and 2011 waves, we ended up with 8,658 individuals, whose
         characteristics were tracked in both years. However for some of them (22 in 2010 and
         23 in 2011) no information was provided on food and nonfood consumption expenditure
         by the household (HH) head. Thus we decided to eliminate these individuals/households
         from the sample. We also observed that some individuals younger than 18 were still part
         of the sample, despite the claim that only people aged 18 and older had been tracked
         overtime: we thus chose to eliminate everybody younger than 16 years old. As a result, our
         mobility analysis will be based on a panel sample made of 8,541 individuals, corresponding
         to 2,841 households.

                             B.    IDENTIFICATION OF THE POVERTY POOL

3.3      In this study the focus will be on the economic mobility of the bottom 40% of the
         Kyrgyz population. This is indeed the target population chosen by the World Bank in
         order to achieve its second (and twin) goal, which is to boost shared prosperity, i.e. to act
         so that the income of this segment of the population grows faster than the rest of it.
         Moreover, in the specific case of the Kyrgyz Republic total poverty rates in the period
         under analysis ranged between 34 and 37%, thus making the poverty and bottom 40% pools
         almost identical. That is why, throughout the whole report we will often speak
         interchangeably of poverty and bottom 40% groups of the population12.

3.4      Given this choice, the second step of our empirical strategy then consisted in
         identifying who belongs to the bottom 40% of the population. From the previous
         chapter we already know that the DIW survey only tracks individuals aged 18 and over;
         thus, if we computed a transition matrix among these individuals between 2010 and 2011,
         we would be focusing on the bottom 40% of these individuals (which we can observe) and
         not on the entire population.

3.5      To cope with this issue (intrinsic to the nature of the data we have) we chose to adopt
         the following two-step empirical strategy:




11
   At the moment of drafting this report, their release is about to take place, so that new data will be included
in the analysis in the following months.
12
   In addition, this choice helps to overcome eventual differences arising in the magnitude of the poverty
pool, due to underlining differences in the way poverty lines have been computed according to different data
sources
        (a) Infer the actual distribution of the entire surveyed (panel) population (observed and
            non-observed individuals, i.e. 2,841 households including 13,175 individuals in 2010
            and 13,595 in 2011), by imputing households’ information on per-capita consumption
            to each household’s member (we indeed know each household’s size). This allowed us
            to identify the 40% cut-off point and determine who lay in the bottom 40%. As a result:
            5,267 individuals turned out to belong to the bottom 40% in 2010 and 5,435 in 2011.

        (b) Once we knew the cut-off point at the individual level, we could then project these
            people back to the households they belonged to, and identify how many households lie
            below the 40% line. In our case, results indicated that about one third of all households
            (31.7% in 2010; 31.9% in 2011) belonged to the bottom 40% in each of the selected
            years. We could then compute a transition matrix at the household level between 2010
            and 201113.

3.6     With this strategy in mind, we can then turn to mobility analysis and its main results.




13
 Although mobility is captured by the DIW survey at the individual level (on people aged 18 and over), the
welfare measure, i.e. per-capita consumption, is indeed measured at the household level.

         4. ECONOMIC MOBILITY: MAIN FINDINGS
4.1   This section presents the report’s main findings. The first part displays some basic
      descriptive statistics providing: (i) a profile of households belonging to the bottom 40%
      vis-à-vis those beyond this threshold; (ii) a profile of households in each of the transition
      groups highlighted after computing our mobility matrix (see below). The second part will
      then focus on the analysis of correlates of economic mobility.

4.2   Throughout both sections we chose to start focusing first on households’ invariant
      characteristics (e.g. HH size, HH dependency ratio, HH location, as well as the
      composition of its income sources), together with some individual ones but only
      related to the HH head (e.g. age, gender, ethnicity, education, labor market status),
      and only then move to investigate the role of each member’s individual
      characteristics. We indeed want to look separately at how each household’s poverty status
      and the corresponding mobility trend does change as a function of each household’s
      common characteristics as compared with how it changes as a function of each member’s
      individual characteristics.

                     A.    SOME PRELIMINARY DESCRIPTIVE RESULTS

4.3   Households’ mobility across different deciles of the welfare distribution between 2010
      and 2011 is displayed in Table 4.1. As already explained in the previous section,
      household mobility is here deduced from the sample of adult members who have been
      tracked in both years, but the bottom 40% threshold was derived from the entire surveyed
      population using information on each household size.

4.4   Each cell percentage represents the share of households transitioning between
      different deciles of the consumption distribution between 2010 and 2011, due to the
      movements observed in their individual adult members. For example, 31% of
      households belonging to the first decile of the distribution in 2010 were still there in the
      following year, while 20.2% of them moved up to the second decile; on the other hand,
      households’ persistency in the richest decile of the population (in terms of consumption)
      amounted to 46.4%, while 21.9% of them moved down to the 9th decile.

4.5   If we now focus on the economic mobility of those belonging to the bottom 40% of the
      population (our target group in term of poverty reduction) vis-à-vis those beyond this
      threshold, our sample can be broken down into four different transition groups of
      households (Table 4.1):

      (a) Those belonging to the bottom 40% in 2010 and still there in 2011 (poverty
          persistence; red shade);
      (b) Those belonging to the bottom 40% in 2010 but moving beyond this threshold in
          2011 (exit from poverty; green shade);
      (c) Those being beyond the 40% threshold in 2010 but moving down the threshold in
          2011 (entry into poverty status; brown shade); and
      (d) Those staying beyond the 40% in both years (out of poverty persistence; yellow
          shade).

4.6     Overall, the evidence suggests the existence of a relatively high economic mobility
        between the bottom 40% and top 60% of the Kyrgyz population. Numbers displayed
        in Table 1 show in particular that about 60% of households (corresponding to 537
        households) who were in the bottom 40% in 2010 persisted in the same condition in the
        following year, whereas the remaining 40% (365 households) managed to move upwards
        and climb over the 40% threshold. On the other hand, about 19% (370) of households who
        were in the top 60% in 2010 moved down to the bottom 40% in 2011, while the remaining
        81% remained in the upper deciles. This is shown in a more summarized version in Figure
        4.1 below.

        B.                     A PROFILE OF HOUSEHOLDS BELOW/ABOVE THE BOTTOM 40% THRESHOLD

4.7      But who are these households? We tried to better characterize households below and
         above the 40% threshold. In particular, by exploiting the wide set of characteristics
         collected by the DIW survey we tried to draw a profile of those belonging to the bottom
         40% vs. those who being beyond this threshold. Furthermore we went on by investigating
         in more detail the characteristics of households in each of the transition group highlighted
         above, i.e. (i) stayed in bottom 40%; (ii) moving upwards from bottom 40%; (iii) entering
         bottom 40% from above; (iv) staying above bottom 40%.

4.8      As already explained before, we chose to start by focusing only on households’
         invariant characteristics, plus some individual characteristics related to the
         household’s head. We indeed want to start investigating how each household’s poverty
         status and the corresponding mobility trend does change as a function of each household’s
         common characteristics.

4.9      A first profile of households belonging to the bottom 40% (vis-à-vis the top 60%) is
         displayed in Figure 4.2 (here data refer to 2010; the following table 4.2 displays
         instead both 2010 and 2011, which however tell about the same story). As expected,
         relatively poorer households tend to be of larger size, display on average higher
         dependency ratios, and appear to be significantly more concentrated in rural areas.
         Significant differences also emerge, when data are broken down by geographical region
         (oblast). If we then focus on the different sources of households’ income, the most
         significant difference emerges when comparing income from household enterprises and
         income from wage employment, with the bottom 40% households receiving a relatively
         higher share of their income from the former and the top 60% ones relatively more resorting
         to wage employment.

4.10   Figure 4.3 describes instead the main differences between bottom 40% and top 60%
       households in terms of some individual characteristics referred to their HH head. In
       particular, Figure 4.3 focuses on differences in education, labor market status, specific
       sectors of employment, as well as the wage status (further characteristics are shown
       separately in Table 4.3).

4.11   Educational attainment strongly differentiates between the two groups of households.
       Households in the bottom 40% display a higher share of HH heads with a relatively lower
       educational attainment: about 75% of them completed in 2010 at most a secondary general
       level of education (compared with about 50% of top 60% households); the share of poor
       HH heads with a tertiary degree was 9% in 2010, compared with 22.9% of non-poor HH
       ones.

4.12   Employment rates also look significantly different. HH heads in the bottom 40% appear
       to have a relatively lower employment rate compared with the top 60% ones (56.5% vs.

          59.2%). Detailed data in Table 4.3 show in particular that, while the proportion of non-
          employed people who have retired looks the same in the two groups of households, poorer
          households have a higher share of non-employed people who are either unemployed or
          inactive (different from retired).

4.14      Figures 4.4 and 4.5 focus instead on the transitions observed between 2010 and 2011.
          They indeed provide a profile of households in each of the following transition statuses: (i)
          stayed in bottom 40%, (ii) moved down to bottom 40%, (iii) moved out from bottom 40%,
          and (iv) stayed in top 60%.

4.15      HH size and dependency ratios significantly different. As before, the first chart analyzes
          the role played by households’ invariant characteristics and shows that, as expected, larger
          households with higher dependency ratios are found to be associated with a relatively
          higher chance of being stacked in the bottom 40% in both years under analysis. The share
          of households persisting in the poverty status tends also to be relatively higher in rural areas
          compared with those living in the urban ones.

4.16      Interesting results also emerge with respect to the different sources of income
          accruing to each household. Results indicate indeed that households either persisting or
          moving down into the poverty status tend to have a relatively higher share of income
          deriving from HH enterprises; on the contrary, households either moving out or staying out
          of poverty in 2011 tend to resort relatively more to income from wage employment. No
          clear-cut results do instead emerge with respect to the other sources of income.

4.17      Figure 4.5 looks instead at the association between our four transition groups and
          some selected individual characteristics referred to each household’s head. Both
          education and labor market outcomes emerge as potentially determinant factors in
          helping households skipping poverty. As far as education is concerned, the evidence
          shows indeed that when households’ heads have completed tertiary education they have a
          relatively higher probability of moving out or persisting out of poverty. Households


                                                                                                                  15
            persisting in poverty are instead associated to a very large extent with heads having at most
            a secondary general diploma.

4.18        Potentially interesting results emerge as far as labor market outcomes are concerned.
            First of all, both those moving out of the bottom 40% and those staying out of it in 2011
            display a relatively higher employment rate; at the same time the percentage of non-
            employed people (which includes both the unemployed and the inactive) turns out to be
            relatively higher in those households, which either persist or fall into poverty. Thus, at first
            sight, we could start thinking that having a job can help avoiding poverty. Let’s however
            try to be more specific and start by looking at what happens if we break our data down by
            different economic sectors. In this case our findings suggest that only working in some
            sectors does actually help escaping poverty. In particular, more than 60% of those staying
            out of the bottom 40% in 2011 claim to work in the service sector14, while the same share
            associated with households persisting in the bottom 40% is less than 30%. The majority of
            people staying in poverty in both years work indeed in agriculture; they are also relatively
            more present in mining and construction. Non clear-cut results do seem to emerge for
            manufacturing with its employment rate relatively higher for both those staying out of
            poverty and falling into it.

  Macroeconomic data show that structural shifts have occurred in the Kyrgyz Republic over time. Historical
poverty reduction has indeed been associated with relevant employment declines in agriculture and
corresponding increases in the service sector. This shift was associated with a strong movement of workers
from rural to urban areas, but also with a rise of informal jobs.


                                                                                                                                                     16
4.19   Other interesting results emerge if we look at households’ heads with different types
       of employment. The type of employment seems indeed to be associated with different
       transitions in terms of poverty. The vast majority of households persisting into poverty or
       falling into it in 2011 is indeed associated with a head working as an own-account worker,
       while most households exiting or staying out of poverty have a head working as an
       employee.

4.20   If the type of employment appears to be significantly linked with the poverty status,
       another relevant differentiating factor seems to be represented by the type of specific
       occupation. Occupations are collected by the DIW survey according to the international
       classification of occupations (ISCO), which distinguished jobs by the intrinsic required
       skill level of the involved worker. Taking this characteristic into account, we re-grouped
       employment data by occupation into three main categories: (i) high-skilled occupations;
       (ii) medium-skilled occupations; and (iii) low-skilled occupations. If being an employee is
       positively associated with leaving or persisting out of poverty, data by skill level show
       additionally that only jobs with either a medium or high skill level do enhance the chance
       of avoiding poverty. More than 60% of households persisting in poverty in 2011 have
       indeed a household’s head working in an unskilled job position. However the proportion
       of unskilled workers among household’s head is about 60% also for those moving out of
       poverty in 2011: this could mean either that being skilled is not the driving force to escape
       poverty or that it is not enough to look at the characteristics of the HH head, since the labor
       market characteristics of the other members of the household could exert a relevant impact
       on the overall result. That is why we need to go deeper into our investigation and turn to
       multivariate regression analysis.

         5. DRIVERS OF ECONOMIC MOBILITY: FIRST
             INSIGHTS FROM THE DIW PANEL DATA

5.1      In this section we try to go deeper into the analysis in the attempt to identify some of
the drivers of the transitions observed above. To this end a multivariate regression analysis has
been carried out in order to estimate the correlates of economic mobility in the 2010-11 period. In
particular, we used a linear probability model, where the dependent variable was alternatively one
of the following four transition groups: (i) stayed in bottom 40% in 2011; (ii) moved out of bottom
40% in 2011; (iii) moved into bottom 40% in 2011; and (iv) stayed out of bottom 40%. Following
the line of reasoning adopted in the previous section, here again we started by regressing our
dependent variables only against HH invariant as well as HH head’s individual characteristics.
These results are shown in the section A. We then turn to analyze the role eventually played by
each HH’s member’s individual characteristics.

    A.    CORRELATES OF ECONOMIC MOBILITY: THE ROLE OF HH INVARIANT AND HH
                              HEAD’S CHARACTERISTICS

5.2     The first set of regressions investigated the correlates of economic mobility for each
of the selected transition groups only focusing on HH invariant and HH head’s
characteristics. The explanatory variables included in this part of the analysis are: HH size, HH
dependency ratio, HH location (urban vs. rural), as well as HH income sources; gender, age,
education, ethnicity, labor market status, as well as type and sector of employment, all referred to
each HH’s head.

5.3      The analysis was carried out for the biennium 2010-11, based on HHs’ initial
characteristics. Detailed findings from different model specifications are displayed in Tables A2-
A5 in the Appendix, while the following Figures 5.1-5.3 summarize some of the main outcomes;
as above, for every transition group we will distinguish between the role of HH invariant
characteristics (panel (a) of each graph) and the one played by individual characteristics of the HH
head (panel (b) of each graph). In each graph, blue histograms represent the coefficients associated
with each displayed characteristic, while the black bars indicate the corresponding confidence
intervals.

5.4     HH demographics highly significant for economic mobility. Unsurprisingly (and
consistently with what we already observed in the previous unconditional evidence), HH size and
HH dependency ratios turn out to be significantly correlated with economic mobility:

         (a) For households in the bottom 40% in 2010, the larger the size, the higher the probability
             of persisting in the poverty status in the following year (Figure 5.1, panel (a)). The
             same turns out to be true for HHs’ dependency ratios (but with an even stronger
             coefficient). Symmetrically, smaller households with a lower share of dependent
             members are associated on average with a higher chance of getting out of the poverty
             40% (Figure 5.2, panel (a)).
           (b)         Similar (and opposite) results apply for households beyond the bottom 40% in
                       2010: larger households with higher dependency ratios do face on average a higher
                       chance of moving down into the poverty pool.

households who in 2010 were beyond the poverty threshold. More specifically, our evidence shows
that non-poor households in 2010 who live in rural regions do indeed face a 10% higher risk of
becoming poor in 2011.

5.6      Different results emerge instead if HH location is not broken down by rural/urban
areas but rather by different regions/oblasts. In this case, indeed, HH transitions appear to be
significantly correlated with some specific regions/oblasts:




                                                      20
        (a) Poor HHs in 2010 living in the Talas oblast do indeed appear to have a 26% higher
            chance of remaining poor in the following year. The opposite is true for poor HHs
            living the Chui oblast, who display a 21% higher chance of moving out of poverty in
            2011.

        (b) For non-poor HHs, instead, the probability of skipping poverty in the following year
            turns out to be significantly higher if they live in the Naryn, Batken, Chui and Bishkek
            oblasts.

5.7     Households’ reliance on remittances seems to play a positive role. Households’
availability of remittances coming from members working abroad appear to significantly contribute
to avoid poverty:

        (a) For households in the bottom 40% in 2010, receiving remittances enhances their
            chance of leaving poverty in the following year by about 10 percentage points (Figure
            5.2).

        (b) Receiving remittances do also appear to contribute positively and significantly to avoid
            poverty for households who were already beyond the poverty threshold in 2010, though
            to a lesser degree (about 5 percentage points) compared with households who were
            poor in 2010 (Figure 5.3).

5.8     No clear-cut correlation emerges instead with the availability of social benefits (see
Box 5.1 for a brief overview on the system of social benefits in the Kyrgyz Republic ). Receiving
social benefits as part of their income does not have an unambiguous correlation with HH mobility:

        (a) No correlation emerges between mobility/persistency of households who were poor
            in 2010 with respect to the availability of social transfers (neither pensions nor other
            types of social benefits).

        (b) On the contrary, the availability of social benefits (excluding pensions) seems to have
            enhanced the chance of non-poor households of staying out of poverty by slightly
            less than 10 percentage points.

5.9     HH head’s educational attainment as significant driver of economic mobility for all
transition groups. The educational attainment of the HH head turns out to be significantly
correlated with mobility for both those who were and those who were not initially poor:

        (a) For a household in the bottom 40% in 2010, having a head with a tertiary education
            reduces on average the probability of staying poor in the following year by about
            15% points (compared with a HH whose head has less than a secondary level of
            education).

        (b) For a household beyond the poverty threshold in 2010, having a head with a tertiary
            education reduces the probability of becoming poor in 2011 by about 8 percentage
            points.



5.10   Gender (and age) of the HH head does not seem to show a significant correlation with
household mobility, while some correlation appears with her/his age. Being employed,



                                                 21
    instead, appears to be significantly linked to mobility outcomes, but only for households who
    were non-poor in 2010. The evidence displayed in Figures 5.1-5.3 shows indeed that:

             (a) For households who belonged to the bottom 40% in 2010, being employed (as opposed
                 of being either unemployed or inactive) does not appear to influence the probability to
                 exit poverty nor that of persisting into it.

             (b) For HHs beyond the 40% threshold, instead, having an employed head appears to
                 reduce the probability to enter into poverty by about 7 percentage points.




Box 5.1: Social Benefits in the Kyrgyz Republic

The Kyrgyz Republic is characterized by a rather complex system of social benefits. The benefit
system consists indeed of several pillars, the most relevant being the following ones: (i) the monthly
social benefits (MSB); (ii) the monthly benefits for poor families with children (MBPF); (iii) the
categorical benefits; and (iv) the energy benefits.

MBPF is the only poverty focused, means-tested benefit, covering about one third of households from
the first quintile, indicating less than perfect targeting efficiency.

About half of the country population lives in a household receiving any type of social protection
transfer. Old age and disability pensions are by far the most important programs, covering 43 percent
of total population. All other social transfers, with the exception of energy compensations, are
relatively small and reach between one and seven percent of the population. Private transfer, including
remittances from migrants abroad, also play a major role given that one fifth of the population regularly
receives money from relatives.

In 2012, the Kyrgyz Republic spent about 5.7 percent of GDP on social protection programs; however,
concerns remain with respect to the effectiveness of the programs. While Government social
expenditures are growing, the performance of the system in terms of coverage of the poor, targeting
accuracy, as well as poverty impact did not significantly improve.

The increase in spending has favored programs largely benefitting individuals and households who are
financially better off (Gassmann, 2013). This might be also reflected in panel data, where there is low
correlation between social benefits and mobility.

5.11    Other labor market characteristics. Panel (b) of Graphs 8-10 also focuses on some
selected labor market characteristics of the HH head in the attempt to investigate whether labor
market outcomes do indeed represent potential determinants of the mobility observed between 2010
and 2011. In particular, results show that working in specific sectors of the economy as well as
having a specific type of occupation can play a significant role. Indeed:

        (a) Poor households with a head working in the mining sector face a significantly higher
            probability of persisting in the poverty status in the following year.




                                                                                   23
         (b) On the contrary, working in the service sector (both private and public) seems to
             enhance significantly the chance of skipping poverty for those who were already non-
             poor in 2010.

         (c) Some correlation finally emerges also between mobility and the type of occupation
             held by the HH head, though coefficients are generally rather small in magnitude. Data
             show in particular that the lower the skill level15 associated with the type of occupation
             the higher the probability for a household either to persist in poverty (Graph 8) or to
             fall into the poverty status in 2011 (Figure 5.3).

          INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS OF ALL MEMBERS INSIDE EACH
                               HOUSEHOLD

5.12     We finally wanted to look at the correlates of economic mobility taking into account
the relative contribution – in terms of their respective individual characteristics – of all adult
HH members, in order to better understand the role played by education and labor market
outcomes. To this end a linear probability model has been estimated by collapsing all relevant
individual characteristics at the household level, so that the contribution of each member emerges
as a relative share. Thus, for every household we will have, for example, the share of members with
a tertiary educational attainment, or the proportion of members who are employed, etc. Detailed
results of the different model specifications are shown in Table A6-A7 in the Appendix, while main
findings are shown in Figures 5.4 and 5.5 below and can be summarized as follows.

5.13     Education is a key ingredient of economic mobility. Once the relative contribution of
each HH members’ characteristics is explicitly taken into account, the evidence confirms and
further reinforces the link between the educational attainment of each HH members and the
outcome in term of economic mobility:

         (a) HHs in the poverty pool with a relative higher share of members with a tertiary
             educational attainment face a significantly higher chance (between 19 and 24
             percentage points depending on the model specification; see Table A6) of leaving
             poverty in the following year.

         (b) Non-poor households with a tertiary educational attainment face a significantly lower
             probability (about 10-11 percentage points lower) of entering poverty in 2011.

5.14   Older people less likely to persist in poverty or entering into it. If HH mobility is broken
down by the relative importance of the age groups of its members, it generally emerges a relatively
more positive position of the oldest cohorts of the population. Indeed:

  Employment data by different types of occupation are usually collected referring to the ISCO international
classification of occupations, which classify jobs into 10 main groups of occupations, in decreasing order of
the amount of skills deemed necessary to carry out the corresponding task. Thus the occupation variable
ranges from 1 to 10, with 1 representing occupations with the highest skilled workers and 9 being the
unskilled ones (the 10th group actually includes armed forces and was treated differently).


                                                     24
      (a) Poor households with a relatively higher proportion of people older than 64 face a 40%
          higher chance to leave poverty in the following year.

      (b) Non-poor households have a 10% higher chance to remain non-poor the highest the
           incidence of member older than 64. At the same time, the higher the share of young
           members (25-34 years of age), the higher the probability for non-poor households to
           become poor in 2011.

5.15    HH members’ labor market characteristics relevant but no clear-cut message seems
to emerge so far. Once the labor market outcomes of each member of the HH are taken into
consideration, our evidence generally confirms what we already found in the previous section,
though some differences seem to emerge:



                                                                                            26
(a) Individual labor market characteristics do indeed confirm the existence of a significant
    correlation between HH economic mobility and the specific sector of employment of
    its members. Poor households with a higher share of members working in the
    agricultural and mining sectors are found to face a relatively higher chance of
    persisting in the poverty status, whereas households who are already non-poor and
    whose members are prevalently employed in the private service sector have a relatively
    higher probability of skipping poverty in the following year.

(b) Being employed as opposed to be either unemployed or inactive does not seem to
    influence HH mobility in any of the four transition groups. The only partial exception
    is represented by non-poor households with a relatively higher presence of retired
    members, who face on average a relatively lower risk of falling into poverty in the
    following year.

(c) Likewise, the specific wage status of the HH members, i.e. whether self-employed or
    employees, does not show a particularly significant correlation with HH mobility.

(d) Having a low-skilled type of occupation turns instead to be significantly correlated
    with a relatively higher chance for poor households to persist into poverty. The same
    cannot be said symmetrically for non-poor households: for them no correlation seems
    to emerge between mobility and type of occupation carried out by HH members.

6. FOCUS ON PERSISTENCY INSIDE THE BOTTOM 40%:
   CHRONIC POVERTY?
6.1      The idea of this section is to focus on the mobility/persistency observed inside the
poverty pool. In Table 4.1 we could indeed observe a relatively high mobility between the first
and fourth deciles of the distribution, but also a relatively significant share of poor families stuck
in the very first deciles of it. That is why we decided to devote a section of this study to the analysis
of this specific segment of the population, with the aim to draw a first picture16 of who tends to be
stuck in the lowest end of the welfare spectrum. We will focus in particular on those households
who are found to persist in either the very first or the second deciles of the distribution as well as
those who moved down from the second to the first decile between 2010 and 2011; we will call
them here the “chronic poors”.

6.2       According to the DIW sample, this group of extremely poor households amounts to
131 families, which represents about one fourth of the entire poverty pool (537 households
belonging to the bottom 40%). Detailed data show in particular that (Figure 6.1), slightly less
than a half of them turn out to be stuck in the very first decile of the welfare spectrum, about 23%
stayed in both years in second decile, while the remaining 29 per cent fell down from the second to
the first decile of the distribution.

16This section is only intended as an introductory overview to the analysis of this specific segment of the poverty
pool in order to evaluate whether it could be relevant to investigate it further.
6.3     Figure 6.2 provides some descriptives of the profile of the chronic poors, compared
with the other households belonging to the poverty pool. Following the line of reasoning adopted
in previous sections, data in panel (a) only refer to the role eventually played by HH invariant
characteristics, while panel (b) focuses on the individual characteristics of the HH head.

6.4      HH size and dependency ratio. Our evidence further reinforces our previous findings that
relatively larger families with a relatively higher incidence of children and older people do
generally face a much higher probability of staying or becoming poor over time; this result also
applied for the poorest segment of the population, who turn out to be characterized by larger

families and a higher number of dependents compared with the rest of households in the poverty
pool (Figure 6.2).

6.5       Geographical location and main sources of income. Chronic poors are found to be
located more often in urban areas (with respect to the other poors) and turn out to resort on average
on a relatively higher share of wage income compared with other income sources (working poors?).
It is also interesting to note that, compared with rest of households belonging to the bottom 40%,
chronic poor households also claim to rely on a significantly higher proportion of income deriving
from alimony, inheritance, and scholarships. If we indeed have a look at the individual
characteristics of the HH head (panel (b)), we notice that compared with the rest of the poverty
pool, chronic poors are more often non-employed (i.e. unemployed or inactive), whereas the
employed ones are more often found to work in the mining and construction sectors (as well as in
the public services).

6.6      Wage status and type of occupation. If we look at their specific wage status, we also find
that they tend to work relatively more often as own-account workers and employees but the
difference does not seem very significant. What could be interesting to better investigate is the fact
that, according to our evidence chronic poors appear on average to be relatively better educated
than the other poors; this is also confirmed by the distribution by type of occupation, with the
chronic poors working relatively more in high-skilled positions compared with the rest of the
poverty pool.

6.7     Multivariate analysis. In order to better understand and qualify this type of findings, we
also carried out a preliminary regression analysis focusing on the correlation between the
probability of belonging to the pool of chronic poors and the usual set of HH invariant and HH
head’s characteristics we already introduced in the previous sections.

6.8      Results are shown in Table A8 in the Appendix, for three different model
specifications, while main results are displayed in Figure 6.3. Though this only represents a
preliminary and tentative analysis of the correlates of persistency into the pool of chronic poors,
some interesting results seem indeed to emerge, which could deserve some future investigation.
First of all, the probability of being stuck in the lower end of the welfare distribution looks strongly
linked to the demographic structure of the poor households, with the most disadvantaged ones being
especially characterized by a significantly higher number of dependent members (whereas the
household size turns out to be only marginally larger). No significant difference seems to emerge
with respect to the urban/rural divide, though chronic poors are relatively more likely to be found
in the region of Talas.

6.9      Further results. Econometric evidence also confirms that chronic poors tend to rely
relatively more on income sources such as alimonies, scholarships and inheritances. Their
incidence among the non-employed is higher compared with the other poor, whereas the employed
ones are more frequently found to work in mining and construction. As already observed in the
descriptive section, no correlation seems to emerge between being chronic poor and the specific
educational attainment of the HH head.

  7. PRELIMINARY CONCLUSIONS AND STEPS AHEAD

7.1     This report aims at characterizing economic mobility in the Kyrgyz Republic, in the
attempt of better understanding recent poverty dynamics and its determinants. It did so by
resorting to a relatively new data-set of micro-data, made available by the Deutsches Institut fuer
Wirtschaftsforschung (DIW) and consisting of “true” longitudinal data at the individual level,
thereby allowing to carry out dynamic analyses of individual well-being and behavior.

7.2      Overall, data analysis was constrained by the availability so far of only two
subsequent waves of micro-data, covering the years 2010 and 2011. As a consequence, only
preliminary and partial conclusions are possible so far, and will be improved as soon as new data
are made available. Nonetheless available data allow characterizing in some detail the different
profile of households with different mobility patterns.

7.3     Throughout the paper, our focus has been on the economic mobility of households
belonging to the bottom 40% of the population, which we assumed here to be our target group
in terms of poverty reduction. As a consequence, four main transition groups were explicitly
addressed in our analysis: (i) households persisting in the bottom 40% (and hence in poverty) in
both 2010 and 2011; (ii) households moving out of bottom 40% in 2011 (and hence leaving
poverty); (iii) households who entered the bottom 40% (and hence the poverty status) in 2011; and
(iv) households staying above the bottom 40% (and hence skipping poverty) in both years.

7.4     With these transitions groups in mind, we drew a profile of each of them in terms of
both households’ invariant characteristics (e.g. household size, dependency ratio,
geographical location, etc.) and individual characteristics referred to each household’s head.
We then turned to multivariate regression analysis to investigate in some more detail the correlates
of economic mobility for each transition group in the attempt to highlight some of its key
determinants. In particular, we were highly interested in studying the role eventually played by
individual’s labor market outcomes.

7.5     Overall our evidence suggests that household invariant characteristics such as
household size and dependency ratio are strongly associated with mobility in and out poverty,
with larger households characterized by a relatively higher number of dependents facing a
significantly higher chance of persisting in poverty or entering into it. The rural or urban
location of a household, instead, does not seem to influence economic mobility in any direction
(though some strong correlation seems to characterize some specific regions/oblasts of the country).
The different origin of each household’s income shows some interesting correlation with economic
mobility, though some clear-cut conclusions seem to emerge only for some selected income
sources: receiving remittances, for example, is found to be associated on average with a relatively
higher probability of leaving the poverty pool, but it also enhances the chance for non-poor
households to stay non-poor in the following period; on the other hand, the availability of social
benefits does not appear to influence either persistency into poverty or the movement out of it,
whereas a significant correlation is found between social benefits and the probability of avoiding
poverty in both years.

7.6   Turning to individual characteristics, education emerges as the key driver of
economic mobility in the (short) period under analysis. Having a tertiary educational attainment
(both referred to the household head and to the sum of adult members in each household) seems
indeed to significantly enhance the probability of moving out of poverty, as well as that of persisting
out of poverty in both years.

7.7      Some interesting results finally emerge when looking at individual’s labor market
characteristics, though they do seem to generally play a key role in determining economic
mobility between 2010 and 2011. In particular, our evidence does not suggest that being employed
by itself does significantly enhance the chance of leaving the poverty pool. However, working in
specific sectors as well as having a specific type of occupation appears to exert a significant role.
Working for example in the mining and agricultural sector, enhances the probability of persisting
in poverty, whereas being employed in the private service sector reduces the risk of becoming poor
in the following year.
